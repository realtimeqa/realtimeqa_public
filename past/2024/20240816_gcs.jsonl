This time it will be a shooting star show.\n\nThe Lyrid meteor shower will peak in 2024 starting late Sunday night on April 21 and last through dawn on Monday April 22.\n\nThe Lyrids, one of the oldest known Metroid showers, began April 15 and runs through April 29 but the weekend will be the best time to get a glimpse of the show which NASA said can be seen by people across the world.\n\nThe first recorded sighting of a Lyrid meteor show, dates back to 687 BC by the Chinese, astronomers say.\n\nHere's all you need to know about the phenomenon including what time to watch it and the best place to see it.\n\nLyrid meteor shower 2024:Visual guide to the celestial show\n\nWhat are meteoroids? What are meteors? What is a meteorite?\n\nMeteoroids are small rocks that are still in space. When they enter the Earth's atmosphere, they burn up, and create a tail of debris as they disintegrate before hitting the ground. During that point, they are are called meteors.\n\nThose that survive a trip through the atmosphere and hit the Earth's ground are called a meteorite. Some of the small pieces of an asteroid have been traced as far away ask the moon and Mars.\n\nLyrids are known for their fast meteors, according to NASA, and can produce the occasional bright flash called a fireball.\n\nWhere is the best place to see the Lyrid meteor shower?\n\nAccording to NASA, the best view in the Northern Hemisphere of the shower after moonset and before dawn.\n\nHere are tips from the space agency:\n\nPick an area well away from city lights or street lights.\n\nBring a sleeping bag, blanket, or lawn chair.\n\nLie flat on your back with your feet facing east and look up.\n\nBe patient.

About one meteor strikes per hour during the shower season, yet during the peak, one to two strikes happen per minute.\n\nIn recent years, the Perseid shower has not been fully visible due to the moon’s illumination. However, this year the moon will be a waning crescent, casting just a sliver of light and leading to better visibility, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac.\n\nThe one hiccup might be the weather, with showers and clouds in the forecast.\n\nIf you’re interested in watching this beautiful display this year, read for details and tips below.\n\nWhat is a meteor/meteor shower?\n\nA meteor is the scientific name for a shooting star, and they are caused by trains of dust entering the Earth’s atmosphere from space. When Earth crosses a comet’s orbit and its debris enters the atmosphere, a meteor shower occurs.\n\nMeteor showers are visible because the pieces of comet debris heat as they enter Earth’s atmosphere, causing them to burn as a bright light.\n\nWhat is a Perseid meteor?\n\nPerseid meteors are about the size of a grain of sand. They reach temperatures of 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit and travel at speeds over 133,000 mph, becoming visible at about 60 miles from the ground.\n\nMore:Want to admire the cosmos? Here's a beginner's guide to stargazing in Rhode Island\n\nHistory of the Perseid shower\n\nThe Perseids result from the Swift-Tuttle comet, currently the largest known object to repeatedly pass Earth, with a 16-mile-wide nucleus.\n\nThe comet passes through the inner solar system every 133 years, leaving behind debris that Earth passes through each August. Its last pass by Earth was in 1992, and its next will be in 2126.\n\nThe first record of a Perseid shower comes from 36 AD. Although the Swift-Tuttle comet was discovered in 1862, it was not linked to the shower for four more years.\n\nTips for the best viewing experience\n\nThe Perseid meteor shower is the most visible in the Northern Hemisphere, and viewing access extends down to the mid-southern latitudes. All you need to view the shower is darkness – no telescope required – but visibility is best during pre-dawn hours on peak days. To improve your viewing experience, see the tips below.\n\nFind the darkest possible location, away from city or street lights. In Rhode Island, the areas with the least light pollution are the less developed areas in the western half of the state and by the shoreline. For the darkest skies in the state, Block Island's beaches will give you the best light conditions to watch the meteor shower.\n\nAllow 20-30 minutes to allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness. Once adjusted, avoid looking at lights, including cellphones, which will ruin your night vision. If light is necessary, try a red flashlight.\n\nFace away from the moon, and gaze at the darkest part of the sky.\n\nLook for the Perseus constellation, the point of origin for the meteors. The constellation – which is said to resemble the Greek hero Perseus holding the head of the Gorgon Medusa in one hand and a diamond sword above his head in the other – is located near the more easily found Cassiopeia constellation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/04/15/lyrid-meteor-shower-2024-peak/73325033007/", "title": "Lyrid meteor shower 2024: How to see it and when it peaks", "text": "A week after that stunning total solar eclipse, the Lyrid meteor shower is about to give sky-gazers plenty of reasons to once again look toward the cosmos.\n\nOne of the oldest-known meteor showers on record, the Lyrids has peaked like clockwork every late April for thousands of years. And while that peak won't be occurring until Saturday, you still have a chance to see the soaring meteors beginning Monday.\n\nThe best part? While the April 8 eclipse was only viewable in North America, the Lyrids should be visible pretty much around the world.\n\nHere's what to know about the Lyrid meteor shower.\n\nOut of this world:From Stanley cups to Samsung phones, this duo's company launches almost anything into space\n\nWhere do the Lyrid meteors come from?\n\nMeteor showers occur when Earth passes through debris trails left by comets and other space objects. The debris – space rocks known as meteoroids – collides with Earth's atmosphere at high speed and disintegrates, creating fiery and colorful streaks in the sky, according to NASA.\n\nThose resulting fireballs, better known as \"shooting stars,\" are meteors. Those meteoroids that survive their trip to Earth without burning up in the atmosphere are called meteorites, NASA says.\n\nNamed for the nearby constellation Lyra, the Lyrid meteor shower is composed of pieces of debris from the Comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher. The comet is named for A. E. Thatcher, who discovered it in 1861.\n\nThe meteor shower itself, though, has been observed for 2,700 years ever since the first recorded sighting was made in 687 BC by the Chinese, according to NASA.\n\nHow can we see the Lyrid meteor shower?\n\nThe Lyrids are known as one of four major meteor showers each year that have a sharp peak. This year, that peak falls between April 21-22, according to EarthSky.org.\n\nHowever, the meteor shower could be visible anytime beginning Monday.\n\nAccording to NASA, the best view in the Northern Hemisphere of the shower is after moonset and before dawn.\n\nHere are tips from the U.S. space agency:\n\nPick an area well away from city lights or street lights.\n\nBring a sleeping bag, blanket, or lawn chair.\n\nLie flat on your back with your feet facing east and look up.\n\nBe patient.

However, they can produce the occasional bright flash called a fireball.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/01/05/astronomical-events-2024-eclipse-meteor-shower-full-moon-rochester-ny/72009492007/", "title": "Astronomical events in 2024: Every eclipse, meteor shower, full moon", "text": "A rare astronomical phenomenon this spring will bring a unique opportunity for skywatchers and stargazers, as the Rochester region is among the best places for viewing the Great North American Solar Eclipse on April 8, 2024.\n\nWhile the total solar eclipse may be the banner celestial event in the Flower City this year, its not the only one. Also worth noting in 2024 are two lunar eclipses, a dozen meteor showers and a year's worth of full moons.\n\nThis 2024 celestial calendar offers a comprehensive overview of key astronomical events throughout the year. It includes the dates and names of every full moon, meteor shower and eclipse this year.\n\nFull moons brighten the night sky and offer monthly reminders of lunar phases. Meteor showers, including stunners like the Perseids and Geminids, promise moments of awe and inspiration as shooting stars streak across the skies. Solar and lunar eclipses offer remarkable opportunities to witness celestial alignments.\n\nWe hope this roundup of 2024 astronomical events helps you connect with the cosmos and marvel at the wonders of our universe.\n\nTotal solar eclipse in Rochester NY\n\nOn April 8, Rochester will be in the path of totality − a narrow slice of geography with an optimal view of the moon perfectly in line with the Sun. The path of totality will stretch from the southwestern United States through the central and northeastern parts of the country, across New York state, and up into eastern Canada.\n\nA total solar eclipse occurs when Earth, the moon and the sun are in syzygy − alignment − during which the moon moves between the sun and Earth and blocks the solar light from reaching Earth.\n\nStarting at 2:07 p.m. on April 8 in Rochester, the moon will begin to appear to move in front of the sun. Totality begins at 3:20 p.m. and will last for 3 minutes and 38 seconds (plus or minus a few seconds depending where you are standing.) By 4:33 p.m. the moon will have moved past the sun returning the light to normal.\n\nDuring totality, it should get very dark and it is the only time you would be able to see the sun's corona, as well as colorful lights in the chromosphere and solar prominences with your eyes because the moon will be blocking out the most extreme source of light. You should feel a temperature drop and animals may begin to act like it is nighttime.\n\nIn New York, Niagara Falls, Buffalo and Rochester will all be in the path of totality, as will Watertown and Plattsburgh. Locally, Brockport is directly on the center line of totality, as is the Horseshoe Falls in Niagara Falls.\n\nThe shadow will be traveling at an average of about 2,300 miles per hour across New York state and will only take about 10 minutes, from one side of state to the other, said Dan Schneiderman, RMSC's eclipse partnership coordinator.\n\nIt's been 98 years since Rochester was in the path of totality for a solar eclipse (in 1925) and it will be more than two decades (in 2045) before another total solar eclipse will be seen in the U.S., though not in New York. The next time the Rochester region will be within the path of totality is 2144.\n\nOther solar and lunar eclipses in 2024\n\nWhile the total solar eclipse will likely be the highlight of the year for many, it's not the lone eclipse this year. Two lunar eclipses are also set to take place. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon, causing the Earth's shadow to be cast on the moon's surface. Lunar eclipses happen when the moon, Earth and sun are closely aligned, typically during a full moon.\n\nMarch 25: Penumbral lunar eclipse: This eclipse will be subtle, visible from the Americas, western Europe and western Africa.\n\nThis eclipse will be subtle, visible from the Americas, western Europe and western Africa.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nIf you spot a shooting star in the night sky later this week, it might be from the Lyrid meteor shower, which will reach its peak overnight around 12 a.m. ET on April 22, according to EarthSky.\n\nNamed after the Lyra constellation, the Lyrid meteor shower will end the “meteor drought,” the period between January and mid-April when no meteor showers light up the sky.\n\nFor those looking to get a glimpse at the Lyrids, they will be best viewed in the Northern Hemisphere, along the northeastern sky in the mid-northern latitudes, according to the American Meteor Society. This area encompasses North America.\n\nGazers should find an area away from city light pollution and lie back to get as much of the night sky in view. Wait 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the darkness to make meteors easier to spot, NASA recommends.\n\nThe Lyrids have been observed for 2,700 years, according to NASA. This shower tends to have bright and fast meteors and has reached a peak of as many as 100 meteors seen per hour.\n\nHowever the moon this year will be in a waning gibbous phase, meaning more than half of it will be shining luminously, so you’ll only see the brightest meteors during the early morning of April 22, according to the American Meteor Society.\n\nWant a better view? Try between late in the evening of April 22 and dawn of April 23 to get another look at the meteor shower under clearer conditions. Lyrids are commonly known to have unpredictable surges, so be prepared for unexpected outbursts, according to EarthSky.\n\nWatchers should also keep an eye out for fireballs or glowing dust trails that meteors leave behind.\n\nThis shower will remain active until April 29.\n\nAfter the Lyrids, there are 10 meteor showers that peak in 2022. Here’s a list of the remaining showers to watch for this year:\n\nEta Aquariids: May 4 to 5\n\nSouthern delta Aquariids: July 29 to 30\n\nAlpha Capricornids: July 30 to 31\n\nPerseids: August 11 to 12\n\nOrionids: October 20 to 21\n\nSouthern Taurids: November 4 to 5\n\nNorthern Taurids: November 11 to 12\n\nLeonids: November 17 to 18\n\nGeminids: December 13 to 14\n\nUrsids: December 21 to 22\n\nLunar and solar eclipses\n\nFollowing the Lyrids, the celestial show will continue on April 30, when a partial solar eclipse occurs. The event can be seen by those in southern South America, the southeastern Pacific Ocean and the Antarctic peninsula, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. Another partial solar eclipse on October 25 will be visible to those in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, northeastern Africa, the Middle East, western Asia, India and western China.\n\nNeither of the partial solar eclipses will be visible from North America.\n\nPartial solar eclipses occur when the moon passes in front of the sun but only blocks some of its light. Be sure to wear proper eclipse glasses to safely view solar eclipses, as the sun’s light can be damaging to the eye.\n\nThere will also be two total lunar eclipses in 2022.\n\nA total lunar eclipse will be visible to those in Europe, Africa, South America and North America (except for those in northwestern regions) between 9:31 p.m. ET on May 15 and 2:52 a.m. ET on May 16.\n\nAnother total lunar eclipse will also be on display for those in Asia, Australia, the Pacific, South America and North America on November 8 between 3:01 a.m. ET and 8:58 a.m. ET – but the moon will be setting for those in eastern regions of North America.\n\nA lunar eclipse can occur only during a full moon when the sun, Earth and moon align, and the moon passes into Earth’s shadow. Earth casts two shadows on the moon during the eclipse. The penumbra is the partial outer shadow, and the umbra is the full, dark shadow.\n\nWhen the full moon moves into Earth’s shadow, it darkens, but it won’t disappear. Sunlight passing through Earth’s atmosphere lights the moon in a dramatic fashion, turning it red – which is why this event is often referred to as a “blood moon.”\n\nDepending on the weather conditions in your area, the moon may appear rusty, brick-colored or blood red.\n\nThis color variability happens because blue light undergoes stronger atmospheric scattering, so red light will be the most dominant color highlighted as sunlight passes through our atmosphere and casts it onto the moon.\n\nFull moons\n\nThere are eight full moons still to come in 2022, with two of them qualifying as supermoons. Here is a list of the remaining moons this year, according to the Farmers’ Almanac:\n\nMay 16: Flower moon\n\nJune 14: Strawberry moon\n\nJuly 13: Buck moon\n\nAugust 11: Sturgeon moon\n\nSeptember 10: Harvest moon\n\nOctober 9: Hunter’s moon\n\nNovember 8: Beaver moon", "authors": ["Angie Orellana Hernandez Ashley Strickland", "Angie Orellana Hernandez", "Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/world/celestial-events-2023-scn/index.html", "title": "Watch the night sky for these celestial events in 2023 | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

The comet, spotted by astronomers using the Zwicky Transient Facility at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego County, California, is named C/2022 E3 (ZTF) and will make its closest pass of Earth on February 2.\n\nThe comet should be visible through binoculars in the morning sky for sky watchers in the Northern Hemisphere during most of January and those in the Southern Hemisphere in early February, according to NASA.\n\nINTERACTIVE: The best space photos of 2022\n\nOn any given day, there is always a good chance that the International Space Station is flying overhead. And if you ever want to know what planets are visible in the morning or evening sky, check The Old Farmer’s Almanac’s calculator.\n\nHere are the rest of 2023’s top sky events, so you can have your binoculars and telescope ready.\n\nFull moons and supermoons\n\nMost years, there are 12 full moons — one for each month. But in 2023, there will be 13 full moons, with two occurring in August.\n\nThe second full moon in one month is known as a blue moon, like the phrase “once in a blue moon,” according to NASA. Typically, full moons occur every 29 days, while most months in our calendar last 30 or 31 days, so the months and moon phases don’t always align. This results in a blue moon about every 2.5 years.\n\nThe two full moons in August can also be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky. Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is brighter and closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger in the night sky.\n\nSome astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee — its closest approach to Earth in orbit. By that definition, the full moon for July will also be considered a supermoon event, according to EarthSky.\n\nHere is the list of full moons for 2023, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac:\n\nJanuary 6: Wolf moon\n\nFebruary 5: Snow moon\n\nMarch 7: Worm moon\n\nApril 6: Pink moon\n\nMay 5: Flower moon\n\nJune 3: Strawberry moon\n\nJuly 3: Buck moon\n\nAugust 1: Sturgeon moon\n\nAugust 30: Blue moon\n\nSeptember 29: Harvest moon\n\nOctober 28: Hunter’s moon\n\nNovember 27: Beaver moon\n\nDecember 26: Cold moon\n\nWhile these are the popularized names associated with the monthly full moon, each one carries its own significance across Native American tribes (with many also referred to by differing names).\n\nLunar and solar eclipses\n\nThere will be two solar eclipses and two lunar eclipses in 2023.\n\nA total solar eclipse will occur on April 20, visible to those in Australia, Southeast Asia and Antarctica. This kind of event occurs when the moon moves between the sun and Earth, blocking out the sun.\n\nAnd for some skywatchers in Indonesia, parts of Australia and Papua New Guinea, it will actually be a hybrid solar eclipse. The curvature of Earth’s surface can cause some eclipses to shift between total and annular as the moon’s shadow moves across the globe, according to NASA.\n\nLike a total solar eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and the Earth during an annular eclipse — but it occurs when the moon is at or near its farthest point from Earth, according to NASA. This causes the moon to appear smaller than the sun, so it doesn’t completely block out our star and creates a glowing ring around the moon.\n\nA Western Hemisphere-sweeping annular solar eclipse will occur on October 14 and be visible across North, Central and South America.\n\nBe sure to wear proper eclipse glasses to safely view solar eclipses, as the sun’s light can be damaging to the eye.\n\nMeanwhile, a lunar eclipse can occur only during a full moon when the sun, Earth and moon align and the moon passes into Earth’s shadow. When this occurs, Earth casts two shadows on the moon during the eclipse. The partial outer shadow is called the penumbra; the full, dark shadow is the umbra.\n\nWhen the full moon moves into Earth’s shadow, it darkens, but it won’t disappear. Instead, sunlight passing through Earth’s atmosphere lights the moon in a dramatic fashion, turning it red — which is why the event is often referred to as a “blood moon.”\n\nDepending on the weather conditions in your area, it may be a rusty or brick-colored red. This happens because blue light undergoes stronger atmospheric scattering, so red light will be the most dominant color highlighted as sunlight passes through our atmosphere and casts it on the moon.\n\nA total lunar eclipse appeared in the skies of Canta, east of Lima on May 15, 2022. Ernesto Benavides/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA penumbral lunar eclipse will occur on May 5 for those in Africa, Asia and Australia. This less dramatic version of a lunar eclipse happens when the moon moves through the penumbra, or the faint, outer part of Earth’s shadow.\n\nA partial lunar eclipse on October 28 will be visible to those in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, parts of North America and much of South America. Partial eclipses occur when the sun, Earth and moon don’t completely align, so only part of the moon passes into shadow.\n\nMeteor showers\n\nThe new year kicks off with the Quadrantid meteor shower, which is expected to peak in the overnight hours between January 3 and 4 for those in North America, according to the American Meteor Society.\n\nIt’s the first of 12 meteor showers throughout the year, although the next one, the Lyrid meteor shower, doesn’t peak until April.\n\nHere are peak dates of other showers to watch in 2023:\n\nLyrids: April 22-23\n\nEta Aquariids: May 5-6\n\nSouthern delta Aquariids: July 30-31\n\nAlpha Capricornids: July 30-31\n\nPerseids: August 12-13\n\nOrionids: October 20-21\n\nSouthern Taurids: November 4-5\n\nNorthern Taurids: November 11-12\n\nLeonids: November 17-18\n\nGeminids: December 13-14\n\nUrsids: December 21-22\n\nIf you live in an urban area, you may want to drive to a place that isn’t littered with city lights.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nOver these last few days of July, two meteor showers will light up the night sky.\n\nThe first, the Delta Aquariids meteor shower, is predicted to peak around 6 a.m. ET (10 a.m. UTC) Friday, according to EarthSky. Its radiant – the point from which meteor paths appear to come from – rises in midevening, is highest around 2 a.m. local time and is low in the sky by dawn.\n\nPictured is a past Delta Aquariids meteor shower occurring around 2 a.m. over Mount St. Helens in Washington State. Diana Robinson Photography/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nAs Earth orbits the sun, it encounters the lopsided orbit of a comet, the icy surface of which leaves behind dust and rocks as they boil off from the sun’s heat. When these space rocks fall toward our atmosphere, “the resistance – or drag – of the air on the rock makes it extremely hot,” according to NASA. “What we see is a ‘shooting star.’ That bright streak is not actually rock, but rather the glowing hot air as the hot rock zips through the atmosphere.\n\n“When Earth encounters many meteors at once, we call it a meteor shower.”\n\nSuspected to originate from Comet 96P Machholz, the Southern Delta Aquariids meteor shower occurs any time between July 12 and August 23 annually. It can be seen best by people in the Southern Hemisphere and southern latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, according to NASA. However, a moon-free dark sky is crucial, EarthSky emphasized. Fittingly, the moon will only be 1% full during the peak.\n\nThe meteors, which tend to number 10 to 20 per hour and fly at 25 miles (41 kilometers) per second, are most visible between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. in all time zones when the faint constellation Aquarius the Water Bearer – the shower’s radiant point – is highest in the sky, according to EarthSky. About 5% to 10% of Delta Aquariid meteors leave persistent trains, which are glowing, ionized gas trails that remain for a second or two after the meteor passes.\n\nIf you go outside for about 30 minutes before the shower, your eyes can adjust to the darkness, according to NASA. For those in the Southern Hemisphere, the radiant is closer to overhead; people in the Northern Hemisphere should look to the southern part of the sky. You don’t need to use a telescope. For optimal viewing, find an area away from artificial lighting and lie flat on your back, observing as much of the sky as possible, NASA suggested.\n\nHow to watch the Alpha Capricornids meteor shower\n\nFollowing the Delta Aquariids peak will be the peak of the Alpha Capricornids meteor shower, which happens Saturday and Sunday while the moon is only 5% full, according to the American Meteor Society.\n\nThis shower isn’t very strong and rarely emits more than five meteors per hour, according to the society. However, Alpha Capricornids tends to produce bright fireballs during its peak and can be seen equally well by people on either side of the equator.\n\nOther space events this year\n\nThere are more meteor showers you can catch during the remainder of 2022, according to EarthSky’s 2022 meteor shower guide:\n\nAugust 13: Perseids\n\nOctober 9: Draconids\n\nOctober 21: Orionids\n\nNovember 5: South Taurids\n\nNovember 12: North Taurids\n\nNovember 18: Leonids\n\nDecember 14: Geminids\n\nDecember 22: Ursids\n\nYou will also be able to see five more full moons in 2022, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac:\n\nAugust 11: Sturgeon moon\n\nSeptember 10: Harvest moon\n\nOctober 9: Hunter’s moon\n\nNovember 8: Beaver moon\n\nDecember 7: Cold moon\n\nAnd there will be one more total lunar eclipse and a partial solar eclipse in 2022, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. The partial solar eclipse on October 25 will be visible to people in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, northeastern Africa, the Middle East, western Asia, India and western China.\n\nThe total lunar eclipse on November 8 can be seen in Asia, Australia, the Pacific, South America and North America between 3:01 a.m. ET and 8:58 a.m. ET. But for people in eastern North America, the moon will be setting during that time.\n\nWear proper eclipse glasses to safely view solar eclipses, as the sun’s light can damage the eye.", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/08/08/perseid-meteor-shower-peak-weekend-how-to-watch/70460253007/", "title": "How to see the Perseid meteor shower when it peaks this weekend", "text": "One of the most dazzling meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere will become more visible in the night sky this weekend.\n\nThe Perseid meteor shower, which peaks in the middle of August, is considered one of the best meteor showers of the year, according to NASA.\n\nPerseid meteors are remains of a comet named Swift-Tuttle that only orbits the sun once every 133 years, according to NASA.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nIn the search for life beyond Earth, NASA’s Curiosity rover has been on a nearly decade-long mission to determine if Mars was ever habitable for living organisms.\n\nA new analysis of sediment samples collected by the rover revealed the presence of carbon – and the possible existence of ancient life on the red planet is just one potential explanation for why it may be there.\n\nThis is a selfie taken by NASA's Curiosity Mars rover at the \"Rock Hall\" drill site. NASA/Caltech-JPL/MSSS\n\nCarbon is the foundation for all of life on Earth, and the carbon cycle is the natural process of recycling carbon atoms. On our home planet, carbon atoms go through a cycle as they travel from the atmosphere to the ground and back to the atmosphere. Most of our carbon is in rocks and sediment and the rest is in the global ocean, atmosphere and organisms, according to NOAA, or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThat’s why carbon atoms – with their cycle of recycling – are tracers of biological activity on Earth. So they could be used to help researchers determine if life existed on ancient Mars.\n\nWhen these atoms are measured inside another substance, like Martian sediment, they can shed light on a planet’s carbon cycle, no matter when it occurred.\n\nLearning more about the origin of this newly detected Martian carbon could also reveal the process of carbon cycling on Mars.\n\nA study detailing these findings published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nSecrets in the sediment\n\nCuriosity landed in Gale Crater on Mars in August 2012. The 96-mile (154.5-kilometer) crater, named for Australian astronomer Walter F. Gale, was probably formed by a meteor impact between 3.5 billion and 3.8 billion years ago. The large cavity likely once held a lake, and now it includes a mountain called Mount Sharp. The crater also includes layers of exposed ancient rock.\n\nThe image shows a drill hole made by Curiosity on Mars' Vera Rubin Ridge. NASA/Caltech-JPL/MSSS\n\nFor a closer look, the rover drilled to collect samples of sediment across the crater between August 2012 and July 2021. Curiosity then heated these 24 powder samples to around 1,562 degrees Fahrenheit (850 degrees Celsius) in order to separate elements. This caused the samples to release methane, which was then analyzed by another instrument in the rover’s arsenal to show the presence of stable carbon isotopes, or carbon atoms.\n\nSome of the samples were depleted in carbon while others were enriched. Carbon has two stable isotopes, measured as either carbon 12 or carbon 13.\n\n“The samples extremely depleted in carbon 13 are a little like samples from Australia taken from sediment that was 2.7 billion years old,” said Christopher H. House, lead study author and professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University, in a statement.\n\n“Those samples were caused by biological activity when methane was consumed by ancient microbial mats, but we can’t necessarily say that on Mars because it’s a planet that may have formed out of different materials and processes than Earth.”\n\nIn lakes on Earth, microbes like to grow in big colonies that essentially form mats just under the surface of the water.\n\n3 possible carbon origins\n\nThe varied measurements of these carbon atoms could suggest three very different things about ancient Mars. The origin of the carbon is likely due to cosmic dust, ultraviolet degradation of carbon dioxide, or the ultraviolet degradation of biologically produced methane.\n\n“All three of these scenarios are unconventional, unlike processes common on Earth,” according to the researchers.\n\nThe first scenario involves our entire solar system passing through a galactic dust cloud, something that occurs every 100 million years, according to House. The particle-heavy cloud could trigger cooling events on rocky planets.\n\nThis image captured by Curiosity shows an area drilled and sampled by the rover. NASA/Caltech-JPL/MSSS\n\n“It doesn’t deposit a lot of dust,” House said. “It is hard to see any of these deposition events in the Earth record.”\n\nBut it’s possible that during an event like this, the cosmic dust cloud would have lowered temperatures on ancient Mars, which may have had liquid water. This could have caused glaciers to form on Mars, leaving a layer of dust on top of the ice. When the ice melted, the layer of sediment including carbon would have remained. While it’s entirely possible, there is little evidence for glaciers in Gale Crater and the study authors said it would require further research.\n\nThe second scenario involves the conversion of carbon dioxide on Mars into organic compounds, such as formaldehyde, due to ultraviolet radiation. That hypothesis also requires additional research.\n\nThe third way this carbon was produced has possible biological roots.\n\nIf this kind of depleted carbon measurement was made on Earth, it would show that microbes were consuming biologically produced methane. While Curiosity has previously detected methane on Mars, researchers can only guess if there were once large plumes of methane being released from beneath the surface of Mars. If this was the case and there were microbes on the Martian surface, they would have consumed this methane.\n\nIt’s also possible that the methane interacted with ultraviolet light, leaving a trace of carbon on the Martian surface.\n\nMore drilling on the horizon\n\nThe Curiosity rover will be returning to the site where it collected the majority of the samples in about a month, which will allow for another chance to analyze sediment from this intriguing location.\n\n“This research accomplished a long-standing goal for Mars exploration,” House said. “To measure different carbon isotopes – one of the most important geology tools – from sediment on another habitable world, and it does so by looking at nine years of exploration.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/world/mars-nasa-meteoroid-impacts-scn/index.html", "title": "Space rock slams into Mars and reveals buried ice | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nChristmas came a little early for NASA’s InSight mission last December when the lander detected a massive quake on Mars.\n\nNow, scientists know what caused the red planet to rumble. A meteoroid slammed into Mars 2,174 miles (3,500 kilometers) away from the lander and created a fresh impact crater on the Martian surface.\n\nThe ground literally moved beneath InSight on December 24, 2021, when the lander recorded a magnitude 4 marsquake. Before and after photos captured from above by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling Mars since 2006, spotted a new crater this past February.\n\nBefore and after photos taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show where a meteoroid slammed into Mars on December 24, 2021. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nWhen scientists connected the dots from both missions, they realized it was one of the largest meteoroid strikes on Mars since NASA began studying the red planet. Images from the orbiter’s two cameras showed the blast zone of the crater, which allowed scientists to compare it with the epicenter of the quake detected by InSight.\n\nThe journal Science published two new studies describing the impact and its effects on Thursday.\n\nThe space rock also revealed boulder-size ice chunks when it slammed into Mars. They were found buried closer to the warm Martian equator than any ice that has ever been detected on the planet.\n\nBoulder-size ice chunks can be seen scattered around and outside the new crater's rim. NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona\n\n“The image of the impact was unlike any I had seen before, with the massive crater, the exposed ice, and the dramatic blast zone preserved in the Martian dust,” said Liliya Posiolova, orbital science operations lead for the orbiter at Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego, in a statement.\n\n“I couldn’t help but imagine what it must have been like to witness the impact, the atmospheric blast, and debris ejected miles downrange.”\n\nStudying the ice revealed by the impact will help scientists better understand previous climate conditions on Mars, as well as how and when the ice was deposited and buried.\n\nResearchers estimated the meteoroid, the name for a space rock before it hits the ground, was about 16 to 39 feet (5 to 12 meters). While this would have been small enough to burn up in Earth’s atmosphere, the same can’t be said for Mars, which has a thin atmosphere only 1% as dense as Earth’s.\n\nWhen the meteoroid crashed into Mars, it created a crater in the planet’s Amazonis Planitia region spanning 492 feet (150 meters) across and 70 feet (21 meters) deep. Some of the material blasted out of the crater landed as far as 23 miles (37 kilometers) away. Teams at NASA also captured sound from the impact, so you can listen to what it sounds like when a space rock hits Mars.\n\nNASA’s InSight Records the Sound of a Martian Impact\n\nThe images captured by the orbiter, along with seismic data recorded by InSight, make the impact one of the largest craters in our solar system ever observed as it was created. Mars is littered with massive craters, but they’re much older than any mission to explore the red planet.\n\n“It’s unprecedented to find a fresh impact of this size,” said Ingrid Daubar, InSight impact science lead at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, in a statement. “It’s an exciting moment in geologic history, and we got to witness it.”\n\nIf a quake like this one had occurred on Earth, it would be “big enough to be felt, but not big enough to cause a ton of damage,” Daubar said. About a thousand quakes of this size occur on Earth each year, but Mars is less active than our planet, so it was “a pretty big one” for the red planet, she said.\n\nThe quake that resulted from the impact also created surface waves, or a seismic wave that moved along the top of the Martian crust. InSight’s data from the event will help scientists study the planet’s crust and learn more about its structure.\n\nStudying craters and their formation rate can help scientists pin down Mars’ geologic timeline. Impact craters also excavate material and bring it to the surface, like the ice revealed by the December 24 strike.\n\nIce beneath the Martian surface could be used for drinking water, rocket propellant and even growing crops and plants by future astronauts. And the fact that the ice was found so near the equator, the warmest region on Mars, might make it an ideal place to land crewed missions to the red planet.\n\nPreviously, InSight has “heard” and detected space rocks hitting Mars, but the December impact was the largest. Since landing on 2018, the mission has revealed new details about Mars’ crust, mantle and core and detected 1,318 marsquakes.\n\nSadly, InSight’s mission is running out of time. Increasing amounts of dust have settled on the lander’s solar panels, only exacerbated by a continent-size dust storm detected on Mars in September, and its power levels keep dropping.\n\nThe beige clouds are a continent-size dust storm imaged by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on September 29. The locations of the Perseverance, Curiosity and InSight missions are also labeled. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nFortunately, the storm didn’t pass over InSight directly — otherwise, the darkness of the storm would have ended the mission. But the weather event has kicked a lot of dust up into the atmosphere, and it has cut down the amount of sunlight reaching InSight’s solar panels, said Bruce Banerdt, InSight principal investigator at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n\nThe mission scientists estimate InSight will likely shut down in the next six weeks, ending a promising mission to unlock the interior of Mars.\n\n“For the last four years we’ve gone well beyond the intended lifetime of the mission, which was two years,” Banerdt said. ” And even now as we’re winding down, we’re still getting these amazing new results.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/03/12/life-on-mars/1982339/", "title": "Life on Mars?

Drilling into bedrock on what appears to have once been a lake bed more than 3 billion years ago, the rover probe returned a sample of clay formed in freshwater and laced with sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon, all vital to the biochemistry of life. \"We found a habitable environment that's largely benign. You could have drank the water that flowed,\" Grotzinger says.\n\nThe rover landed inside Gale Crater on Mars in August in a dramatic seven minute rocket-deployed landing and quickly found evidence of past water flow inside the crater. Since then,the rover has rolled to a rocky outcrop nicknamed \"Yellowknife Bay\" by mission scientists, where they drilled into the bedrock, first discovering a gray \"mudstone\" clay underneath the rusty dust carpeting Mars.\n\n\"Now we know from ground truth chemical measurements that mudstone containing clays provided an environment that is not extremely harsh, consistent with, for example, microbial life at some time,\" says University of California, Berkeley, biochemist Richard Mathies, who was not part of the mission. \"This is a strong argument for NASA to push for flying higher capability instruments that actually do have the capability and sensitivity needed to search for the presence of life on Mars.\"\n\nFor now, the rover will continue probing the rock outcrop, moving on to similar settings that might yield evidence of even more complex chemicals that may hint at ancient biochemistry. Grotzinger pointed to microbes on Earth that make a living off of simple chemical reactions with minerals as examples of the kind of life that could have survived in the environment at Gale Crater. They would have thrived, he added, \"about the time we first see life preserved on Earth.\"\n\nThe Curiosity rover is essentially a mobile chemistry lab, \"not a life detection machine,\" unable to detect any fossil traces of such ancient microbes, noted mission scientist Paul Mahaffy of NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Md., at the briefing. NASA's next Mars lander planned for 2020 will likely need to have such a capability, Mathies suggested, as a result of the new findings.\n\nMount Sharp, or Aeolis Mons, an 18,000-foot-high mountain in the center of the crater, remains the ultimate destination of the rover. The mountain is ringed with clay deposits targeted for exploration that have been pre-empted to some extent by Tuesday's announced discovery.\n\n\"We now have food to imagine a very different Mars than the one we see today,\" said Grunsfeld, a former astronaut, pointing to the possibilities of lakes and snow-capped mountains once dotting the now-desert planet. \"It makes me want to go,\" he said.\n\n\"I'll go, John,\" replied Grotzinger. \"Just bring me back.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/24/world/new-minerals-discovered-in-el-ali-meteorite-scn/index.html", "title": "El Ali: 2 new minerals found in 15-metric ton meteorite that crashed ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

As he was examining it, something unusual caught his eye — some parts of the sample weren’t identifiable by a microscope. He then sought advice from Andrew Locock, head of the university’s Electron Microprobe Laboratory, since Locock has experience describing new minerals.\n\n“The very first day he did some analyses, he said, ‘You’ve got at least two new minerals in there,’” Herd, a professor in the university’s department of Earth and atmospheric sciences, said in a statement. “That was phenomenal.

Elkins-Tanton is also a regents professor in that university’s School of Earth and Space Exploration and the principal investigator of NASA’s upcoming Psyche mission — a journey to a metal-rich asteroid orbiting the sun between Mars and Jupiter, according to the space agency.\n\n“Lindy has done a lot of work on how the cores of planets form, how these iron nickel cores form, and the closest analogue we have are iron meteorites,” Herd said. “It made sense to name a mineral after her and recognize her contributions to science.”\n\nThe International Mineralogical Association’s approval of the two new minerals in November of this year “indicates that the work is robust,” said Oliver Tschauner, a mineralogist and professor of research in the department of geoscience at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\n\n“Whenever you find a new mineral, it means that the actual geological conditions, the chemistry of the rock, was different than what’s been found before,” Herd said. “That’s what makes this exciting: In this particular meteorite you have two officially described minerals that are new to science.”\n\nThe role of lab-created minerals in discovery\n\nLocock’s quick identification was possible because similar minerals had been synthetically created before, and he was able to match the composition of the newly discovered minerals with their human-made counterparts, according to the University of Alberta release.\n\n“Material scientists do this all the time,” said Alan Rubin, a meteorite researcher and former adjunct professor and research geochemist in the department of earth, planetary and space sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles. “They can create new compounds — one, just to see what’s physically possible just as a research interest, and others … will say, ‘We’re seeking a compound that has certain properties for some practical or commercial application, like conductivity or high strain or high melting temperature.\n\n“It’s just fortuitous that a researcher will find a mineral in a meteorite or a terrestrial rock that hasn’t been known before, and then very often, that same compound will have been created previously by material scientists.”\n\nBoth new minerals are phosphates of iron, Tschauner said. A phosphate is a salt or ester of a phosphoric acid.\n\n“Phosphates in iron meteorites are secondary products: They form through oxidation of phosphides … which are rare primary components of iron meteorites,” he said via email. “Hence, the two new phosphates tell us about oxidation processes that occurred in the meteorite material. It remains to be seen if the oxidation occurred in space or on Earth, after the fall, but as far as I know, many of these meteorite phosphates formed in space. In either case, water is probably the reactant that caused the oxidation.”\n\nThe findings were presented in November at the University of Alberta’s Space Exploration Symposium. The revelations “broaden our perspective on the natural materials that can be found and can be formed in the solar system,” Rubin said.\n\nThe El Ali meteorite the minerals came from appears to have been sent to China in search of a buyer, Herd said.\n\nMeanwhile, the researchers are still analyzing the minerals — and potentially a third one — to find out what the conditions were in the meteorite when the space rock formed. And newly discovered minerals could have exciting implications for the future, he added.\n\n“Whenever there’s a new material that’s known, material scientists are interested too because of the potential uses in a wide range of things in society,” Herd said.", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/12/21/2020-amazing-science-space-discoveries/3922477001/", "title": "COVID vaccine wasn't only amazing discovery 2020: A year in science", "text": "In 2020, incredible scientific discoveries didn't stop because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFirst and foremost was the phenomenal work done by scientists to study the disease and develop vaccines in record time to put the brakes on the global pandemic. It was a truly Herculean effort by literally thousands of scientists around the world.\n\nOtherwise, while nothing can compare to the vaccine effort for impact, we discovered there could be water on the sunlit surface of the moon, potentially life on Venus, \"Marsquakes\" on Mars, and the chance that dozens of intelligent civilizations could be scattered across our Milky Way galaxy.\n\nCloser to home, we uncovered prehistoric evidence of a ferocious tyrannosaur in Canada, a car-sized turtle in South America, and the oldest bird fossil ever found, dubbed the \"wonderchicken.\"\n\nAnd as for us humans, we listened to a mummy speak after 3,000 years, found Africa's oldest human footprints, and even realized that Neanderthals were skilled fishermen.\n\nHere are just a few of the amazing science stories of 2020:\n\nWe heard the voice of an ancient mummy\n\nIn January, scientists re-created the voice of an ancient, 3,000-year-old Egyptian mummy using 3D printing, medical scanners and an electronic larynx, a study said. They were able to reproduce a single vowel sound, which sounds like something between the vowels in the words \"bed\" and \"bad.\" Listen for yourself below.\n\n'Boiling' plasma was spotted on the sun\n\nAlso that month, we saw the most detailed photos of the sun ever taken. One of the images showed a pattern of turbulent \"boiling\" plasma that covers the entire sun. The cell-like structures – each about the size of Texas – are the signature of violent motions that carry heat from the inside of the sun to its surface.\n\nScientists discovered the fossil of a giant turtle\n\nIn February, paleontologists discovered what they called the \"reaper of death,\" a fearsome new species of dinosaur that was the \"oldest occurrence of a large tyrannosaur in Canada.\"\n\nAlso in February, scientists announced the discovery of a huge turtle fossil in South America. It's \"one of the largest, if not the largest, turtle that ever existed,\" scientists said, noting that the colossal, long-extinct beast lived 5 million to 10 million years ago and measured 9½ feet, roughly the size and shape of a midsized car.\n\nNASA's robot detected hundreds of 'marsquakes'\n\nAnd that month we also heard about \"marsquakes,\" and the fact that our red neighbor planet had hundreds of quakes over the past year. The marsquakes were recorded by NASA's InSight, a robot spacecraft that landed on Mars in November 2018. \"We've finally, for the first time, established that Mars is a seismically active planet,\" said NASA's Bruce Banerdt.\n\n'Wonderchicken' becomes oldest bird fossil ever\n\nIn March, our attention turned to a creature dubbed the \"wonderchicken,\" a seagull-size shorebird with features of ducks, chickens and turkeys. The nearly complete skull was hidden inside nondescript pieces of rock, and it dates to more than 66 million years ago – which makes it the oldest bird fossil ever discovered. (That's less than 1 million years before the asteroid impact that killed off all the large dinosaurs.)\n\n\"The moment I first saw what was beneath the rock was the most exciting moment of my scientific career,\" said study lead author Daniel Field.\n\nWe also learned about an ancient wormlike creature that's the ancestor of all animals. The tiny thing, about the size of a grain of rice, lived about 555 million years ago.\n\nWe learned Neanderthals were actually skilled fishermen\n\nAlso in March, the reputation of Neanderthals got a boost when we found out that they weren't just the club-wielding brutes of popular legend, hunting and eating only woolly mammoths in frozen northern climates.\n\nA study, for the first time, suggested that they were skilled fishermen and that seafood was a key ingredient in their diets.\n\nA comet from outside our solar system paid a visit\n\nIn April, we tracked an unusual visitor from outer space: Comet 2I/Borisov, which astronomers described as a \"snowman from a dark and cold place,\" because “comets are leftover building blocks from the time of planet formation.\"\n\n“This is the first time we’ve ever looked inside a comet from outside our solar system,” said NASA astrochemist Martin Cordiner.\n\nBizarre mammal called 'crazy beast' fossil discovered in Madagascar\n\nAlso in April, we learned about the fossil of a bizarre mammal, called \"crazy beast,\" which was discovered in Madagascar. The skeleton is the most complete for any Mesozoic mammal yet discovered in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nThe 66-million-year-old opossum-size fossil represented a new species, which the study authors have named \"Adalatherium hui,\" from a Malagasy word meaning “crazy” and the Greek word for “beast.”\n\nScientists spot 'incredibly rare' Super-Earth\n\nMeanwhile, in May, scientists announced the discovery of an incredibly rare \"Super-Earth,\" which they said was a \"one in a million\" find. Also calling it \"incredibly rare,\" New Zealand astronomers say the planet \"is one of only a handful that have been discovered with both size and orbit comparable to that of Earth.\"\n\nAfrica's largest group of human fossil footprints were uncovered\n\nMay also was when we found out about Africa's largest group of human fossil footprints, which were discovered in Tanzania. Thousands of years ago, a group of 17 people took a walk through the mud in eastern Africa. Amazingly, their footprints are still there today, and were recently identified by archaeologists.\n\nWe learned there could be 'dozens' of intelligent civilizations in our galaxy\n\nIn June, we got the news that we're probably not alone in our galaxy: There could be \"dozens\" of intelligent civilizations scattered throughout the Milky Way.\n\n“There should be at least a few dozen active civilizations in our galaxy under the assumption that it takes 5 billion years for intelligent life to form on other planets, as on Earth,” University of Nottingham astrophysicist Christopher Conselice said.\n\nThis estimate assumes that intelligent life forms on other planets in a similar way as it does on Earth.\n\nAn asteroid impact, not volcanoes, killed off dinosaurs\n\nAlso in June we learned for sure that an asteroid impact – not volcanic eruptions – killed off the dinosaurs. The asteroid strike would have released particles and gases high into the atmosphere, blocking out the sun for years and causing permanent winters, a study said.\n\n\"Our study confirms, for the first time quantitatively, that the only plausible explanation for the extinction is the impact winter that eradicated dinosaur habitats worldwide,\" said study lead author Alessandro Chiarenza of Imperial College London.\n\nScientists confirmed the universe is 13.8 billion years old\n\nThe discoveries continued in the second half of the year: Scientists confirmed in July that the universe is 13.8 billion years old. While this estimate had been known, in recent years other scientific measurements had suggested instead the universe may be hundreds of millions of years younger than that. The scientists studied an image of the oldest light in the universe to confirm its age of 13.8 billion years.\n\nComet Neowise made a rare appearance\n\nAlso in July, folks got a rare chance to spot another interstellar interloper: Comet Neowise. “Discovered on March 27, 2020, by NASA’s Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) mission, Comet Neowise is putting on a dazzling display for skywatchers before it disappears, not to be seen again for another 6,800 years,” NASA said in July.\n\nGreenland's melting ice sheet passed the point of no return\n\nAlso in August, in unsettling news, scientists said Greenland's melting ice sheet had passed the point of no return. In fact, glaciers on the island have shrunk so much that even if global warming were to stop today, the ice sheet would continue shrinking, a study suggested.\n\n\"Glacier retreat has knocked the dynamics of the whole ice sheet into a constant state of loss,\" said study co-author Ian Howat, an earth scientist from Ohio State University.\n\nAstronomers see hint of life on Venus\n\nScientists in September announced the discovery of a possible sign of life high in the clouds of Venus. Using telescopes based in Chile and Hawaii, astronomers spotted in Venus' clouds the chemical signature of phosphine, a noxious gas that on Earth is associated only with life. Based on the many scenarios the astronomers considered, the team concluded there is no explanation for the phosphine in Venus’ clouds other than the presence of life.\n\nWater discovered on sunlit part of the moon for the first time\n\nIn October, we learned that water had been discovered on the sunlit surface of the moon for the first time. NASA said this was an important revelation that indicates water may be distributed across the lunar surface – and not just limited to its cold, shadowed places such as the poles. This is good news for astronauts at future lunar bases who could tap into those resources for drinking and rocket fuel production.\n\n“We had indications that H2O – the familiar water we know – might be present on the sunlit side of the moon,” said Paul Hertz, director of the astrophysics division in the science mission directorate at NASA headquarters in Washington. “Now we know it is there. This discovery challenges our understanding of the lunar surface and raises intriguing questions about resources relevant for deep space exploration.”\n\nThere's a metal asteroid out there worth $10,000 quadrillion\n\nThis isn't your typical space rock. Also in October, we found out that the asteroid 16 Psyche – one of the most massive objects in the main asteroid belt orbiting between Mars and Jupiter – could be made entirely of metal, according to a study.\n\nEven more intriguing, the asteroid's metal is worth an estimated $10,000 quadrillion (that's 15 more zeroes), more than the entire economy of Earth.\n\nRadio bursts were detected from within our Milky Way for first time\n\nFor the first time, astronomers in November discovered a \"fast radio burst\" that came from within our own Milky Way galaxy.\n\nThey also believe they have found a source of one of the bursts, which are extremely bright flashes of energy that last for a fraction of a second, during which they can blast out more than 100 million times more power than our sun.\n\nIt appears the radio pulses were produced by a magnetar – a type of neutron star with a hugely powerful magnetic field.\n\nA 50-year-old science problem was solved\n\nAnd in December, we learned about the arcane field of \"protein folding.\" A new discovery about the field could unlock a world of possibilities into the understanding of everything from diseases to drugs, researchers say. The breakthrough sent ripples of excitement through the science and medical communities because it deals with the shapes tiny proteins in our bodies – essential to all life – fold into.\n\nThe \"protein-folding problem\" has puzzled scientists for five decades, and the discovery from the London-based artificial intelligence lab DeepMind was heralded as a major milestone.\n\n\"This computational work represents a stunning advance on the protein-folding problem, a 50-year old grand challenge in biology,\" said Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the U.K.'s Royal Society.\n\nWe learned mass extinctions of Earth's land animals follow a cycle\n\nAlso in December, we found out that mass extinctions of life on Earth appear to follow a regular pattern, according to a study. In fact, widespread die-offs of land-dwelling animals – which include amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds – follow a cycle of about 27 million years, the study reports. The study also said these mass extinctions coincide with major asteroid impacts and devastating volcanic outpourings of lava.\n\n\"The global mass extinctions were apparently caused by the largest cataclysmic impacts and massive volcanism, perhaps sometimes working in concert,\" said study lead author Michael Rampino of New York University.\n\nMore news from 2020 you don't want to forget\n\nAstronomers say 'disappearing planet' may never have existed\n\nWalking sharks discovered near Australia but there's no need to head for the hills\n\nNASA is dropping racially insensitive nicknames from cosmic objects\n\nWarm water discovered beneath Antarctica's 'doomsday' glacier, scientists say", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/18/world/webb-telescope-jupiter-images-scn/index.html", "title": "New Webb telescope images show Jupiter in a new light | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope’s first stunning images of the distant universe have been followed up by something a little closer to home.\n\nData collected during the telescope’s commissioning period, before its science operations officially started on July 12, have been released on the Space Telescope Science Institute’s website. The publicly available data is now ready for scientists around the world to study.\n\nThat data includes new images of Jupiter, which were taken while the space observatory’s instruments were still being tested.\n\n“Combined with the deep field images released the other day, these images of Jupiter demonstrate the full grasp of what Webb can observe, from the faintest, most distant observable galaxies to planets in our own cosmic backyard that you can see with the naked eye from your actual backyard,” said Bryan Holler, a scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, in a statement.\n\nHoller helped with the planning for the observations.\n\nWebb is an infrared telescope, so it captures light that is invisible to the human eye. One of Webb’s images of Jupiter shows the giant planet’s telltale atmospheric bands as well as the Great Red Spot.\n\nThis famous feature is a massive storm about twice the size of Earth that has churned for over a century. It looks white in the image due to the processing of the infrared image.\n\nEuropa, one of Jupiter’s moons, is visible to the left of the planet. The shadow of the moon also makes a cameo left of the Great Red Spot.\n\nJupiter, center, and its moon Europa, left, are seen through the Webb telescope's NIRCam instrument. NASA/ESA/CSA/B. Holler/J. Stansberry/STScI\n\n“I couldn’t believe that we saw everything so clearly, and how bright they were,” said Stefanie Milam, Webb’s deputy project scientist for planetary science based at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, in a statement.\n\n“It’s really exciting to think of the capability and opportunity that we have for observing these kinds of objects in our solar system.”\n\nSome of the telescope’s other perspectives of Jupiter revealed some of the planet’s faint rings. The images prove that Webb is able to observe faint details and objects close to bright planets like Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nThis is especially exciting because it means that Webb may also be able to observe plumes of material releasing into space from ocean worlds in our solar system, like Europa or Saturn’s moon Enceladus.\n\nInteractive: The search for life on Mars and ocean worlds in our solar system\n\n“We’ll look at our own solar system with new infrared eyes, looking for chemical traces of our history, and tracking down mysteries like Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, composition of the ocean under the ice of Europa, and the atmosphere of Saturn’s giant moon Titan,” said John Mather, Webb senior project scientist at NASA Goddard, in a statement.\n\nThe first images were anticipated by Mather for 25 years. “What comes next? All the tools are working, better than we hoped and promised. Scientific observations, proposed years ago, are being made as we speak,” Mather said.\n\n“We want to know: Where did we come from? What happened after the big bang to make galaxies and stars and black holes?

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThis year, humankind glimpsed the universe in ways that were never before possible, and space missions took unprecedented leaps forward in unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos.\n\nWe witnessed the first mission to the International Space Station funded entirely by space tourists. A new space-based internet service played a key role in the war in Ukraine. And there were historic launches of spacecraft and technology by NASA and its international partners that could one day be used to land humans on Mars.\n\n“There is no doubt that 2022 was out of this world,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. “2022 will go down in the history books as one of the most accomplished years across all of NASA’s missions.”\n\nHere are some of the unforgettable space discoveries and moments from 2022.\n\nArtemis I moon mission launches\n\nAfter years of preparation, NASA finally got its latest lunar exploration program off the ground with an uncrewed test flight that carried anastronaut-worthy spacecraft around the moon.\n\nThe mission was chock-full of huge moments. The rocket that got the mission off the ground, the Space Launch System or SLS, became the most powerful rocket ever to reach orbit — boasting 15% more thrust than the Saturn V rockets behind the Apollo program.\n\nUpon reaching space, the Orion capsule, which flew empty save for a few test mannequins, captured stunning images of the Earth and moon. And Orion’s orbital path swung farther out beyond the far side of the moon than any spacecraft designed to carry humans has traveled before.\n\nNASA's Orion spacecraft captures an image of the \"Earth rise\" as it emerges from the far side of the moon. NASA\n\nThe trial run has paved the way for future Artemis missions, with the aim of returning humans to the lunar surface before mapping out a pathway for the first human spaceflight to Mars.\n\nWebb telescope reveals the invisible universe\n\nIn partnership with international space agencies, NASA not only made strides in its human exploration program, but it also notched steps forward in scientific endeavors. After decades of anticipation, the James Webb Space Telescope finally began observing the universe in July.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope captured this image of the spiral galaxy IC 5332. ESA/NASA/CSA/J. Lee\n\nSince then, the world’s most powerful space observatory has turned its gaze on planets, stars and galaxies in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nThe telescope has spied unseen aspects of the universe and previously hidden features, including the most distant galaxies ever observed. Webb has also shared new perspectives on some of astronomy’s favorite cosmic features and captured them in a new light, such as the Pillars of Creation.\n\nThe telescope’s images have already gone beyond what astronomers expected — and the best news: Webb is just getting started.\n\nObserving astronomical wonders for the first time\n\nThe Webb telescope, however, wasn’t the only space observatory expanding our understanding of deep space. The Hubble Space Telescope spied the most distant single star ever observed, faintly shining 28 billion light-years away. The star existed just 900 million years after the big bang created the universe, and its light has traveled nearly 13 billion years to reach Earth.\n\nAstronomers nicknamed the star Earendel, derived from an Old English word that means “morning star” or “rising light.”\n\nMeanwhile, astronomers used the Event Horizon Telescope to capture an image of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy for the first time. This first direct observation confirmed the presence of the black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, as the beating heart of the Milky Way.\n\nWhile black holes don’t emit light, the shadow of the cosmic object was surrounded by a bright ring — light bent by the gravity of the black hole.\n\nShifting an asteroid’s trajectory in space\n\nIn late September, NASA successfully completed the first test mission for planetary defense. The space agency slammed a spacecraft into Dimorphos, a small asteroid that orbits a larger space rock named Didymos — and yes, the collision was intentional. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, was a full-scale demonstration of deflection technology.\n\nThe rocky surface of Dimorphos was the last thing DART saw before crashing into the asteroid. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\n\nNeither Dimorphos nor Didymos poses a threat to Earth, but the system was a perfect target to test a technique that may one day be used to protect the planet from an asteroid strike.\n\nThe DART mission marked the first time humanity intentionally changed the motion of a celestial object in space. The spacecraft altered the moonlet asteroid’s orbit by 32 minutes.\n\nNASA announces plans to study UFOs\n\nAnd that’s not all 2022 offered when it came to the study of unusual objects in the skies. In June, NASA announced it would delve into the mysteries surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena, more popularly known as unidentified flying objects or UFOs. The space agency later selected a team of experts across numerous disciplines — including astrobiology, data science, oceanography, genetics, policy and planetary science — for the task.\n\nOfficials at NASA aren’t suggesting aliens may be responsible for such phenomena. The goal is merely to take a serious look at the as-yet-unexplained — but much publicly debated — topic of UAPs and how they might be studied through a scientific lens.\n\n“Without access to an extensive set of data, it is nearly impossible to verify or explain any observation, thus the focus of the study is to inform NASA what possible data could be collected in the future to scientifically discern the nature of UAP,” according to a NASA news release.\n\nMilestones on Mars\n\nMeanwhile on the red planet, the InSight lander’s mission came to an end due to a surplus of dust on its solar panels (and no whirlwinds to vacuum them clean), but the stationary spacecraft made history in 2022. InSight detected the largest quake on Mars and captured the sounds of space rocks slamming into the planet — which created craters that revealed treasure troves of subsurface ice.\n\nThe NASA InSight lander acquired this image of the area in front of the spacecraft on Mars on December 11. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nAs InSight winds down, the Perseverance rover’s sidekick has continued to take to the Martian skies, above and beyond its original five-flight mission. The Ingenuity helicopter broke its own altitude record and has aced 37 flights on the red planet since April 2021. The little chopper has acted as an aerial scout for Perseverance, which collected an incredible diversity of Martian rock and sediment samples.\n\nNow, the rover is setting up a depot of samples that will be stored on the Martian surface. The samples will be retrieved and returned to Earth in 2033 via the ambitious Mars Sample Return program, which will send a lander and a duo of retrieval helicopters to the red planet later this decade.\n\nInterstellar meteor visits our cosmic neighborhood\n\nSpeaking of space rocks, a rare specimen traveled to Earth in 2014. But scientists just put its puzzle pieces together this year, and the discovery was announced in a US Space Command document.\n\nThe first known interstellar meteor to hit Earth crash-landed along the northeast coast of Papua New Guinea in January 2014.\n\nInterstellar meteors are space rocks originating from outside our solar system, such as ʻOumuamua, the first known interstellar object in our solar system that was detected in 2017.\n\nDebris from Space Shuttle Challenger disaster discovered\n\nTo be sure, NASA has seen many successes this year but also faced reminders of tragedy and disaster. Investigators set off in March to search suspected shipwreck sites in the Bermuda Triangle, a swath of the northern Atlantic Ocean said to be the site of dozens of shipwrecks and plane crashes, for a TV docuseries. But the crew stumbled upon something unexpected at another site off Florida’s east coast: a 20-foot-long (6-meter-long) piece of debris from the Space Shuttle Challenger, which broke apart shortly after takeoff in 1986 and killed all seven crew members aboard.\n\nDivers discovered a lost piece of the Space Shuttle Challenger while scouring the ocean floor off Florida's east coast. The History Channel/\"The Bermuda Triangle: Into Cursed Waters\"\n\nIt was the first debris to be discovered since pieces from the shuttle washed ashore in 1996.\n\n“This discovery gives us an opportunity to pause once again, to uplift the legacies of the seven pioneers we lost, and to reflect on how this tragedy changed us,” Nelson, the NASA administrator, said in a statement. “At NASA, the core value of safety is — and must forever remain — our top priority, especially as our missions explore more of the cosmos than ever before.”\n\nNascent satellite system provides internet to war-torn Ukraine\n\nAs Russia launched its invasion in February and some areas of Ukraine lost internet access, a space-based internet system that barely existed a few years ago began to provide crucial connectivity.\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX designed and launched the system, called Starlink. It makes use of thousands of small satellites orbiting a few hundred miles above Earth. The satellites work in tandem to blanket the globe in internet connectivity, and all that’s needed to get online is an easy-to-use Starlink satellite dish.\n\nMusk and SpaceX sent thousands of those dishes to Ukraine. Though a funding controversy later ensued, the use of Starlink in the Eastern European country was hailed as a game changer in strategic communication for its military, allowing Ukraine to fight effectively, even as the ongoing war disrupted cellular phone and internet networks.\n\nFirst all-private mission to the space station\n\nStarlink, however, is one small part of SpaceX’s booming business. The company routinely launches not only satellites but also astronauts into space on NASA’s behalf. And this year, SpaceX even flew a few wealthy thrill-seekers to the International Space Station on a mission brokered by Axiom. The event marked the first space station mission that was fully paid for by paying customers and included only private citizens.\n\nThe AX-1 crew is shown (from left): Larry Connor, Michael López-Alegría, Mark Pathy, Michael López-Alegría and Eytan Stibbe. Courtesy SpaceX\n\nThere were four crew members. Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut-turned-Axiom employee, was mission commander. And the three paying customers were Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe, Canadian investor Mark Pathy and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor.\n\nThe mission, called AX-1, launched on April 8 and was originally billed as a 10-day trip. Delays, however, extended the mission by about a week.\n\nAllowing private missions to the space station is part of NASA’s plan for more commercial activity in low-Earth orbit as it turns its focus to exploring deep space.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland Jackie Wattles", "Ashley Strickland", "Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/01/11/nasa-planet-toi-700-e-habitable-zone/11032777002/", "title": "NASA: Newly discovered planet TOI 700 e exists in habitable zone", "text": "Scientists with NASA announced they have discovered an Earth-sized planet that is likely rocky – and could be habitable.\n\nThe planet, named TOI 700 e, is slightly smaller than Earth and orbits a red dwarf star called TOI 700 about 100 light-years away. It's one of four planets to orbit the star, alongside TOI 700 b, c and d.\n\nTOI 700 d was already known to be in the habitable zone, a discovery made possible by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which monitors large portions of the sky for 27 days at a time to track changes in stellar brightness caused by planets.\n\nBut it took more than a year for scientists to discover TOI 700 e and learn that it was within the star's habitable zone. Its discovery was presented at the American Astronomical Society in Seattle, and a paper about the planet was accepted by The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nComet: A newly-discovered green comet is nearing Earth and it may be visible to the naked eye\n\nMore: NASA's new asteroid-hunting telescope is made to protect Earth from disaster\n\nWhat is the habitable zone?\n\nAlso known as the \"Goldilocks zone,\" the habitable zone is the distance from a star where liquid water could exist on an orbiting planet, according to NASA. It gets its nickname because the conditions on the planet are not too cold or too hot to sustain life.\n\nScientists say TOI 700 e, along with planet d, are in the \"optimistic\" habitable zone, which means the planet, at some point, could have had liquid water in its history.\n\n\"This is one of only a few systems with multiple, small, habitable-zone planets that we know of,\" Emily Gilbert, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who led the work, said in a statement.\n\nMeteor showers of 2023:A visual guide on where and when to view the year's 11 sky shows\n\nWhat is planet TOI 700 e like?\n\nTOI 700 e is about 95% the size of Earth and is probably a rocky planet similar to ours.\n\nIt is about 10% smaller than planet d. Although it is the fourth planet to be discovered in the TOI 700 system, it is between planets c and d.\n\n\"If the star was a little closer or the planet a little bigger, we might have been able to spot TOI 700 e in the first year of TESS data,” said Ben Hord, graduate researcher at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nIt takes TOI 700 e about 28 days to orbit its star, and it may also be a tidally locked planet, meaning it spins only once per orbit and only one side always faces the star. It's similar to how only one side of the moon is always facing Earth.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

In 2019, water vapor was detected in the atmosphere of the planet known as K2-18b, along with temperatures that could support life.\n\nScientists plan follow-up studies on the TOI 700 system as TESS searches for other systems in the universe.\n\n\"We’re looking forward to the other exciting discoveries hidden in the mission’s treasure trove of data,\" said Allison Youngblood, a research astrophysicist and TESS deputy project scientist.\n\nFollow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2012/09/14/nasa-mars-mission/1568101/", "title": "Will we be the first Martians?", "text": "USATODAY\n\nThe first outposts on Mars could come after 2060.\n\nFrom ancients who worshiped the Red Planet as a fierce war god in the sky, to scientists like Percival Lowell and fantasists like Ray Bradbury, Mars has taunted Earth's adventurers with the ultimate challenge.\n\nNow that the fear of imaginary invaders has been replaced by a frustrating search for even microscopic signs of life there, a more fundamental question is emerging.\n\nCould humans walk the sands of Mars, and actually live and work there?\n\nThat's what NASA's $2.5 billion Mars' Curiosity rover is trying to determine as it rolls heroically across the rugged but achingly desolate Martian landscape.\n\nPlacing men and women on a cold planet currently 173.5 million miles away is a question not just for poets and philosophers but for planners and policymakers.\n\nWhen USA TODAY, celebrating its 30th anniversary with a look to the 21st-century future, spoke with NASA chief Charles Bolden, he emphasized \"the critical importance of Curiosity, because it's not the first, but it's the most critical, the largest mission, that's a precursor for putting humans on Mars.\"\n\nThe first manned visits, he said, could happen around 2035 as an international endeavor. The first outposts on Mars could come after 2060.\n\n\"Mars has captured the human imagination certainly since people started gazing up at the sky,\" says NASA science chief John Grunsfeld, a former Hubble repair mission astronaut. \"There are really very few places that humans could actually go and live some day. Mars is one of those.\"\n\nStill, as the nation debates its goals for space exploration in a post-space shuttle era marked by an increasingly tight-fisted Congress and endless deficits, how improbable it is that the proposals even are being made.\n\nConsider: John F. Kennedy's ambitious goal, announced 50 years ago this week, to put a man on the moon involved a trip of a mere 239,000 miles. Getting to Mars — even at its closest point to Earth — means a trip more than 140 times farther, lasting 200 days and with the possible bombardment by life-threatening radiation, a risk some scientists see as a deal-killer.\n\nEven if all goes well, what would they find once they arrive?\n\nStanding on the Red Planet\n\n\n\nThe day the first explorers set foot on Mars, a ruddy dust hanging like a curtain in the sky would tint their every view. If they stood where Curiosity is now, the sun would look less than half as large as it does from Earth. Temperatures would range from merely freezing during the day, to minus-103 degrees Fahrenheit at night.\n\nTrying to take a breath would kill, the faint carbon dioxide atmosphere so thin it would count as a vacuum on Earth. Radiation rakes the surface in doses stronger than the astronauts receive aboard the International Space Station — the equivalent of at least 240 chest X-rays in a six-month stay.\n\nThe gravity on Mars is only 38% of Earth's. Walking — or bounding — could be Mars' first challenge, and an eventual Olympic sport.\n\nPhoning home would be rare. The distance from Earth to Mars varies from 33 million to 249 million miles. It would take anywhere from three to 21 minutes to transmit \"hello\" even at the speed of light, making for stilted conversation. And for two weeks every two years, Mars and Earth are on opposite sides of the sun. Communications might be impossible.\n\nInstead of the towering cities imagined by John Carter of Mars creator Edgar Rice Burroughs, lava caves lining the slopes of the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, look safer as houses for future Martian tenants.\n\nMore likely, plans call for pre-fabricated Martian habitats to be launched two years before astronauts themselves begin their journey. Once secured on the surface, astronauts would spend their days on Mars brewing methane fuel and oxygen from water and carbon deposits that evidence suggests remain locked under the Martian soil.\n\nFor all that, NASA spacecraft have revealed a Red Planet that looks more hospitable — with caves, water and minerals — than the dusty picture painted by the 1970s Viking lander missions, which transmitted images of a sterile desert.\n\nAnd as NASA's Curiosity rover makes its first tracks — exploring, sniffing and zapping the surface of Mars for signs that life once graced the Red Planet in the past — the panoramas it reveals are of a planet that looks not unlike the high deserts on Earth.\n\nSurviving the rays of Mars\n\n\n\nWhat Curiosity learns about the weather and radiation hazards of Mars will help determine how manned landings play out.\n\nJust getting there would be a triumph. The trip could take 200 days, with Martian stayovers ranging from a month to 500 days.\n\nSuch long voyages might seem an eternity for astronauts trapped in a spacecraft. But in 2011, the European Space Agency's \"Mars 500\" project isolated six men for 520 days in a simulated Mars trip. And several cosmonauts have experienced long stays in space, one of them spending 14 months in microgravity.\n\n\"I think there will be good circumstantial evidence that people will be able to tolerate a Mars mission when the time comes,\" says space psychologist Nick Kanas of the University of California-San Francisco.\n\nRadiation storms — which are known to affect telecommunications even on the atmosphere-shielded Earth — are the more immediate worry, especially in the barely-there atmosphere of Mars.\n\nA radiation detector aboard the rover already has collected months of data about hazards astronauts would face from cosmic rays and solar storm radiation on their trip to Mars.\n\n\"Sitting down in the belly of the spacecraft, the rover had about as much radiation shielding as astronauts have on the International Space Station,\" says Donald Hassler of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. He heads the rover's radiation instrument team.\n\nAstronauts could hide from solar storm radiation in shielded parts of a spacecraft or lander, Hassler says. Based on readings from Curiosity, \"we are finding the radiation from solar events is significant,\" he concedes.\n\nEven with shielding, Mars travel poses lifetime radiation risks for \"cataracts, skin damage, central nervous system damage, and impaired immune systems,\" as well as fatal cancers, according to a 2008 National Research Council Report. Radiation sickness from solar storms might endanger a mission, the report added.\n\nThe rover's radiation measures also tell scientists how deeply microbes on Mars, and astronauts, might have to hide under the surface to escape those effects. Would people from Earth have to burrow below the Martian surface to survive?\n\nIs Mars worth the risk?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This would be the most exciting adventure I could possibly imagine,\" SpaceX chief Elon Musk told The Daily Show's Jon Stewart, who asked the space entrepreneur why he wanted to walk on Mars.\n\n\"It's not so crazy to talk about astronauts visiting Mars,\" scientist Hassler says. \"It really is a question of when we decide to do it.\"\n\n\"It engages human fascination,\" says NASA's Grunsfeld.\n\nWhere rocket pioneer Werner von Braun once proposed sending fleets of silver-finned rocket ships to Mars on a trip piloted by 70 men, Musk today hopes to send people there on private rockets, eventually making the trip a $500,000 ticket.\n\nA Dutch reality-television-show effort, Mars One, has announced a plan to send colonists on a one-way trip to Mars starting in 2023 (the group's website \"frequently asked questions\" list begins with, \"Is this for real?\" — to which it answers, \"Yes, it is!\").\n\nWhether government-funded, privately financed or some undreamt reality-show adventure, \"it is not an unreasonable question to ask whether 30 years from now, will people have been to Mars?\" says space policy expert John Logsdon, author of John F. Kennedy and the Race to the Moon. \"It is a possibility, verging on a probability,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers aren't so sure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongress has balked at sending astronauts to Mars for decades, most notably in 1989 after a $500 billion cost estimate killed off one ambitious NASA plan. For that reason, Bolden was emphatic in his remarks to USA TODAY's editorial board that any manned missions to Mars would be international ones that spread the costs around.\n\nThe Obama administration recently cut unmanned Martian exploration by $500 million. Republican candidate Mitt Romney has called for \"clearer priorities\" in space efforts.\n\nEven Roger Launius, a former NASA historian who is curator at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., which is now offering a Mars exhibit, says he is \"pessimistic\" about Mars travel.\n\n\"We wanted to give people a glimpse of the future in the exhibit. I doubt we are going to see (Mars) any other way for the foreseeable future,\" he says.\n\n\"This is just not realistic, even spread out over many years, to think we will spend this kind of money,\" says Arizona State University historian Stephen Pyne, author of Voyager: Seeking Newer Worlds in the Third Great Age of Discovery. In an age of robotic rovers such as Curiosity, he says, \"we don't need people to plant the flag anymore to be explorers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Martian dream\n\n\n\n\n\nA century ago, astronomer Percival Lowell stirred generations with speculation that the deep scars in the planet's surface were canals created by Martians. Author H.G. Wells went a step further, writing that malevolent Martians watched Earth with \"envious eyes.\" And author Bradbury predicted people from Earth would be the first real Martians.\n\nIn widely noted remarks in January, physicist Stephen Hawking called for human colonies on Mars in the next century as a safeguard against catastrophe on Earth. We'll need a colony of the Red Planet by the next century, Hawking suggested, given the way things are going on the Blue Planet.\n\nIn cosmic terms, Mars is achingly close and the technology seems to be there, at least judging by the remarkable success of rovers like Curiosity.\n\nIf and when the call to Mars comes, there will likely be plenty of volunteers, says Bolden, a former space shuttle pilot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd go myself,\" he says. \"But my wife wouldn't let me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/11/24/good-night-oppy-nasa-mars-rover-documentary/10757855002/", "title": "'Good Night Oppy': NASA Mars Rover documentary is really a love ...", "text": "Get those Kleenex ready. You’ll never again see robots as just lurching, whirring, beeping hunks of metal.\n\nIn 2003, the U.S. sent two rovers to explore Mars. The documentary “Good Night Oppy” (streaming now on Amazon Prime Video) revives that epic adventure, doing for gangly interstellar probes what the Oscar-winning 2020 doc “My Octopus Teacher” did for that tentacled sea creature: humanize them.\n\nThe two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, or Oppy, were built to last roughly 92 days. Spirit lasted six years. And Oppy rambled across 28 miles of the red planet for nearly 15 years, driving its way into the hearts of NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists, who reveled in its triumphs and sweated its breakdowns. Think Pixar’s “WALL-E” meets “Apollo 13.”\n\n'Moonfall':Could the moon hit Earth? We fact check Roland Emmerich's disaster movie\n\nUSA TODAY spoke with “Oppy” director Ryan White and JPL engineering lead Doug Ellison about how this space adventure is really a love story.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe viral NASA tweet that started it all\n\nScience documentaries don’t typically tug at the heartstrings. But White says a 2019 viral tweet from NASA instantly convinced him and his production team that there was a very different story to tell.\n\nOppy had run into trouble during a Martian storm, so JPL scientists shut down most of its systems to preserve battery life. But doom loomed. The last message JPL received from its robot was, “My battery is low and it’s getting dark.”\n\nDid life ever exist on Mars? NASA's Perseverance rover finds organic matter in rock samples\n\n“People who had never heard of this mission suddenly felt they could relate to this little robot who was alone on this planet and in trouble,” says Ryan. “The emotion that human beings can pour into inanimate objects is what fascinated me.”\n\nWhy it’s easy to fall in love with a robot\n\nHow did JPL scientists fall for Oppy? It didn’t hurt that the robot was humanoid in some of its qualities: It stood 5-foot-2, had two cameras for eyes, an articulating arm and wheels as legs.\n\n“The robots were designed with engineering constraints, mostly: What equipment can we fit into this small package?” says Ellison, who was part of the rover project team. “But in the end, you wind up with very human qualities. Eyes that see in stereo and with 20/20 vision, like us. There’s an arm with a hammer, that looks like what a human geologist would bring on an expedition.”\n\nEllison adds that there was always a moment when JPL scientists working the robots remotely from California would start “mimicking their movements, raising their arm the way the robot would, and that’s when you know they’ve moved to another level of connection.”\n\nWhat to watch this Thanksgiving holiday weekend:From a new 'Knives Out' to 'Devotion'\n\nHumans are at the heart of the 'Good Night Oppy' story\n\nWhite was worried that the JPL scientists would “no offense to Doug, be dry and academic and emotionally detached, but these people proved me wrong. The humans I got were the biggest embarrassment of riches.”\n\nEllison concedes that “it’s strange to form an attachment to a glorified laptop on another planet, but we did have this strange fondness for and nurturing of 400 pounds of metal.”\n\nBack to the moon:NASA's Orion spacecraft reaches lunar realm, first such attempt since 1972\n\nThat said, once Oppy died, concluding the mission, Ellison and his JPL team members understood the real attachment. “In the end, it was maybe like when you turn in that first old car of yours,” he says. “We realized that the bond wasn’t so much to the robot itself, but rather to all these people you bonded with during that experience.”\n\nFilming on Mars, thanks to Industrial Light & Magic\n\nA big part of the emotional tug created by “Good Night Oppy” comes thanks to Industrial Light & Magic, the special effects company started by George Lucas when he was making his first “Star Wars” movie. Industrial Light & Magic visual effects pros were called in to take real images of Mars provided by Oppy and Spirit and turn those into exceedingly realistic scenes that show Oppy rovering around the red planet.\n\nWith the hit animated movie \"WALL-E\" firmly on his mind, White had a directive for the Industrial Light & Magic team: “If this is going to look like a cartoon, that’s not worth it. It needs to feel like a human crew was there filming these robots on Mars.”\n\nAs a longtime documentary filmmaker used to working fast, it took patience for White to let Industrial Light & Magic work its magic. “But JPL’s motto is ‘Dare Mighty Things,’ so if I’m doing a movie about them, I thought, let’s swing for the bleachers. It was just like what NASA does. Each team does what they’re best at, and they trust that others will do the same. That worked.”\n\n10 movies you must see this holiday season:From 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' to 'Avatar 2'\n\n'Good Night Oppy' could be the right movie at the right time\n\nWhite felt he might have a hit on his hands when in 2020, at the height of the pandemic and presidential elections, he pitched his robot documentary to distributors.\n\n“Docs are important in the way they hold up a mirror to society, but as a result, they're mostly dark stories,” he says. “But I would do this Zoom presentation and often there were tears streaming down the faces of these executives. People are desperate for stories that are hopeful and about the best of humanity.”\n\nThat is White’s wish for anyone curious about “Good Night Oppy.” He wants viewers to “come for the robot adventure” but stay for “the incredible human beings from all walks of life working on a project for the betterment of mankind. These days, that is very rare.”\n\nWhat are critics and audiences saying?\n\n\"Good Night Oppy,\" narrated by Angela Bassett, took the top prize at the 2022 Critics Choice Documentary Awards.\n\nUSA TODAY film critic Brian Truitt calls it an “out-of-this-world documentary” and “a crowd-pleasing testament to human ingenuity that rocks a real-life 'WALL-E' vibe.\" The film has a 100% positive audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nWho's roving around Mars now?\n\nNASA took up the rover challenge again a few years ago, successfully landing Perseverance on the planet in February 2021. The rover is significantly larger than Spirit and Opportunity, which were constrained in size by their method of delivery. The two older rovers were dropped to the surface of Mars inside cushioned balls, whereas Perseverance lowered itself using rockets.\n\nPerseverance is tasked with further exploring what Oppy already learned: Mars contains past evidence of flowing water with an intimation of some kind of life. The new rover is busy collecting soil samples that could help scientists learn more about the Martian environment prior to its current arid state.\n\n'The Fabelmans':Michelle Williams says playing Steven Spielberg's mom changed her approach to parenting", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/24"}]}

He also reiterated our commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself,” the official said.\n\nWithin hours, China had expressed its “strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition” to Biden’s comments, saying it will not allow any external force to interfere in its “internal affairs.”\n\n“On issues concerning China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and other core interests, there is no room for compromise,” said Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.\n\n“We urged the US side to earnestly follow the One China principle … be cautious in words and deeds on the Taiwan issue, and not send any wrong signal to pro-Taiwan independence and separatist forces — so it won’t cause serious damage to the situation across the Taiwan Strait and China-US relations.”\n\nChina’s Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian added, “We urge the US to stop saying or doing anything in violation of the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués. … Those who play with fire will certainly burn themselves.”\n\nTaiwan lies fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) off the coast of China. For more than 70 years the two sides have been governed separately, but that hasn’t stopped China’s ruling Communist Party from claiming the island as its own — despite having never controlled it.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping has said that “reunification” between China and Taiwan is inevitable and refused to rule out the use of force. Tensions between Beijing and Taipei are at the highest they’ve been in recent decades, with the Chinese military sending record numbers of war planes near the island.\n\nJoanne Ou, a spokesperson for Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNN that it “expresses sincere welcome and gratitude to President Biden and the United States government for reiterating its rock solid commitment to Taiwan.”\n\nBiden compares potential invasion of Taiwan to Ukraine war\n\nBiden on Monday compared a potential invasion of Taiwan by China to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, warning, “It will dislocate the entire region,” and emphasizing “Russia has to pay a long-term price for its actions.”\n\n“And the reason I bother to say this, not just about Ukraine – if, in fact, after all (Russian President Vladimir Putin has) done, there’s a rapprochement … between the Ukrainians and Russia, and these sanctions are not continued to be sustained in many ways, then what signal does that send to China about the cost of attempting, attempting to take Taiwan by force?”\n\nBiden said that China is “already flirting with danger right now by flying so close and all the maneuvers they’re undertaking.”\n\n“But the United States is committed, we made a commitment, we support the One China policy, we support all we’ve done in the past, but that does not mean, it does not mean that China has the ability, has the, excuse me, jurisdiction to go in and use force to take over Taiwan,” he added.\n\nAt the press conference, Kishida also reaffirmed the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\n\n“Attempts to change the status quo by force, like Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, should never be tolerated in the Indo-Pacific, above all, in East Asia,” he said.\n\n“As the regional security environment becomes increasingly severe, I reaffirmed with President Biden that we need to speedily strengthen the deterrence and response of the Japan-US alliance,” he said, adding that he conveyed his determination to “fundamentally strengthen Japan’s defense capability.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting and reaction.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Donald Judd Nectar Gan", "Kevin Liptak", "Donald Judd", "Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/22/politics/joe-biden-japan-monday/index.html", "title": "IPEF: President Biden unveils his economic plan for countering ...", "text": "Tokyo CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Monday said the thirteen nations joining his long-sought economic plan for Asia were “signing up to work toward an economic vision that will deliver for all people on Earth.”\n\nThe Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is Biden’s attempt at engaging a region coming increasingly under the influence of China. He unveiled it as he began the second leg of his debut tour of Asia. The announcement was one of the centerpieces of Biden’s visit to the continent, which began last week in South Korea and is continuing this week in Japan.\n\n“We’re here today for one simple purpose: the future of the 21st Century economy is going to be largely written in the Indo-Pacific. Our region,” Biden said as he launched the plan.\n\n“This framework should drive a race to the top,” he said.\n\nBiden is walking a delicate balance in revealing the economic framework. While Asian nations have been clamoring for a way to partner with the United States to reduce dependance on China, the President is also facing protectionist sentiments at home, where economic pain in the form of higher prices has proved the central issue in November’s midterm elections.\n\nBiden said Monday he did not believe a recession was inevitable, but acknowledged the pain was real.\n\n“It’s bad,” he said, suggesting later that improvement could be a long time coming.\n\n“This is going to be a haul. This is going to take some time,” he said, arguing things could have been much worse had he not taken steps like cultivating foreign investments in the US economy.\n\nBefore unveiling the plan, Biden called on Japan’s Emperor Naruhito and sat for bilateral talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, discussing issues related to China, Taiwan and North Korea.\n\n“The United States remains fully committed to Japanese, Japan’s defense, and we will face the challenges of today and the future together,” Biden said in his meeting with Kishida, their first formal face-to-face.\n\n“The purpose of the visit is to increase our cooperation with other nations of the region and deliver concrete benefits to the people of the Indo-Pacfic region,” Biden said, going on to thank Kishida for joining a US-led effort to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBiden was welcomed to the Akasaka Palace with a stately ceremony that included the playing of national anthems and an inspection of ceremonial honor guards. Biden watched and placed his hand on his heart for the playing of the Star Spangled Banner.\n\nChina has loomed over each of Biden’s stops, a mostly unspoken but ever-present factor in his push to reorient American foreign policy to focus more on Asia. It became explicit on Monday when Biden, speaking on China’s doorstep in Tokyo, said the US would be willing to intervene militarily should China invade Taiwan. While acknowledging the US still agrees with the “One China” policy, Biden said that the idea of Taiwan being taken by force “is (just not) appropriate.” A White House official said later the US position on the “One China” policy had not changed.\n\nWhen he meets Tuesday with leaders of a revitalized “Quad” grouping – the US, Japan, India and Australia – it will be with the tacit intention of countering Beijing’s attempts to expand its influence among its neighbors.\n\nThe economic framework comes with a similar goal. Ever since then-President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TTP) – the massive trade agreement negotiated during the Obama presidency – the US has been without a defined plan to engage this region economically.\n\nMeanwhile, China has secured several trade agreements with its neighbors, and has sought to wield its economic influence globally through the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nThe plan Biden will announce Monday isn’t a trade agreement in the traditional sense. It includes one “pillar” related to trade, but also incorporates other areas like making supply chains more resilient, promoting clean energy and combating corruption.\n\nThe nations participating in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) are Australia, Brunei, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, alongside the US.\n\nThe roster represents a relatively wide swath of Asia, from highly advanced economies like Japan and South Korea to countries that haven’t always aligned with the US on the economic front. But it doesn’t include Taiwan, which had been an open question as Biden was preparing a plan meant to create an economic sphere to counter China’s growing influence in the region.\n\nBy unveiling the framework, Biden appears to be acknowledging he has little intention of rejoining the TPP, which remains unpopular among US lawmakers who would need to ratify the deal. Instead, he hopes to generate an economic sphere that can compete with China.\n\n“I think that the biggest problem with it was that we did not have the support at home to get it through,” US Trade Ambassador Katherine Tai said of the TPP, which was negotiated during the Obama presidency. “I think that there’s a very, very strong lesson there. That TPP as it was envisioned, ultimately, was something that was quite fragile, and that the United States was not able to deliver on and that informs very much our thinking about bringing the Indo-Pacific economic framework, as it’s designed here.”\n\nIt’s unclear whether IPEF will require Congressional approval; Tai said only “Let’s see where these negotiations take us” when asked if lawmakers would need to vote on the framework.\n\nThe Biden administration has worked hard to convince other countries to join – not only staunch partners like Japan and South Korea but smaller nations, particularly in Southeast Asia, who aren’t as closely aligned with the US.\n\nThe plan’s early detractors have suggested it lacks any incentives – like lowering tariffs – in return for joining up. Biden’s aides suggest there are other ways to facilitate more trade and market access, and that the framework itself provides an attractive opportunity for participating countries to work closely with the US. And if anything, Biden’s announcement Monday reflects just the beginning of the process for writing the plan.\n\nAlready, China has responded harshly to the framework, with a senior envoy calling it a “closed and exclusive clique.”\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as Biden was traveling from South Korea to Japan, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the criticism was expected.\n\n“It’s not a surprise to me that China has concerns about the number of countries, the diversity of countries who have expressed interest in and enthusiasm for IPEF,” he said. “It’s natural that they’re going to try to find ways to raise questions.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/21/asia/japan-us-alliance-quad-summit-defense-hnk-dst-intl/index.html", "title": "Japan steps out of US' shadow as China threat grows | CNN", "text": "Tokyo CNN —\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is a man on a mission.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in February, he has imposed sanctions on Moscow, agreed to pursue a nuclear-free world with the Pope and taken a diplomatic tour of Southeast Asia and Europe to rally world leaders to protect democracy.\n\nBut it’s not just democracy in Ukraine that he’s trying to protect – Kishida sees parallels between Russia’s actions in Europe and China’s expansion in the Indo-Pacific, a region stretching from America’s Pacific coastline to the Indian Ocean.\n\n“We strongly oppose any unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force, regardless of the location,” said Kishida, in a joint statement with European Union leaders in May. The same statement included a clause expressing “serious concern about reports of militarization, coercion and intimidation in the South China Sea,” though it didn’t name China as the aggressor.\n\nJapan’s location places it in an increasingly volatile security environment – flanked by China to its south, nuclear-armed North Korea to the west and Russia to its north. As a result, the war in Ukraine has catalyzed debates on Japan’s national security like never before.\n\nIn April, members of the country’s ruling party submitted a proposal to raise the country’s defense budget from 1% to 2% – in line with NATO members – and develop “counter-attack capabilities” – a move that heralds big changes for Japan’s longstanding pacifist security stance.\n\nBut Tokyo is not only investing in its defense, it’s using diplomacy to strengthen its relationships in the region and beyond. Ahead of Kishida’s meeting with United States President Joe Biden on Monday, experts say the world’s third-largest economy is reevaluating its approach to deterrence and showcasing itself as a reliable partner on the world stage.\n\nJapanese PM Fumio Kishida meets Pope Francis at the Vatican. Vatican media/Sipa USA/Reuters\n\nA Japanese invention\n\nJapan floated its idea of an “arc of freedom and prosperity” that would stretch across the Indo-Pacific and draw in the US and Australia more than a decade ago.\n\nIn 2007, then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told Indian lawmakers that a “broader Asia” was beginning to form and implored Delhi to work alongside Tokyo “to nurture and enrich these seas.” It was the start of what would become the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), a loose strategic alliance between the US, Australia, India and Japan.\n\nAbe’s attempts to unite Pacific allies came as China was overtaking Japan as the world’s second-largest economy. Before long, Beijing was promoting its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to develop new trade routes connecting China with the world.\n\nChina claims sovereignty almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea, and has turned multiple reefs and sandbars – far from its shoreline – into man-made artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems.\n\nObservers worried that China’s expansion could eventually allow Beijing to control waterways in the South China Sea, threatening the free flow of trade, so in 2016, Abe upgraded his idea and introduced the concept of the “free and open Indo-Pacific (FOIP).”\n\nUnder FOIP, like-minded countries and organizations across Southeast Asia and Africa would safeguard the Indo-Pacific, and the trillions of dollars of goods that pass through it each year.\n\nCleo Paskal, an Indo-Pacific strategist at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said countries were initially slow to catch on to FOIP. “Many people didn’t think FOIP was even an issue as they assumed the seas would be open and people would be free,” she said. “But now we’re realizing that those two things of being free and open are actually under threat.”\n\nChina’s expansion in the region is expected to be one of the main points of discussion when Quad leaders meet in Tokyo on Tuesday, after Kishida’s bilateral with Biden.\n\nPresident Joe Biden gestures as he boards Air Force One for a trip to South Korea and Japan, May 19, 2022. Evan Vucci/AP\n\nForging a stronger US security pact\n\nJapan’s efforts to unite its democratic allies paid off when the US adopted FOIP in 2017, giving extra clout to the concept along with new resources, programs and partnerships.\n\nBut now analysts say the US expects Japan to take on a stronger leadership role in the region, and Tokyo knows that means it needs to step up its defenses.\n\n“Japan recognizes that if it relies solely on the United States that wouldn’t really sustain the political confidence between the two sides,” said Ken Jimbo, a national security expert and professor at Keio University.\n\nLast December Kishida announced the government was exploring options to give Japan the capability to strike enemy bases. Since then, calls have intensified from within Japan’s ruling party to develop “counterattack capabilities” in coordination with the US. The move would stretch the limits of the country’s pacifist constitution but expand Tokyo’s ability to retaliate against mobile and submarine-launched attacks.\n\n“Japan wants to be able to stand up for itself in a fight. The country has a very strong section of the population who don’t want to be reliant on outside powers in order to be able to make decisions that might or may not risk its sovereignty,” Paskal said.\n\nHowever, there’s resistance within the country to any move away from Japan’s pacifist stance.\n\n“Popular public opinion still views Japan as a pacifist country that shouldn’t have the ability to attack others, it should only have sufficient means in order to defend itself,” said James Brown, an international relations expert at Temple University.\n\n“So that concern has made the government move more slowly on this.”\n\nHowever, the war in Ukraine seems to be shifting attitudes. A recent poll conducted by Asahi Shimbun and the University of Tokyo showed 64% of 3,000 people surveyed were in favor of Japan strengthening its defensive capabilities – the highest percentage since the survey started in 2003.\n\nManaging China’s influence\n\nChina’s support of Russia’s actions in Ukraine has strengthened Kishida’s mission to protect the integrity of the Indo-Pacific. Not only is he reaching out to larger allies in the US and Europe, he’s engaging in diplomacy closer to home to make it clear Japan is a partner that can be relied upon in uncertain times.\n\nIn March, a Japanese delegation visited the Solomon Islands after China and Honiara signed a security pact that some feared could eventually see a Chinese military base in the Pacific. Paskal, the Indo-Pacific analyst, said the diplomatic trip highlights Tokyo’s interest in positioning itself as an alternative security provider.\n\nJapan also wants to offer an alternative to China by showcasing its own quality infrastructure projects, which use local labor, have high-quality controls and don’t leave unsustainable debt burdens in participating countries, said Thomas Wilkins, a senior fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\n\nTokyo’s efforts have not gone unnoticed in Beijing.\n\nDuring a video call with his Japanese counterpart on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that even before Biden’s arrival in Asia, the perception that Japan and the US were united against China “was already rampant” and had created “a foul atmosphere,” according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement.\n\nJapan’s assertive response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is on brand for a country that’s trying to strengthen democratic ties in its own region.\n\nWhen Quad members meet in Tokyo on Tuesday, they’ll be looking to present a united front that fits with Japan’s original vision of the “arc of freedom and prosperity.”\n\nPaskal said in that regard Japan’s leadership in the region was “respected and appreciated.”\n\n“There’s a lot left to be done, but it is moving in a way that many Japan watchers may not have expected even five years ago,” she said.", "authors": ["Emiko Jozuka Blake Essig", "Emiko Jozuka", "Blake Essig"], "publish_date": "2022/05/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/biden-bali-g20-summit-final-day/index.html", "title": "G20 Summit: Biden says allies working in 'total unanimity' after ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS President Joe Biden emerged from an emergency meeting with top allies during his final day at the G20 in Indonesia promising to “figure out exactly what happened” after a Russian-made missile fell inside the borders of a NATO ally.\n\n“We agreed to support Poland’s investigations into the explosion in rural Poland near the Ukrainian border and we’re gonna make sure we figure out exactly what happened,” Biden told reporters following his emergency roundtable with leaders at the G20 Summit.\n\nBiden added, “Then we’re gonna collectively determine next step as we investigate.”\n\nThe president had just exited the meeting in Bali on Wednesday morning local time. The talks came after Poland’s foreign ministry said late Tuesday that the “Russian-made missile” fell on the village of Przewodów. On Wednesday, Polish President Andrzej Duda said that the missile that landed in Poland on Tuesday was “probably an accident” from the Ukrainian side while intercepting incoming Russian missiles.\n\nThe statement appeared to confirm something that Biden alluded to earlier when speaking to the press after being asked if the missile was fired from Russia.\n\n“There is preliminary information that contests that,” he answered.\n\nHe added, “I don’t want to say that until we completely investigate. It’s unlikely in the minds of the trajectory that it was fired from Russia. But we’ll see.”\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry had denied that there were strikes made on targets near the Ukrainian-Polish state border.\n\nBiden and leaders from the G7 and NATO were in the roundtable. The meeting included Biden and leaders from Canada, the European Union, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Netherlands, and Japan, the officials said.\n\nThe president said that there was “total unanimity among folks at the table” about how to respond to the incident. He did not provide other information about the source of the missile.\n\nDuring a call with Duda earlier, Biden “expressed deep condolences for the loss of life in Eastern Poland earlier this evening,” the White House said in a readout.\n\n“President Duda described Poland’s ongoing assessment of the explosion that took place in the eastern part of the country near the border with Ukraine. President Biden offered full US support for and assistance with Poland’s investigation,” the readout continued.\n\nBiden “reaffirmed the United States’ ironclad commitment to NATO” and the leaders agreed to have their teams “remain in close touch to determine appropriate next steps as the investigation proceeds.”\n\nAt the summit, Biden and most G20 members have been slated to sign onto a statement condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine “and the human suffering it has caused both for Ukrainians and for families in the developing world that are facing food and fuel insecurity as a result,” according to a senior administration official previewing the statement. Such an expression of condemnation has been the work of months of diplomacy between G20 leaders. However, it’s not clear yet exactly which countries will sign onto the declaration.\n\nBefore beginning a long journey back to Washington, Biden participated in a mangrove tree planting with other G20 leaders. He also met with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of the United Kingdom for the first time since Sunak took office last month.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz, France's President Emmanuel Macron, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, U.S. President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Netherland's Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and European Council President Charles Michel attend an emergency meeting of global leaders after an alleged Russian missile blast in Poland, in Bali, Indonesia, November 16, 2022.

Truss resigned six weeks into a term that plunged Britain into political and economic turmoil. Sunak is the first person of color and the first Hindu to lead the UK. He is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nSplit screen moment\n\nWhite House officials were expecting a split screen moment this week as Biden met world leaders in Bali at the same moment his predecessor was announcing a third presidential run.\n\nBut the dynamic was amplified as Biden convened the emergency talks at the same hour Trump loyalists filled the Mar-a-Lago ballroom for former President Donald Trump’s announcement.\n\nBiden was leading the crisis talks with members of the G7 and NATO in Bali – two groupings Trump questioned the usefulness of when he was in office.\n\nLess than 10 minutes after he finished speaking to reporters, Trump walked on stage at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHeading into the trip, Biden’s advisers were not particularly concerned about the split-screen and, after Democrats’ better-than-expected midterm elections, were even less wary of Trump announcing a third bid for president while Biden was in Asia.\n\nFor one, Biden officials are happy to take the comparison between the current president and the former on the foreign stage, given the general chaos that often trailed Trump as he traveled abroad.\n\nBiden’s team also believe the president’s newfound acclaim among Democrats compares favorably to Trump’s post-midterms status within the Republican Party — still an evolving picture, but showing signs of erosion.\n\nTrump’s announcement will surely prompt renewed attention on Biden’s on decision-making on running for reelection. By all accounts, including from his closest advisers, Biden will feel more propelled to seek a second term if Trump is in contention.\n\nThroughout the course of his meetings in Asia this week, Biden has been approached by fellow leaders bearing congratulations following the midterm results, a signal the American political contests were being closely monitored by leaders on the opposite side of the world.\n\nIt was a phenomenon that surprised some of his aides, particularly the specificity with which many of the leaders were watching. It was a sign, according to one senior administration official, that the stakes of the midterm elections extended well beyond US borders. Biden himself had framed the contest as putting democracy on the ballot — stakes that leaders in foreign capitals were highly attuned to as they work to determine which way the political winds are blowing in the United States.\n\nAhead of the elections, foreign diplomats posted to Washington traveled the country working to suss out the political temperature, all with the goal of determining whether Trump could be poised for a political comeback.\n\nIf the collection of election deniers and Trump acolytes vying for office amounted to a signal that the former president’s influence was still alive within Republican politics – and that his return to the White House remained a distinct possibility – the widespread rejection of those candidates last week sent an alternate signal abroad.\n\nFor Biden, the timing could not have been more opportune. The prospect of a midterm wipeout loomed over preparations for his around-the-world trip over the last several weeks. Widespread Republican wins – including by election deniers – would badly complicate the president’s bedrock message that Democracies will win out against autocracies.\n\nTrump’s tease of a campaign announcement at the very moment Biden would be rallying the world behind democratic ideals only elevated the stakes.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Maegan Vazquez", "Kevin Liptak", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/politics/joe-biden-g7-summit-day-two-volodymyr-zelensky/index.html", "title": "G7 leaders work to 'starve' Russia of oil money as Zelensky says he ...", "text": "Telfs-Buchen, Austria CNN —\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told G7 leaders during a virtual meeting Monday that he wants the war in Ukraine to end by the end of 2022, according to a source familiar with his remarks, as leaders worked to starve Russia of its oil revenues and mitigate the economic fallout of the conflict.\n\nThe dual missions – sustain support for Ukraine while easing economic pressures at home – have defined this year’s summit of leading democracies, held high in the Bavarian Alps. While largely united, the leaders are all facing their own political imperatives to see a momentum shift in the fighting and bring an end to the conflict quickly.\n\nTo that end, leaders were nearing an agreement to try capping the price of Russian oil, depriving the country of revenues that have soared amid the global spike in energy prices. Details were still being ironed out, including whether the top buyers of Russian oil would agree to the limits, but US officials sounded confident in the prospects of the plan.\n\nAs the war in Ukraine grinds ahead, the question of how to end the conflict has loomed over the talks here. Zelensky’s timeframe, delivered via video conference during a morning session at the Schloss Elmau castle, was as clear a sign as he has given about where he sees the trajectory of the war headed.\n\nA top adviser to President Joe Biden said Zelensky was focused on regaining momentum in Ukraine over the coming months – and not years – when he spoke to leaders.\n\n“Zelensky was very much focused on trying to ensure that Ukraine is in as advantageous a position on the battlefield as possible in the next months as opposed to the next years, because he believes that a grinding conflict is not in the interest of the Ukrainian people,” US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said after the meeting.\n\nThe Ukraine conflict has been at the center of the Group of 7 summit being held inside a century-old mountainside castle in Germany’s Bavaria region. Leaders have decided on new steps to isolate Russia’s economy, including a ban on new imports of Russian gold, and unveiled new sanctions on Monday.\n\nIn a joint statement after their meeting with Zelensky, the leaders pledged to continue supporting Ukraine “for as long as it takes.”\n\nThe United States is expected to announce as soon as this week it’s purchased a new advanced medium-to-long range missile defense system that Ukraine has been requesting, along with new shipments of ammunition and radar systems, as it works to turn the momentum in the war away from Russia, which has been making small gains in the East.\n\nUkraine had requested the system to help sustain its fight against Russia. In a brief glimpse of the leaders’ meeting with Zelensky, the Ukrainian President could be seen on a screen set up in the conference room as the leaders took their seats.\n\nG7 leaders also plan to announce a lengthy set of new sanctions, including on Russian defense supply chains, Russians responsible for human rights abuses and war crimes, private military companies and new visa restrictions on 500 officials. The US will also announce $7.5 billion in new funding for Ukraine, part of a broader commitment from G7 nations to help the country make up its budgetary shortfalls.\n\n“Here at this meeting of the G7, as well as at NATO, we will continue to do, collectively, everything we can to make sure that the Ukrainians have what they need in their hands to repel the Russian aggression,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an exclusive interview with CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\nThere are other important topics on the agenda, including a new effort to counter China’s infrastructure investments in the developing world that have extended Beijing’s influence across the globe.\n\nBut how much longer the Western front can remain united against Russia is the question looming over these talks. The rising cost of energy, fears of global food shortages and the certain inevitability that war fatigue will set in have lent urgency to the discussions about where the conflict goes next.\n\nMeeting his host, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, on Sunday, Biden sought to underscore the importance of sticking together.\n\n“Putin has been counting on, from the beginning, that somehow NATO and the G7 would splinter,” he said. “But we haven’t, and we’re not going to.”\n\nZelensky, who is also planning to address this week’s NATO summit in Madrid, has pressed the West for accelerated sanctions on Moscow and heavy artillery to beat back the Russian invaders.\n\nHis entreaties will become more urgent following Sunday’s missile hits on two residential buildings in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital that had enjoyed relative calm in recent weeks as the fighting moved eastward. Biden condemned the attack as “barbarism.”\n\nYet how much further leaders will be willing to go in applying new sanctions on Russia remains to be seen. High oil prices mean Russia is making more revenue from its energy exports, despite bans in Europe and the United States.\n\nWestern leaders gathering at the G7 have decided to try capping the price of Russian oil, officials say, the latest step toward punishing Moscow while attempting to mitigate the economic effects of the war in Ukraine. How, when and by how much the price of Russian oil will be capped remains to be seen. Officials said the precise mechanism for accomplishing the cap was still being worked out.\n\nHow, when and by how much the price of Russian oil will be capped remains to be seen. Officials said the precise mechanism for accomplishing the cap was still being worked out.\n\nBut leaders will instruct their teams to work urgently toward finding a way to limit the price at which Russia can sell its oil, depriving Moscow of a key revenue source.\n\n“The goal here is to starve Russia, starve Putin of his main source of cash and force down the price of Russian oil to help blunt the impact of Putin’s war at the pump,” said a senior US administration official.\n\nAs oil prices have skyrocketed, Russia’s oil revenues are actually up, despite global import bans.

Issei Kato/Reuters\n\nThe protests grew tense at times, with several loud confrontations and scuffles between demonstrators and police.\n\nAbe’s death sent shock waves through Japan and the international community, with thousands of mourners gathering in Tokyo in July as his private funeral took place. But in the months since his assassination, the outpouring of grief has given way to a growing discontent.\n\nAbe’s state funeral comes as the country grapples with rising inflation and anger stemming from revelations that half of Japan’s ruling party members had ties with the controversial Unification Church which has faced backlash over fundraising practices.\n\nSome critics have also pointed to Abe’s more unpopular policies while in office as a reason for the shift in mood, and questioned why so much taxpayer money is going to the state funeral – which will cost some $12 million (1.66 billion yen) – at a time of acute economic strain.\n\n“It was a tragedy that Abe was gunned down and lost his life, but we shouldn’t make him a hero out of this tragedy,” one protester, Shinsaku Nohira, told CNN at a recent anti-state funeral demonstration outside Japan’s parliament.\n\nPeople gather to mourn Shinzo Abe at a shrine in Osaka City, Japan, on September 27.

The ceremony is not meant to “force people to mourn” or to become a “political issue,” he said in August.\n\nAbe’s tenure and assassination\n\nAbe held office for two separate terms, during which he transformed Japan’s security posture, raising questions over the country’s status as a pacifist nation, and passed a major security legislation in 2015 that expanded what Japan could do militarily to support the US.\n\nHe also was a prominent figure on the world stage, cultivating strong ties with Washington and seeking better relations with Beijing – while also trying to counter Chinese expansion in the region by uniting Pacific allies.\n\nOne of his final successes in office was securing the 2020 Tokyo Olympics – though the Covid-19 pandemic forced the competition to be postponed to 2021.\n\nPeople wait in line to offer flowers at a park near the venue for the state funeral of Shinzo Abe in Tokyo, Japan, on September 27. Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images\n\nAfter stepping down in 2020, citing health reasons, Abe remained active in politics, often campaigning for his party – which is what he was doing at the time of his assassination.\n\nNHK reported in July that the suspected shooter, Tetsuya Yamagami, had targeted the former Prime Minister because he believed Abe’s grandfather – another former Japanese leader – had helped the expansion of a religious group he held a grudge against.\n\nCNN has not been able to independently confirm what group Yamagami was referring to, or links between Abe and any group the suspect harbored hatred towards.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Controversial church under the microscope after assassination 04:14 - Source: CNNI\n\nBut the assassination saw a backlash against the Unification Church, which said Yamagami’s mother had been a member who attended church events, though Yamagami himself was never a member.\n\nIt also said that the church had received a message of support from Abe at an event it organized, but that the former prime minister was not a registered church member, nor did he sit on its advisory board.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Emiko Jozuka", "Jessie Yeung", "Emiko Jozuka"], "publish_date": "2022/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/people/958158/kim-philby-unmasking-the-original-cold-war-double-agent", "title": "Kim Philby: unmasking the original Cold War double agent | The Week", "text": "Kim Philby, Britain’s most infamous spy, could have been unmasked as a double agent years before he fled to the Soviet Union, newly declassified records have revealed.\n\nAccording to files from the National Archive, which have been kept secret for 60 years, Philby confided to the British-Russian social campaigner Flora Solomon in 1938 that he was “100% on the Soviet side”.

Having worked as a journalist for The Times, he eventually joined MI6 and quickly rose through the ranks of the British intelligence service.\n\nWhile working in Washington DC as MI6’s liaison with the CIA and FBI in 1951, two fellow Cambridge spies, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, fled to Moscow, turning the spotlight on to Philby.\n\nHe was interrogated and eventually cleared but in 1955 was publicly accused of being the so-called “Third Man” in the spy ring. In an extraordinary press conference held in his mother’s flat in London, he managed to successfully convince journalists he was innocent.\n\nDespite officially leaving MI6, he resumed life as a double agent while working as a newspaper journalist in Beirut, until he was finally unmasked in 1963.\n\nThe reason he got away with his double life for so long was twofold, said the BBC. “The first was the British class system, which could not accept one of their own was a traitor.” And the second “was the fact that so many in MI6 had so much to lose if he was proven to be a spy”.\n\nSky History said his ability to escape detection for so long was more down to “a mixture of luck and shameless stubbornness”.\n\n“Like other enigmas… the story of a third man with two paymasters and four wives can never be definitively told, the case never closed,” said Jasper Rees in The Telegraph. “Hunting for the real Philby among the false fronts and double lives is like wandering around a maze uncertain if you’re looking for the entrance or the exit. From every new angle glint more questions.”\n\nHow was he eventually unmasked?\n\nBen Macintyre, whose book about Philby’s unmasking has been adapted as the ITV drama A Spy Among Friends, starring Guy Pearce and Damian Lewis, said in The Times that Solomon’s conversation with Victor Rothschild was “the moment that cracked the Philby case”.\n\nFor 24 years she “held tight to one of the greatest secrets of the 20th century: she knew that Kim Philby was a KGB spy”, Macintyre said. “Had she revealed this fact earlier, she might have saved hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives, averted the scandal of the Cambridge spy ring and prevented the collective nervous breakdown that gripped British intelligence when Philby defected to Moscow.”\n\nLong-time colleague and friend Nicholas Elliott was sent to Beirut to confront Philby with Solomon’s evidence and their confrontation is depicted in A Spy Among Friends, with Philby giving everyone the slip before making his way to Moscow.\n\nHe died in Moscow in 1988 just before the collapse of the communist system he had spent his life serving.\n\nWhat was his role in the Cold War?\n\nPhilby was “a crucial point of contact with the CIA, all the while stealing secrets for the KGB”, said Sky History. It is believed he shared tens of thousands of classified documents with his Soviet handlers over the course of his career.\n\nIn 2016, previously unseen footage from 1981 emerged of Philby, by then a retired colonel in the KGB, giving a secret lecture to officers of the Stasi, the East German intelligence service.\n\nIn it he described how he betrayed an operation to secretly send thousands of Albanians back into their country to overthrow the communist regime, “one episode which is usually cited to illustrate the human cost of Philby’s treachery”, said the BBC.\n\nMany were killed directly because of his actions, but in his lecture Philby claims if he had not compromised the operation and it had succeeded, the CIA and MI6 would have tried it again in countries like Bulgaria, eventually leading to all-out war with the Soviet Union.\n\nThe news that Philby had been spying for the Russians “sounded an alarm in Whitehall”, said The Guardian, and “prompted a government campaign to minimise political embarrassment and prevent his memoirs being published”, according to secret files released in 2020.\n\nIt concerned the identity of a fourth member of the Cambridge spy ring, Sir Anthony Blunt, who had been uncovered as a Russian mole in 1964 when he held the role of surveyor of the Queen’s pictures.

And now, more than a decade later, manifesting has become a buzzword among Generation Z, especially TikTok users.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAs of this week, videos with the hashtag “manifestation” had been viewed “a whopping ten billion times” on the social media platform, wrote Helen Rumbelow in The Times. The term “started to spike, from nowhere, on Google Trends in 2018 and Generation Z accelerated it via TikTok throughout 2020”, she continued.\n\nGoogle searches for the term rose by 66% between March and July last year, “mirroring the peak of anxiety about world collapse” as Covid-19 spread across the world.\n\nThe resurgence of manifesting has spawned a new generation of specialist manifestation coaches, “many of whom have no traditional financial advisement background or certifications”, wrote Amelia Harnish in Cosmopolitan magazine. Manifestation courses to teach methods of “meditating and visualising” are big business too, she said.\n\n“The thinking goes, sometimes you have to spend - sometimes a lot - in order to manifest financial security,” Harnish added.\n\nBut while manifesting is becoming increasingly popular, some experts believe the practice causes more harm than good. Psychologists have argued that there is a thin line between thinking positively and being delusional - and that people who rely on the spiritual practice may fail to take concrete steps to achieve their goals as a result.\n\nIn a 2016 article in Psychology Today headlined “The truth about the Law of Attraction: it doesn't exist”, psychology professor Neil Farber also warned that the theory can enforce “blame the victim” beliefs.\n\nA “basic, fundamental” premise of the Law of Attraction is that “the only reason that anything bad could ever happen to you is because you were thinking bad thoughts”, he wrote. “If someone rear-ends you in a car - 100% your fault. If you get breast cancer - 100% your fault (not genetics).”\n\nAlthough “we all know deep inside that this is ridiculous to even suggest”, he continued, the Law of Attraction dictates that “you NEVER attract something you are not thinking about”.\n\nCalifornia-based psychology professor Inna Kanevsky shares these concerns about manifesting, so she was “appalled” when her daughter showed her how such “pseudoscience myths” were spreading on TikTok, wrote Rumbelow in The Times.\n\n“Living in a constant state of crises drives people to reach out for any avenues to control at least something about their lives,” said Kanevsky, who grew up in Russia. “This is very similar to the early Nineties Soviet collapse era that I experienced in my youth, that led to people believing in supernatural healing.”\n\nDespite experts’ many misgivings, advocates of manifesting are continuing to come forward with stories about how the practice allegedly helped them achieve their ambitions. And while Gen Z is driving the trend, people of all ages have been turning to manifesting in recent years.\n\nLucia Craddock, a 39-year-old business consultant from Rayleigh in Essex, told the Daily Mail that she had successfully manifested her “dream man”.\n\n“I wrote down my intentions in July 2015 and, three weeks later, I met my now husband Mark at an art festival,” she explained. “Three months later he moved out to Ibiza to live with me.\n\n“I can only think that it was because I had put so much into these words that the universe was waiting for it, ready on standby, to magic up Mark.”\n\nSuch “positivity is infectious”, wrote Marianne Eloise in Stylist magazine, but “does manifestation work on a scientific level?”\n\n“There is absolutely no solid proof it does,” Eloise concluded.\n\nHowever, she added, “while it’s important to not rely on it entirely or to hand over your life savings to any would-be genie in a bottle, in these uncertain times, maybe anything is worth a try.\n\n“Getting in touch with what you want and believing you are capable of achieving it is, at its heart, really just an exercise in optimism and self-belief, and who doesn’t need that right now?”", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Joel Mathis", "Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Scott Hocker", "Theara Coleman"], "publish_date": "2021/09/29"}]}

Few of these workers had given any thought to unions when they started their jobs at the coffee chain. But now they are at the center of one of the most successful union organizing campaigns to take place in the United States in decades.\n\nNaomi Martinez, 25, of Phoenix, started working at Starbucks two years ago so she could afford to finish school. The company offers tuition support for an online program at Arizona State University.\n\nMichelle Eisen, 39, of Buffalo, New York, is the production stage manager at the local Irish Classical Theatre Company. She joined Starbucks in 2010 because she needed the health insurance.\n\nTori Tambellini, 23, of Pittsburgh, started working at the coffee chain in 2019 because, as a junior in college in her first apartment, she wanted to earn some money to pay the rent — and also to get free coffee.\n\nAnd Nabretta Hardin, 23, of Memphis, said she wanted to work at her local Starbucks because it seemed like the workers there were having a good time interacting with customers.\n\n\n\nFrom left to right: Naomi Martinez, Tori Tambellini, Nabretta Hardin, Michelle Eisen. Naomi Martinez/Melissa Tambellini/Andrea Morales/Libby March/The New York Times/Redux\n\nMartinez, Eisen, Tambellini and Hardin are among the hundreds of Starbucks baristas across the US who have helped organize their fellow workers and make union votes happen.\n\nThe first Starbucks-owned store ever to vote for a union took place less than a year ago, in December 2021, at the location where Eisen worked. Since then workers at 243 other stores spread over 38 states have voted to join Starbucks Workers United — that’s more than five stores a week.\n\nVotes have been held at 25 other stores but the results have yet to be certified by the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that oversees the votes. And 18 additional locations are either in the process of conducting or awaiting votes. So far, the union has had an impressive 83% success rate among stores where votes have been completed.\n\nIt’s been a true grassroots effort, with baristas at each store collecting signatures from their coworkers, pitching them to support the union and responding to the anti-union arguments being made by management.\n\nMartinez, Eisen, Tambellini and Hardin’s efforts have shaken up not only the coffee giant, but they have also inspired workers at other retailers and food services outlets around the country, fueling a surge in union-organizing votes so far this year, including Apple retail stores, Chipotle and Home Depot.\n\n“Winning is contagious,” said Todd Vachon, professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University. “It’s been very visible. It’s geographically diverse. There are shops in very red states, in the North and South, East and West. The pace it’s happening is breakneck. It’s remarkable.”\n\nMembers of the Memphis Seven, including Nabretta Hardin (far left) celebrate a vote to unionize their local Starbucks location in Memphis. Patrick Lantrip/AP\n\nBut by taking a high-profile role in the unionization efforts at Starbucks, the four baristas, along with hundreds of their counterparts who have also been active in the effort, have put their own livelihoods at risk.\n\nEisen has kept her job at the Buffalo store, but Hardin and Tambellini were fired after organizing efforts began, and Martinez says an organizer at her Phoenix store was fired. The union has filed unfair labor practices complaints on their behalf, as well as more than 100 other employees it says were wrongly discharged for their support of the union.\n\n“When they told me I was fired, I was scared about rent and groceries and I had just found out my car needed $900 of work to pass inspection, so I was really worried,” said Tambellini.\n\nMany of the employees who were fired said they had initially thought their strong work records would protect them from being let go even if they were active in supporting the union.\n\n“When I called my mom and told her I was supporting the union, the only thing she had to say was ‘They’re going to fire you,’” said Tambellini. “I said, ‘No way, my manager loves me, I’m award winning.’ So I was surprised how hard the company came down on me.”\n\nHardin and six other union supporters at her Memphis store said they were fired for allowing a television crew working on a story about the organizing effort into the store after closing time.\n\nHardin and several of her fired co-workers in Memphis were recently hired back after Starbucks lost the unfair labor practice case in front of both the NLRB and a federal court. Starbucks defends the firings and said it continues to appeal the decision that forced it to rehire the workers.\n\n“We filed the appeal because these individuals violated numerous policies by failing to maintain a secure work environment and uphold safety important standards,” said the company.\n\nStill, most of the fired workers nationwide remain off the job, including Tambellini. Both Tambellini and Starbucks said her firing came after she was cited for violating attendance rules. She denies she did anything wrong.\n\nMany of the workers have been able to land on their feet. Some have gone to work for the union itself, as paid organizers. Others have found a new job with employers desperate to find help in the current labor market.\n\n“The pizza place next door [to the Starbucks store I worked at] offered me a job almost immediately,” said Tambellini.\n\nStarbucks denies firings were for union activity\n\nStarbucks insists that none of the employees, which it refers to as “partners,” were fired for their union activity, and it continues to fight the cases alleging wrongful discharge before the NLRB or in court.\n\n“No Starbucks partner has been, or will be, disciplined for supporting or engaging in lawful union activity,” the company said in a statement. “But interest in a union does not exempt partners from following policies and procedures that apply to all partners.”\n\nThe company said it respects employees’ right to vote for a union, but believes employees are better off without a “third party” such as a union stepping between management and workers.\n\nDemonstrators protest outside a closed Starbucks location in Seattle in July. David Ryder/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nRichard Bensinger, a former organizing director at the AFL-CIO union federation and an adviser to Starbucks Workers United, said he’s never seen a more anti-union campaign conducted by any company.\n\n“It’s become an epidemic of firing all over the country,” he said. “It’s a targeting of union leaders for the smallest of things, such as violation of dress code. It’s not subtle.”\n\nThe union has also filed complaints about Starbucks stores that were permanently closed after workers there voted for the union or filed for elections. Starbucks said the store closing decisions were made based on safety concerns for employees in the store, not on union activity.\n\nThe union has filed 398 unfair labor practice complaints against Starbucks since the start of the organizing campaign last year, while Starbucks has filed 15 complaints against the union. The NLRB has investigated and has issued 43 complaints of its own, all against the company, covering 141 of the 398 charges filed by the union.\n\nMany of the organizers are young, like Hardin, Tambellini and Martinez, who are in their twenties.\n\n“Their energy and their unwillingness to accept the way things are is why we’re where we’re at,” Eisen said of her colleagues. “The newer generation doesn’t apologize for wanting more, and they’re not asking for permission. They’re just doing it.”\n\nIn the past, most union-organizing efforts were at factories or other businesses where employees intended to spend their careers and wanted to improve jobs they expected to have for decades to come.\n\nStarbucks employees and supporters react as votes are read during a union-election watch party in Buffalo, New York. Joshua Bessex/AP/FILE\n\nBut many of the union leaders at Starbucks, weren’t intending to stay long term. Even Eisen, who has worked for the company for 12 years, had been planning to quit before the organizing effort got underway last year, since the health insurance Starbucks offered no longer provided a level of coverage that made working there worth it to her.\n\n“The health benefits I had come to the company for — costs kept going up and benefits going down. I just didn’t think it was worth it anymore,” she said. “I think when I started there, part of the draw was they did care about their employees and the community. It was the last several years that things really shifted in how they were treating employees.”\n\nBut even though they might not have intended to stay long-term at Starbucks and had never thought about unions before this, they say the Starbucks organizing campaign has become a central part of their lives, and almost a full-time job away from work.\n\n“The movement has literally changed my life,” said Martinez. “I have no intention of leaving my store at the very least until we get a first contract. I want to be involved in how my workplace runs.”\n\nWanting to be involved is a driving force for many of the organizers. They say that beyond wanting to see improvements in pay and benefits, they mostly want a voice on the job, a voice they say can best be achieved with a union.\n\nMoreover, after working through a pandemic, many want rules put in place that will make them feel safe at work. And they want an opportunity to appeal what they say are unfair disciplinary write-ups or firings.\n\nSignificance beyond the campaign numbers\n\nIt might be easy to dismiss what Starbucks Workers United has accomplished: The stores that have voted to join the union represent only about 6,000 of the company’s 235,000 employees at its US company stores.\n\nIn addition, the union has yet to win any contracts for unionized employees. Both the union and management point to one another as the reason that negotiations haven’t progressed, even at the stores that have been organized for months.\n\nBut the movement at Starbucks is an important change for the US labor force, which has seen union membership steadily fall over the last 40 years, from 16.8% of workers at private sector businesses in 1983, the first year the Labor Department started tracking union membership, to only 6.1% in 2021.\n\nWinning elections is hard for unions. Management faces few penalties if it fires employees for their support of a union — they only have to pay back pay, plus some interest, less whatever money the employee earned elsewhere while fired, with no penalties. Companies can close locations that are trying to organize. And they have the ability to require employees to sit through presentations at which they lay out arguments against voting for a union, and to make it difficult for union organizers to contact employees to make their case.\n\nThe difficulty winning union votes is part of the reason so few US workers are represented by unions and the changing nature of the labor force is another. Not nearly as many jobs are in more heavily unionized industries, such as manufacturing or transportation, these days — and the jobs that do exist face more competition from nonunion rivals both here and overseas, leading to job losses at unionized businesses.\n\nMeanwhile retail and food services have become a far bigger share of the US economy, with more than 23 million jobs between them, or nearly twice as many as in US factories. Only 3.2% of retail and food service workers belong to unions.\n\nThe Starbucks organizing campaign may have made only a small dent in that number so far, but it’s an important first step, said Rutgers’ Vachon.\n\n“We’re not a manufacturing economy any longer. We’re a service and knowledge economy. The Starbucks workers are really demonstrating that it’s possible to unionize in an industry where it was thought of as impossible to organize, due to high turnover and a large percentage of young people,” he said. “It turns out having so many young workers was a key to their success. Young people are the demographic that thinks they can change the world.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/business/amazon-starbucks-union-votes/index.html", "title": "Amazon and Starbucks union votes are small wins — but important ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nLabor unions haven’t had this much success in decades.\n\nAfter years of failed organizing efforts and a long, steady decline in the number of private sector workers represented by unions, two grassroots upstart groups have scored recent victories at two of the nation’s largest employers: Amazon and Starbucks.\n\nBoth efforts represent only a tiny fraction of those companies’ total employees. But they also represent a sea change in the mainstream conversation about American labor — and they could inspire more union efforts.\n\n“I think it’s very significant, even though it’s a small percentage of the workforces so far,” said Alexander Colvin, dean of Cornell University’s Industrial and Labor Relations School. “I do think that’s a real shift we’re seeing.”\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board reports that from October 2021 through last month, 1,174 petitions were filed at the agency seeking union representation.That’s up 57% from the same period a year earlier — and the highest level of union organizing in 10 years.\n\nThe Amazon and Starbucks victories are important to union organizing efforts, Colvin said. That sentiment is echoed by Chris Smalls, who went from fired Amazon employee to the the leader of the Amazon Labor Union, which recently became the first union to win a representation vote at one of Amazon’s facilities.\n\nSince that vote at Amazon’s Staten Island, New York, facility where Smalls used to work, he has talked to workers at 50 other Amazon facilities nationwide who want to hold their own union votes. Another vote is scheduled for later this month at a different Staten Island Amazon facility.\n\n“I think what we did … is a catalyst for a revolution with Amazon workers, just like the Starbucks unionizing effort,” he said on an interview on CNN+ last week. “We want to have the same domino effect.”\n\nDomino effect\n\nOver at Starbucks, since December workers at 17 stores from Boston to its hometown of Seattle have voted to be represented by Starbucks Workers United — a separate grassroots union effort that has filed to hold votes at more than 100 additional stores.\n\nStarbucks Workers United partners celebrate a victory after watching the union vote count in Mesa, Arizona. Alexandra Buxbaum/Sipa/AP\n\nStarbucks has about 235,000 workers spread across 9,000 company-operated US stores. Fewer than 1,000 workers at the 17 stores have voted for the union. It’s similar at Amazon, where some 8,300 hourly workers were eligible to vote at the Staten Island facility. That’s not even 1% of the company’s US workforce of 1.1 million employees, including both warehouse and office workers.\n\nBut the votes have grabbed headlines, and the Labor Board figures suggest the efforts Amazon (AMZN) and Starbucks (SBUX) may be inspiring others.\n\nUnion leaders talk of wanting not just better pay and benefits, also but improved job security, staffing levels and workplace safety measures — as well as better working conditions overall and a voice in how workers are treated. Employers generally tend to argue workers are better off with no “third party” standing between workers and management.\n\n“While not all the partners supporting unionization are colluding with outside union forces, the critical point is that I do not believe conflict, division and dissension – which has been a focus of union organizing – benefits Starbucks or our partners,” said CEO Howard Schultz in a message to the company’s employees, who are referred to as “partners,” shortly after reassuming the CEO position at the company.\n\nStill, the efforts seem to be having an effect. Starbucks recently announced it suspended repurchases of its stock, a move that would benefit primarily its shareholders, in order to invest more in its employees. The company also instituted two wage increases in the last 18 months, and in October said it would raise wages to at least $15 an hour for baristas, with most hourly employees earning an average of nearly $17 an hour by this summer.\n\nCovid-era changes\n\nMany of the unions’ demands stem from the difficulties of working during the pandemic during the last two years, said John Logan, professor of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University.\n\n“Part of what’s changed is we’re just in a different moment, [with] frontline workers feeling they were not rewarded or treated with respect during the pandemic,” said Logan. “I think something has really changed in the consciousness of young workers.”\n\nThe very tight labor market — with more job openings than there are job seekers and a record number of workers quitting — is making it easier to organize today, said Colvin. While workers don’t want to lose a job at the company they’re trying to organize, the fact that other jobs are available can make them more willing to take that risk.\n\nA more union-friendly NLRB under the Biden administration is also a factor. Amazon appealed the vote at the Staten Island facility, alleging the labor board acted “unfairly and inappropriately” and delayed investigating what it calls “frivolous” unfair labor practice charges.\n\nIn a statement Kayla Blado, the NLRB’s press secretary, said the board “is an independent federal agency that Congress has charged with enforcing the National Labor Relations Act,” and its enforcement actions against Amazon are “consistent with that.”\n\n“Things are changing for the better for workers. They’ve implemented remedies that make easier to organize,” said Amazon Labor Union president Smalls. “We still have a long way to go.”\n\nPerhaps the biggest potential change under the new, more labor-friendly NRLB is a recent opinion by its general counsel that management should no longer be able to require workers to sit through presentations about the company’s union stance, arguing that doing so violates workers’ right to refrain from organizing-related activities. Such meetings are central to management efforts to defeat union organizing efforts.\n\nSmalls called the compulsory meetings one of the biggest challenges the union faced. “They have 24-hour access to the workers. You can’t compare and compete with that,” he said.\n\nThe opinion doesn’t change current law, which allows for those meetings, although Colvin said it wouldn’t surprise him if the Democrat-controlled NLRB votes to change it. From there, it’s a likely court battle that could go all the way to the US Supreme Court, which has already indicated it is far less supportive of unions.\n\nDecline in union membership\n\nEven with the recent wins for unions, there are numerous long-term trends still in place that have reduced union membership to only 7% of private sector employees over the last 50 years. A main reason is the shift from manufacturing to service-sector jobs like those at Starbucks and Amazon, said Colvin.\n\nOther factors contributing to declining union membership include the rise of nonunion competitors, automation, the building of facilities in less union-friendly Southern states and shifting production overseas.\n\nFinding ways to organize at Amazon and Starbucks and other service sector companies in fields like technology, finance and retail is a key to turning around those long-term trends, experts say.\n\nIt’s an uphill battle for unions to win new members, but that doesn’t mean they can’t succeed, said Erik Loomis, a labor historian and associate professor at the University of Rhode Island.\n\n“Amazon is the GM or the US Steel of our time — and it took decades to organize those places,” he said last month, before the vote results at Amazon were known. “It took many different forms of campaigns led by different ideologies, different modes of organizing … before these kind of companies were finally successfully organized.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Sara O'Brien", "Chris Isidore", "Sara O'Brien"], "publish_date": "2022/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/09/12/nurses-lawsuit-michigan-medicine-strike-vote/1276856002/", "title": "Nurses file lawsuit against U-M in midst of strike vote", "text": "Nurses at Michigan Medicine, the medical arm of the University of Michigan, have filed a federal lawsuit against the university, alleging it isn't letting them wear pro-union buttons and T-shirts.\n\nThe filing comes as the 5,700 union nurses are in the midst of voting on whether to authorize a strike as contract talks between the two sides have stalled.\n\n“Our nurse bargaining team believes it is time to hold management accountable for bad faith bargaining, making changes to our working conditions without any negotiations and discriminating against RNs for exercising our right to free speech,” Megan Duncan, RN, a nurse at the University of Michigan Hospital, said in a news release.\n\nThe nurses also filed four unfair labor practice charges with the Michigan Employment Relations Commission, alleging university officials are violating Michigan labor law, including failure to bargain in good faith; making changes in work shifts without notifying or negotiating with the union; refusing to bargain in good faith over terms and conditions of employment, and discriminating against union members who are engaged in legally protected speech in support of their right to collective bargaining.\n\nAlso at freep.com:\n\nU-M to pay $4.3M penalty in lax opioid handling\n\nList reveals 21 best hospitals in Michigan\n\nU-M must allow cross-examination in assault cases\n\n\"Time and again, university administrators have shown blatant disregard and disrespect for the rights of nurses,\" John Karebian, executive director of the Michigan Nurses Association, said in a news release. \"Anyone who thinks our members can be scared into silence doesn’t know much about nurses or the nursing profession.\"\n\nNot so, said Michigan Medicine spokeswoman Mary Masson.\n\n\"Michigan Medicine is confident all of its efforts in these negotiations have been consistent with the First Amendment and putting our patients first,\" she said in a statement. \"We will vigorously defend the university from this lawsuit that further hinders our ability to reach a contract agreement. We remain opposed to the union's efforts to bring labor negotiations into patient care areas.\n\n\"We stand ready to continue contract talks.\"\n\nThe two largest issues during the contract talks are wages and staffing ratios. On the latter, the union wants U-M to codify in writing the current staffing levels as the minimum levels not to be reduced, according to the unfair labor practice allegation filed by the union.\n\nNurses have been showing up to meetings of the U-M Board of Regents for the past several months to protest the direction of the talks. The nurses will vote until Sunday on whether to authorize a strike against the health system.\n\nMasson said U-M has been fair in its offers.\n\n\"Michigan Medicine has offered the nurses a compensation package that includes competitive across-the-board increases of at least 3 percent and a competitive paid maternal/parental leave program that includes six weeks of paid leave for physiological recovery from birth of a child and six weeks of paid parental leave to employees after a birth, adoption or foster care and guardianship,\" she said. \"(The nurses union) cites safe staffing as one of its most important bargaining issues.

We accomplished this without any contractual requirement to do so because excellent nurse staffing supports excellent patient outcomes. We remain committed to providing this level of staffing.\n\n\"If any of our nurses go out on strike, their absences may put patient safety at serious risk.

The election at the VW plant in Chattanooga is scheduled for April 17-19.\n\nArt Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, in a statement Thursday, highlighted the impact that last year's targeted strike by the UAW against Ford, General Motors and Stellantis has had on the union's organizing in the South.\n\n“There has been more momentum for the UAW in the past year than for the last 10 years.

Kay Ivey on the platform formerly known as Twitter but which is now listed as X.\n\nA news release about the effort at Mercedes-Benz said a supermajority of workers have filed a petition with the NLRB seeking a vote.\n\nOn Friday, NLRB spokesman Matt Hayward said in an email that the petition was filed with the board's Region 10 office in Atlanta to represent about 5,200 full-time and regular part-time production and maintenance employees at plants in Vance and Woodstock, Alabama, noting that a hearing would be held on April 15 if the union and employer do not stipulate to the terms of the union election. The NLRB website indicates that all professional employees, guards, managers and supervisors would be excluded. The facilities are both east of Tuscaloosa.\n\nThe plant in Vance, the automaker's first major such facility built outside Germany, produces a half-dozen models, including the GLE and GLS SUVs, and has 6,100 employees, and the facility in Woodstock is a battery plant, according to the company. It wasn't clear Friday how many workers are located in Woodstock.\n\nThe news release on the unionization effort quoted Moesha Chandler, a Mercedes assembly team member, who said \"we are voting for safer jobs at Mercedes. ... I’m still young, but I’m already having serious problems with my shoulders and hands. When you’re still in your 20s and your body is breaking down, that’s not right. By winning our union, we’ll have the power to make the work safer and more sustainable.”\n\nA UAW video posted on YouTube featured Chandler and other workers along with the theme \"Stand up Mercedes\" and Fain at a rally calling on a crowd to have faith that they can win:\n\n\"Working-class people have the power to change the world. That's what you're fighting for right now. Work-life balance. Good health care that you can afford. A better life for your family. A better life for all of Alabama.\"\n\nThe news release, provided by public relations firm Feldman Strategies, described the effort to date and accused the company of leading an aggressive anti-union campaign, which the company has denied.\n\n\"By late February, less than two months after Mercedes workers went public with their drive to join the UAW, a majority of them had signed union cards. The Mercedes workers hope to be voting in their union election by early May. The NLRB is expected to quickly set the date for the election,\" the release said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the UAW said it filed charges against Mercedes-Benz for violating Germany's new law on global supply chain practices related to actions at the Alabama plant, which is run by one of its subsidiaries. The union said the complaint details how the company \"has intimidated, threatened and even fired Alabama workers in violation of U.S. labor law and International Labour Organization Conventions.\"\n\nThe UAW said the company fired a union supporter with cancer over having his phone with him at work so he could get updates on a scarce chemo drug. The supporter had been allowed to have his phone for that purpose, the union said, but \"a supervisor who has intimidated union supporters claimed there was a zero-tolerance policy on cellphones and had him fired.\"\n\nIn addition, the release described mandatory plant-wide meetings, including one that featured former University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban, which either discouraged unionizing or prevented union supporters from distributing UAW hats.\n\nThe UAW has also filed unfair labor practice charges against the company with the NLRB.\n\nThe email from the NLRB spokesman noted that the board \"has docketed four unfair labor practice charges ... filed by UAW against Mercedes-Benz. The union’s charges, still under investigation, allege that the employer unlawfully fired three employees for engaging in protected activities, imposed discipline on employees for discussing unionization at work, and prohibited the distribution of union materials and paraphernalia.\"\n\nAndrea Berg, a spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz, provided a statement saying the company was declining comment on the complaint when asked about the case in Germany because it hadn't been received.

The action means dealers and customers may soon struggle in the service lane.\n\n\"These are extremely profitable for GM and Stellantis primarily because if you get your vehicle serviced at a dealership, you pay full sticker price for replacement parts,\" said Art Wheaton, director of Labor Studies at Cornell University. \"The dealerships are already struggling to hire enough certified mechanics to fix them and now you’re telling the struggling dealership that they don’t have the parts to fix the cars either.\"\n\nWheaton said dealers and customers will feel this pain.\n\n\"So now you have the end customer screaming at GM,\" he said. \"GM is trying to win the public relations war and they are losing badly.\"\n\nIn a statement, GM said it has contingency plans but did not offer details.\n\nIt also could endanger Michigan's economic future if consumers start buying imports or other nonunion brands such as Tesla and the Detroit automakers can't compete, said Glenn Stevens, executive director of MICHauto and vice president of Automotive and Mobility Initiatives for the Detroit Regional Chamber.\n\n\"The current strike is damaging Michigan companies, communities, and our reputation,\" Stevens said in a statement. \"If this strike continues, and if our companies cannot compete, Michigan’s leadership position, ability to develop and attract talent, and our economy will be at risk.”\n\nThe auto industry is worth more than $300 billion annually to the state of Michigan, Stevens said.\n\nProgress with Ford\n\nThe UAW has been negotiating separately, yet simultaneously, with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis since midsummer. The automakers have each made offers and counteroffers to the union, but no tentative agreement has been reached.\n\nEarlier this week, Fain warned that a second wave of plants could face a strike if the automakers did not make \"substantial progress\" in talks by noon Friday. Fain has complained that the automakers have dragged their feet on making substantive offers since the union presented its list of \"audacious\" demands to them earlier this summer. He said GM and Stellantis only made serious offers after the union filed unfair labor charges against them with the National Labor Relations Board, which is currently investigating the allegations.\n\nBut Fain said in recent days, the union has made some \"real progress\" with Ford, but \"We’re not there yet.\"\n\nStill he said, Ford's latest offer includes:\n\nReinstating the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) to offset increases in inflation over the life of the contract, a provision that the union lost in 2009.\n\nAgreeing the union has a right to strike over any plant closures.\n\nOffering two years pay and health care coverage for laid-off workers.\n\nAgreeing to immediately convert all temporary workers with at least 90 days employment upon ratification.\n\nAgreeing to an enhanced profit-sharing formula that would have resulted in a 13.3% increase for the average employee in payouts last year.\n\n\"I don’t have to tell you that this is an important victory,\" Fain said. “All that represents serious movement on tiers, pay and job security. We want to recognize that Ford is serious about reaching a deal. At GM and Stellantis, it’s a different story.\"\n\nIn a statement to the Detroit Free Press, Ford wrote: \"Ford is working diligently with the UAW to reach a deal that rewards our workforce and enables Ford to invest in a vibrant and growing future. Although we are making progress in some areas, we still have significant gaps to close on the key economic issues. In the end, the issues are interconnected and must work within an overall agreement that supports our mutual success.\"\n\nGM fires back at Fain\n\nFain also said the union has \"won a serious victory\" ending two wage tiers at GM's parts distribution and component holdings facility workers. Those workers would now be on the same wage scale as assembly workers. Tier wages are when workers are paid different amounts for doing similar work. The UAW wants the same pay across all of the automakers’ facilities and jobs.\n\nGM's first offer was a 0% raise for those workers. But without COLA and without strong job security, those gains are not protected, the union said. But the progression to the top wage is still eight years and the union wants to shorten that and boost the top wage, currently $25 an hour, to the same as that in the assembly plants, which is closer to $33.\n\nStellantis has not proposed killing the sub-tier pay for its parts distribution centers, Fain said.\n\nHe said GM and Stellantis are not offering to reinstate COLA, they rejected profit-sharing improvements, job security proposals and converting temporary employees to permanent.\n\nStellantis responded in a statement that it had made significant counterproposals including “a very competitive offer yesterday that includes all our current full-time hourly employees earning between $80,000 and $96,000 a year by the end of the contract (a 21.4% compounded increase. ... And significant product allocation that allows for workforce stability through the end of the contract,” spokeswoman Jodi Tinson said. “And yet, we still have not received a response to that offer. We look forward to the UAW leadership’s productive engagement so that we can bargain in good faith to reach an agreement that will protect the competitiveness of our company and our ability to continue providing good jobs.”\n\nGM provided the following statement in reaction to the expanded strike: \"Today’s strike escalation by the UAW’s top leadership is unnecessary. ... We have contingency plans for various scenarios and are prepared to do what is best for our business, our customers, and our dealers.\"\n\nGM said it had so far presented five separate economic proposals that are \"historic,\" addressing employees' demands while still allowing GM to thrive into the future. It will continue to bargain in good faith with the union to reach an agreement as quickly as possible, the statement said.\n\nIn an op-ed that ran in the Detroit Free Press on Wednesday, GM President Mark Reuss defended GM's most recent offer to the UAW made last Thursday.\n\n\"The record offer we proposed on Sept. 14 recognizes the many contributions our represented team members make to our company — past, present and future,\" Reuss wrote. \"And it addresses, directly, what they’ve told us matters most: wage growth, job security and long-term stability.\"\n\nUAW Vice President Mike Booth wrote an op-ed in response noting that Reuss touted the wages of 85% of GM’s workforce, \"What about the other 15%? We’re fighting for 100% fairness for 100% of our members.\"\n\nFain's invitation to join the picket line\n\nAn audience of about 50,000 tuned in to listen to Fain’s update on the UAW’s Facebook page. He thanked the workers who have been on the picket line since last week for showing \"leadership, courage and creativity on the picket line.\n\n“Reinforcements are coming. As we said for weeks, we’re not going to wait around forever for a contract from the Big Three,\" Fain said. \"We can and we will go all out if our national leadership thinks we can’t move. Right now, we think we can get there. Obviously, Stellantis and GM will need some pushing.”\n\nFain declared a strike as contract talks failed before the current contract expired at 11:59 p.m. Sept. 14. Fain announced the first wave of plants the union would strike as: Ford Michigan Assembly Plant (Final Assembly and Paint only) in Wayne where it builds the Bronco, Stellantis Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio where it builds some Jeep vehicles and GM's Wentzville Assembly where GM makes its midsize Chevrolet and GMC pickups and cargo vans.\n\nAs Fain announced the expansion Friday, he invited anyone who supports the union to join members on the picket line, \"from friends and families all the way up to the president of the United States.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced later that he plans to visit Michigan on Tuesday. Biden has been a staunch supporter of unions and their rights to collectively bargain. Last Friday, Biden said he believed automakers should provide better wages and benefits to the workers.\n\nMore:Auto suppliers say if the UAW strikes more plants, it could mean the end for many\n\nMore:Unifor, UAW chose different bargaining strategies. 1 has a deal.

It also claims the agency delayed investigating what it calls “frivolous” unfair labor practice charges that it says were “exploited” by the union. And it alleges that the agency failed to properly staff the polls during the election, which ultimately “produced chaos and hours-long lines to vote on the first polling day, discouraging other employees from voting.”\n\nAmazon also outlines alleged misconduct on the part of ALU, the grassroots labor organization started by current and former employees of the facility. Among its claims about the ALU, it says the union unlawfully intimidated employees and “threatened violence against its detractors.”\n\nAmazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement Friday: “Based on the evidence we’ve seen so far, as set out in our objections, we believe that the actions of the NLRB and the ALU improperly suppressed and influenced the vote, and we think the election should be conducted again so that a fair and broadly representative vote can be had.”\n\nThe Staten Island election marked the first time a group of US workers have successfully voted to form a union in the company’s 27-year history. On Thursday, Amazon was granted a two-week extension on filing the proof to support its objections.\n\nIn its filing requesting the extension from the NLRB regional director, Amazon noted that the election at the facility “was one of the largest in the Board’s recent history” and said that its “objections are anticipated to be substantial, both in the number … and the scope of the conduct.”\n\nOut of approximately 8,325 eligible voters, 4,785 votes were counted. There were 2,654 votes in favor of unionizing and 2,131 votes against it. Another 67 ballots were challenged and 17 were voided.\n\nThe ALU did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company first indicated last week that it was exploring filing objections over what it claimed was “inappropriate and undue influence” on the part of the NLRB. Kayla Blado, acting director and press secretary for the NLRB, said in a statement to CNN Business last week: “The NLRB is an independent federal agency that Congress has charged with enforcing the National Labor Relations Act. All NLRB enforcement actions against Amazon have been consistent with that Congressional mandate.”\n\nAmazon said last week that it was “disappointed” with the Staten Island results. While Amazon has repeatedly said in statements that its “employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union,” it also spent $4.3 million last year on anti-union consultants and used a combination of texting, on-site signage and mandatory meetings to convince workers to vote against unionizing.\n\nLast Thursday, the same day the public vote count began for the Staten Island election, the ballots of a do-over union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, were also tallied, but the outcome remains too close to call. There are 416 ballots being challenged, which is enough to sway the result. The NLRB is expected to hold a hearing to review the contested ballots in the coming weeks.\n\nIn contrast to the bootstrapped Staten Island effort, the Bessemer drive was done in tandem with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, an 85-year-old labor union. The original election, held a year ago, favored Amazon, but the results were scrapped after an NLRB regional director determined that Amazon illegally interfered, a decision the company called “disappointing.”\n\nThe RWDSU this week filed objections to the do-over election, arguing that Amazon again interfered with its employees right to vote freely in a fair election and it called for the NLRB regional director to hold a hearing to determine if the results should be set aside once more. The RWSDU alleged there were instances of termination and retaliation of union supporters, intimidation and surveillance of employees engaged in organizing activities, and discrepancies with the list of eligible voters provided to the union. The RWSDU also alleged Amazon applied new rules to prohibit organizing, removed pro-union literature, and threatened to close the facility if the union succeeded.\n\n“We’ve said from the beginning that we want our employees’ voices to be heard, and we hope the NLRB counts every valid vote,” said Amazon’s Nantel in a statement about the Bessemer vote.\n\nThe RWDSU previously filed several unfair labor practice complaints over Amazon’s conduct at the facility. One complaint took issue with required group meetings where Amazon representatives conveyed its anti-union stance to workers, which the union argued violated workers’ right to refrain from organizing-related activities.\n\nWhile these required meetings are a common tactic similarly used by a number of other employers and one that is legally permitted, the union asked the NLRB to review the law. On Thursday, NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo issued a memo calling for the agency to reconsider its stance on mandatory meetings of this nature.\n\nAmazon, which previously told CNN Business the RWDSU’s complaint has no merit, declined to comment on Abruzzo’s memo.\n\nThe battle over treatment of workers inside Amazon’s facilities is widely viewed as central to the future of work in the United States. The company is the nation’s second largest private employer and is known for its heavy emphasis on automation and tracking of productivity. Its high turnover rates, on-the-job injuries and increased worker activism, have also drawn significant attention to its workplace conditions in recent years.\n\nIn late May, Amazon shareholders are expected to have the opportunity to vote on a resolution for an independent audit of the company’s warehouse working conditions, according to a Reuters report on Thursday.", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien"], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2023/09/04/labor-day-parade-uaw-fain-delivers-message-of-fair-contract/70761455007/", "title": "UAW's Fain delivers message of fair contract at Labor Day parade", "text": "With a strike deadline looming, UAW President Shawn Fain told a cheering crowd of organized labor workers and supporters Monday at Detroit's annual Labor Day parade that “We are 10 days out and have a lot of work to do.\"\n\n“The UAW is back in the fight and we are ready to stand united to win economic and social justice,” Fain said about ongoing contract negotiations with the Detroit Three\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday at a Labor Day event in Philadelphia, President Joe Biden told reporters that he doesn't expect the UAW to strike any of the Detroit Three auto companies, as discussions intensify among autoworkers, union leaders, auto company executives and investors.\n\n“No, I’m not worried about a strike until it happens. I don’t think it’s going to happen.\" Biden said, when asked about a potential auto strike.\n\nWhen asked about Biden’s comments at Monday’s Labor Day parade, Fain said he was “shocked by that reaction.”\n\n“He must know something we don’t know,” Fain told reporters. “Maybe the companies plan on walking in and giving us our demands the night before.

Our intent is to get a fair agreement. “\n\nLabor Day returns\n\nMonday's event was a return of the annual Labor Day Parade to downtown Detroit after a three-year pandemic hiatus. A message of solidarity, social and economic justice and workers’ rights was loud and clear amid those who marched and chanted.\n\nThis year's theme “Labor United Stronger than Ever!” comes amid current negotiations for a new, four-year contract, with the Detroit Three. The current contract expires at 11:59 p.m. on Sept. 14 and UAW autoworkers have already voted to authorize a strike if an agreement is not reached.\n\nMore:UAW files unfair labor charges against GM and Stellantis; Ford proposal tossed in trash\n\nMore:UAW President Shawn Fain responds to workers worried about pay loss during a strike\n\nThousands of organized labor members took to the streets and center stage in Corktown on Monday, celebrating American workers, solidarity and what they stand for on this Labor Day.\n\nThe parade kicked off at 9 a.m. on a hot, sunny morning starting on Michigan Avenue at Sixth Street. This year, the parade headed west on Michigan Avenue into Corktown instead of the usual trek to downtown Detroit.\n\nAs expected, there was a sea of those wearing red for solidarity, holding signs and chanting. Workers' shirts and placard signs included messages of “End Tiers” referencing the two-tiered pay system, “record profits, record contract” echoed by UAW members as they marched with fellow workers, families and children.\n\nAmong those leading the parade with Fain was Liz Shuler, AFL-CIO president, and U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor.\n\nShuler said the workers are “fired up.\"\n\n“They are fired up, they got us through this pandemic, they sacrificed and now they want their fair share,” Shuler said. “We are seeing it here with the UAW, we are seeing it with bakery workers, nurses and hotel workers all across this country. Working people are on the rise.”\n\nMarching in the parade, Dingell called labor the “backbone of the American economy.”\n\n“What’s going to happen here in the next two weeks is people recognizing that working men and women are the backbone of our economy and they need to be paid a fair and decent wage.”\n\nThe parade was made up of several unions including the UAW, Teamsters, state workers, building trades and others, marched west on Michigan Avenue in Corktown ending at Roosevelt Park with Ford’s Michigan Central Station in the backdrop.\n\nMore than a half dozen elected and union officials took the stage before a cheering crowd delivering messages of support for workers, workers' rights and solidarity. Those speaking included Dingell; Democratic Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist; U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich.; U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Detroit; U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Holly; U.S. Rep.

The last time I had a job not in a union was in high school.”\n\nBob Wydra, a member of UAW Local 1284 at Stellantis’ Chelsea Proving Grounds, has been attending the parade since 2014.\n\n“It’s especially important this year because it’s a contract year and gives us solidarity,” Wydra said. \"It brings people and a sense of cohesiveness, like a pep rally.”\n\nTeamster member and car hauler Darrell Buckner, of Lincoln Park, comes to the parade every year. “It shows solidarity and pride,” he said. His wife, Kirsten, and sons Darrell Jr. and Logan also attended.\n\nMessage to members\n\nFain delivered his much-repeated message that the automakers have seen record profits and workers deserve a fair share of social and economic justice. He noted that included $21 billion in the first six months of this year.\n\n“Our workers deserve their share of equity in this and they are not getting it,” he said.\n\nFain also said that it’s not their intent to strike.\n\n“Our intent is to get a fair agreement,” he said. There are three companies to bargain with and there are 10 days left to do it. “The goal is a fair and equitable agreement for our members.

The reason: the money never came. “That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company… which has been around since my grandfather,” he said.\n\nDonald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will \"protect your job.\" But a USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades — and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them.\n\nAt least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others.\n\nTrump’s companies have also been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. That includes 21 citations against the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and three against the also out-of-business Trump Mortgage LLC in New York. Both cases were resolved by the companies agreeing to pay back wages.\n\nLitigator in chief\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nIn addition to the lawsuits, the review found more than 200 mechanic’s liens — filed by contractors and employees against Trump, his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work — since the 1980s. The liens range from a $75,000 claim by a Plainview, N.Y., air conditioning and heating company to a $1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm. On just one project, Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show that at least 253 subcontractors weren’t paid in full or on time, including workers who installed walls, chandeliers and plumbing.\n\nThe actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years. In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight, or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether.\n\nTrump and his daughter Ivanka, in an interview with USA TODAY, shrugged off the lawsuits and other claims of non-payment. If a company or worker he hires isn’t paid fully, the Trumps said, it’s because The Trump Organization was unhappy with the work.\n\n“Let’s say that they do a job that’s not good, or a job that they didn’t finish, or a job that was way late. I’ll deduct from their contract, absolutely,” Trump said. “That’s what the country should be doing.”\n\nTo be sure, Trump and his companies have prevailed in many legal disputes over missing payments, or reached settlements that cloud the terms reached by the parties.\n\nHowever, the consistent circumstances laid out in those lawsuits and other non-payment claims raise questions about Trump’s judgment as a businessman, and as a potential commander- in- chief. The number of companies and others alleging he hasn’t paid suggests that either his companies have a poor track record hiring workers and assessing contractors, or that Trump businesses renege on contracts, refuse to pay, or consistently attempt to change payment terms after work is complete as is alleged in dozens of court cases.\n\nIn the interview, Trump repeatedly said the cases were “a long time ago.” However, even as he campaigns for the presidency, new cases are continuing. Just last month, Trump Miami Resort Management LLC settled with 48 servers at his Miami golf resort over failing to pay overtime for a special event. The settlements averaged about $800 for each worker and as high as $3,000 for one, according to court records. Some workers put in 20-hour days over the 10-day Passover event at Trump National Doral Miami, the lawsuit contends. Trump’s team initially argued a contractor hired the workers, and he wasn’t responsible, and counter-sued the contractor demanding payment.\n\n“Trump could have settled it right off the bat, but they wanted to fight it out, that’s their M.O.” said Rod Hannah, of Plantation, Fla., the lawyer who represented the workers, who he said are forbidden from talking about the case in public. “They’re known for their aggressiveness, and if you have the money, why not?”\n\nSimilar cases have cropped up with Trump’s facilities in California and New York, where hourly workers, bartenders and wait staff have sued with a range of allegations from not letting workers take breaks to not passing along tips to servers. Trump's company settled the California case, and the New York case is pending.\n\nTrump's Doral golf resort also has been embroiled in recent non-payment claims by two different paint firms, with one case settled and the other pending. Last month, his company’s refusal to pay one Florida painter more than $30,000 for work at Doral led the judge in the case to order foreclosure of the resort if the contractor isn’t paid.\n\nJuan Carlos Enriquez, owner of The Paint Spot, in South Florida, has been waiting more than two years to get paid for his work at the Doral. The Paint Spot first filed a lien against Trump’s course, then filed a lawsuit asking a Florida judge to intervene.\n\nIn courtroom testimony, the manager of the general contractor for the Doral renovation admitted that a decision was made not to pay The Paint Spot because Trump “already paid enough.” As the construction manager spoke, “Trump’s trial attorneys visibly winced, began breathing heavily, and attempted to make eye contact” with the witness, the judge noted in his ruling.\n\nThat, and other evidence, convinced the judge The Paint Spot’s claim was credible. He ordered last month that the Doral resort be foreclosed on, sold, and the proceeds used to pay Enriquez the money he was owed. Trump’s attorneys have since filed a motion to delay the sale, and the contest continues.\n\nEnriquez still hasn’t been paid.\n\nTrump frequently boasts that he will bring jobs back to America, including Tuesday in a primary-election night victory speech at his golf club in suburban New York City. “No matter who you are, we're going to protect your job,” Trump said Tuesday. “Because let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we're babies.”\n\nBut the lawsuits show Trump’s organization wages Goliath vs David legal battles over small amounts of money that are negligible to the billionaire and his executives — but devastating to his much-smaller foes.\n\nIn 2007, for instance, dishwasher Guy Dorcinvil filed a federal lawsuit against Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club resort in Palm Beach, Fla., alleging the club failed to pay time-and-a-half for overtime he worked over three years and the company failed to keep proper time records for employees.\n\nMar-a-Lago LLC agreed to pay Dorcinvil $7,500 to settle the case in 2008. The terms of the settlement agreement includes a standard statement that Mar-a-Lago does not admit fault and forbids Dorcinvil or his lawyers from talking about the case, according to court records.\n\nDevelopers with histories of not paying contractors are a very small minority of the industry, said Colette Nelson, chief advocacy officer of the American Subcontractors Association. But late or missing payments can be devastating for small businesses and their employees.\n\n“Real estate is a tough and aggressive business, but most business people don’t set out to make their money by breaking the companies that they do business with,” she said, stressing she couldn’t speak directly to the specifics of cases in Trump’s record. “But there are a few.”\n\nIn the interview, Trump said that complaints represent a tiny fraction of his business empire and dealings with contractors and employees, insisting all are paid fairly. “We pay everybody what they’re supposed to be paid, and we pay everybody on time,” he said. “And we employ thousands and thousands of people. OK?”\n\nDespite the Trumps’ assertion that his their companies only refuse payment to contractors “when somebody does a bad job,” he has sometimes offered to hire those same contractors again. It’s a puzzling turn of events, since most people who have a poor experience with a contractor, and who refuse to pay and even fight the contractor in court, aren’t likely to offer to rehire them.\n\nNevertheless, such was the case for the Friels. After submitting the final bill for the Plaza casino cabinet-building in 1984, Paul Friel said he got a call asking that his father, Edward, come to the Trump family’s offices at the casino for a meeting. There Edward, and some other contractors, were called in one by one to meet with Donald Trump and his brother, Robert Trump.\n\n“He sat in a room with nine guys,” Paul Friel said. “We found out some of them were carpet guys. Some of them were glass guys. Plumbers. You name it.”\n\nIn the meeting, Donald Trump told his father that the company’s work was inferior, Friel said, even though the general contractor on the casino had approved it. The bottom line, Trump told Edward Friel, was the company wouldn't get the final payment. Then, Friel said Trump added something that struck the family as bizarre. Trump told his dad that he could work on other Trump projects in the future.\n\n“Wait a minute,” Paul Friel said, recalling his family's reaction to his dad’s account of the meeting. “Why would the Trump family want a company who they say their work is inferior to work for them in the future?”\n\nAsked about the meeting this week, Trump said, “Was the work bad? Was it bad work?” And, then, after being told that the general contractor had approved it, Trump added, “Well, see here’s the thing. You’re talking about, what, 30 years ago?”\n\nIvanka Trump added that any number of disputes over late or deficient payments that were found over the past few decades pale in comparison to the thousands of checks Trump companies cut each month.\n\n“We have hundreds of millions of dollars of construction projects underway. And we have, for the most part, exceptional contractors on them who get paid, and get paid quickly,” she said, adding that she doubted any contractor complaining in court or in the press would admit they delivered substandard work. “But it would be irresponsible if my father paid contractors who did lousy work. And he doesn’t do that.”\n\nBut, the Friels’ story is similar to experiences of hundreds of other contractors over the casino-boom decade in Atlantic City. Legal records, New Jersey Casino Control Commission records and contemporaneous local newspaper stories recounted time and again tales about the Trumps paying late or renegotiating deals for dimes on the dollar.\n\nA half-decade after the Friels’ encounter, in 1990, as Trump neared the opening of his third Atlantic City casino, he was once again attempting to pay contractors less than he owed. In casino commission records of an audit, it was revealed that Trump’s companies owed a total of $69.5 million to 253 subcontractors on the Taj Mahal project. Some already had sued Trump, the state audit said; others were negotiating with Trump to try to recover what they could. The companies and their hundreds of workers had installed walls, chandeliers, plumbing, lighting and even the casino’s trademark minarets.\n\nOne of the builders was Marty Rosenberg, vice president of Atlantic Plate Glass Co., who said he was owed about $1.5 million for work at the Taj Mahal. When it became clear Trump was not going to pay in full, Rosenberg took on an informal leadership role, representing about 100 to 150 contractors in negotiations with Trump.\n\nRosenberg’s mission: with Trump offering as little as 30 cents on the dollar to some of the contractors, Rosenberg wanted to get as much as he could for the small businesses, most staffed by younger tradesmen with modest incomes and often families to support.\n\n“Yes, there were a lot of other companies,\" he said of those Trump left waiting to get paid. \"Yes, some did not survive.\"\n\nRosenberg said his company was among the lucky ones. He had to delay paying his own suppliers to the project. The negotiations led to him eventually getting about 70 cents on the dollar for his work, and he was able to pay all of his suppliers in full.\n\nThe analysis of Trump lawsuits also found that professionals, such as real estate agents and lawyers, say he's refused to pay them sizable sums of money. Those cases show that even some loyal employees, those selling his properties and fighting for him in court, are only with him until they’re not.\n\nReal estate broker Rana Williams, who said she had sold hundreds of millions of dollars in Manhattan property for Trump International Realty over more than two decades with the company, sued in 2013 alleging Trump shorted her $735,212 in commissions on deals she brokered from 2009 to 2012. Williams, who managed as many as 16 other sales agents for Trump, said the tycoon and his senior deputies decided to pay her less than her contracted commission rate “based on nothing more than whimsy.”\n\nTrump and Williams settled their case in 2015, and the terms of the deal are confidential, as is the case in dozens of other settlements between plaintiffs and Trump companies.\n\nHowever, Williams' 2014 deposition in the case is not sealed. In her sworn testimony, Williams said the 2013 commission shortage wasn't the only one, and neither was she the only person who didn't get fully paid. “There were instances where a sizable commission would come in and we would be waiting for payment and it wouldn’t come,” she testified. “That was both for myself and for some of the agents.”\n\nAnother broker, Jennifer McGovern, filed a similar lawsuit against the now-defunct Trump Mortgage LLC in 2007, citing a six-figure commission on real-estate sales that she said went unpaid. A judge issued a judgment ordering Trump Mortgage to pay McGovern $298,274.\n\nEven Trump’s own attorneys, on several occasions, sued him over claims of unpaid bills.\n\nOne law firm that fought contractors over payments and other issues for Trump — New York City’s Morrison Cohen LLP — ended up on the other side of a similar battle with the mogul in 2008. Trump didn’t like that its lawyers were using his name in press releases touting its representation of Trump in a lawsuit against a construction contractor that Trump claimed overcharged him for work on a luxury golf club.\n\nAs Trump now turned his ire on his former lawyers, however, Morrison Cohen counter-sued. In court records, the law firm alleged Trump didn’t pay nearly a half million dollars in legal fees. Trump and his ex-lawyers settled their disputes out of court, confidentially, in 2009.\n\nIn 2012, Virginia-based law firm Cook, Heyward, Lee, Hopper & Feehan filed a lawsuit against the Trump Organization for $94,511 for legal fees and costs. The case was eventually settled out of court. But as the case unfolded, court records detail how Trump's senior deputies attacked the attorneys' quality of work in the local and trade press, leading the firm to make claims of defamation that a judge ultimately rejected on free speech grounds.\n\nTrump claims in his presidential personal financial disclosure to be worth $10 billion as a result of his business acumen. Many of the small contractors and individuals who weren’t paid by him haven’t been as fortunate.\n\nEdward Friel, of the Philadelphia cabinetry company allegedly shortchanged for the casino work, hired a lawyer to sue for the money, said his son, Paul Friel. But the attorney advised him that the Trumps would drag the case out in court and legal fees would exceed what they’d recover.\n\nThe unpaid bill took a huge chunk out of the bottom line of the company that Edward ran to take care of his wife and five kids. “The worst part wasn’t dealing with the Trumps,” Paul Friel said. After standing up to Trump, Friel said the family struggled to get other casino work in Atlantic City. “There’s tons of these stories out there,” he said.\n\nThe Edward J. Friel Co. filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 5, 1989.\n\nSays the founder's grandson: “Trump hits everybody.”\n\nContributing: John Kelly, Nick Penzenstadler, Karen Yi, David McKay Wilson\n\nExclusive: Trump's 3,500 lawsuits unprecedented for a presidential nominee\n\nUSA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills\n\nTrump, companies accused of mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes over taxes tied to Trump and his companies\n\nDive into Donald Trump's thousands of lawsuits\n\nTrump casino empire dogged by bad bets in Atlantic City\n\nAs campaign rolls on, so do Trump's lawsuits in Florida\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK is tracking Trump court files\n\nTrump and the Law", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/09"}]}

It’s not the job of corporations to make us more accepting of transgender individuals, any more than it’s their job to warn us about North Korea’s intercontinental-missile programme.\n\nI don’t like the boorish tone of some of the pro-boycott “Bud Lighting” campaigns, said Jonah Goldberg in the Los Angeles Times. But if these rows result in firms stepping back from politics and concentrating on their core mission – building shareholder value – “America will be better for it”.\n\n‘Self-interested decisions’\n\nThe idea that corporations are trying to push US culture in a more progressive direction is misplaced, said Greg Sargent in The Washington Post. These companies are making “self-interested decisions” in response to shifting consumer tastes and needs, as they always have.\n\nMany companies reluctantly backed the civil rights movement in the 1960s, and the gay rights movement in subsequent decades, for the same reason they now back Pride Month and Black Lives Matter: to reach new customers and strengthen the loyalty of their existing base. It’s all about money.

Combs and Cassie settled for an undisclosed amount a day after her filing in New York.\n\nIn March, Homeland Security Investigations raided his homes in Los Angeles and Miami \"as part of an ongoing investigation.\"\n\nThe music mogul, 54, has yet to be charged for any of the alleged crimes, but unnamed sources have told Rolling Stone and CNN that New York and federal investigators are closing in on Combs.\n\nSources told CNN that possible witnesses have been notified that they could be called to testify against Combs in front of a federal grand jury in New York City. Rolling Stone similarly reported a day prior the Southern District of New York has interviewed potential witnesses for sex trafficking and racketeering claims as well as Combs' alleged connections to the Black Mafia Family cartel.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nCombs has denied all accusations against him, although he has since apologized to ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura after a surveillance video obtained by CNN in May depicted him physically assaulting her at a hotel in 2016.\n\nWhile Combs' legal trouble has mounted over the past year, the music mogul has faced a plethora of controversy since Bad Boy Entertainment positioned him as one of the biggest faces in the industry.\n\nHere's a look back at some of Combs' notable history over the past three decades.\n\nJuly 2024: Former Vibe top editor Danyel Smith speaks out about Diddy, Cassie\n\nIn a New York Times Magazine op-ed on July 12, Danyel Smith, the former editor-in-chief of the music magazine Vibe, wrote about an incident in which Diddy threatened to kill her for not showing him the 1997 covers he was set to appear on before publication.\n\nAfter telling Diddy she could not show him the covers before publication, a policy that is typical in journalism, the producer angrily showed up at the Vibe office looking for Smith. Her team hid her, ushering her from room to room. A day later, he called her and told her he would see her \"dead in the trunk of a car.\" She then got her lawyer involved and, hours later, was faxed an apology.\n\nThe long-time journalist also recalled an incident at a restaurant getting dinner with Kim Porter and mutual friends in 1998, when Diddy showed up and yelled at the mother of his then-two children to go home and be with them.\n\nSmith also wrestled with her own assault by an unnamed person who is implied to have been in the music industry. During a brief conversation with Cassie at an Epic Records party in 2015, Smith suggested the \"Me & U\" singer was looking for support amid her own abuse, with Smith noting the conversation came six months before a video showing Diddy kicking and hitting Cassie was captured by security cameras.\n\nJuly 2024: Woman alleges she was sex trafficked at Diddy's 'white parties'\n\nIn a July 3 civil complaint filed in the southern district of New York and obtained by USA TODAY, Adria English alleged she was sex trafficked by Combs and his associates between 2004 and 2009 in New York and Florida.\n\nEnglish, who was a go-go dancer in New York City when she met Combs, claims she agreed to work as \"entertainment\" at his Labor Day \"white parties\" in the Hamptons and later in Miami to help her boyfriend secure modeling work with Sean John. In her lawsuit, she alleges she was \"forced to drink copious amounts of alcohol and consume illicit narcotics\" including ecstasy and eventually was coerced into having sexual intercourse with guests.\n\nEnglish also accused Combs of helping her break into the music industry to \"silence\" her and \"keep her in his sex trafficking organization\" as well as threatening to harm or blackball those who \"did not comply with his demands.\"\n\nIn a statement shared with USA TODAY, Combs' lawyer, Jonathan Davis, wrote: \"No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won't change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone.\n\n\"We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason and without any proof. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth and Mr. Combs is confident he will prevail against these and other baseless claims in court.\"\n\nJune 2024: Former Sean John employees claim Diddy was violent in Daily Beast report\n\nThe Daily Beast reported on June 2 that a few ex-employees of fashion brand Sean John and Blue Flame (Combs' former advertising agency) told the outlet they'd either witnessed or experienced Combs' anger in the workplace.\n\nSeveral of the five anonymous sources who spoke to The Daily Beast claimed Combs fostered a toxic work environment — to the point that Sean John employees allegedly started using the phrase \"catching a brick\" to describe being targeted by the entrepreneur when he'd become angry.\n\nA female former employee alleged Combs once grabbed and squeezed her face after they had a disagreement. Another ex-employee claimed Combs screamed in their face. However, two people who spoke with the outlet said they had no knowledge of these types of incidents.\n\nMay 2024: Ex-Bad Boy employees speak out in Rolling Stone report\n\nA report from Rolling Stone published on May 28 detailed allegations that Combs had a history of violent and dangerous behavior toward women and his employees at Bad Boy Entertainment.\n\nBad Boy co-founder and former president Kirk Burrowes, who was fired in 1997, and another ex-employee claimed they witnessed Combs attack a woman in the office in 1994 and had to tear him off her.\n\nFelicia Newsome, former manager of Bad Boy's recording studio Daddy's House, added that she also had to hold Combs \"by his waist\" as he was about to \"beat this girl\" amid a fight between two women.\n\nIn a statement to Rolling Stone, Combs' attorney Jonathan Davis said, \"Mr. Combs cannot comment on settled litigation, will not comment on pending litigation, and cannot address every allegation picked up by the press from any source, no matter how unreliable. We are aware that the proper authorities are conducting a thorough investigation and therefore have confidence any important issues will be addressed in the proper forum, where the rules distinguish facts from fiction.\"\n\nKeep reading:Former Diddy associates detail alleged history of abuse\n\nMay 2024: Second lawsuit in a week claims Diddy raped college student in '90s\n\nApril Lampros filed a lawsuit on May 23 in New York County Supreme Court accusing Combs of battery and sexual assault stemming from alleged incidents that occurred in the mid-'90s.\n\nShe claims to have met the music mogul in 1994, when she was a college student at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, and that at first he \"love-bombed her\" and \"showered her with gifts and flowers.\"\n\nHowever, her lawsuit states, \"what Mr. Combs displayed as kind gestures quickly manifested into an aggressive, coercive and abusive relationship based on sex.\" She details being raped by Combs in 1995 and 1996 and being sexual assaulted by him inside a car in 1996.\n\nMore about the lawsuit:April Lampros' allegations against Combs\n\nMay 2024: Former model sues Diddy, claiming he drugged, sexually assaulted her in 2003\n\nIn a lawsuit filed May 21 in New York federal court, Crystal McKinney claimed Combs, then 34, assaulted her when she was 22 years old.

It's unclear when they officially split.\n\n1992: Bad Boy Entertainment is born\n\nCombs started out as an intern at Uptown Records, rose to being an A&R and in 1992, he founded Bad Boy Records. The company sold over 500 million records, produced 38 platinum singles and earned multiple Grammy Awards, according to the official website for Combs Global.\n\n\"Ready to Die,\" the 1994 debut album by Combs' friend and artist The Notorious B.I.G., sold 2 million copies by 1995 and went on to be certified six times platinum.

It’s also about its culture and its people, their hopes and their dreams.\n\nOver the last four weeks, this tiny Gulf State truly became a global village. Fans of all 32 teams, along with supporters from many other countries, mingled cheek by jowl in a way that was never possible in previous tournaments, which were spread across much larger geographical areas.\n\nSometimes it was hard to tell who was cheering for who as processions of cheering fans would follow drummers through Souq Waqif, a marketplace in downtown Doha, drunk only on the joy of the shared experience.\n\n“The atmosphere here in Qatar is like a Moroccan wedding,” one supporter told CNN in the thick of the festivities. “When everyone is enjoying the music and singing, it’s like a big party.”\n\nSupporters dance and sing at the Souq Waqif in Doha on November 30, 2022, during the Qatar 2022 World Cup football tournament. Fadel Senna/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMorocco’s thrilling run to the semifinals was a watershed moment for the sport, the first time that a team from outside Europe and South America had made it to the final week in the tournament’s 92-year history.\n\nBut even before the Atlas Lions’ stirring win against Portugal, it was already Africa’s most successful World Cup, as it was for Asia, too, which saw three teams – Japan, South Korea, and Australia – make it to the round of 16 for the first time ever. In 2005, world governing body FIFA ratified Australia’s switch from the Oceania Football Confederation to the Asian Football Confederation.\n\nThere have certainly been matches that will be remembered for years to come.\n\nSaudi Arabia scored a result for the ages, beating Argentina in its opening match, while Iran managed to shine, despite the protests and violence in their homeland with admirable performances against Wales and the US.\n\nFans of Morocco show their support ahead of the third place match against Croatia. Ashraf Amra/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nThis was a tournament in which the underdogs challenged the old-world order, and won universal respect for doing so.\n\nMoroccan supporter Boubker Benna told CNN that he believes the message of this World Cup has been self-determination.\n\n“You may be an underdog,” he said, “but if you do your work, you can achieve big, big things. That’s what [Morocco head coach] Walid Regragui is trying to prove. And that’s what Morocco is trying to prove.”\n\nIt’s not unusual to see African fans rooting for other teams from their continent, but it has been particularly striking to witness the shared joy in Qatar, where CNN spoke to fans from Egypt, Syria, Sudan, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and the Palestinian territories, all cheering for Morocco in the later stages.\n\n“If France is playing, you will find only French people supporting their team, never England or Germany behind them. And I don’t know why,” explained Moroccan fan Adam Marzoug.\n\nA musician from Oman perform traditional music at the Corniche sea promenade in Doha, Qatar, Saturday, Nov. 26, 2022. Francisco Seco/AP\n\nHe continued: “That’s why it’s special for the Arab and Muslim and African countries. That’s what makes us strong in every tournament, this is just the beginning.”\n\nHis friend, Oumaima Amallah, added: “Despite all the political and historical problems, Muslims, Arabs and Africans love each other and they are like brothers and sisters and everyone is happy for us, like they would be happy for their own nation.”\n\nIt was almost poetic that Morocco overturned two of its former colonizers, Spain and Portugal, and went toe-to-toe with a third, France. But any score settling was done politely, with respect.\n\nSupporters who spoke with CNN would always praise Qatar for hosting the World Cup and express gratitude and thanks for bringing it to the region.\n\nAnd although there was surprise, even an outcry in some media establishments, when Budweiser vending stations were removed from the stadium concourses on the eve of the tournament, did anyone really miss the alcohol?\n\nCertainly, many that we spoke to, including the former player turned broadcaster Ally McCoist, agreed that the atmosphere among the crowds was much more congenial as a result.\n\nWe watched security personnel in the stadia respectfully asking shirtless Argentina fans to cover up, humbly gesturing with their palms closed by their chest. Local customs were followed and cultures exchanged. The sea of humanity that flowed from every stadium to Metro station passed by a series of musicians and dancers.\n\nWhat might have once been described as a culture clash felt more like a cultural exchange here in Qatar.\n\n“We must be open minded,” said another Moroccan fan, David Hamriri, an engineer who currently works in Europe. “I am very rich, culturally, because I am open minded.\n\n“We have emotions,” he continued, “We have many conflicts in the world. But when we enjoy football, we forget this problem. We forget the economic crisis, and we return to the origin. A value of humanity, shared between Occidental and Oriental society. I find it amazing.”\n\nFans are seen on the Doha Metro ahead of the match between Argentina and Mexico. Amanda Perobelli/Reuters\n\nThe fans CNN spoke to were leaving Qatar with positive memories of their experiences.\n\nEngland fan Theo Ogden, who attended all of the tournament’s 64 games, told CNN: “People said that you couldn’t host it in the desert, and they proved them wrong.\n\n“They’ve been so welcoming. You won’t find a fan out here who will say that they had a bad time, and it’s because they are so hospitable. I don’t think that gets spoken about enough.”\n\nOgden could only have attempted his feat at this World Cup, where every stadium was just a metro or cab ride away.\n\nThe landmass of the 2026 World Cup will be almost 2,000 times bigger in the USA, Mexico and Canada. Qatar managed to turn the world’s most popular game into something much smaller, and it was all the better for it.\n\nFrom the results on the field, to the experience on the ground. Qatar 2022 has been memorable.\n\nBut we mustn’t forget that there were members of the soccer community who refused to travel here, LGBTQ fans who felt it wasn’t safe for them to support their teams because of the Gulf State’s laws. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar and punishable by up to three years in prison.\n\nLGBTQ rights was an issue that would not go away during the tournament as reports also emerged of security officials asking people to remove rainbow-colored items of clothing – a symbol of LGBTQ pride.\n\nFIFA’s decision to threaten sanctions for any player wearing a “OneLove” armband, which features a heart containing different colors to promote inclusion, created a rift between the sport’s governing body and the seven European nations whose captains had planned to wear it.\n\nLionel Messi holds up the World Cup trophy after Argentina defeated France in the tournament final on Sunday, December 18.

The Blank Slate Monument, created by Ghanaian artist Kwame Akoto-Bamfo, contests the narratives that Civil War memorials present. It is is described as “a reimagining of the American monument; interrogating the traditional white supremacist commemoration of the American Civil War.” A digital sign within the piece allows users to change its message using their phones. “The Civil Rights Memorial Center is honored to bring the Blank Slate Monument to Alabama and specifically Montgomery – a city critical to the civil rights movement and a city continuing to respond to injustices of today,” said Tafeni English, CRMC director. “This monument serves as a reminder of the continued struggle for the liberation of Black people and the importance of preserving the truthful, rich history of Black Americans.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The board tasked with drawing the state’s political boundaries has approved new Alaska Senate districts for the Anchorage area, with two members expressing opposition. The Alaska Redistricting Board adopted the plan, 3-2, on Wednesday, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The board had gone back to work after the state Supreme Court ruled that a Senate district pairing part of east Anchorage and the Eagle River area constituted an “unconstitutional political gerrymander.” The new plan would join part of the Eagle River area with south Anchorage and Girdwood for one Senate district and another part of the Eagle River area to an area that includes a military base for another Senate district. The board’s dissenting members said the plan would improperly give Eagle River greater representation in the Senate. “This is still gerrymandering, just in a different way, in my mind,” board member Melanie Bahnke said. The board had been considering two options to address concerns raised by the court. The other option would have joined the Eagle River area’s two House districts into one Senate district. Two House districts make up one Senate district. If the new plan is upheld, Republican Sens. Lora Reinbold, of Eagle River, and Roger Holland, of Anchorage, would be in the same district.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Prosecutors have asked the state Supreme Court to call off an upcoming hearing scheduled by a lower-court judge to determine the mental fitness of a prisoner to be executed in what would be Arizona’s first use of the death penalty in nearly eight years. Attorney General Mark Brnovich’s office told the state’s highest court in a filing Wednesday that the May 3 mental competency hearing scheduled in Pinal County for death-row prisoner Clarence Dixon is likely to delay his May 11 execution. Dixon was sentenced to death for his murder conviction in the 1977 killing of Arizona State University student Deana Bowdoin. The prosecutors are seeking to throw out the lower court’s order that concluded defense lawyers had shown reasonable grounds for planning a hearing over whether Dixon is psychologically fit. Dixon’s lawyers have said their client erroneously believes he will be executed because police at Northern Arizona University wrongfully arrested him in a previous case – a 1985 attack on a 21-year-old student. His attorneys concede he was in fact lawfully arrested then by Flagstaff police. Dixon was sentenced to life sentences in that case for sexual assault and other convictions. DNA samples taken while he was in prison later linked him to Bowdoin’s killing, which at that point had been unsolved.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: U.S. Sen. John Boozman raised $1.1 million over the past three months for his reelection campaign as he continued to surpass his rivals in fundraising for the Republican primary next month, according to federal fundraising records. Boozman’s campaign reported having $2.5 million on hand at the end of March after spending $2.1 million during the first quarter. Friday was the deadline for candidates to file quarterly fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission. Boozman, first elected to the Senate in 2010, has the endorsement of former President Donald Trump and the state’s top Republicans. Jake Bequette, a former NFL and Arkansas Razorbacks player challenging Boozman, reported raising nearly $344,000 during the quarter and spending almost $200,000. Bequette’s campaign had more than $555,000 on hand. A super PAC supporting Bequette’s bid also spent more than $1.1 million on television ads. Another Senate hopeful, conservative activist and former TV reporter Jan Morgan, raised more than $215,000 during the quarter. Morgan’s campaign spent $221,000 and had $54,751 on hand. Stuttgart pastor Heath Loftis gave his Senate campaign more than $20,000 and raised another $1,100. Loftis had $1,560 on hand.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A spring storm brought several feet of snow to the Sierra Nevada and rain to parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, with more stormy weather expected this week. The seven-day snow total topped 3 feet in some mountain areas as of Saturday, UC Berkeley’s Central Sierra Snow Lab reported. “We’re getting a bit of an abundant April!” the research station in Soda Springs said on Twitter. Mammoth Mountain in the eastern Sierra reported a foot of fresh snow. The resort has said it would remain open to skiing and snowboarding until Memorial Day. Lake Tahoe resorts also reported significant snowfall. Drivers heading up to the mountains were urged to use caution because of slippery conditions. Parts of Northern California including the Bay Area could see pockets of rain for much of the week thanks to an unsettled weather pattern stalling over the region, the National Weather Service said. The welcome precipitation could help slow the start of the fire season but won’t do anything to alleviate the state’s drought, said Matt Mehle with the weather service office in San Francisco. “What this rain is doing is bringing moisture and allowing grasses and finer fuels to grow and green up,” Mehle told the San Francisco Chronicle. “It will alleviate fire concerns, at least for the short term.”\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: A judge ruled Friday that a man charged with killing 10 people at a supermarket last year is still mentally incompetent to stand trial, further delaying court proceedings in the case. But the judge also said that assessment could change soon. Experts at the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo have said there is a substantial probability that Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 22, can be restored to competency within the “reasonable future” and remain competent by taking medications, Judge Ingrid Bakke said during a brief hearing. It is a prognosis she first mentioned in a March 11 scheduling order. The prosecution of Alissa has been on hold since December, when Bakke first ruled he was mentally incompetent – unable to understand legal proceedings and work with his lawyers to defend himself. Alissa is being treated at the state mental hospital and was not in court for Friday’s hearing. The judge set a July 21 hearing to again evaluate Alissa’s competency to stand trial. Bakke’s ruling came nearly a month after Boulder, the home of the University of Colorado, marked the first anniversary of the attack that killed workers, customers and a police officer who rushed inside the store.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones will be getting back the $75,000 in fines he paid to a court for failing to appear at a deposition last month in a lawsuit over his assertions that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax, a judge has ruled. Relatives of some of the 20 children and six educators killed in the 2012 Newtown massacre sued Jones for defamation, saying they have been subjected to harassment and death threats from Jones’ followers. A judge found Jones liable for damages, and a trial on how much he should pay the families is set for August. Judge Barbara Bellis in Waterbury ordered the return of the money Thursday because Jones eventually did show at a rescheduled deposition. The fines, which escalated daily, were aimed at making sure Jones did appear for questioning. Jones said he missed the March 23-24 deposition in Austin, Texas – home to Jones and Infowars – because of a medical problem that included vertigo. He said his doctors first thought it was a serious heart issue, but it later turned out to be a sinus infection. Bellis said there wasn’t enough evidence Jones was too ill to attend the deposition. Jones paid a $25,000 daily fine for April 1 and another $50,000 daily fine for April 4. He then attended a deposition in Bridgeport on April 5-6.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Wilmington University will continue to prioritize science, technology, engineering and mathematics education as the school announced its partnership with Futures First Gaming, which will create degree and certificate pathways for students in the esports and gaming communities. The partnership announced April 11 will provide students with education and training in a variety of areas that pertain to the esports industry. “The agreement between WilmU and FFG leverages the capabilities of both to ensure there’s academic rigor that benefits students with and without esports and game design credentials,” Scott Shaw, assistant professor and academic chair of WilmU’s Game Design program, said in a press release. “There’s so much more to it beyond programming and game design, and this agreement provides pathways to educational credit for skill-building, and opportunities to gain a wider perspective of the industry.” FFG was co-founded in February 2020 by CEO Stephen Sye, who said the company’s goal was to spread the reach of esports, a form of competition using video games, to the state of Delaware.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Fifty years after pandas first took up residence in the nation’s capital, the Smithsonian National Zoo celebrated the “Panda-versary” with its beloved bears Saturday, WUSA-TV reports. Tian Tian, Mei Xiang and their baby Xiao Qi Ji – which means “little miracle” – enjoyed a fruit-and-ice cake as part of the commemoration. The first pair of pandas arrived in D.C. on April 16, 1972, thanks to a deal between first lady Patricia Nixon and the Chinese premier. Since then, the mammals have become the most popular attraction at the Smithsonian National Zoo. Their 50 years have improved relations with China through what’s been called “panda diplomacy,” bolstering conservation efforts and ingraining the bears into Washington’s identity. “For me, the birth of Xiao Qi Ji was pretty spectacular,” said the zoo’s chief curato,r Brian Amaral. “During my entire (five-year) tenure here, we’ve tried to have panda cubs, and for various reasons that we are not sure of, we were not successful, but August of 2020 changed all that, so that was pretty amazing.” In 2021, pandas were downgraded from endangered to vulnerable status by Chinese conservation officials, although they still face many threats, including the threat of climate change to the bamboo forests where they live.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: The 40th anniversary celebration of the Florida Keys’ symbolic secession from the United States, motivated by a 1982 U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint established on the only road connecting the Keys with mainland Florida, has begun in Key West. The 10-day Conch Republic Independence Celebration kicked off Friday with a waterfront ceremony at the island city’s Mallory Square. The offbeat republic was born April 23, 1982, shortly after a Border Patrol checkpoint was erected at the top of the Florida Keys Overseas Highway, the lower end of U.S. Highway 1. Agents ostensibly searched departing cars for drugs and other contraband. The obstacle created a miles­long traffic jam that enraged Keys officials, visitors and residents. After appeals to remove the roadblock were denied by federal officials, Key West’s then-Mayor Dennis Wardlow led local leaders in staging the tongue-in-cheek secession, proclaiming the independent Conch Republic and raising its royal blue flag. “We made the announcement that if we’re going to be treated as a foreign country, then we will become a foreign country,” said Wardlow, who was named the republic’s first “prime minister.” The roadblock was subsequently removed, and the eccentric “nation” is now internationally recognized as the Florida Keys’ irreverent alter ego. “It’s been 40 years, and the people are still supporting the republic,” Wardlow said after Friday’s ceremony. “And the government has not put up any border checkpoints, and they haven’t messed with us.” Festivities will continue through April 24 with events including a pirates’ ball, a wacky drag queen footrace and a sailing regatta that recalls the Keys’ seafaring heritage.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The police chief will retire this summer as the city struggles to tamp down its rising homicide rate and as residents on the north side of the city consider seceding to form their own entity, largely over crime concerns. Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant will retire in June, and a nationwide search for his replacement will be conducted, Mayor Andre Dickens’ office announced Friday. “As Mayor Dickens plans his leadership strategies for this great city, I believe it is essential that he and the city of Atlanta have a Chief of Police who is willing to serve throughout his term,” Bryant said in a statement. When he took office, the mayor said he would assess Bryant’s performance in his first 100 days before deciding whether to keep him long term or search for a new chief, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Dickens said he’s looking for a leader who shares his vision for the city. “I am thankful that the chief agreed to stay on for my first 100 days as Mayor, and I have grown to rely on the Chief’s counsel during our daily meetings,” Dickens said in the statement. “We will miss the Chief’s leadership as he enjoys his well-earned retirement.” Bryant, an Atlanta native, joined the department in 1988 and rose to become a major in 2010 and a deputy chief in 2014. Bryant was named the department’s interim chief in June 2020.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A COVID-19 omicron variant hybrid called XE has been detected in the state, the Hawaii Department of Health said. The department’s laboratories division confirmed one case of XE in its latest coronavirus variant report, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The hybrid contains genetic material from both BA.1 and BA.2 variants. The department found it in a sample collected last month. The XE subvariant is believed to be about 10% more transmissible than BA.2, which itself is about 30% more contagious than the original omicron. It was first detected in the United Kingdom. Infectious disease epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said XE doesn’t appear to have more severe effects than other versions of the virus. A recombinant variant occurs when an individual becomes infected with two or more variants at the same time, resulting in a mixing of their genetic material within the patient’s body, according to the UK Health Security Agency. It’s not unusual for this to happen, the agency said in a news release. XE is a recombinant lineage of BA.1 and BA.2, with the majority of its genome, including the gene encoding for the spike protein, coming from BA.2, the report said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little said Friday that he won’t participate in debates heading into next month’s Republican primary. The first-term governor had been invited to participate in debates put on by Idaho Debates on Idaho Public Television and by KTVB-TV. “Governor Little has a proven track record of cutting red tape, responsibly managing the budget and the economy, and providing Idaho families and businesses with historic tax relief and record investments in schools, roads, water, and other areas,” his campaign said in a statement. “Those historic accomplishments and facts are non-debatable.” Little has drawn several Republican challengers, including far-right Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin. The governor and lieutenant governor run on separate tickets. Little has a significant fundraising advantage, and debating McGeachin in a statewide televised debate could give her a big platform with not much to gain for himself. The two have sparred during the coronavirus pandemic, with McGeachin as acting governor issuing several executive orders while Little was out of town. Little rescinded McGeachin’s orders each time upon his return. McGeachin, who has been endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump, tweeted that Little’s decision wasn’t based on “a scheduling conflict” and said he was “showing his elitist attitude.” After Little’s announcement, Idaho Debates officials said it was unclear if the governor’s debate would be held without Little, and they were conferring with other candidates. They said it was the first time in more than three decades that a sitting governor seeking reelection had declined to participate.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A fire that roared through a prominent church on the South Side was sparked by a propane torch on the building’s roof, the Chicago Fire Department said Saturday. “The CFD Office of Fire Investigation has determined the fire at Antioch Church to be accidental and caused by work being done on the building roof using a propane torch,” the department said on Twitter. The multiple-alarm fire blaze at the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church began after 2 p.m. Friday, an hour after services ended, and wasn’t brought under control for 90 minutes. Exactly three years prior, the famed Notre Dame cathedral in Paris was severely damaged after a fire broke out beneath its roof. “This church is an anchor in this community,” Antioch’s pastor, the Rev. Gerald Dew, told reporters at the scene. “If we’ve got to lose something, losing it on Good Friday is the best time to lose it because after Good Friday comes Resurrection Sunday.” No one appeared to be inside at the time of the fire, Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford said. About 150 firefighters and 50 engines, trucks and ambulances went to the scene, he said. The only reported injury was a firefighter who slipped on the street, injured his ankle and was taken away in an ambulance, Langford said. The South Side church is well-known for its political clout and community involvement, investing in several housing projects starting in the 1960s. It provides over 1,500 units of affordable housing for seniors, the physically handicapped and for families, Dew said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indiana State Fair will celebrate the state’s automotive heritage this year. Fairgoers can expect to see iconic celebrity cars from movies and books and world-class classic car collections showcasing Indiana-made vehicles, the fair announced this past week. During the first decades of the 20th century, more than 250 automobile manufacturers opened in the state, including Duesenberg, Stutz, Cord, Auburn and Studebaker, according to Indiana Landmarks, a historic preservation group. This year’s fair will run from Friday, July 29, through Sunday, Aug. 21. It’s closed Mondays and Tuesdays.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Hundreds of American white pelicans are visiting the Iowa River, delighting the city’s residents with their snowy feathers and prominent yellow bills. “They are a big white bird that from behind looks like a swan,” said Anna Burkhardt-Thomas, the state’s top bird expert within the Iowa Department of Natural Resources wildlife diversity staff. “That really long yellow beak with a pouch for fish is a key feature.” For more than a week, the pelicans have been swimming in and flying around the Iowa River as far south as Terry Trueblood Recreation Area all the way north to the Coralville Lake. Large clusters of the birds loiter south of the dam in downtown Iowa City, where turbulent water stirs up fish. The Cedar Rapids Gazette reports this Midwest spring break is part of the pelicans’ migration from their winter habitat on the Gulf Coast shores to Minnesota or Canada, where they will spend the summer, Burkhardt-Thomas said. But pelicans don’t always come through Iowa in such large numbers, and they don’t always stay so long. “They might stick around longer if they are finding a good food source,” she said. American white pelicans have black flight feathers on the underside of their wings only visible when their wings are open. The birds have a 9-foot wingspan – larger than brown pelicans found near the ocean.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State funds for public schools have been held up as Republican lawmakers push for policies critics say would punish educators for court rulings that forced the GOP-controlled Legislature to boost its spending. A legislative proposal ties $6.4 billion in spending to policies pushed by conservative Republicans, including an “open enrollment” proposal to allow parents to send their children to any public school with enough space. Another provision would restrict surveys of students’ families, their beliefs, mental health, or drug or alcohol abuse. A third would expand a state-funded college scholarship program to students outside Kansas. Republicans drafted the measure before lawmakers began their annual spring break earlier this month, to settle differences between the House and Senate. When legislators reconvene April 25, they must decide whether to add more money for special education programs and whether to link dollars to policy changes. Conservatives argue they are trying to make schools more accountable for how they spend state money. They’ve been linking money to policy since 2014, when the Kansas Supreme Court issued the first of seven rulings in an education funding lawsuit filed against the state by four school districts.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A jury has awarded $450,000 to a man who sued his employer after he asked that it not celebrate his birthday at work, and colleagues did it anyway. Kevin Berling told his manager at Gravity Diagnostics in Covington in 2019 that a birthday celebration would cause him immense stress, citing bad childhood memories surrounding his parents’ divorce. But the company didn’t heed his request, and Berling suffered a panic attack. The next day he had another panic attack when his supervisor chastised him for “stealing his co-workers’ ” joy and “being a little girl,” according to a lawsuit. Berling was fired after the second attack. He alleged in his lawsuit that the company discriminated against him based on a disability and retaliated against him for demanding a reasonable accommodation to it. The jury returned the verdict after a two-day trial in Kenton County that ended in late March. The jury awarded him $300,000 for emotional distress and $150,000 in lost wages. An attorney for the company, Katherine Kennedy, said it continues to deny liability and is pursuing its post-trial options. Brazil said her employees, rather than the plaintiff, were the victims in the case. Berling’s attorney, Tony Bucher, said once the jury got to meet his client, they realized the company’s claim that he posed a threat was far-fetched.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMaurice: A high school senior who lost her best friend in a head-on collision is on a mission to improve safety on Highway 167. Emma Hebert and Ramsie Baumgardner both attended North Vermillion High, and Baumgardner became the third high schooler killed on that highway in the past four years. She was 18. Some sections of the state highway are uneven and unlit. Hebert is one of the people in the Maurice community fighting for change. She joined others at a Vermilion Parish Police Jury meeting in February to discuss adding lights and other ways to increase safety, but she left feeling as if nothing would be done. “I wanted (action), so nobody else has to go through what we went through,” Hebert said. She turned her final paper for her dual-enrollment English class into a persuasive argument to put lights and better signage on the highway. “The lack of lighting and signage on highway 167 makes it perilous, and it is imperative that state and local authorities take action to prevent head-on collisions,” Hebert wrote. She collected police data on highway crashes and learned about the dangers and prevalence of impaired driving. The information fills a large binder, along with more than 1,100 responses to an online survey she posted last month. More than half of those responding identified as 16 to 22 years old. Most were fine with the highway during the day, but a resounding majority said they felt unsafe at night. The main difference is lighting, Herbert said.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: The trail network at Acadia National Park is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The National Park Service said Thursday that the listing recognizes 109 trails that cover 117 miles. The network becomes the largest system of trails listed on the register. The park service said the trail system was recognized because of its historic significance and ties to the history of Mount Desert Island, where the park is located. Kevin Schneider, superintendent of Acadia National Park, said in a statement that the recognition “is a testament to not only the historic significance of these trails, but also the incredible dedication of the National Park Service staff, partners and volunteers who continue to preserve them.” The park service worked for several years to nominate the trails to the register. It was approved last week.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A container ship longer than three football fields has finally been pried from the muddy bottom of the Chesapeake Bay more than a month after it ran aground. After two unsuccessful attempts to dislodge it and the subsequent removal of roughly 500 of the 5,000 containers it was carrying, the Ever Forward was refloated just before 7 a.m. Sunday by two barges and five tugboats. A full moon and high spring tide helped provide a lift to the salvage vessels as they pulled and pushed the massive ship from the mud, across a dredged hole and back into the shipping channel. Once refloated, the Ever Forward was weighed down again by water tanks to ensure safe passage under the Chesapeake Bay Bridge on its way to an anchorage off Annapolis, The Baltimore Sun reports. Marine inspectors will examine the ship’s hull before the Coast Guard allows it to return to the Port of Baltimore to retrieve the offloaded containers. The cargo ship, operated by Taiwan-based Evergreen Marine Corp., was traveling from Baltimore to Norfolk, Virginia, on March 13 when it ran aground just north of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. Officials have said the grounding did not result in reports of injuries, damage or pollution. The Coast Guard has not said what caused the Ever Forward to run aground.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Legislation outlining steps the state needs to take to meet its goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 cleared a key hurdle late Thursday when the Massachusetts Senate voted 37-3 to approve the sweeping climate bill. The bill’s passage sets the stage for negotiations with the House, which last month passed its own, more narrowly focused bill. Both Democratic-led chambers hope to come up with a single compromise proposal to ship to Republican Gov. Charlie Baker before the end for the Legislature’s formal session on July 31. The Senate bill tries to address climate change in three areas: renewable energy, transportation and buildings. The bill would set aside $100 million for an investment fund to support the clean energy industry while updating the process of bringing more offshore wind energy online. It would allow solar panels on agricultural and horticultural land and supporting emerging technologies like nuclear fusion, networked geothermal and deep geothermal energy. It would also increase to $3,500 the rebate for the purchase of many zero-emission passenger cars and light-duty trucks, offer another $1,000 for buyers trading in an internal combustion vehicle, deploy more car charging stations across the state, and require new developments to allocate 10% of parking spaces to charging stations. The bill aims to reduce the use of fossil fuels in the construction of buildings by letting a handful of communities participate in two demonstration projects.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Four Michiganders – a taxidermist, his wife and two mink farm employees – were infected with a unique coronavirus strain connected to minks, leading state health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conclude they likely contracted the first known U.S. cases of so-called animal-to-human virus spillover. Michigan’s four mink-connected COVID-19 cases, the only known animal-to-human cases in the U.S. to date, infected more people than was previously known. The Detroit Free Press and the Documenting COVID-19 project first reported on the mink cases in April 2021, after discovering details about them in Freedom of Information Act requests, and National Geographic confirmed last month that four cases with the same genetic mutations had been linked together. All four people fully recovered. There have been other animal-to-human COVID-19 cases documented with white-tailed deer in Canada and a hamster in Japan. While Michigan’s cases are the only known animal-connected COVID-19 cases in the U.S., there could be other cases that have gone unreported, as the country is not actively testing for such outbreaks.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State corrections officials are looking to launch a prison tattoo program in hopes of curbing bloodborne diseases as inmates ink themselves with homemade tools. The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports the Corrections Department is searching for an experienced tattoo artist to oversee tattoo studios in state prisons. The aim is to slow the spread of diseases like hepatitis C that can spread when inmates try to tattoo themselves or each other with unsterilized tools like electric motors and ballpoint pens and share contaminated needles. Corrections spokesman Nick Kimball said as of January, anywhere from 1,200 to 3,500 of the prison system’s 7,511 inmates were infected with hepatitis C. The prison system treats about 80 to 100 inmates for the disease each at a cost ranging from $20,000 to $75,000 per inmate.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: Technology donations are giving a boost to a nonprofit organization that provides education programs for Hispanic residents. El Centro, in Tupelo, is receiving three years of free internet access and a $50,000 grant from AT&T and 15 computers from Dell Technologies, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports. “It opens up a lot more possibilities for us and for us to be able to tell the community, ‘Whatever you have a need for, we can provide it,’ ” El Centro Director Allen Bradford said Thursday of the donation. El Centro, started in 2006, provides free after-school tutoring and services, adult English classes and workshops on topics relevant to the community. The computers came with a free digital learning platform, free digital literacy courses and workshops created with the Public Library Association. El Centro becomes one of more than 20 Connected Learning Centers that AT&T is opening nationwide. The company created its Connected Learning program in response to COVID-19 and the need to bridge the digital divide, said AT&T Mississippi president Mayo Flynt. El Centro helps K-6 students with homework because it can be difficult for students who grow up in bilingual homes and communities, Bradford said. During the pandemic, some fell behind when learning at home.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence: City Council member Mike Huff is suing to retain his seat after one of the winning candidates died shortly after the election. Huff was one of four candidates who ran for two council seats in the April 5 election. He came in third, behind fellow member Karen DeLuccie and newcomer Jared Fears. DeLuccie died of cancer April 12, the same day the election results were certified. In a lawsuit filed Thursday, Huff said the Jackson County Election Board and the Independence city clerk should not have certified DeLuccie as the winner because she was incapacitated by her illness, The Kansas City Star reports. Huff argues he should be declared the winner of the second at-large seat. DeLuccie’s family said after her death that her lung cancer prognosis in early February was positive. But after a scan April 7, two days after the election, showed that treatments had not worked, she decided to stop treatment and spend time with her family. Sara Zorich, a director at the Jackson County Election Board, said the city will have to decide how to proceed. The City Council is expected to vote this week on whether to hold a special election.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dipped 0.3 percentage points in March to 2.3% as it continued to hit new record lows, Gov. Greg Gianforte said Friday. The number of unemployed people in the state fell to 13,106 – a decline of 1,162 people from February. Montana’s unemployment rate in recent months has been the lowest since records started being kept in 1976. Also in March, the state’s total employment hit a new high at 545,360 workers. That’s up by more than 3,200 workers compared to February. The U.S. unemployment rate was 3.6% in March, down 0.2 percentage points from February’s rate. Inflation has risen 8.5% over the past 12 months, a 40-year high. That’s driven prices sharply higher for purchases including gasoline, airfare, used cars and trucks and fuel oil.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts has signed off on a $900 million property and income tax cut package. Ricketts said the bill will provide nearly $1 billion in annual tax relief once it is fully implemented. The measure will reduce the top individual and corporate income tax rates to 5.84% by 2027. Currently, the highest individual rate is 6.84%, and the top corporate rate is 7.5%. Property owners will also receive a refundable tax credit to reimburse them for some of the taxes they pay to community colleges, and the law will speed up the state’s plan to phase out taxes on Social Security income. That tax will now by eliminated by 2025. Some senators raised concerns how the tax cut will affect the state budget in future years, but lawmakers ultimately passed the package.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A state panel has endorsed an agency’s request for funding to expand Gov. Steve Sisolak’s security team. The Board of Examiners’ vote last Tuesday forwards the Department of Public Safety’s request for $373,051 to the Legislature’s Interim Finance Committee, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The department wants to expand Sisolak’s security detail to eight positions by adding a sergeant and two officers. A department memo cited “various national threat alerts” and referenced two incidents in which Sisolak and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo were separately accosted and verbally attacked in public. “Recently our own state experienced verbal attacks on elected officials in a public place,” the memo said. “A recent assessment of the Dignitary Protection operation by the Capital Police Chief revealed the need for expanding the protective team. With this being an election year, the need for stronger protective services is critical to protect Governor and First Family.” Sisolak, a Democrat, is running for reelection this year, while Lombardo is a candidate for the Republican nomination for governor. The Board of Examiners consists of Sisolak, Attorney General Aaron Ford and Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Some business owners struggling to hire workers are lining up behind Gov. Chris Sununu’s plan to use $100 million in federal funds to increase the state’s housing stock. In the two months since Sununu announced the initiative, the state’s unemployment rate has fallen to 2.5%, while the vacancy rate for a two-bedroom apartment fell to under 1%. That’s been tough on companies like Boyce Highlands, which makes architectural moldings in Concord and recently acquired a lumber company in Brentwood. “Our plan in five years is to double the size of that operation, but with very limited housing, it’s very difficult to attract good quality workers,” co-owner Brien Murphy said at a news conference Wednesday. While New Hampshire is one of the region’s fastest growing states, the lack of affordable housing continues to be an obstacle, said Taylor Caswell, commissioner of the Department of Business and Economic Affairs. Half of the total would go to developers of multifamily projects with at least five units, with preference given to projects aimed at lower- and middle-income workers. Another $40 million would go to towns and cities, including $30 million to encourage them to approve projects quickly. Another $10 million would help communities update zoning regulations or demolish vacant, dilapidated buildings.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Police officers will be allowed to purchase and consume marijuana once it’s officially and legally for sale in the state, just like any other potential customer, under the recreational weed laws passed last year. On Thursday, acting New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin issued a memo alerting police chiefs that law enforcement agencies “may not take any adverse action against any officers because they do or do not use cannabis off duty,” which was codified in the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act. Police officers are barred from possessing or using marijuana while on the clock and from performing any work while under the influence. The marijuana legalization laws allow any employer to maintain a drug-free workplace and puts into place procedures for suspected drug use while on the job. Platkin’s memo reminds police chiefs they have the same rights. But a drug test must accompany a physical examination as well, as THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, can stay in the bloodstream for weeks. A positive drug test could mean the police officer smoked a joint on the way to the station or simply ate a cannabis-infused gummy at an off-duty barbecue a month ago.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: An appeals court on Friday uphold a lower court’s rejection of two ranching groups’ challenge to a federal agency’s designation of certain riparian areas of Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico as critical habitat of a mouse species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2016 designated nearly 22 square miles in the three states as critical habitat of the New Mexico meadow jumping mouse. The decision by a three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a U.S. District Court judge correctly rejected the challenge by two New Mexico ranching groups, the Northern New Mexico Stockman’s Association and the Otero County Cattleman’s Association. Livestock grazing can damage mouse habitat, and its protected status has prompted federal managers in some areas to restrict access to streams and wetlands. The appeals court said the Fish and Wildlife Service complied with legal requirements for assessing economic impacts of critical habitat designation, adequately considered the effects on ranchers’ water rights and “reasonably supported its decision not to exclude certain areas from the critical habitat designation.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The former union boss for the nation’s largest correction officers’ union might have gotten too harsh a prison sentence when he was ordered to spend nearly five years behind bars for corruption convictions, a judge said. U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein, who sentenced Seabrook to four years and 10 months in prison in early 2019, said in a ruling Friday that the length of Norman Seabrook’s prison term deserves a second look. He noted disparities in the sentence given to Seabrook, who is Black, and co-conspirators who are white. But he also said in a written ruling that the former head of the New York City Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association did not deserve a new trial after his 2018 conviction on conspiracy and honest service wire fraud charges. Prosecutors said he accepted $60,000 in bribes in 2014 to funnel $20 million in union funds to a risky hedge fund. All but $1 million was lost. Seabrook has said there was no evidence he ever intended to “lose a dime” of union members’ money. In October 2021, Seabrook asked Hellerstein to grant him a new trial on several grounds including ineffective assistance of counsel and unjust rulings against him, which Hellerstein said in his Friday ruling all fall “well short of the mark.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Three primates suffered frostbite while enduring subfreezing conditions this year at an exotic animal farm operated by a county commissioner that has been repeatedly cited by federal inspectors. The latest citations, involving a black and white ruffed lemur, a De Brazza’s monkey and a capuchin, were issued in March by the U.S. Department of Agriculture against Zootastic Park of Lake Norman, The Charlotte Observer reports. “The lemur’s hand was injured and remains contracted while the De Brazza’s and capuchin suffered the loss of their tail tips,” according to a copy of the federal inspection report, obtained by the animal welfare group PETA. Scottie Brown, the Iredell County commissioner who owns the park outside Charlotte, didn’t reply to a phone message from the newspaper Thursday. In another instance, the inspector saw a young howler monkey “hugging a live electric cord that was connected to a heating pad inside its enclosure.” That could have hurt or killed the monkey, the inspector wrote. The USDA also cited Zootastic for medicating animals without a veterinarian present, allowing visitors unsupervised access to some animals, and failing to document its purchase or disposal of at least a dozen animals, the inspection reports show.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Two North Dakota Army National Guard soldiers are being recognized for saving migrants from drowning at the southern border of the United States last month. Spc. Luis Alvarado, of Bismarck, and Spc. Gracin Clem, of Dickinson, were conducting surveillance for U.S. Customs and Border Protection on March 22 when they observed five migrants attempting to cross the Rio Grande River, the National Guard said. The migrants were halfway across the river but struggled to stay above water due to strong currents and high winds. The two men were equipped with nylon rope lifelines, and Clem swam a line out to help the people that were struggling. The soldiers rescued two people as the other three managed to get to safety. “There wasn’t time to be scared,” Clem said. “It wasn’t an option.” Alvarado and Clem are assigned to the North Dakota National Guard’s 957th Engineer Company and have been part of the southwest border mission since the fall of 2021. “These heroic actions demonstrate the unyielding commitment of our Guard members to preserve lives while in the service of our nation,” said Maj. Gen. Al Dohrmann, North Dakota adjutant general. “Our entire chain of command is extremely proud of the actions of all our soldiers.”\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: Ohio State University will pay $2 million to settle more lawsuits brought by men who said they were sexually abused decades ago by now-deceased team doctor Richard Strauss, increasing the number of survivors who’ve reached settlement agreements to nearly 290. The payouts by the university have now reached just under $60 million to former athletes and other men who alleged Strauss carried out the abuse at campus athletic facilities, a student health center, his home and an off-campus clinic. The latest settlement announced Friday ends lawsuits brought by 57 survivors whose cases had been dismissed by a federal judge who last year ruled that the legal window for such claims had passed. Dozens of men whose cases were dismissed have appealed that decision and have yet to reach settlements. The hundreds of survivors who have sued the university said it failed to stop Strauss despite students raising concerns during his 20 years at Ohio State as far back as the late 1970s. No one has publicly defended Strauss, who died in 2005. Ohio State has said that a law firm investigation for the university and lawsuits filed against the school have revealed more than 170 total instances of rape and more than 2,600 instances of fondling attributed to Strauss.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Republican Scott Pruitt, the scandal-ridden former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, filed Friday to run for Oklahoma’s open U.S. Senate seat, making a return to politics in a state with deep ties to the oil and gas industry. Pruitt, 53, a former Oklahoma attorney general and outspoken supporter of the energy industry, is seeking the seat being vacated by longtime Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe. While Pruitt was attorney general, he filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the agency he was later picked to lead by ex-President Donald Trump. After arriving in Washington, he worked to dismantle Obama-era environmental regulations that aimed to reduce toxic pollution and planet-warming carbon emissions. Pruitt stepped down as EPA administrator in 2018 amid a wave of ethics scandals, including living in a bargain-priced Capitol Hill condo tied to an energy lobbyist. He also faced ethics investigations into pricey trips with first-class airline seats and unusual security spending, including a $43,000 soundproof booth for making private phone calls. And he demanded 24-hour-a-day protection from armed officers, resulting in a swollen 20-member security detail that blew through overtime budgets and racked up expenses of more than $3 million.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Officials at Oregon Health & Science University have apologized to employees after a fake phishing test drew complaints about raising false hopes. The university sent the phishing test email to employees April 12 offering up to $7,500 in financial assistance, Portland TV station KGW8 reports. The email, from a “benefit@ohsu.edu” address, read in part: “In response to the current community hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Oregon Health & Science University has decided to assist all employees in getting through these difficult times.” It included a link where respondents could “register” for pandemic-related benefits. But the offer was not real – it was a test intended to measure employees’ cybersecurity awareness and OHSU’s own technology systems. The test was sent several days after the university sent a message to employees warning them about suspicious emails. The phishing test was met with frustration from some employees. In a statement, OHSU apologized and said the university didn’t fully consider the harm the phishing test could cause. “This week, as part of OHSU’s regular exercises to help members practice spotting suspicious e-mails, the language in the test e-mail was taken verbatim from an actual phishing e-mail to ensure no one else fell for the scam. That was a mistake,” the OHSU statement said. “The real scam was insensitive and exploitive of OHSU members – and the attempt to educate members felt the same way, causing confusion and concern.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: An ad by one of three people seeking the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor this year drew a complaint Friday and a sharply worded letter from the party’s presumed nominee for governor. The dispute pits Attorney General Josh Shapiro against state Rep. Brian Sims over Sims’ ad that the Shapiro campaign says falsely implies Shapiro has endorsed Sims. Shapiro took the unusual step earlier this year of endorsing and running with state Rep. Austin Davis of Allegheny County, even though in Pennsylvania candidates for governor and lieutenant governor are not paired on the primary ballot. So when the Shapiro camp noticed that “ENDORSED JOSH SHAPIRO,” along with a check-marked ribbon, appeared at the end of Sims’ new statewide ad, lawyers fired off a cease-and-desist order. “Not only does the ad mislead voters, it also places Attorney General Shapiro in a false light,” argued Courtney Weisman, a lawyer for Shapiro, in the letter sent Friday. She said Sims’ wording was designed to mislead Pennsylvanians. The ad began running on streaming services in markets around Pennsylvania this past week, Sims’ spokesperson said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state Department of Environmental Management plans to hire somebody who can recruit hunters and trappers, including women and people from minority communities. “We’re hiring! DEM’s Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) is looking for an innovative self-starter with a strong human dimensions background to coordinate the state’s efforts to recruit, retain and reactivate (R3) outdoor enthusiasts, specifically hunters, trappers and shooting sportsmen and women,” the department said in a Facebook post. The job, which pays $71,487 for a 35-hour workweek, is consistent with a wider effort to encourage those outdoor sports. License fees for those activities and taxes on equipment help pay for wildlife management and land conservation, but Rhode Island and other states across the nation are seeing a drop in hunting, according to the DEM. “We’ve seen a tremendous decline in the number of people who participate in hunting,” said David Kalb, supervising wildlife biologist for the DEM’s Division of Fish and Wildlife. For example, Kalb said, the state sold 8,800 hunting licenses last year, a sizable drop from the peak of 11,600 in 2000. Revenue has decreased along with the drop in license sales, Kalb said, although he couldn’t immediately attach a dollar figure to it.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A prisoner scheduled to be the first man executed in the state in more than a decade has decided to die by firing squad rather than in the electric chair later this month, according to court documents filed Friday. Richard Bernard Moore, 57, is the also first South Carolina prisoner to face the choice of execution methods after a law went into effect last year making electrocution the default and giving inmates the option to face three prison workers with rifles instead. Moore has spent more than two decades on death row after being convicted of the 1999 killing of convenience store clerk James Mahoney in Spartanburg. If executed as scheduled April 29, he would be the first person put to death in the state since 2011 and the fourth in the country to die by firing squad in nearly half a century. Only three executions in the United States have been carried out by firing squad since 1976, according to the Washington-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. South Carolina is one of eight states to still use the electric chair and one of four to allow a firing squad, according to the center. In a statement, Moore said he didn’t concede that either method was legal or constitutional but more strongly opposed death by electrocution and only chose the firing squad because he was required to make a choice.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBrookings: Rural communities are more vulnerable to economic effects from major historical events like the COVID-19 pandemic and recessions than urban communities, according to two local students’ research. Brookings High School seniors Will Hummel and Aditya Tummala will present their study, “The Disproportionate Effect of Labor Force Exodus on Rural America: A Study on the Implications of Pandemic-Era Recessions on Rural Midwest Communities,” next month at the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair in Atlanta. The May 8-13 fair is the world’s largest international pre-college science competition, hosting more than 1,500 high school students from 75 countries to share science projects of their own design. It will be the third time at the fair for Hummel and fourth time for Tummala, but it’s their first time together as a team. They also took this project to the Eastern South Dakota Science & Engineering Fair at South Dakota State University on March 22, securing the first grand prize award, earning them an all-expense-paid trip to the international fair. Hummel said because rural communities tend to base their economies on things like agriculture, mining or harvesting raw materials, like soybeans and corn, and then shipping those materials out, it leaves them more vulnerable to economic events.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State lawmakers are advancing a bill strictly limiting the shackling of pregnant inmates. The Republican-led Senate passed the legislation by Democratic Sen. Raumesh Akbari without opposition Thursday. The bill would generally prohibit restraints of a pregnant inmate. More specifically, a pregnant inmate’s ankles, legs or waist couldn’t be shackled during labor or delivery. The legislation also would not allow a pregnant inmate to be shackled behind the back or to be attached to another inmate. Some exceptions allowing restraints on a pregnant inmate would be when the inmate is moved within or outside of a facility, if the inmate is an immediate flight risk, if the inmate poses a self-threat or threat to the fetus or others, or if the classification level of the inmate requires restraints. In those cases, the bill says only the least restrictive restraints necessary should be used. The legislation still needs a vote from the House.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday repealed his traffic-clogging immigration order that backed up commercial trucks at the U.S.-Mexico border, after a week of intensifying backlash and fears of deepening economic losses. The Republican governor dropped his new rules that had required all commercial trucks from Mexico to undergo extra inspections to curb the flow of migrants and drugs and ratcheted up a fight with the Biden administration over immigration policy. Some truckers reported waiting more than 30 hours to cross. Others blocked one of the world’s busiest trade bridges in protest. Abbott, who is up for reelection in November and has made the border his top issue, fully lifted the inspections after reaching agreements with neighboring Mexican states that he said outline new commitments to border security. The last was signed with the governor of Tamaulipas, who earlier in the week said the inspections were overzealous and created havoc. On Friday, he joined Abbott and said they were ready to work together. Pressure was building on Abbott to retreat as gridlock on the border worsened. The American Trucking Association called the inspections “wholly flawed, redundant and adding considerable weight on an already strained supply chain.” One customs agency in Mexico estimated the losses at millions of dollars a day, and produce distributors warned of empty shelves and higher prices if the order was not rescinded soon.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: U.S. Sen. Mike Lee worked on early efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, helping to push legally dubious schemes to keep then-President Donald Trump in power, before he shifted course and quickly backed away. His efforts, revealed in text messages obtained by the House panel investigating the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, drew quick condemnation Friday from his reelection challengers. Text messages between the Utah senator and then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows detail how Lee encouraged top Trump advisers to embrace Sidney Powell, a Republican lawyer who later spread wild and baseless claims of a rigged election. The messages from Lee to Meadows – and messages from Texas U.S. Rep. Chip Roy to Meadows – were reported on and published Friday by CNN. They show Lee’s efforts to assist Trump began Nov. 7 and included early support for Powell. Later, Lee explored a plan to encourage state legislatures to alter the outcome of the 2020 election by appointing alternate electors. At one point, Lee said he was working “14 hour days” assisting Trump. At another he asked Meadows: “Please tell me what I should be saying.” By mid-November, the messages show Lee beginning to lose confidence in Powell and, eventually, the alternate electors plan.\n\nVermont\n\nEssex Junction: After 50 years of helping to teach local students how to drive, a local high school’s driver’s education simulators have been put “out to pasture.” John Dunn posted pictures of the simulators languishing outside Essex High School in a Burlington Area History Facebook group last month and was flooded with comments from people who used the machines in school. The simulators, put into use in 1972 and taken out in 2022, were not just the only ones in Vermont – they were the oldest ones of their kind in use anywhere, according to Bill Mayville, who first used one as an EHS student in 1973 and then returned to the school to teach driver’s education for the next 39 years. The simulators were his main teaching tool. “I was sad to see them go, but I knew they were going to go,” he said. When the school first received the 12 simulators, “it was a big deal,” Mayville said. More were planned to come to the state, and Essex even had a driver’s education course planned for a field near the school. But the Nixon-era funds were frozen, according to Mayville, and Essex remained the only program in the state to have the simulators. Vermont State Police also trained on them, and they were used as an evaluation tool for teens with special needs or older adults to determine if they were capable of driving. One was handicap-equipped with full hand controls.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Virginia Commonwealth University has received nearly $1 million in federal funds to study gun violence in the city as it experiences a spike in homicides. The money comes from the Omnibus Appropriations Agreement for the 2022 fiscal year approved by Congress this month, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. VCU’s project, the RVA Gun Violence Prevention Framework, aims to create a public health response to addressing the social, economic and systemic factors that lead to gun violence. The project is led by school representatives, VCU Health and the city of Richmond. Last year, Mayor Levar Stoney called gun violence a public health crisis, and the city allocated $133,000 toward the initiative. There were 101 slayings in the city last year, the most since 2004. Most involved guns. Richmond police classified 93 of the killings as homicides. In addition to intentional gun deaths, VCU Health reported last summer that it had seen a surprisingly high number of gun accidents. VCU also received $400,000 for a program seeking to support recruitment and training efforts of early childhood educators across central Virginia.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: A hovering arctic jet stream has brought biting cold, snow, rain and hail that is concerning growers across central Washington’s Yakima Valley. Grower Mike Saunders with Apple King–Pro Orchard Management said orchards were laden with snow Wednesday, an unusual sight, the Yakima Herald-Republic reports. Freezing temperatures began early last week with another cold snap expected this week. Growers have been using wind machines and smudge pots to warm the apple, pear and cherry orchards. Washington State Tree Fruit Association spokesperson Tim Kovis said the trees there are in bloom, but the cold is keeping the bees from pollinating, which is the biggest concern. “This is the window that is essential for the bees to be out in the orchards and pollinating those buds for the growing process,” he said. He said it’s still too early to assess the impact and said growers will know more this week. Not all orchards in the state are in the same dilemma, though they are facing freezing temperatures, Kovis said. Chelan, for example, has had snow, but fruit trees there have yet to bud, he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFairmont: Most of the protesters arrested at a power plant linked to U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin have settled trespassing cases. Twelve of the 16 protesters arrested last weekend at the Grant Town Power Plant in Marion County settled cases Friday, the activist group West Virginia Rising said. All 16 were arrested April 9 for trespassing after forming a human chain, The Dominion Post reports. The protest attracted about 200 people to call attention to the plant’s burning of low-grade coal, which emits more pollution. Manchin’s son runs the plant and burns the low-grade coal sold by Enersystems, the senator’s company. Manchin, Democrat, is chairman of the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Among the protesters last week was J. Davitt McAteer, the former mine safety chief in the Clinton administration. McAteer said Manchin “appears to be contributing mightily to the problem (of coal pollution) while reaping untold benefits,” he said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay: The state Department of Natural Resources is ending its practice of posting volunteer guards along the Wolf River to protect spawning sturgeon from poachers. WLUK-TV reports Sturgeon for Tomorrow has been posting guards along the river around the clock each spring for decades in coordination with the DNR to protect the fish. DNR Regional Conservation Warden Ben Treml said there have been no major complaints or poaching cases for at least 15 years, and coordinating the volunteers is a lot of work, with notable difficulty in finding people willing to work overnight. He added that no volunteers have patrolled the river for the past two years during the pandemic. Jim Patt, president of the southwest chapter of Sturgeon for Tomorrow, said he’s not happy with the DNR’s decision. No one knows how much poaching is really going on, he said, and if word gets around that the guards aren’t on the river, any more poaching could increase.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: The West’s oldest horse-drawn parade might become a relic after two years of pandemic-related cancellations. The Old West Days Parade drew just 22 entrants in 2019, when it was last held, and the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce is now trying to decide whether to bring the Memorial Day season event back, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The chamber is asking members of the ranching community to speak up if they want to keep the tradition going, according to the paper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/05/27/homeless-rerouted-safe-margaritaville-summer-camps-cancel-news-around-states/111867810/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Some Alabama residents spent the holiday weekend struggling to claim their weekly unemployment benefits. The Alabama Department of Labor told local news outlets that about 53,000 people were blocked from filing the required weekly report telling state government that they still don’t have a job. Only then will another week’s worth of unemployment benefits will be issued. The department said Monday that it had resolved the problems. Although many Alabama residents went to lakes or Gulf of Mexico beaches for the Memorial Day holiday, others watched programs commemorating war dead online as many in-person ceremonies were canceled. New rules from Gov. Kay Ivey went into effect at 5 p.m. Friday allowing entertainment venues like bowling alleys, arcades and theaters, as well as child care facilities, to reopen subject to social-distancing and sanitation rules. Youth sports practices also have been allowed to resume, though competition won’t begin until June 15, and summer camps are now allowed to open.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Juneau Assembly could approve more than $1 million in funds to help licensed child care providers whose businesses have been hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. The assembly plans to vote on an emergency measure during a special meeting scheduled for Thursday, KTOO-FM reported Saturday. The vote would commit federal relief funds for distribution to child care providers beginning in June. The program would initially give licensed providers up to $500 per child each month, about half of what they would usually receive in tuition if they were at capacity. The subsidy would decrease to $250 per full-time enrolled child in September. The federal funding will last until year’s end. Funding for a nonemergency, child care stipend program is in the city’s proposed budget. Before the pandemic, city officials identified a lack of affordable child care as a factor keeping new parents from working and hindering the economy. When COVID-19 health restrictions mandates took effect in March, Juneau child care centers with long waiting lists were forced to close. Day care facilities have started reopening as the state relaxes health mandates. The businesses are expected to adopt new practices to reduce the risk of spreading the virus, including decreased enrollment, although the change does not benefit their financial health.\n\nArizona\n\nKayenta:Although the Navajo Nation recently surpassed New York to have the highest COVID-19 infection rate in the country, President Jonathan Nez said Monday “the curve is flattening on the Navajo Nation.” As of Monday, the Navajo Nation had 4,794 cases of COVID-19 and the number of deaths associated with the disease reached 157. Nearly 1,500 people have recovered from the virus, according to updated numbers from the Navajo Department of Health. “The Navajo Nation continues to test at a higher rate per capita than any state in the country,” Nez said in a statement, adding that 14.6% of citizens have been tested. Meanwhile, 2.3% of the population in Arizona has been tested, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. “Testing, contact tracing, and the public health orders that were implemented months ago requiring protective masks in public and weekend lockdowns are working and flattening the curve,” Nez said. “The numbers are high, but it’s great to see that overall the rate of new cases is flattening, so let’s keep up the good practices and continue to pray for everyone,” Vice President Myron Lizer said in the statement.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge has eased some petition rules for an Arkansas group trying to get a redistricting measure on the ballot, but declined to delay the deadline for submitting the petitions because of the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge P.K. Holmes on Monday issued a preliminary injunction preventing the state from enforcing on the redistricting group a requirement that signatures on petitions be witnessed in person. Holmes also blocked a requirement that canvassers sign an affidavit in the presence of a notary. Holmes, however, declined to push back the state’s July 3 deadline for submitting petitions by a month or to allow the use of electronic signatures. The group, Arkansas Voters First, sued the state last month and said the pandemic has made it nearly impossible to collect the 89,151 signatures from registered voters needed to qualify for the November election. The group’s proposed constitutional amendment would put a nine-member commission in charge of redrawing congressional and legislative districts\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Mendocino County public health officials said Sunday that six more people who participated in a Mother’s Day service at Assembly of God Church in Redwood Valley contracted the new coronavirus, raising the number of cases to nine and making the outbreak responsible for a third of local infections. Meanwhile, Butte County health officials said two of 180 people who attended a Mother’s Day church service in Oroville have tested positive for COVID-19. They said a recent spike in local cases, mostly in the Oroville area, indicate increased community spread. Some places of worship across the country opened their doors over the weekend after President Donald Trump declared such places essential and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released guidelines for reopening faith organizations. Gov. Gavin Newsom has taken a more cautious approach: Last week, many counties in California had received approval to reopen businesses, including retail shops and restaurants as permitted in the second phase of his plan to restart the state economy. Churches are not allowed to reopen until the plan’s third phase. The approach has angered opponents who claim that California’s rules to stop the spread of the virus violate religious freedoms. Many had announced they would violate the state order and hold in-person services next Sunday. A Pentecostal church in San Diego sued to reopen immediately, but lost its appeal on Friday when the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Newsom’s ban on in-person services. In a split ruling, a court panel found that government’s emergency powers override what in normal times would be fundamental constitutional rights.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver:Restaurants in Colorado can reopen at reduced capacity this week and day camps will be allowed to open next week, Gov. Jared Polis said Monday. Restaurants in spots like El Paso and Routt counties have been allowed to reopen under special approvals by state health officials. Restaurants elsewhere in Colorado will be able open starting Wednesday at 50% of their posted occupancy limit but cannot have more than 50 customers at a time, Polis said. “Diners will have more space between tables and at many restaurants, more opportunities to eat outside. The safest thing anyone can do is stay home whenever possible, but for those who want to shop and dine we want to make sure it can be done as safely as possible,” he said. Polis said children’s day camps and youth sports camps will be able to open on June 1 but residential overnight camps would be closed through June.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Coronavirus hospitalizations in Connecticut increased slightly on Sunday, with five new admissions making for a total of 706, according to state data released Monday. The state reported 49 new deaths from the disease on Sunday and 405 new positive tests. All three numbers are still far below peak levels reached in mid-April. In all, more than 40,800 people in Connecticut have tested positive for COVID-19 and 3,742 have died. The state on Monday closed several parks to additional traffic for the Memorial Day holiday because parking lots had reached capacity under social distancing guidelines. They included Sleeping Giant State Park in Hamden, Paugussett State Forest in Newtown and Wadsworth Falls State Park in Middletown.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Gov. John Carney has lifted Delaware’s temporary ban on short-term rentals and the requirement for out-of-state travelers to quarantine for 14 days. Outdoor gatherings of up to 250 people, including weddings and ceremonies, will also be allowed in the coming week, the governor said Tuesday. Cloth face coverings must be worn and people must stand 6 feet apart. These are the latest restrictions the governor has eased up on as Delaware plans to restart parts of its economy in the coming week. Like the reopening of restaurants and businesses, these latest announcements take effect June 1. Carney will also lift the state’s stay-at-home order on June 1, though he cautioned people in a news release to “continue to avoid unnecessary outings and gatherings to limit community spread of COVID-19.” Organizers who want to hold a large, outdoor event can apply by submitting a plan to Delaware Division of Small Business at least seven days before the event. Delaware beaches and boardwalks fully reopened for Memorial Day weekend, the unofficial start of summer. At the time, only Delawareans and nonresidents who completed the mandatory quarantine were allowed to take advantage of the sandy beaches.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:As the city looks to begin its initial phase of reopening Friday, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the addition of two new testing sites in the District, WUSA-TV reported. A new testing site on 2241 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave. in Southeast will replace United Medical Center’s testing site as an accessible alternative. And a new walk-up testing site on 5th Street Northwest between F and G streets will begin operating June 1. Although data showed a spike in cases last weekend, the city has seen 13 days of sustained decline. Bowser said if the trend continues, the District could report 14 days of decline Wednesday. The city will then provide the next steps for its initial phase of reopening. The District will continue to follow the science and reopen when data show the city can, Bowser said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee:With customers losing jobs and employees facing health threats, Gulf Power saw a drop in payments for electric service in April as it also spent money to try to prevent the spread of COVID-19, a regulatory filing showed. Gulf, the largest utility in Northwest Florida, said it received about $6 million less in customer bill payments in April than it ordinarily would have collected during the month. About $2.1 million is considered “bad debt,” up from the historical average for April of about $300,000, the company said Friday in the filing at the Florida Public Service Commission. Gulf, like other utilities in the state and country, suspended electric-service disconnections in March as the pandemic caused businesses to shut down or scale back and unemployment to skyrocket. But the filing offers a glimpse of how the economic problems have played out in electric service, something that affects most Florida residents and businesses. It also raises the possibility that Gulf could try to recoup the money when it seeks revised base electric rates, a process that is expected to start in 2021. The filing Friday dealt with an accounting process for bad debt and COVID-19 expenses of the utility.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Georgia Army National Guard continued a recent string of honorary flyovers Monday, with two featuring UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, one in metro Atlanta and one in coastal and southwest Georgia. The formations hovered over sites with military significance, as well as large hospitals that have been treating people with COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus. “We will pause for a few moments this day to recognize the sacrifice of our service members and our families,” Maj. Gen. Tom Carden said. “It is part of our culture to remember and to honor, and it is going to take more than a global pandemic to change that part of us.” Over the holiday weekend, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources continued to report that it was limiting entrance at some state parks to reduce crowding and possible disease transmission. Local parks and beaches also reported a crowded weekend. The throngs had fallen slightly at Tybee Island, where bumper-to-bumper traffic was reported entering the island for the long weekend. WTOC-TV reported 11,000 cars entered the island Friday, and more than 13,000 on Saturday. Some drivers reported spending an hour trying to find a parking spot.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The University of Hawaii said the SAT and ACT will be optional for applicants for the fall 2021 semester as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The exemption for the two standardized entrance exams is only for students applying to enter the university for the 2021-22 academic year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Monday. Applicants to the University of Hawaii-Manoa campus can still submit standardized test scores if they desire. The University of Hawaii-Hilo and University of Hawaii-West Oahu do not rely on the SAT or ACT as major criteria for admission. University of Hawaii community colleges do not require the tests for admission. The College Board testing organization canceled SAT exams scheduled for May and June, when many high school juniors would usually take the test.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Ramping up COVID-19 testing and tracing is key to Idaho’s containment strategy, Gov. Brad Little said Friday, as authorities said they hope to be consistently testing 2% of the state’s population in the coming months. “The whole goal of this is to scale up testing with tracing where we can do what Idaho likes to do in a good fire season, and that is get on those fires early and put them out,” Little said at a news conference where a task force released recommendations for expanding testing in the state. The state has in the past weeks struggled to increase testing. Elke Shaw-Telloch, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare administrator for public health, said federal officials recommend testing 2% of the population each month. She said Idaho has been sent 40,000 swabs and other testing materials for May, and it expects the same amount in June. Shaw-Telloch said the state public health lab can run 200 COVID-19 tests a day, and the Veterans Administration can accommodate non VA-patient testing for urgent cases. And she said the Federal Emergency Management Agency has helped deploy point-of-care testing units in Idaho to every health district in the state.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The chief judge of federal courts in Northern Illinois said things will look “quite different” as some operations resume at courthouses in Chicago and Rockford. Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer said in a video message released Monday that a task force has been planning for how courts can proceed safely during the coronavirus pandemic. Federal courthouses have been largely empty since mid-March. One emergency judge has been on duty at the Dirksen Federal Building in downtown Chicago each day, but most court proceedings have been conducted by paper filings, telephone or video. Under a court order, most hearings were rescheduled for after June 1 and trials were ordered rescheduled for June 29 or later. Pallmeyer said in her video message that the task force has been working with public health officials to determine the safest way to screen visitors entering the courthouse, sanitize facilities and resume jury trials. She didn’t say when jury trials will resume, but said the focus will be on scheduling criminal trials that have been delayed the longest amount of time. Pallmeyer said emergency judges have handled over 500 motions since the pandemic started in Illinois. Since March 18, attorneys have filed more than 7,200 motions, judges have entered 34,200 orders and more than 1,350 new civil cases have been filed, she said.\n\nIndiana\n\nTerre Haute: Three inmates have tested positive for COVID-19 at the federal prison complex in Terre Haute, according to the federal government. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons’ coronavirus website showed that as of Monday, three inmates but no staffers have tested positive for COVID-19 at the U.S. Penitentiary, which is the maximum security prison at the Federal Correctional Complex. That website showed that no deaths from the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus have occurred at the western Indiana prisons complex that’s located about 70 miles west of Indianapolis, the Tribune-Star reported. Nationwide, the website showed that there have been 59 federal inmate deaths but no prison staff member deaths attributed to COVID-19 disease. But 1,556 federal inmates and 175 Bureau of Prisons staffers have confirmed positive test results for COVID-19, according to the website. As of Monday, 3,144 inmates and 414 staff have recovered from the virus. The Bureau of Prisons has 136,968 federal inmates in Bureau of Prisons-managed institutions and 12,109 in community-based facilities. The federal agency has about 36,000 staff members.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Gov. Kim Reynolds said Tuesday she will lift a moratorium on evictions and allow gatherings of more than 10 people to resume as she continues to ease restrictions meant to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. Reynolds also said she would also allow casinos, amusement parks, speedways, arcades and bowling alleys to reopen in the coming days. Large gatherings for social functions and sports competitions will also be allowed to resume, she said. Advocates for low-income tenants have warned that scores of tenants who have lost income during the pandemic could soon face eviction. The American Civil Liberties Union and several other groups had asked the governor to extend the moratorium of eviction proceedings for nonpayment of rent that she imposed on March 19. Some landlords, however, had reported that they were struggling financially as renters stopped paying amid skyrocketing levels of unemployment. Reynolds said Tuesday the moratorium was a temporary public health measure designed to keep people in their homes. She said the Iowa Finance Authority would announce the details of a new federally-funded program this week to prevent evictions and foreclosures, including the eligibility criteria to receive assistance.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Dr. Lee Norman, Secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, urged Kansans who joined large gatherings at Missouri’s Lake of the Ozarks during the Memorial Day weekend to self-quarantine for 14 days to prevent spreading the new coronavirus. Social media posts showed large crowds at pools, bars and restaurants near the lake without any social distancing or masks. “The reckless behavior displayed during this weekend risks setting our community back substantially for the progress we’ve already made in slowing the spread of COVID-19,” Norman said. “If you traveled to Lake of the Ozarks over the weekend, we urge you to act responsibly and self-quarantine to protect your neighbors, coworkers and family.” Officials in Kansas City and St. Louis have also urged residents who were at the gatherings to self-quarantine for 14 days. St. Louis County Executive Sam Page asked the county’s health department to issue a travel advisory for the lake, which draws thousands of visitors every summer.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The University of Kentucky will use portions of its contingency fund to save nearly 100 school jobs in the next fiscal year amid continuing furloughs at the school, the university’s president said in a news release. The announcement came as 100 additional academic employees were furloughed Friday, about a month after the university furloughed nearly 1,700 academic and UK HealthCare employees because of revenue shortfalls related to the coronavirus outbreak. Many of the 700 furloughed health care workers have returned to work as the number of patients going to the hospital system has increased, the news release said. The money in the contingency fund largely came from savings the school made after it cut back on employee’s retirement funds, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported. According to the news outlet, school officials continue to predict a $70 million shortfall for the budget beginning in July, largely because of a drop in enrollment. Graduate students who work at the university will not lose their jobs because of budget cuts, according to the release. The school will also portion off $250,000 from the student emergency fund specifically for graduate students.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: City officials are sounding the alarm after data from neighborhood testing showed that the city’s Hispanic community is being disproportionately infected with the new coronavirus. The city’s health director, Jennifer Avegno, said that officials had analyzed the roughly 5,000 tests that had been done at testing sites in recent weeks in partnership with Louisiana State University and LCMC Health. They found that about 3% of blacks and whites who got tested were positive for the virus. But of Hispanics who got tested, more than 20% were positive. They compared their data with other groups such as Ochsner, which had started a mobile testing site and found that they were seeing similar results. Avegno said so far the death rate doesn’t mirror the infection rate, but she’s concerned that the data they’re seeing within the Hispanic community might be the beginning of a greater problem.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Some summer camps have decided to cancel their seasons, but others are finding a way to operate under new rules designed to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, a newspaper reported Tuesday. Day camps for Maine children are allowed to open June 1, and overnight camps can open on July 1. Out-of-state campers are required to quarantine, the Portland Press Herald reported. So far, about 14 camps decided to cancel their seasons after seeing the new guidelines or in anticipation of them, Ron Hall, executive director of Maine Summer Camps, told the newspaper. The state has about 270 summer camps. The guidelines for overnight camps would limit the size of gatherings, segregate campers into groups and require health screenings. Slovenski Camps in Raymond will operate under the guidelines, even though the camp will take on debt to do so, said owner Peter Slovenski. “The economics of it will lead us into debt, but we don’t think of it as reopening the economy. We think of it as reopening life,” said Slovenski. “We’ll open, and do the best we can to help the children of Maine reopen their lives.”\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:Photos of a crowded boardwalk in Ocean City fueled conversation throughout the holiday weekend during a time where gatherings of more than 10 people or dining in a restaurant are not permitted. The scene did not elicit praise from Delaware Gov. John Carney. “That looks to me like not the way to do things,” Carney said. “What I saw in Rehoboth, and what I heard is the situation along the Delaware coast, is the way to do it.” Carney was likely referring to the decision to open Delaware beaches and community pools under “strict” social distancing guidelines, starting May 22. In past weeks, Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan’s hope for transition was instead met with crowds. The weekend of May 16-17, when Cruisin week would have been held, still drew car enthusiasts and motorists. That was also the first weekend lodging was reopened by the mayor. Social media posts showed burnouts and other reckless behavior by drivers. Maryland had a 14-day quarantine request for out-of-stater travelers when it was under a stay-at-home order. Gov. Larry Hogan switched to a safer-at-home model May 15. In Ocean City, Meehan said police would not monitor license plates or enforce travel restrictions. Maryland State Police only enforced the stay-at-home order when conducting other business.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The EcoTarium, a science and nature museum in Worcester that closed to the public in March in response to the coronavirus pandemic, is planning to reopen on a limited basis next month. The museum is reopening June 4 only to visitors who purchase tickets in advance, the museum announced Monday on its website. No tickets will be sold to walk-up visitors. Only the paths and trails, ponds and wildlife habitats will be open at first. Buildings, except for the bathrooms, will remain closed. All guests will be required to wear a face mask while on the premises, unless it is medically impossible. The museum will hold an opening for members only on May 30-31.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A group organizing a ballot drive to add LGBT anti-discrimination protections to Michigan’s civil rights law sued the state Tuesday, saying coronavirus restrictions made it impossible to collect the 340,000 voter signatures needed. Fair and Equal Michigan and two Democratic legislators filed the lawsuit in the state Court of Claims. It seeks an injunction reducing the signature requirement to roughly 127,000 signatures. The suit also challenges deadlines by which signatures must be submitted and asks that signatures that have been collected be able to count in future elections. If the ballot committee is successful, the initiated bill would go to lawmakers and, because the Republican-led Legislature would likely not act, to a public vote in November. The proposal would update the law to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations. Religion-based discrimination, which already is barred, would be defined to include an individual’s “religious beliefs.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nCrookston:The University of Minnesota Crookston’s fourth installment of a six-part series designed to help businesses and communities recover from the COVID-19 pandemic will take place at noon Wednesday. The session will focus on creating strategic partnerships and will feature Deb McGregor, marketing consultant for the Northwest Minnesota Small Business Development Center. McGregor will talk about the importance of strategic partnerships and how businesses can benefit from the right alignments, especially during the pandemic. McGregor will provide context around strategic partnerships including how to identify the right type of partnerships for businesses. She will also provide examples of strategic partnerships that have formed during this time frame. Future installments will follow on the next two Wednesdays, also beginning at noon. The series is a collaboration between UMN Crookston, the Northwest Small Business Development Center in Crookston and Northwest Minnesota Foundation. Although this is a free series, preregistration is recommended; to register visit z.umn.edu/CommunitySeries. Each hour-long session will be recorded. For more information, contact Christine Anderson at caanders@crk.umn.edu or Michelle Christopherson at mchristo@crk.umn.edu.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: With water parks and amusement parks reopening in Mississippi, visitors at one Gulf Coast attraction said they believed they were safe from coronavirus infection. Margaritaville, which includes an elaborate indoor arcade and rooftop pool, began greeting visitors in Biloxi on Thursday. Other water parks and amusement parks statewide were allowed to reopen Monday, as long as they operated at half capacity of less and met additional requirements for sanitizing and social distancing. “It’s been a great experience so far. We are just glad to be out and have a place welcome us,” Amber Yochim, a visitor from Louisiana, told WLOX-TV. “All the staff are wearing masks. There’s been social distancing in line at the slide and the staff has been great at serving us and getting our food and drinks.” Margaritaville general manager Joe Farruggio said indoor attractions were rearranged. Employees are wearing gloves and masks. “We’ve actually redid the whole floor and we spaced it out quite a bit,” Farruggio said. “That’s the first thing we did. We have social distancing signs probably every 6 feet – they should be 6 feet, just letting them know.” Louisiana resident Kristoffer Arrington said he and his friends wanted to go somewhere they knew the pandemic would be taken seriously. “Louisiana itself, especially New Orleans, is really a hotbed for corona, so we really wanted to get away. I know it’s a lot of people here still, but just out of that state just because I know how bad it is there,” Arrington said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield:The school district is changing how it distributes grab-and-go meals this summer but will add enough food to cover the weekend. Children under age 18 will be able to eat school meals, at no cost to the family, for up to seven days a week. Superintendent John Jungmann said the district is expanding the amount of food it will provide this summer because of the coronavirus pandemic. Each summer, the district participates in a federal program that provides meals to any child, age 18 or younger. However, because summer courses are online in June because of the pandemic, they will be available as grab-and-go. “We will be fewer sites but we’ll actually expand the number of meals,” Jungmann said. “We’ll be providing weekend meals also.” Through July 31, the grab-and-go meals will be provided from 10 a.m. to noon each Monday, Wednesday and Friday. “Kids and parents will just have the ability to pick up multiple days of meals at one time instead of having to come every day,” he said.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A Yellowstone County woman in her 80s has died of COVID-19, the county’s health department said Tuesday. The woman died Monday at a Billings hospital, RiverStone Health announced. She is the 17th person in the state to die of the respiratory virus and the third in the county. John Felton, the county’s health officer, extended sympathies to the woman’s family and friends. Her name has not been released. “This death serves as a very unfortunate reminder about the seriousness of this pandemic,” he said in a statement. “We must continue to take measures to protect them from this disease.” Montana’s last confirmed COVID-19 death happened on April 28, also in Yellowstone County. There have been no new cases among the more than 3,000 tests run in the five days from Thursday through Monday. Gov. Steve Bullock has announced plans for the second phase of reopening the economy to begin on June 1, with increased capacity at bars and restaurants and a lifting of the 14-day quarantine for out-of-state travelers.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: An eighth resident at a western Omaha nursing home has died from COVID-19, as Nebraska health officials reported three new deaths and 145 news cases of the virus. The Life Care Center of Elkhorn in Omaha reported its latest death on Sunday, along with news that eight residents of the care center who had previously tested negative for the virus have now tested positive, the Omaha World-Herald reported. The facility said last week that it would retest all residents who initially tested negative on May 11. The new test results bring the number of residents and former residents who have tested positive to 68, and the facility said in a news release that 55 residents are being treated for COVID-19 symptoms at the nursing home. Seven are being treated at local hospitals. Of 140 center employees tested for the new coronavirus since April 27, 30 have tested positive, with five having recovered and returned to work. The state’s online coronavirus tracking site said the three new deaths Sunday brings the state’s total deaths since the outbreak began to 150. A total of 12,134 people have tested positive for the virus in Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City:The Trump administration is warning Nevada’s Democratic governor that his plan for reopening the state during recovery from the coronavirus fails to treat religious and secular gatherings equally. In a letter sent Monday to Gov. Steve Sisolak, the head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division took issue with the first phase of Sisolak’s guidelines for restarting economic and social activity in the state. That phased-in reopening restricts the size of in-person worship services, while allowing restaurants and other secular establishments to reopen with less stringent occupancy restrictions, the federal official said. “We understand these directives were issued in the midst of an uncertain situation, which may have required quick decisions based on changing information,” Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband wrote to Sisolak. ”We are concerned, however, that the flat prohibition against ten or more persons gathering for in-person worship services – regardless of whether they maintain social distancing guidelines – impermissibly treats religious and nonreligious organizations unequally.” Dreiband last week sent a similar warning letter alleging discriminatory treatment in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom later released guidelines for resuming in-person religious services in his state. The letter to Sisolak came three days after President Donald Trump declared houses of worship essential during the pandemic and vowed to try to override governors who don’t abide by his call to permit religious organizations to resume in-person services. A spokeswoman for Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the Justice Department letter.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire chapter of the National Endowment for the Humanities has distributed $400,000 to libraries, historical societies, museums and cultural nonprofit groups struggling financially because of the coronavirus pandemic. New Hampshire Humanities allocated the federal funding to 64 organizations in about 50 communities. Grants to libraries accounted for just over 40% of the total. Brittany Overton, director of the Minot-Sleeper Library in Bristol, said the money will help bridge the town’s digital divide.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: New Jersey schools can hold outdoor graduation ceremonies starting July 6, Gov. Phil Murphy said Tuesday. Murphy, a Democrat, announced the latest relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in a tweet before his regular news conference on the outbreak. “To the class of 2020, I am proud to say that you will have your opportunity to join with your classmates and families to celebrate your graduation,” Murphy said at the news conference. The events must be held outside and adhere to social-distancing guidelines, Murphy said. It’s possible such restrictions will mean that graduation ceremonies must occur over a couple of days, he said. It’s not clear yet how many people will be permitted to attend the ceremonies, he said, but added that the state education and higher education departments will issue guidance on Wednesday. Schools are closed through June because of the outbreak, but this is the latest easing of restrictions, which have included opening parks and golf courses along with the state’s beaches.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe:The New Mexico Department of Health and the State Personnel Office began accepting applications Friday to fill 200 to 250 contact-tracing positions around the state as the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic moves into the next phase. The positions range from entry-level through supervisory. Work will be done remotely, and hiring will be done virtually. Qualifications include experience in a health-related field or work with communities on social service matters, social work or case management. Those hired will work with approximately 150 Health Department personnel already engaged in contact tracing, many of whom have been temporarily reassigned from other public health roles in the department. Those hired will be assigned to one of five regional contact-tracing teams statewide, with larger teams deployed to the regions with higher numbers of cases. Additional positions are likely to become available over the summer as New Mexico continues to increase contact-tracing capacity. The goal is to ensure that every individual who tests positive for COVID-19 is identified, isolated, monitored and supported through the isolation period and that all known contacts are also contacted, tested for COVID-19 and monitored.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: New Yorkers marked Memorial Day with car convoys and small ceremonies instead of big parades as the coronavirus pandemic reshaped the solemn holiday, blending tributes to virus victims and front-line workers with the traditional remembrance of the nation’s war dead. In a year that marks the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II, veterans wore masks and saluted while standing at social-distancing intervals at observances shrunk by virus precautions. At the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in Manhattan – the former aircraft carrier USS Intrepid – Gov. Andrew Cuomo honored veterans and essential workers on a Memorial Day he called “especially poignant and powerful.” “We know something about loss, and we’re living it again,” the Democratic governor said. In Rochester, officials looked ahead to the construction of the city’s War on Terror Memorial. In Long Island’s Nassau County, a small group of veterans in masks saluted flag-bedecked vehicles at a car parade and wreath-laying that was closed to the public but streamed online. In Brooklyn, about 30 to 40 cars, including an old-style checkered cab, rode along the route usually covered by marchers at the United Military Veterans of Kings County parade. They finished by circling a Veterans Affairs hospital, many honking their horns, and laying a wreath near monuments at the hospital’s fence.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSouthport: A coastal town in North Carolina has installed hand sanitizer stations on sidewalks in its downtown. The Charlotte Observer reported that that the town of Southport announced the move on Saturday as crowds traveled to the North Carolina coast for Memorial Day weekend. “One of the interventions we can do as a city is to supply masks and we’re also placing hand sanitizer stations around the city,” Southport Mayor Joseph Hatem said in a YouTube video. Health experts have long recommended that people sanitize their hands to avoid contracting the new coronavirus.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State health officials on Tuesday reported 43 new cases of COVID-19, including 38 in the state’s most populous county that contains Fargo. Statewide, there were 2,422 confirmed cases as of Tuesday. Cass County has recorded 1,580 of the confirmed cases. North Dakota has recorded 54 deaths linked to the new coronavirus but none was reported Tuesday. The number of patients hospitalized was 40 on Tuesday, up one from the previous day. The state Department of Health said the testing lab recently experienced a recent malfunction of two pieces of equipment, so 82 positive results have been considered inconclusive and the individuals have been asked to retest. The malfunction has been corrected and has not impacted lab processing, officials said. Officials said retesting is ongoing over the next “couple of days.” Sixty-five people have been retested, with one positive case. One person has refused to be retested, officials said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A federal court panel temporarily stopped Ohio ballot campaigns Tuesday from proceeding under less restrictive signature-gathering rules they had been granted amid the coronavirus pandemic. A three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals stayed the more flexible rules while the state fights a lower court judge’s May 19 decision setting them up. U.S. District Court Judge Edmund Sargus Jr. had allowed campaigns promoting minimum wage, voting rights and marijuana issues to collect signatures electronically. He also extended the deadline for submitting signatures to July 31. Sargus stopped short of reducing the number of signatures required, as some courts elsewhere have done amid a spate of COVID-19-related signature-gathering challenges. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost appealed Sargus’ decision Thursday on behalf of fellow Republican Frank LaRose, the secretary of state. Yost asked the full Sixth Circuit to take up the case en banc. The state argued, among other things, that “wet ink” signature requirements laid out in Ohio’s Constitution cannot be changed without a vote of the people. The case has been expedited. The ruling adds to a string of setbacks for Ohioans for Safe and Secure Elections, whose reform package aims to make voting in Ohio easier. Campaign manager Toni Webb lamented Tuesday’s ruling in an emailed statement.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A city-based hospital system on Tuesday began allowing limited visitation to most patients, including those with the new coronavirus, as the state continues to reopen. Integris Health said some patients can designate one person as a “patient representative” who can visit between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. daily. Patients in obstetrics, pediatrics and neonatal intensive care can have two representatives, but no visitors will be allowed for patients in isolation except for those near death. The representative must be 18 or older and follow hospital health safety rules that include hand washing and wearing masks. The statement did not address whether the visitors would be allowed to touch the patients or if social distancing guidelines would be enforced, and a spokesperson did not immediately return phone calls for comment. Gov. Kevin Stitt’s reopening plan allows the patient representatives in hospitals “subject to any screening procedures required by the facility including temperature screenings, observance of hand hygiene practices, and the wearing of their own mask at all times while in the facility.” The policy is considered strict and likely will remain so “because we have the most vulnerable health population in the state,” said Dr. David Chansolme, medical director of infection prevention at Integris.“These are the sickest people,” with the least immunity to infection, Chansolme said. The hospital’s waiting rooms and common areas will remain closed.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A rural Oregon judge said he won’t dismiss his ruling which tossed out Gov. Kate Brown’s stay-at-home orders to fight the spread of the coronavirus. The Oregonian/OregonLive reported that Baker County Circuit Judge Matthew B. Shirtcliff told the state Supreme Court on Tuesday he will not alter the preliminary injunction that declared Brown’s directives “null and void.? The Supreme Court last week stayed Shirtcliff’s original ruling. “I have elected to stand by my original ruling,? the judge wrote to attorneys involved in the case. ” I will not be vacating the May 18, 2020 Order Granting Preliminary Injunctive Relief and Denying Motion to Dismiss or taking other action.? The state Supreme Court will now accept further legal briefs until June 2 before it decides whether it should uphold or dismiss Shirtcliff’s preliminary injunction. The governor had won an emergency stay, meaning a hold on the injunction, allowing her executive “Stay Home Save Lives? orders to remain in effect, until the state Supreme Court hears the merits of the case. The state has until Thursday to file further briefing in support of its push to dismiss Shirtcliff’s injunction, and the 10 churches and 21 others who sought the injunction will have until next Tuesday to respond.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: City officials on Tuesday began removing dozens of people who have been sleeping at the airport during the coronavirus pandemic, and they plan to administer rapid COVID-19 tests before taking them to homeless shelters. Officials at Philadelphia International Airport had initially planned Friday to remove the 50 to 100 homeless people who have been sleeping at a baggage claim area underused during stay-at-home orders. But airport and city officials agreed to wait until Tuesday after advocates threatened to sue if the people were moved to shelters without being tested. City Manager Brian Abernathy said Friday that Delaware County officials also would be on hand Tuesday to offer to take people to shelters in the neighboring county. He said arrangements were in place to house anyone who wanted to go to a shelter. The airport began enforcing new rules Tuesday, allowing only workers and those with airport business in the terminals and baggage areas. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Thursday that homeless advocates were concerned about people being moved from the airport without being tested for the virus and the possibility that they could take the illness into shelters.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The City Council is expected to consider a resolution this week that would go beyond state rules and mandate mask-wearing at all hours on some city streets. The measure introduced by Councilwoman Susan Taylor, if passed at a special meeting Wednesday, would go into effect Friday, WJAR-TV reported. Under Raimondo’s executive order enacted earlier this month, anyone in a public place has to wear a face covering if it’s not possible to maintain a 6-foot distance from others. Newport’s proposal goes a step further, requiring all pedestrians to wear masks on some busy downtown streets that get lots of foot traffic whether social distancing can be maintained or not. The resolution is meant to keep people healthy as more residents emerge from their homes during the nicer weather, and more people visit the city.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Coronavirus-related changes to this year’s South Carolina primary elections, including universal absentee voting, mean that elections officials are expecting a high volume of absentee ballots, as well as possibly a long wait for results. On Monday, a federal judge temporarily nixed a policy requiring absentee voters obtain the signature of a witness, saying that having to seek a witness increases the chance that a voter would contract or spread the new coronavirus. Ordering South Carolina officials not to enforce the requirement, U.S. District Judge J. Michelle Childs wrote that “adherence to the witness requirement in June would only increase the risk for contracting COVID-19 for members of the public with underlying medical conditions, the disabled, and racial and ethnic minorities.” Childs’ order is the second recent move to ease voting in South Carolina amid the outbreak. Earlier this month, Gov. Henry McMaster signed a law allowing anyone to get an absentee ballot without an excuse for the June 9 primary. Both the narrowly tailored law and the lifting of the signature requirement apply only to the primaries and, if needed, runoff elections that would follow two weeks later. State lawmakers have said they will consider in the summer or early fall if changes need to be made for November’s general elections.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: South Dakota health officials reported 67 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday but no new deaths in the state tied to the pandemic. Although Minnehaha County, the state’s most populated area, has accounted for the bulk of cases statewide and an outbreak at a Smithfield pork processing plant that infected more than 800 employees, several other counties have seen a significant number of cases in recent days. Beadle County reported the highest number Tuesday with 18. Outbreaks at other meat processing plants have fueled the rise in cases in some of those counties. The DemKota Ranch Beef plant in Aberdeen has reported 147 cases among employees, and 58 employees of a Jack Link’s plant in Alpena have tested positive for the virus. Employees at the Dakota Provisions poultry plant in Huron have also tested positive, but the Department of Health does not release case counts for a specific employer until they reach over 40.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:State lawmakers marked their return to legislative offices Tuesday by advancing an anti-transgender proposal after abruptly recessing three months ago because of the coronavirus outbreak. In March, lawmakers scrambled to approve a newly designed 2020-21 fiscal year budget back when the virus outbreak was just emerging in Tennessee – leaving hundreds of bills in limbo – but promised to formally return on June 1. House members, however, decided to gather this week and hold legislative committee meetings on a wide variety of bills – many of which were not directly related to COVID-19. This included a proposal dictating that Tennessee elementary and high school students could only play sports based on the sex identified on their birth certificates. The bill is one of two proposals being considered in the GOP-dominated Statehouse involving transgender students and what sports teams they can play on. The proposal advanced out of a subcommittee on a voice vote with only person voting in opposition. It must still face the full House Education Committee and House floor. However, even if the bill clears those hurdles, it’s unclear how much success it would have in the Senate. The Senate’s only scheduled meeting this week is a briefing on the state’s revenues affected by the economic fallout of the virus. This has resulted in a stark difference between the House and Senate on what issues will be considered over the next coming weeks.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be a headliner of Texas Democrats’ virtual convention, which was moved online over fears of the new coronavirus. The announcement Tuesday gives Texas Democrats one of their most prominent convention speakers in recent years. Democrats have been shut out of power at the Texas Capitol for nearly two decades but need just nine seats to flip the Texas House for the first time since 2003. The virtual convention begins Monday. Democrats had originally booked San Antonio’s convention center but moved the party gathering online as coronavirus cases began to climb in Texas in March. Texas Republicans are still planning to hold their convention in-person in Houston in July.\n\nUtah\n\nLogan: Restrictions aimed at reducing the use of single-use plastic bags have been put on hold in northern Utah during the coronavirus pandemic, but officials close to the issue said the efforts will not be forgotten. In response to COVID-19, some stores have banned reusable bags as part of their safety measures because they are believed to pose more of a risk in spreading the virus than plastic bags, The Herald Journal reported. “The very thing that we were promoting as a big part of the solution is now banned,” said Richmond Mayor Jeff Young, who has extensively reviewed the bag issue as Cache County Solid Waste Advisory Board chairman. “I actually think that we’re going to have to go back to the drawing board and re-discuss stuff that we now know that we didn’t know a few months ago when we were discussing this.” The board drafted a plan last year to work with retailers and residents to reduce lightweight, single-use plastic bags, which have contributed to pollution concerns worldwide. The plan included a public-education program and working with retailers to formulate their own reduction measures and policies. The Logan Municipal Council then passed a ban on plastic bags to speed up the board’s plan. The ban was scheduled to take effect in April if the board failed to act before then, but it was reversed earlier this year.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A nonprofit group that protects public access to some swimming holes in Vermont’s rivers and streams is urging people who use them to be safe. The advice from The Vermont River Conservancy, which works to protect land along the state’s waterways, comes as the state is getting its first dose of extended hot, summer weather. The conservancy said that the swimming holes it protects will have signs by the organization that says people shouldn’t visit if they are sick, avoid areas that do not allow a minimum 6-foot distance, urges swimmers not to linger too long and to make space for others. The conservancy said people should not wear a mask while swimming, but they should wear masks along the trails to and from the swimming holes. Executive Director Steve Libby said the swimming holes are places to enjoy on a hot day where people can recharge during unsettling times. “We rely strongly on the respectful behavior of visitors to ensure these sites can remain open during the pandemic, and are cared for and maintained for years to come,” he said in a news release posted to the organization’s website.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Local governments across the state are set to start receiving their first share of federal funding designated to cover spending related to the coronavirus pandemic. Virginia got about $3.1 billion from the federal CARES Act and opted to give half to localities with fewer than 500,000 people, The Virginian-Pilot reported. A little less than half of what has been set aside for the cities and counties should be paid around June 1. Finance Secretary Aubrey Layne told the newspaper this round of funding was allocated based on the locality’s proportion of the statewide population. Layne said the other half of the money set aside for local governments could be allocated a different way the next time - based on the number of positive coronavirus cases, for example. Cities and counties can use the money only for certain expenses, not to make up for lost tax revenue. The funding could be used to help pay for projects such as establishing temporary medical facilities, providing COVID-19 testing, performing contact tracing and facilitating distance learning. Fairfax County, the only jurisdiction in the state with more than a half-million residents, had to seek its own funding and got about $200 million.\n\nWashington\n\nVancouver: The number of employees at a Vancouver fruit processing facility who have tested positive for COVID-19 is now up to 65. KGW reported that Firestone Pacific Foods said 87 employees have tested negative for the virus, and there are still a few of its employees who need to be tested. The company said there are no known hospitalizations involving its workers. The outbreak was first discovered on May 17 when an employee tested positive for the new coronavirus. After learning of the positive test, the company shut down its production facility, but the number of workers known to be infected with COVID-19 has continued to grow. As of May 22, the number of employees who had tested positive was at 38. Clark County Public Health is working with the plant to get all its roughly 150 employees tested and make sure guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is being followed.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s Board of Law Examiners will go ahead with the bar examination this summer, with policies worked out with government and medical experts amid the coronavirus pandemic.The dates for the exam are July 28-29. It will be given at the Charleston Coliseum and Convention Center. Applicants, administrators and proctors can be screened before entering the site, with applicants not allowed to enter if their temperature is 100.4 degrees or higher, according to a news release from the state Supreme Court.Applicants will have to be 6 feet apart when in line to enter or exit and during the exam. Only one applicant will sit at each table. Applicants, administrators and proctors also must wear masks. Anyone traveling to West Virginia from out of state for the exam may be required to quarantine for 14 days before the exam, based on an executive order issued in March.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State courts can resume in-person hearings and jury trials if they can come up with plans to protect participants and observers from the new coronavirus, under an order from a divided state Supreme Court. The Supreme Court in March suspended in-person hearings and jury trials, ordering judges to continue trials to a date after May 22. A task force convened by Wisconsin Supreme Court Chief Justice Patience Roggensack and comprised of judges, court clerks and attorneys convened in April. Its recommendations released on May 15 included calls for participants and spectators to wear face masks, observe social distancing standards and use hand sanitizers, and clerks to include a note in jury summons detailing the precautions the court has taken. The Supreme Court issued an order Friday evening that allows individual municipal and circuit courts to resume in-person proceedings, including jury trials, on a county-by-county basis if the courts prepare a plan to do so safely. Each plan must mandate face masks for everyone in the courtroom, although a judge can allow a witness to testify without one, spell out practices for cleaning frequently touched surfaces, and require courthouse signs directing people to hand sanitizer. The chief judge of each judicial administrative district must approve the plans before proceedings can resume. The chief judge’s signature would invalidate the Supreme Court’s suspensions and allow hearings and trials to resume in the local court that submitted the plan.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Results are negative so far during testing for signs of the new coronavirus in sewage. Park County Public Health officer Dr. Aaron Billin presented the first round of results to Cody city officials Monday. The samples were taken April 28 at the city’s wastewater treatment center. Billin said the results are encouraging and show that local public health efforts have been successful. Health officials plan two more rounds of tests this month to establish baseline data before more tourists visiting nearby Yellowstone National Park begin to arrive in Cody, the Cody Enterprise reported. More tests will follow throughout the summer. The samples go to BioBot Analytics, a wastewater epidemiology company based in Somerville, Massachusetts. Park County Public Health is paying for the program with state and federal funding.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/956564/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-28-april-2022", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 28 April 2022 | The Week", "text": "1. Care home warnings ‘ignored’\n\nHospital patients were unlawfully discharged to care homes during the pandemic despite 20 warnings of asymptomatic Covid-19 transmission, the High Court has said. A 75-page ruling found that Public Health England advised the government against allowing untested hospital patients to be transferred to care homes. The i news site said this disclosure “undermines claims” from the former health secretary Matt Hancock that he did not know about asymptomatic transmission. Bereaved families said care home residents were “thrown to the wolves” during the pandemic.

Putin makes nuclear threat\n\nAny nation attempting to intervene in the Ukraine invasion will face a “lightning-fast” response, Vladimir Putin has warned. In what has been widely regarded as a reference to Russia’s nuclear arsenal, the president said: “We have all the tools no-one can boast of... we will use them if necessary.” However, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Western allies must “double down” on support for Ukraine, providing heavy weapons and air power. “We will keep going further and faster to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine,” she added.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sunak threatens windfall tax\n\nThe chancellor has threatened energy companies with a windfall tax unless they “support the economy” by upping their investment in UK energy supply. During a question and answer session on Mumsnet, Rishi Sunak said that if big firms fail to protect energy security, levying a windfall tax is “something I’d look at”. He also said it would be “silly” for the government to provide more help to families struggling with energy bills before the next price cap is announced in the autumn.\n\nFebruary 2022: What is the energy price cap and when will it increase?\n\n4. Andrew loses freedom of York\n\nPrince Andrew has lost his honorary freedom of the city of York. Councillors voted unanimously for a motion brought after the settlement of the civil sexual assault case against the royal by Virginia Giuffre. Darryl Smalley, the executive member for culture, leisure and communities at York Council, said that the move “sends the right message that we as a city stand with victims of abuse”, adding: “The next logical step is now for Prince Andrew to relinquish his Duke of York title.”\n\nMarch 2022: Prince Andrew escorts the Queen: the start of a royal rehabilitation?\n\n5. Suu Kyi sentenced to five years\n\nA Myanmar military court has sentenced deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi to five years in jail after finding her guilty in the first of 11 corruption cases against her. Suu Kyi, who was forced from power in a coup in 2021, has been charged with at least 18 offences that carry combined maximum jail terms of nearly 190 years. It is not clear if the Nobel Laureate, who is currently being held in an undisclosed location, will be transferred to a prison.\n\nThe rise and fall of Aung San Suu Kyi\n\n6. MPs ‘ballistic’ over porn claim\n\nAn independent investigation could be launched into claims a Conservative MP watched pornography on his phone while in the Commons. A female junior minister complained about the incident to the Conservative Chief Whip Chris Heaton-Harris during a meeting of a new group for female MPs and peers on Tuesday night. Others at the meeting were said to have “gone ballistic”, reported The Guardian, triggering “fevered speculation” over the identity of the MP.\n\n7. Charles backs masks for cows\n\nMethane-catching devices could be fitted to British cows to reduce emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas. A company called Zelp has been working with one of the UK’s largest meat producers to trial the devices that help cut the carbon footprint of herds. The device, which sits around the animal’s head, captures methane, which then travels through a micro-sized catalytic converter and is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and water vapour. The invention has the backing of Prince Charles, who described it as “fascinating”, according to The Telegraph.\n\nNovember 2021: Climate change: the worst offenders\n\n8. BBC’s ‘lurch to youth’ ends\n\nThe BBC’s director-general has said the corporation’s “lurch to youth” is over as he tries to win back disaffected older viewers. The broadcaster has made “determined attempts” to woo the 16 to 34 demographic in recent years, said The Telegraph, while over-55s have been tempted by streaming services such as Netflix. Tim Davie said “we need to be healthily paranoid about making sure we give value to people aged 16 to 34”, adding that the corporation doesn’t “have to skew everything young in any shape or form”.\n\nJanuary 2022: BBC funding row: alternatives to the licence fee\n\n9. ‘Perfect storm’ sees measles surge\n\nCases of measles cases soared by nearly 80% worldwide this year, as the pandemic interrupted vaccination campaigns for non-Covid diseases in what the UN described as a “perfect storm”. More than 17,300 measles cases were reported in January and February, compared with about 9,600 during those months last year.

Pincher scandal damaging PM\n\nBoris Johnson is under pressure to reveal what he knew about allegations of inappropriate behaviour concerning Chris Pincher when he was appointed deputy chief whip. Tory rebels told The Times that Johnson’s handling of the episode has bolstered their efforts to oust him. Meanwhile, a survey for the i news site found that a third of people not planning to vote Tory at the next election cited Johnson as the reason, while 45% of all Britons said Johnson being leader makes the party less appealing.\n\nInside the Carlton Club\n\n2.

Single-parent families face surge in poverty\n\nHalf of all children in lone-parent families now live in relative poverty, according to analysis by The Guardian. Relative poverty, defined as having an income of less than 60% of the national median, rose for single parents by nine percentage points between 2013-14 and 2019-20 to reach 49%, where as the rate for two-parent families rose by only two percentage points to reach 25%. The paper said “a decade of austerity-driven cuts to benefits has left single parents among the most exposed to soaring inflation”.\n\nWhy does inflation matter?\n\n4. NHS in for a ‘bumpy ride’\n\nThe number of people in hospital with Covid-19 is expected to continue rising, raising concern about the NHS’s ability to treat other illnesses. Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, warned that the present wave of infections had not yet peaked and asked people to behave in a “precautionary way”. Saffron Cordery, the interim chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said hospital bosses are “in for a bumpy ride over the coming months” as Covid infections are expected to coincide with seasonal flu pressures later this year.\n\nWhat to expect from the next Covid wave\n\n5. Six die in Alpine avalanche\n\nAt least six people hiking on an Alpine trail in north eastern Italy were killed yesterday when a huge chunk of glacier broke loose. An avalanche of ice, snow and rock struck a group hiking in the Dolomites, killing six of them and injuring eight others, according to the authorities. Walter Milan, a rescue service spokesperson, told Italian state TV that the area has been experiencing unusually high temperatures up to 10C. “That’s extreme heat,” he said. “Clearly it’s something abnormal.”\n\n6. Abbott makes unfounded PM claim\n\nDiane Abbott made an unsupported claim that Boris Johnson is “rumoured to like assaulting women”. Appearing on BBC Radio 4, the Labour MP discussed the case of former deputy chief whip Chris Pincher, who reportedly groped two men in a London club. She said a man sexually assaulting a woman might have been treated differently from Pincher allegedly groping two men, “because Boris Johnson has been rumoured to be the one who likes assaulting women”. The Broadcasting House episode was taken down and the claim was edited out.\n\n7. Ten-year-old rape victim denied abortion in Ohio\n\nA ten-year-old rape victim in Ohio, who was six weeks pregnant, was ineligible for an abortion in her own state and forced to travel to Indiana for the procedure. Three days after the state of Ohio changed its laws after the overturning of Roe vs. Wade to outlaw terminations, the child who had fallen pregnant through the rape, attended a hospital in the state and had to be sent to the neighbouring state for the abortion.\n\nRoe vs. Wade overturned: what the ruling means for other American rights\n\n8. Met under-recording crimes\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has been significantly under-recording crimes including rape, stalking and violence, The Times reported. Scotland Yard recorded 77 rapes per 100,000 people in the 12 months to March, nearly half the 131 in the West Midlands and also far lower than the 113 and 116 in Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire respectively. The Times said the news “raises concerns about the potential manipulation of statistics”, but remarked that it is possible other forces are inflating their figures, rather than the Met under-recording.\n\n9. North Korea criticises US pact\n\nNorth Korea has described a military agreement between the US, South Korea and Japan as part of a Washington plot to create a military alliance like Nato in the region. Speaking on state media, North Korea’s foreign ministry spokesperson said “the real purpose of the US spreading the rumour about a ‘threat from North Korea’ is to provide an excuse for attaining military supremacy over the Asia-Pacific region”. US President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol have agreed to explore further means to reinforce “extended deterrence” against North Korea.\n\nAre North Korea’s nuclear weapons a real threat to the West?\n\n10. Players fined after fiery Wimbledon match\n\nNick Kyrgios and Stefanos Tsitsipas have both been fined for their conduct during an ill-tempered match at Wimbledon. Tsitsipas was given a $10,000 (£8,250) fine for unsportsmanlike conduct and Kyrgios must pay $4,000 (£3,300) for an audible obscenity. Tsitsipas received warnings for hitting a ball into the Court One crowd and Kyrgios appealed repeatedly to the umpire for his opponent to be defaulted for his first offence.

The money announced by Gov. Kay Ivey’s office will help fund four weeks of virtual group therapy for people in 11 counties. Veterans will have virtual, hourlong meetings three times a week to help them deal with PTSD and stresses from the pandemic. Sixty veterans already are enrolled in the program, which is run by Priority Soldier, a nonprofit group that assists veterans diagnosed with PTSD. Services are available in counties including Calhoun, Coffee, Dallas, Lauderdale, Lowndes, Macon, Madison, Montgomery, Talladega, Tuscaloosa and Walker.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A female clinician not known to have allergies had a probable severe allergic reaction shortly after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, a Fairbanks health system reported Friday. The woman began experiencing “a probable anaphylactic reaction” about 10 minutes after receiving the shot Thursday, the health care system Foundation Health Partners said. Symptoms included tongue swelling, hoarse voice and difficulty breathing – “traditional anaphylactic symptoms,” it said. She received two doses of epinephrine at the Fairbanks Memorial Hospital emergency department and was discharged about six hours later, a statement from the health system said. An email seeking comment on the case was sent to Clinton Bennett, a state health department spokesperson. On Tuesday, a female health care worker at Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau was hospitalized for what officials determined was anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. Dr. Joe McLaughlin, the state epidemiologist, on Thursday said reports of reactions should be kept in context with the number of people being vaccinated.\n\nArizona\n\nYuma:A warden at a prison that is in the midst of the largest coronavirus outbreak within the state's prison system, has died after being hospitalized over the weekend, the Department of Corrections said. Edwin Jensen was a warden at the Arizona State Prison Complex in Yuma, which houses more than 4,400 incarcerated people near the U.S.-Mexico border. The Yuma County Medical Examiner’s Office confirmed Jensen’s death but said it would not be determining the cause of death or making a report because of federal privacy rules. Yuma County Sheriff’s Office Lt. Sam Pavlak said Jensen was hospitalized at Yuma Regional Medical Center over the weekend. More than 600 inmates at the prison tested positive for the virus last week, officials said. More than 1,500 employees have also self-reported contracting the virus since the pandemic began in March and most of the employees at the Yuma prison have said they believe most of the staff had been infected. No official numbers are publicly available.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: More than 4,000 health care workers have been vaccinated with the state’s initial allotment of the vaccine to combat the coronavirus pandemic, according to Gov. Asa Hutchinson. During his weekly radio address Friday, Hutchinson said he expects the number of people who can be vaccinated will increase now that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a second vaccine, this one created by Moderna Inc. Arkansas expected to have the first shipments of the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday, Hutchinson said. The state received about 25,000 doses of its first shipment of the Pfizer vaccine, which were sent to 18 larger hospitals, the Department of Health, and several pharmacies. “We are well on our way to vaccinating thousands of Arkansans, which is the only way we are ever going to beat this virus,” Hutchinson said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: California hospitals are fighting to find beds to house patients amid fears the increase of coronavirus cases will exhaust staffing resources. As of Saturday, nearly 17,400 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections – more than double the previous peak reached in July – and a state model that uses current data to forecast future trends shows the number could reach 75,000 by mid-January. More than 3,600 confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients were in intensive care units. All of Southern California and the 12-county San Joaquin Valley to the north have exhausted their regular intensive care unit capacity, and some hospitals have begun using “surge” space. Overall, the state’s ICU capacity was just 2% on Saturday. The enormous crush of cases in the last six weeks has California’s death toll spiraling ever higher. Another 272 fatalities were reported Saturday and in the last week nearly 1,600 people died. In hard-hit Los Angeles County, Director of Public Health Barbara Ferrer implored people to stay home as much as possible, not mingle with others outside their household and wear a mask and social distance when around others.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado’s economic outlook is brighter than previously anticipated in part because of the arrival of coronavirus vaccines, new job creation and strong online sales tax revenue, officials said, potentially providing lawmakers some wiggle room when they craft a state budget during the 2021 legislative session. Two economic forecasts presented to the powerful Joint Budget Committee suggest Colorado’s budget will rebound to prepandemic levels during the next fiscal year that starts July 1, The Colorado Sun reported. Lawmakers might see a surplus of up to $3.8 billion in the next fiscal year, according to forecasts. But the revenue forecasts don’t account for increased demand in government support for residents, businesses and services impacted by the pandemic. The quarterly forecasts from the governor’s office and legislative economists also show Colorado’s key restaurant and tourism industries and low-wage workers are getting left behind, the Sun reported. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has proposed a $1.3 billion stimulus plan that includes checks sent in December to more than 400,000 unemployed residents, future infrastructure spending, and restoring drastic cuts made this year to state spending and to reserves for the general fund, the discretionary portion of the state budget.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Overdose deaths from opioids are on the rise in Connecticut as the coronavirus pandemic has compounded social stressors and increased isolation. Health officials said Friday the state is projected to record more than 1,300 overdose deaths by the end of the year, the Hartford Courant reported. That compares to 1,200 fatal overdoses in 2019. Through October, the state had seen a 13% increase in drug overdose deaths compared to the same period last year. Connecticut has recorded a 300% increase in opioid overdose deaths since 2012, said Dr. James Gill, the state’s chief medical examiner. The data reflected a national trend, the Courant reported. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported this week that about 81,000 people fatally overdosed on drugs between June 2019 and May 2020 – a record for a 12-month period. Fentanyl, a highly dangerous synthetic opioid, has been involved in about 85% of Connecticut’s overdose deaths this year, Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, commissioner of the state Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, said at a virtual roundtable discussion. The horse tranquilizer Xylazine also is increasingly showing up in overdose deaths.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:New Castle County plans to use $136 million from its CARES Act allocation to help fund six statewide programs that benefit county residents, County Executive Matt Meyer said. The county will contribute $67.5 million) to the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. Based on actual unemployment claims through mid-September and estimates through the rest of the year, the total statewide amount of COVID-19 unemployment claims paid from March 15 to Dec. 30 will be $273 million. Approximately 55% of the statewide claims are from residents in New Castle County, the county said. The Essential Childcare Program, which provides benefits to child care centers during the pandemic, will get $38 million. Also, the Statewide Testing Program, which provides access to coronavirus testing regardless of symptoms to all residents of Delaware, will get $20.6 million. The Statewide Contract Tracing Program is expected to get $3.1 million, the Enhanced Rent & Utility Program $4.7 million and the Hospitality Emergency Loan Program $1.8 million.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: After a shortfall hit the local allotment of new COVID-19 vaccine doses, Washington’s neighboring states pitched in to help make up the difference. In a heartening demonstration of interstate collectivism, Maryland and Virginia are each sending 8,000 vaccine doses, more than tripling the amount available for health care workers in the nation’s capital. D.C. health officials have complained for weeks that the initial allotment formula followed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided Washington with just under 7,000 doses – less than one-tenth of what would be needed for local health care workers. The dosage allotments were based on population, but many of Washington’s health care workers live in the intertwined neighboring communities of Maryland and northern Virginia. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser had sent a letter to U.S. health officials claiming the “one-size-fits-all formula for distribution” would prove “woefully insufficient.” Govs. Larry Hogan of Maryland and Ralph Northam of Virginia apparently agreed, and each state will send 8,000 vaccine doses to D.C. The donations are just the latest indication of the close informal partnership Bowser, Northam and Hogan have pursued for the region since the early days of the pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nCocoa Beach:Brevard County residents extracted maximum Christmas bang for the buck by getting trees early to enjoy them for as long as possible to soothe any blues from the coronavirus pandemic. Many told vendors that in 2020, an artificial tree just wasn't as appealing given that they weren't dashing off anywhere, and that that extra bit of cheer and Alpine fragrance seemed so much more necessary this Christmas. The upshot is that trees are in short supply this year. The Christmas tree industry is still reeling from the Great Recession in 2008, when demand sank. It can take a decade to raise a mature 6-foot Christmas tree, and fewer growers have been planting trees in recent years. On Merritt Island, Dustin Grutzik, owner of Wisconsin Christmas Trees, ran out of all but his smallest trees two weekends ago and sold out of his stock on Friday. He had trouble acquiring large trees, he said, because of a slump in tree planting more than a decade ago.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: An 18-year-old college student from Loganville was sentenced to four months in a Cayman Islands prison after pleading guilty to violating a strict COVID-19 quarantine mandate in the Caribbean territory, according to several news reports. Skylar Mack and her 24-year-old boyfriend Vanjae Ramgeet were sent to prison last Tuesday after a judge set aside an earlier sentence by a lower court that entailed a $2,600 fine and 40 hours of community service. An attorney representing the couple criticized the punishment as too harsh, although the four months to serve was reduced from 15 months because of the guilty pleas, Cayman News Service reported. “There is no way that it can be right that a custodial sentence is imposed for a first-time offense on an 18-year-old defendant, who entered an early guilty plea,” said Jonathan Hughes, who attributed their actions to “youthful ignorance and selfishness.” The Cayman Islands, a British territory in the Caribbean south of Cuba, are a popular destination for vacationing Americans because of the pristine waters, lavish beach resorts and aquatic activities such as scuba diving, snorkeling and deep-sea fishing. Mack arrived there Nov. 27, reports said. Caymanian guidelines required her to quarantine-in-residence for a minimum of 14 days, according to the country’s Director of Public Prosecutions Patrick Moran. Instead, she went out after only two days and removed a location tracking device from her wrist in order to attend a water sports competition for Ramgeet, who is a professional jet-ski racer. Local police arrested Mack and Ramgeet at the event after observing the couple mingling among the crowd for more than seven hours without masks or social distancing, according to the island newspaper The Cayman Compass and later confirmed in a report by People magazine. In addition to the jail sentence, Ramgeet, who won the jet ski event, was ordered to return the trophy and cash prize and will be banned from competing in several races planned for early 2021. Authorities also required him to write a formal apology to the Cayman Islands Watercraft Association.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Public Safety said an additional 55 inmates and eight employees have tested positive for the coronavirus at the Halawa Correctional Facility, the state’s largest prison. The total number of active cases in the prison now encompasses 325 inmates and 43 staffers, KITV-TV reported. The Department of Public Safety had announced a lockdown and other measures to try to control the outbreak, which initially infected three inmates and 10 staffers last week.The outbreak at Halawa is the third major correctional facility in the state to face coronavirus issues since the pandemic began. The Oahu Community Correctional Center has 450 inmates who test positive and the Waiawa Community Correctional Center in Waipahu has reported 213 cases among inmates. More than 600 inmates from Hawaii have tested positive for the virus at a privately owned prison in Arizona. The state public safety agency said there were still three ongoing cases at the Oahu Community Correctional Center, six at the Waipahu correctional center and four at the private prison in Arizona as of Saturday.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An unexpected cut in the number of coronavirus vaccine doses Idaho will receive this week will disrupt distribution plans, a state immunization official said. State Department of Health and Welfare Immunization Program Manager Sarah Leeds said that the state had expected 17,550 but will only get 9,750. “That has some pretty significant implications for our vaccination program,” Leeds said during a meeting of the Idaho COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Committee. State officials have detailed plans for distributing the vaccine, and will now have to recalibrate. Health officials said the reason for the reduced amount isn’t known. Leeds said the state has received all 13,950 doses they expected last week. Nearly 1,000 people have been vaccinated so far. Health care workers who have direct contact with COVID-19 patients are receiving the initial doses. The vaccine Idaho has received so far is from Pfizer-BioNTech. Officials during the meeting said the state could get another 28,000 doses from Moderna Inc. this week.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A record number of Illinois nursing home residents with COVID-19 died in the past week as people in long-term care try to hold out until they can get vaccinated against the virus. An unprecedented 605 resident deaths were attributed to COVID-19 in the past seven days, state figures showed Friday – far more than the previous high of 480 two weeks ago. The number of recorded new infections in the state’s long-term care facilities also set a record with 5,063, surpassing the previous high of 4,536 from two weeks earlier. This second surge of the virus again exceeds the worst trends of the first wave of cases and deaths in the spring. The toll fell markedly in the summer but has risen again since November, following increases seen in the broader population. The Health Care Council of Illinois, which represents long-term care facilities, issued a statement looking forward to a “turning point” when vaccinations are scheduled to begin in nursing homes Dec. 28.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s daily rate of COVID-19 deaths has continued growing even as coronavirus-related hospitalizations have dropped to its lowest level in a month. The Department of Health’s daily update on Saturday added 73 coronavirus deaths that occurred over the past several days to the state’s toll. Those boosted the state’s seven-day rolling average of COVID-19 deaths to 77 per day after that average was in the low 40s in mid-November and below 10 a day during July. Indiana’s coronavirus hospitalizations and new confirmed infections have slowed in recent weeks following steep increases that began in September and raised worries among health officials about hospitals becoming overwhelmed. Indiana hospitals had 2,932 coronavirus patients as of Friday, the first day below the 3,000 mark since Nov. 16, according to the state health department’s online dashboard. The COVID-19 hospitalizations have declined about 15% since peaking Nov. 30 but remain nearly four times higher than in September.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Falls: Last year, Pastor Brian King delivered his sermon to 3,500 worshippers at Christmas Eve services at Nazareth Lutheran Church. This year, there will be seven live services, with attendance capped at 250 preregistered people per service. Masks are mandatory, and everyone is expected to maintain appropriate physical distancing. A variety of online and televised services also will be offered for members who are uncomfortable attending in person, King said. Doors are still closed to congregations at some Cedar Valley churches, and other churches are open but limiting the number of people at live services. Most churches will livestream or offer prerecorded Christmas Eve services at their websites, and may offer recordings of last year’s cantatas, concerts, celebrations and other sermons to view or download.\n\nKansas\n\nQuinter: The sheriff in Gove County, which has been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic, has died of the virus. The Gove County Sheriff’s Office described Sheriff Allan Weber as an “extraordinary public servant” in a Facebook post Friday announcing that he had died. He was transported to the Swedish Medical Center in Denver on Oct. 18 for COVID-19 respiratory complications. The county of 2,636 has recorded 18 deaths, for a rate of about 6.82 deaths per 1,000 residents, which is the highest rate in the state. The county’s emergency management director, the hospital CEO and more than 50 medical staff also tested positive. Shortly before Weber was taken to Colorado, he spoke to a reporter with the Associated Press. Occasionally coughing, he said he had been hospitalized in the past for asthma attacks, but the coronavirus symptoms were more pronounced. “You got body aches and headaches. The tightness in my chest is different,” he said. The county commission imposed a mask mandate starting Aug. 6, when only a handful of cases had been reported, but repealed it 11 days later. Officials subsequently issued a new mandate requiring masks.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear said he is using $51.5 million in federal coronavirus funding to provide relief from unemployment costs for more than 1,500 employers. In a news release Friday, the Democrat said those impacted will be public schools, universities, government entities and nearly 1,000 nonprofits. Beshear’s Labor Cabinet said that during the pandemic, the federal government has let states provide relief to employers that reimburse the state 100% on employment claims paid on their behalf, bringing their share down to 50%. Beshear’s action Friday covers the other half owed by the employers. Unemployment charges will resume to contributing and reimbursing employers starting Jan. 1, the news release said. Since the pandemic began, Kentucky has seen more than 1.3 million unemployment insurance claims.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe:Louisiana’s newest member of Congress was admitted to a hospital for monitoring on Saturday, a day after announcing that he had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Republican Rep.-elect Luke Letlow was admitted as a precaution, spokesman Andrew Bautsch told The News-Star. Bautsch also is fighting the disease, the newspaper said. Letlow, who is from the northeast Louisiana town of Start, was elected earlier this month to the 5th District seat representing northeast and central Louisiana. He is scheduled to be sworn in next month. He had announced Friday that he had been infected by the coronavirus and was in quarantine at home. Letlow was the third high-profile Louisiana politician in two days to say he had been infected. Democratic U.S. Rep. Cedric Richmond, who is leaving to become a member of President-elect Joe Biden’s White House staff, and Republican Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser said Thursday that they had tested positive for the virus. Richmond will be a senior adviser to the president and director of the White House Office of Public Engagement. Two Republicans in Louisiana’s congressional delegation – U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy and U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson – have publicly said they have recovered from the disease.\n\nMaine\n\nSaco: The coronavirus pandemic has been a struggle for much of American seafood, but at least one sector of the industry has found a way to grow during the crisis – the seaweed business. Seaweed harvesting and farming, based largely along the rocky and chilly coast of Maine, has grown for several years as interest in foods and nutritional products made with the gooey marine algae have risen in popularity. Like many pieces of the seafood industry, seaweed is highly dependent on the restaurant sector, which made the pandemic a potentially major setback. But that hasn’t been the case, according to state records and members of the industry. Representatives for Atlantic Sea Farms, a Saco company that works with two dozen seaweed farmers and accounts for most of the seaweed aquaculture in the state, said it nearly doubled its harvest this year to 450,000 pounds. Other growers said they continued harvesting seaweed through the pandemic, though finding workers and buyers was more complicated than a typical year. The industry was able to pivot to selling more of its products via retail locations than restaurants, and that meant it avoided the trouble that befell other seafood industries, such as the hard-hit oyster business, said Tollef Olson, president of the Maine Seaweed Council. The statewide harvest of farm-raised seaweed in Maine grew from about 50,000 pounds in 2018 to about 275,000 pounds last year, state records showed. Atlantic Sea Farms alone thinks its farmers will harvest more than 800,000 pounds in 2021. The seaweed is processed into products such as seaweed sauerkraut and frozen kelp cubes for smoothies. The state’s seaweed industry also includes a wild harvest of rockweed, which is used for livestock feed and fertilizers.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A trade group for Maryland restaurants is suing to challenge local bans on indoor dining during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Restaurant Association of Maryland on Friday filed requests for court orders to have indoor dining restored “as soon as possible” in Baltimore, and Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, the group’s president and CEO, Marshall Weston, said at a news conference. The association also wants to overturn Baltimore’s ban on outdoor dining. Weston said restaurant owners face an “impossible task” of trying to stay open with only carryout service, the Baltimore Sun reported. The association sued two days after an Anne Arundel County judge issued a temporary restraining order lifting that jurisdiction’s ban on indoor dining. Association attorneys claim there is insufficient evidence that restaurants carry a greater risk for COVID-19 transmission than other types of businesses. But public health experts said there are differences that make indoor dining riskier, such as customers removing masks to eat. Gov. Larry Hogan has limited restaurants statewide to 50% of their capacity for indoor dining, but local governments can impose stricter measures.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Massachusetts expects to receive 20% fewer doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine this year after the federal government reduced its allotment, state officials said. The state joins more than a dozen others that have been told their vaccine shipments will be smaller than planned in coming weeks. Instead of receiving 180,000, Massachusetts now expects to get 145,000. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said he hasn’t received an explanation for the cutback. “We’re certainly frustrated,” Baker said. “We’re working to get clarity on what this means, what happened and how that bump will be dealt with along the way.” Baker said he expects to get more answers during a call with federal officials this week. Despite the reduced allotment, Baker said he expects the state to have “more than enough” doses in the first months of 2021. Vaccine cutbacks in some states have raised concerns about potential delays in shots for health care workers and long-term care residents.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast Lansing:Veterinary students at Michigan State University are pleading for a tuition rebate after months of online instruction. The students said they expected a mix of in-person and online courses, but in-person classes were quickly dropped when the fall term began, the Lansing State Journal reported. Lauren Phillip and Breanna Demaline, on behalf of the classes of 2023 and 2024, spoke to the MSU Board of Trustees on Friday, requesting a 30% refund. “We strongly believe our tuition must reflect our current circumstances we are facing and will continue to face if we receive doctorate degrees online,” Phillip said. Students pay more than $100,000 in tuition, she said. Students from outside Michigan pay more. “Even with time to plan, the online course structure has been less than ideal and seemingly very disorganized,” Phillip said. President Samuel Stanley Jr. said a partial refund isn’t practical, noting the university still has fixed costs. He said the change in instruction is “one of the unfortunate casualties of the pandemic.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:A state senator from St. Cloud has died of complications related to COVID-19. Jerry Relph, 76, was the first Minnesota lawmaker to succumb to the virus. Relph was among a number of Republican legislators who contracted COVID-19 after contact with colleagues in mid-November. At the time, Rachel Aplikowski, the Senate GOP spokeswoman, said Relph tested positive after having had close contact with someone in the chamber who had the virus. Relph started quarantine on Nov. 10 and did not attend that week’s special session. He was also excused from a special session this week. In a statement confirming the news of Relph’s death late Friday, his wife, Pegi Broker-Relph, said her husband “dedicated his life to service.” First elected in 2016, Relph recently lost in a close race for reelection against DFLer Aric Putnam. Before serving in the Senate, Relph had a career as a small-business owner and attorney, and previously worked for 3M. Relph served in the Marine Corps in Vietnam. Shortly after the virus hit in March, Relph authored a $21 million COVID-19 response bill to buffer the state’s public health emergency response resources.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:The State Department of Health reported1,700 new cases of the coronavirus and 36 additional deaths on Saturday. The numbers come after a week of milestones for the state. On Dec. 8, the number of deaths related to the virus since the beginning of the outbreak in March topped 4,000. On Dec. 9 a record single-day total of cases 2,746 was reported. To date, the state has reported a total of 192,111 cases and 4,390 deaths. Residents, the health department said, should avoid social gatherings that include individuals outside the nuclear family or household. That includes weddings, funerals, sporting events and in-person church services. The rise in cases in Mississippi is part of a trend in new infections sweeping the nation.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A top St. Louis-area health official is warning that doctors and nurses are becoming exhausted as the coronavirus surges and that the tempo gives them “little room to maneuver.” Dr. Alex Garza, who leads a pandemic task force of 22 hospitals, said an average of more than 100 COVID-19 patients have been admitted every day to those hospitals for more than a month. He said they are filling 20% of general hospital beds and 30% of ICU beds, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. The hospitals’ intensive care and medical units are about 85% full on average. More than 20 COVID-19 patients are dying every day. “You just can’t maintain this sort of operations tempo at this rate, because it gives us very little room to maneuver. Even the slightest uptick in admissions above what we are seeing as normal now can really tip us into crisis management,” he said. “Beyond that, we can’t keep up this tempo because we are burning our staff out.” Crisis management means doctors have to make difficult decisions on who gets the best care and who doesn’t. “Make no mistake,” Garza said, “we continue to be in the most serious and deadly part of the pandemic.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: More than two dozen people have gathered to protest against COVID-19 restrictions, then said the Pledge of Allegiance and prayed outside Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock’s office in Helena, officials said. Conrad Evarts and the Montana Liberty Coalition organized “The Great Escalation” event and posted it on Facebook, the Independent Record reported Friday. Thirty-two people showed up at Memorial Park on Thursday to peacefully protest before moving up to the state Capitol building. All of the protestors who were approached by the Independent Record declined to be interviewed.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Nebraska will get 11,900 additional doses of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine this week that will be used to treat residents and employees at the state’s long-term care facilities, Gov. Pete Ricketts said. The announcement at a news conference came just days after state officials said they weren’t expecting any shipments from the company this week because of unspecified “logistical hiccups.” Other states have reported similar problems, but Pfizer issued a statement saying it wasn’t having any production or distribution issues. Ricketts said state officials still expect to receive about 32,000 doses of a separate vaccine developed by Moderna, as previously announced. Because of that, he said state officials will hold off on distributing the Pfizer vaccines until the last week of December so they can combine those doses with another expected shipment of 11,900 for use in Nebraska’s hard-hit long-term care facilities. “What we’re going to do is bank them,” he said at a news conference. State officials have identified front-line medical workers and people tied to the long-term care industry as the first groups that need to receive the vaccine. Other groups, such as teachers and meatpacking workers, will also get priority. State officials have predicted that the vaccine will be available to the general public in Nebraska by April.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Restaurants and bars are turning to individual dining tents, food trucks and contactless takeout to survive extended coronavirus restrictions limiting indoor dining. The hospitality industry has been especially hurt by the pandemic, first seeing total shutdowns and then shifting restrictions on capacity and other operations. Amid a surge of reported coronavirus cases hospitalizations and deaths in Nevada, Gov. Steve Sisolak in late November tightened restrictions on casinos and restaurants, which had been operating generally at 50% capacity since the summer. Sisolak ordered them to reduce capacity to 25% or 50 people, whichever is less, and extended the limits until at least Jan. 15. To cope with the new rules as chilly weather has made its way to southern Nevada, one Las Vegas restaurant, Esther’s Kitchen, has expanded into its parking lot in the city’s Arts District with eight cabana-style structures. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported each individual dining tent has floor coverings, lighting, a sound system and a heater. The tents are arranged around a fire pit sitting on artificial turf.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: The Currier Museum of Art is planning to close for a month during the coronavirus pandemic, but it will hold its traditional “Noon Year’s Eve” event for children online this year. The museum is closed until mid-January, when it will evaluate whether it’s safe to reopen. “Our region has recently experienced an alarming spike in cases and the Currier Museum is doing all it can to contain the spread of COVID-19 and avoid burdening local health resources,” museum officials said in a news release. “Many museums in Massachusetts and Maine have also temporarily shut their doors as a precaution.” The museum usually has more than 600 guests for its Noon Year’s Eve celebration. Participants in the virtual program this year will get a guided tour of an exhibit called “Open World: Video Games in Contemporary Art,” with performances. Participants also will get art kits to make a pixilation-inspired collage, party hats, festive masks, and bubble wrap fireworks.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The federal government is telling New Jersey to expect thousands fewer COVID-19 vaccines next week and for the rest of the month, though it’s not known why, the state’s health commissioner said. Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said that New Jersey expected to get about 87,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine for this week but instead will get about 54,000, a reduction of 38%. She added that New Jersey was told it would get 273,000 doses for the month but instead will get just 183,000, down 33%. Murphy said he expects there will be an explanation during a video meeting with the White House set for Monday. “I don’t think we’ve gotten a satisfactory reason why,” Murphy said. “It’s nothing personal. Apparently, every American state has received an expectation of a smaller allocation.” Several states have reported smaller allocations. Pfizer, the co-maker of the first vaccine approved for emergency use, has said as far as production goes, nothing has changed. “Pfizer has not had any production issues with our COVID-19 vaccine, and no shipments containing the vaccine are on hold or delayed,” spokesperson Eamonn Nolan said in an email. “We are continuing to dispatch our orders to the locations specified by the U.S. government.” The vaccine was first administered last week in New Jersey on Tuesday. A second vaccine, made by Moderna, was approved for an emergency roll-out Friday night. There have been 2,149 health care workers vaccinated in New Jersey, Persichilli said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Labor officials said local governments have shed thousands of jobs in New Mexico amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Department of Workforce Solutions said the overall statewide unemployment rate has fallen to 7.5% in November, down from 8.1% in October. Payroll employment is down by 58,300 jobs since November 2019, excluding agriculture. Most employment losses are in the hospitality and petroleum sectors, but local government also reduced employment by 6,500 jobs, mostly in public education. New Mexico is delivering relief payments of $1,200 to at least 120,000 unemployed people and offering $100 million in small business grants tied to federal relief money received by the state. An emergency health order continues to require face masks, ban gatherings of more than five people, forbid indoor dining at restaurants and restrict capacity at most businesses to 25% or less.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The number of New Yorkers hospitalized with the coronavirus has risen to the highest level since mid-May, according to state figures released Saturday. Officials said 6,208 people were hospitalized with the virus as of Friday – the largest number in the state since May 15. The state on Saturday also reported 127 new deaths and 9,919 new cases. Still, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo said New York “can see the light at the end of the tunnel” with the arrival of the first vaccines. “If we stay tough and be smart by socially distancing and wearing masks, we can avoid the holiday surge the experts are predicting and finally win this war,” the governor said in a news release. The numbers were announced as Cuomo sent a letter to President Donald Trump calling on the Republican to ensure Congress passes an “urgently needed” relief package with support for not only families but state and local governments. Also Saturday, Cuomo signed an executive order lifting the requirement that low-income senior citizens and people with disabilities must appear in person to renew their property tax exemptions. To claim or renew benefits, eligible seniors and people with disabilities typically line up at city and town halls across New York to file the required documentation, raising concerns about the potential spread of COVID-19.Cuomo’s order allows local governments to automatically renew 2021 benefits for all property owners who received the benefit in 2020 unless local officials believe the person is no longer eligible.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGraham: Judges in North Carolina have announced new procedures for reporters to access hearings less than two weeks after a newspaper publisher was handcuffed and ordered out of a courtroom. The News & Observer reported that Alamance County judges announced the policy after the newspaper and two other news outlets, the Alamance News and Triad City Beat, asked the North Carolina Court of Appeals to force the courts to let in journalists. Friday’s order by the judges said reporters must request permission in advance to attend hearings, and up to five journalists will be allowed in a courtroom. Journalists have been barred from attending recent Alamance County court hearings, even when they requested permission in advance. Courthouse staff cited COVID-19 as the reason for limiting access to victims and defendants. District Court Judge Fred Wilkins barred reporters from attending a plea hearing for Sandra Warren Brazee, a white woman accused of driving her pickup truck at two 12-year-old Black girls. Tom Boney Jr., publisher of The Alamance News, was handcuffed and ordered out of a courtroom as he objected. He was then released. The news outlets’ petition to the Court of Appeals is pending.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Nearly 200 nursing and pharmacy students at North Dakota State University are helping administer the coronavirus vaccine to front-line health care workers over the next several months. The upper-level students have received training to administer the shots at health care systems in the region and are being supervised by faculty members in the clinics, the university said. NDSU Nursing at Sanford Health students were the first to assist in administering the COVID-19 vaccination to front-line workers in Bismarck. In Fargo, NDSU pharmacy and nursing students are assisting Essentia Health and Sanford Health in providing vaccinations to front-line health care workers.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:The state’s supply of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine will be less in the second full week of delivery than initial estimates, the Department of Health said. Previous estimates were about 123,000 doses, but the current allocation is actually 70,200 doses, said Melanie Amato, a Health Department spokesperson. The “allocation for the second Pfizer shipment was lower than previously estimated by our federal partners,” Amato said. Ohio received about 98,000 vaccines last week for hospital workers and nursing home residents. Several other states said this week they have been told to expect far fewer doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in its second week of distribution. The federal government has said there is confusion among the states between planning and training numbers provided in mid-November, and actual allocations, which are only provided the week prior to shipment. Ohio began vaccinating front-line medical workers at 10 hospitals across the state Monday and Tuesday. Vaccinations of nursing home caregivers and residents started Friday at 10 facilities across the state.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Bars and restaurants have effectively won a temporary reprieve from a curfew that has been forcing them to close early since November to minimize the spread of the coronavirus. A state judge sided with a group of bar owners Friday, granting them a 12-day stay on Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt’s order that bars and restaurants not serve food or alcohol on their premises after 11 p.m. “It’s 12 days of freedom,” Daniel Capps, the owner of Redneck Yacht Club and a plaintiff in the case, told The Oklahoman. “It’s the 12 days of Christmas.” Stitt said in a statement that he looks forward to a hearing on the issue and that his order “maintains the right balance between protecting public health and keeping businesses open safely.” District Judge Susan Stallings said the stay only applied to the six plaintiffs in the case, according to The Oklahoman. But Keith Burt, the state’s director of the Alcoholic Beverage Laws Enforcement Commission, told the paper the agency would not enforce the curfew at any bars or restraints until there’s a hearing on the issue Dec. 30.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Multnomah County commissioners have voted to extend the county’s residential eviction ban until July 2, providing assurance that tenants won’t lose their homes even if Oregon doesn’t extend its statewide eviction moratorium past the end of the year. The commissioners voted unanimously on Thursday to extend the ban until July 2, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported Friday. State lawmakers are set to meet in a one-day special session this week to consider extending the statewide moratorium and provide aid to landlords whose tenants are behind on rent. Commissioners in Multnomah County – which includes Portland – said they acted urgently because it remains unknown whether the statewide measure will pass this week. The extension retains a six-month grace period for paying back rent, beginning July 2. Oregon’s largest county issued its eviction moratorium in March, at the pandemic’s outset, and extended it in September. The moratorium would have expired on Jan. 8 had the commissioners not acted. As many as 150,000 Oregonians could be behind on rental payments by January, according to a report from the National Council of State Housing Finance Agencies.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh:Local hospitals received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and have begun administering it to front-line workers. UPMC Jameson and Passavant received the vaccine Thursday and began inoculating priority hospital staff by Friday. Heritage Valley Health System also received doses of the vaccine for its front-line workers at the Beaver and Sewickley locations. According to a press release, 975 doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine were received Thursday. Heritage Valley has developed an automated tool that allows individuals to schedule their first and follow-up dose and copy the appointments to their calendars. At UPMC's Jameson location in New Castle, as well as its two Passavant locations in Cranberry and McCandless townships, vaccines were administered first to hospital staff who will be giving out the vaccines to others. Early this week, mass vaccinations are expected for other hospital employees, according to Lisa Lombardo.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A 66-year-old inmate with COVID-19 has died, the state Department of Corrections said late Saturday. The inmate, whose name was not released, died at Rhode Island Hospital, the department said. He “had other complicating comorbidities that likely contributed to his death,” the department said. The man was serving a sentence of life without parole in the maximum security facility at Adult Correctional Institutions since 1988 for the sexual assault and resulting death of a 73-year-old woman, the department said. The department said Friday that there had been 390 confirmed coronavirus cases at the facility, including 331 among inmates and 59 among staff, the Providence Journal reported.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Homeless people infected with the coronavirus or showing symptoms will soon be offered a new place to stay in upstate South Carolina. A 32-bed quarantine shelter will open Dec. 28 near Greenville, United Housing Connections and the Upstate Continuum of Care told the Greenville News. Tim Brown of homeless service ministry Miracle Hill said people have no place to go. “They have no shelter and when they’re starting to feel symptoms, they don’t know what to do,” Brown said. “There’s nobody to care for them. That’s what this facility is all about.” United Housing Connections CEO Lorain Crowl said last week that her group and the continuum were awarded $2 million in grants to develop the shelter. That includes $157,000 in federal coronavirus relief from Greenville County that can be used immediately to start buying supplies. A $1.7 million state grant will pay for staff salaries, support services, food and more. The shelter is a joint effort between United Housing Connections and others. PRISMA Health will provide medical care, oxygen, protective gear and testing. Telehealth consultations will also be available.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The number of COVID-19 cases in South Dakota over the last two weeks continued to fall compared to the rest of the country. State health officials on Sunday reported 391 cases in the last day, for a total of 94,727 infections since the start of the pandemic. The state that had been among the worst in the country for the coronarius in late summer and fall now ranks 16th for new cases per capita over the last two weeks, according to The COVID Tracking Project. The update showed 11 deaths in the last day, bringing the total number of fatalities to 1,361, of which 415 have been in December. The state is ranked No. 7 per capita at 153 deaths per 100,000 people, Johns Hopkins University researchers reported. Three of the deaths reported Sunday were in Minnehaha County and two came from Lincoln and Union counties. There was one fatality each confirmed in Beadle, Brown, Day and Yankton counties. South Dakota had vaccinated 6,311 residents with the Pfizer vaccine as of Sunday morning.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:Gov. Bill Lee disclosed Saturday afternoon that his wife has tested positive for the coronavirus and has mild symptoms and he has tested negative. Lee tweeted that the positive test for his wife Maria was confirmed in the afternoon. “I am feeling well with no symptoms and have tested negative for COVID-19,” the Republican governor wrote, adding, “Out of an abundance of caution, I will be quarantining at the Governor’s Residence and still plan to address Tennesseans about the COVID-19 surge” on Sunday night. Lee wasd scheduled to make a rare prime-time address on Sunday night about the COVID-19 surge.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Texas on Saturday surpassed 25,000 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic, the second-highest total in the country. State health officials reported 272 new deaths, bringing Texas’ death toll to 25,226. Cases of COVID-19 and virus-related hospitalizations continue to rise in the state. On Saturday, the state reported 9,796 people hospitalized with the virus, an increase of nearly 23% over the last month. Officials reported 12,914 new cases on Saturday. That comes two days after the state set its one-day record of new cases – 16,864 – on Thursday. One in every 262 people in Texas tested positive for the virus in the past week, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The increase in cases and hospitalizations comes as state health officials announced Friday that Texas will receive 620,000 more doses of COVID-19 vaccines over the next week. More than 224,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been delivered in Texas. The new round of vaccines will go mainly to front-line health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah is one of more than a dozen states that have been told to expect far fewer doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in its second week of distribution, the state’s health department said Friday. Instead of receiving the expected 23,400 doses, Utah will instead receive 16,575 – 30% fewer doses. The health department said it learned of the lowered allocation Friday afternoon and is working to determine the cause. The federal government has said there is confusion among the states between planning and training numbers and actual allocations, which are only provided the week before shipment. Pfizer has said it has not had any production issues and no vaccine shipments are on hold or delayed. The company said in a written statement that last week it “successfully shipped all 2.9 million doses that we were asked to ship by the U.S. Government to the locations specified by them. We have millions more doses sitting in our warehouse but, as of now, we have not received any shipment instructions for additional doses.” Utah hospitals began administering vaccinations on Tuesday to front-line health care workers with the highest risk of exposure. There have been 1,347 doses administered this week, according to state data.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Vermont officials are again asking residents to avoid holiday gatherings to reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Vermont avoided a feared spike of new cases after Thanksgiving because people largely followed the recommendations to keep celebrations within residents’ immediate households. Although much higher than it was several months ago, the number of new infections being reported in Vermont has largely plateaued, but there is not enough evidence yet that would allow the state to loosen the restrictions, Gov. Phil Scott said Friday during his regular virus briefing. “I understand the emotional need here, but at the same time, we have to take care of ourselves, take care of our families, take care of others surrounding us,” Scott said. For people who do gather, the events should be kept as small as possible, people should wear masks and keep a 6-foot distance from others. People who gather and travel should get tested immediately after and then again seven days later, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said earlier in the briefing. “The fact is we need to acknowledge that some people will choose these higher risk activities,” Levine said.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: Scientists said that tests of sewage in the Hampton Roads region indicate that coronavirus cases in the area will continue to rise. Raul Gonzalez, an environmental scientist with the Hampton Roads Sanitation District, told WAVY-TV that “wastewater signals right now are higher than they were during our last wave in July.” WAVY reported Friday that samples of sewage are taken each week at local wastewater treatment plants in parts of Hampton Roads and tested for the presence of the virus. The samples are taken to laboratories where genetic material is extracted. “We’re sampling the entire community at once,” Gonzalez said. “We get an idea of whether the COVID-19 are increasing, whether they’re going down, whether they are just plateauing. Right now by the way, we’re definitely increasing.” The findings are passed off to local health departments, as well as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The data can also be used to warn officials and medical providers that there could be an influx of patients. “That’s really where some of the strength of this work comes in,” Gonzalez said. Studies are also occurring in Charlottesville, Stafford County and in other parts of the country.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: As Boeing scrambles to conserve cash in the dramatic aviation downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, CEO Dave Calhoun told nonunion employees last week the company has this month given them shares of company stock instead of pay raises. Boeing said it awarded the stock to about 82,000 employees, excluding executives and those engineers, machinists and others whose pay is determined by union contracts. The stock will vest in three years, on Dec. 14, 2023, provided the employee doesn’t leave the company through that date. However, according to an internal company memo, if an employee is laid off or accepts a voluntary buyout in that period, they will keep a proportion of the allocated shares: one-third if leaving in the first year, two-thirds in the second year and all of the shares in the third year. The amount of shares granted depends on the employment level. According to the internal memo, managers will get 100 shares, which today are valued at about $226 each. Senior nonmanagerial employees get 75 shares, worth almost $17,000; lower-level salaried employees will get 50 shares, worth just over $11,000; and nonunion hourly employees will get 25 shares, worth about $5,600.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Officials said the state will receive about 44% fewer doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine this week than initially expected, in line with several other states.“They had some hiccup,” said Gov. Jim Justice about the federal government’s distribution of the vaccine. “I don’t really know what it is. Hiccups are not really permissible when people are dying.” The state expects about 11,700 doses to come in this week, down from 21,000. Pfizer has said its production levels have not changed and the Trump administration has downplayed the risk of delays. Several states have said they are receiving a smaller allotment of doses than first projected, with little explanation for the shift. West Virginia officials said they were informed of their allocation on Thursday. Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, head of the West Virginia National Guard, said he was still optimistic in the state’s drive to vaccinate all long-term care centers within three weeks. An expected 32,600 doses of a second vaccine from Moderna are expected to ship to the state. By Saturday morning the state planned to have administered about 8,000 shots at 50 nursing homes and assisted-living communities. Justice said that about 85% to 95% of residents at homes are taking the shots. But participation drops to about 60% among staff. “That’s not good enough,” he said. “But as far as the residents, we’re doing well.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay: The Green Bay Packers honored workers who have been on the front lines caring for coronavirus patients during Saturday night’s 24-16 victory over the Carolina Panthers at Lambeau Field. The team said it welcomed about 250 health care employees, first responders and their families to Lambeau Field. The honorees sat in socially distanced pods, in compliance with Lambeau Field's COVID-19 protocols, the team said. “We are so thankful and appreciative of all they have done for our community during this challenging time,” Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy said in a statement. “While we cannot invite large numbers of these special guests due to the pandemic, we want to express our community’s collective appreciation for all their great work.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Some bars in northwestern Wyoming are defying a statewide public health order to close earlier than usual to discourage spread of the coronavirus. They include the Elkhorn Bar and Grill in Meeteetse and Red Zone Sports Bar and Grill in Powell, the Cody Enterprise reported. Public health orders announced by Gov. Mark Gordon on Dec. 7 require bars and restaurants to close from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. through at least Jan. 8. The goal is to discourage people from gathering in situations that make virus spread more likely while stopping short of closing bars and restaurants completely. “This is not an anti-authority grab here for us. This is nothing to do with the local town council, or sheriff deputies, or the Park County sheriff or anything – we respect all those people,” Elkhorn co-owner Magnum Faust said. “This is about this ridiculous mandate.\" The Elkhorn also wasn't enforcing a statewide mask mandate Gordon announced on the same day as the overnight-hours restriction, the newspaper said. Red Zone Sports Bar and Grill, meanwhile, has begun claiming to be a “travel center” in an attempt to be exempted from the health restrictions. “We’ve been charging electric vehicles all summer,” owner James Andrews said. Law enforcement officers have visited both establishments but said they will focus on public education rather than citations to get people to follow the public health orders.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/china/china-protests-lockdown-softening-covid-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "What's happening in China after zero-Covid protests? Here's what ...", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nAfter unprecedented protests swept China, several cities have taken steps to ease some Covid-19 restrictions and a top official has signaled a softer approach to virus controls – leading to speculation that an end to zero-Covid may be in sight.\n\nChina’s most senior official in charge of its Covid response told health officials Wednesday that a “new stage and mission” in the pandemic response was due to “the decreasing toxicity” of the Omicron variant, increasing vaccinations and the “accumulating experience” of fighting the virus, according to state news agency Xinhua.\n\nVice Premier Sun Chunlan’s comments – which made no mention of “zero-Covid” – came after anger over Beijing’s increasingly costly strategy of mass-testing, enforced quarantine and lockdowns brought thousands of protesters onto the streets of major cities.\n\nAs their numbers swelled, many also demanded greater political freedoms – and some even called for the removal of Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nProtests on such a large scale are highly unusual in China. While demonstrations over local grievances occur periodically, the protests are the most widespread since the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement of 1989.\n\nThe Chinese government has cracked down swiftly, deploying police at key protest sites, calling protesters to warn them and tightening online censorship.\n\nHere’s what we know.\n\nWhat’s behind the protests?\n\nThe demonstrations were triggered by a deadly fire on November 24 in Urumqi, the capital of the far western region of Xinjiang. The blaze killed at least 10 people and injured nine in an apartment building – leading to public fury after videos of the incident appeared to show lockdown measures had delayed firefighters from reaching the victims.\n\nThe city had been under lockdown for more than 100 days, with residents unable to leave the region and many forced to stay home.\n\nVideos showed Urumqi residents marching to a government building and chanting for the end of lockdown on Friday. The following morning, the local government said it would lift the lockdown in stages – but did not provide a clear time frame or address the protests.\n\nThat failed to quell public anger and the protests rapidly spread beyond Xinjiang, with residents in cities and universities across China also taking to the streets.\n\nWhere have protests taken place?\n\nSo far, CNN has verified 23 demonstrations since Saturday across 17 Chinese cities – including the capital Beijing and financial center Shanghai.\n\nIn Shanghai on Saturday, hundreds gathered for a candlelight vigil on Urumqi Road, named after the Xinjiang city, to mourn the fire victims. Many held up blank sheets of white paper – a symbolic protest against censorship – and chanted, “Need human rights, need freedom.”\n\nSome also shouted for Xi to “step down,” and sang “The Internationale,” a socialist anthem used as a call to action in demonstrations worldwide for more than a century. It was also sung during pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing before a brutal crackdown by armed troops in 1989.\n\nBy Sunday evening, mass demonstrations had spread to Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Wuhan, where thousands of residents called for not only an end to Covid restrictions, but more remarkably, political freedoms. Residents in some locked-down neighborhoods tore down barriers and took to the streets.\n\nProtests also took place on campuses, including the prestigious institutions of Peking University and Tsinghua University in Beijing, and Communication University of China, Nanjing.\n\nIn Hong Kong, where a national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 has been used to stifle dissent, dozens of people gathered on Monday evening in the city’s Central district for a vigil. Some held blank pieces of paper, while others left flowers and held signs commemorating those killed in the Urumqi fire.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear protesters in China call for Xi Jinping's resignation 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nWhat does this mean for zero-Covid?\n\nVice Premier Sun’s remarks Wednesday about China’s “new stage and mission” in pandemic controls came just one day after the country’s National Health Commission (NHC) said the rectification of current pandemic measures is underway and local governments should “respond to and resolve the reasonable demands of the masses” in a timely manner.\n\nIn a meeting with the NHC on Wednesday, Sun also stated that a “human-centered approach” should be taken, and China should enhance its “diagnosis, testing, treatment and quarantine” measures, continue boosting vaccination rates – especially among elderly people – and strengthen medication and medical resources.\n\nExperts have previously said higher vaccination rates among the elderly was necessary before any potential relaxation of restrictions.\n\nPolice form a cordon during a protest in Beijing on November 27. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nAt a State Council press briefing on Tuesday, top health officials appeared to acknowledge the disruptions caused by measures such as lockdowns, saying long-term closures “can cause anxiety and life difficulties.”\n\nNHC spokesperson Mi Feng said Covid policies were being rectified to include lifting lockdown “as quickly as possible” to reduce inconvenience.\n\nIn recent days, at least six cities across China, including Beijing, have made changes to their Covid policies, in some cases lifting lockdowns, easing quarantine requirements and eliminating mass testing, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.\n\nSince Monday, the number of locally transmitted Covid cases reported daily in China has been declining, based on NHC data.\n\nWhy are these protests significant?\n\nPublic protest is exceedingly rare in China, where the Communist Party has tightened its grip on all aspects of life, launched a sweeping crackdown on dissent, wiped out much of civil society and built a high-tech surveillance state.\n\nThe mass surveillance system is even more stringent in Xinjiang, where the Chinese government is accused of detaining up to 2 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in camps where former detainees have alleged they were physically and sexually abused.\n\nA damning United Nations report in September described the region’s “invasive” surveillance network, with police databases containing hundreds of thousands of files with biometric data such as facial and eyeball scans.\n\nChina has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses in the region.\n\nProtesters march in Beijing on November 27. Ng Han Guan/AP\n\nWhile protests do occur in China, they rarely happen on this scale or take such direct aim at the central government and the nation’s leader, said Maria Repnikova, an associate professor at Georgia State University who studies Chinese politics and media.\n\n“This is a different type of protest from the more localized protests we have seen recurring over the past two decades that tend to focus their claims and demands on local officials and on very targeted societal and economic issues,” she said. Instead, this time the protests have expanded to include “the sharper expression of political grievances alongside concerns about Covid-19 lockdowns.”\n\nThere have been growing signs in recent months that the public has run out of patience with zero-Covid, after nearly three years of economic hardship and disruption to daily life.\n\nIsolated pockets of protest broke out in October, with anti-zero-Covid slogans appearing on the walls of public bathrooms and in various Chinese cities, inspired by a banner hung by a lone protester on an overpass in Beijing just days before Xi cemented a third term in power.\n\nEarlier in November, larger protests took place in Guangzhou, with residents defying lockdown orders to topple barriers and cheer as they took to the streets.\n\nHow have authorities reacted?\n\nWhile protests in several parts of China appear to have largely dispersed peacefully over the weekend, authorities responded more forcefully in some cities on Monday and Tuesday, flooding protest sites to discourage people from gathering.\n\nAuthorities in some cities have also adopted surveillance tactics, such as those used in Xinjiang, to intimidate those who demonstrated over the weekend.\n\nIn what appeared to be the first official – albeit veiled – response to the protests, China’s domestic security chief vowed at a meeting Tuesday to “effectively maintain overall social stability.”\n\nWithout mentioning the demonstrations, Chen Wenqing urged law enforcement officials to “resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as illegal and criminal acts that disrupt social order,” Xinhua reported.\n\nThe tough language may signal a heavy-handed crackdown ahead.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows British journalist 'beaten' and detained in China 01:17 - Source: CNN\n\nHow has the world responded?\n\nIn recent days, vigils and demonstrations expressing solidarity with protesters in China have been held around the world, including in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the United States and Malaysia.\n\nForeign officials and organizations have also voiced support for the protesters and criticized Beijing’s response.\n\n“We’re watching this closely, as you might expect we would,” said US National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby on Monday. “We continue to stand up and support the right of peaceful protest.”\n\nUK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told reporters the Chinese government should “listen to the voices of its own people … when they are saying that they are not happy with the restrictions imposed upon them.”\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union also said on Monday that it condemned “the intolerable intimidation and aggression” directed toward member journalists in China, in an apparent reference to foreign journalists who were detained during protests.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Tara Subramaniam", "Jessie Yeung", "Tara Subramaniam", "How Have Authorities Reacted"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/12/24/vaccine-freezer-christmas-cheer-iditarod-trail-switch-news-around-states/115213256/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nOpelika: At East Alabama Medical Center, located about 60 miles northeast of Montgomery, nurses and doctors who have spent months caring for the ill, are doing what they can to get through the holiday season, which many fear will only spread the disease and add to the U.S. death toll that has surpassed 300,000. That means staff members can hang decorations on patients’ doors in the ICU but cannot attend after-work Christmas parties. A cheerful Santa doll stands atop the desk at a nursing station, but big gatherings with relatives are out. A nurse for five years, Nurse Carla Fallin said Christmas just doesn’t feel right this year. She and her husband did not take their two young sons to local Christmas events that drew hundreds of people, many without masks. The decorations in the ICU help lighten the mental load a little, she said, if only until another patient nears death. The decorations are “a way to let family members know that we’re trying, and we love these patients and we want them to feel like it’s Christmas as much as we can,” Fallin said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race will follow a revised trail that won’t lead mushers to Nome in 2021. Instead, mushers will make a round-trip run of about 860 miles that begins and ends in Willow and includes two crossings of the Alaska Range. Dog teams will travel a little beyond Iditarod, the ghost town that marks the midway point of the race’s southern route, before turning around. Race organizers announced the shorter route after releasing a COVID-19 plan that includes mandatory and multiple tests for mushers. Anyone who tests positive in rapid tests administered at the start or at the McGrath checkpoint will be removed from the race. The revised route is about 140 miles short of the race’s traditional and much-celebrated 1,000-mile distance. It eliminates 13 checkpoints and doesn’t go near the Norton Sound coast or the burled arch that marks the iconic finish line on Nome’s Front Street. It still includes a ceremonial start in Anchorage on March 6, though how that will work with the city’s COVID-19 mitigation policies remains unknown. “The Iditarod is working with the Municipality of Anchorage regarding the ceremonial start and will provide updates as they arise,” race organizers said by email.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state Senate has announced a new set of COVID-19 safety guidelines for the legislative session in January, including requiring masks. Senate President Karen Fann told the senators and staff on Monday that anyone who enters the Senate building must have their temperature checked and be wearing masks at all times. The guidelines also require 6 feet of social distancing when possible and prohibits handshakes or any physical contact during committee hearings and gatherings. “This was not the scenario I had hoped for the 55th Legislature, but it is necessary to ensure we conduct legislative business and avoid disruption of the process to the best of our ability,” Fann said. Fann warned that failing to comply with the rules could result in an early end of the session. Lawmakers shut down their buildings last month and cut the 2020 session short because of the pandemic. Senate security has been tasked with enforcing the protocols.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: As hospitalizations of coronavirus patients hit a daily record high in Arkansas on Tuesday, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said two facilities will be constructed to provide more than 100 additional hospital beds if needed. “We have to be ready for whatever comes in January,” Hutchinson said at a news conference. “It is my hope that we will build this out and we will not have to utilize those beds for COVID patients.” He said that although the state’s existing capacity has been able to manage the current caseload, there could be a spike in cases following the Christmas holiday, as there was after Thanksgiving. Hutchinson said there were currently 1,103 people with COVID-19 hospitalized in the state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state’s health care system is in the throes of a coronavirus crisis stemming from Thanksgiving gatherings, top executives from the state’s largest hospital systems said Tuesday as they put out a “desperate call” for residents to avoid a Christmas repeat they said would overwhelm the state’s medical system. The officials offered what they called a “prescription” for Californians to slow the virus spread, a marketing effort dubbed “Don’t share your air.” The underlying message is to stay away from people from other households, which is what many did not do at Thanksgiving. “We simply will not be able to keep up if the COVID surge continues to increase,” Kaiser Permanente chairman and CEO Greg Adams said. “We’re at or near capacity everywhere.” The officials blamed Thanksgiving transmissions they fear will be repeated if people gather for Christmas and New Year’s and don’t take precautions like wearing masks, socially distancing, staying home as much as possible and not socializing with others.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo:In an undisclosed location in Pueblo County, there is a storage unit the size of a large freezer capable of holding thousands of doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Public health officials hope that these immunizations – the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which arrived in Pueblo on Dec. 16, and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, scheduled to arrive sometime this week – mark the beginning of the end of the pandemic. But the shots must first find their way out of the freezer, into a medical facility and ultimately, into the arms of enough Coloradans to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus. As one of nine vaccine distribution hubs across the state overseeing storage and dispensation of COVID-19 vaccines, Pueblo County is playing a vital role. “We are a distribution hub for several counties in Southeastern Colorado and in the San Luis Valley,” said Randy Evetts, director of the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment. “It’s really meant to be a distribution point – a place closer to those locations so the vaccine can get out in an expeditious manner and is not allI read th stored or coming out of one place in Denver.” Evetts said Pueblo County was an ideal hub for several reasons, including its size, geographic location, access to major highways and winter weather. And because the Pfizer vaccine must be stored in extreme cold – minus-94 degrees Fahrenheit – each hub also needed ultra-cold storage capabilities, which PDPHE already had.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Another prison inmate died from complications of COVID-19 on Tuesday and prisoner-rights advocates called on Gov. Ned Lamont to do more to protect those incarcerated in Connecticut from the coronavirus. It was the 13th death in the state prison system during the pandemic, the second reported this week and the fifth in the last month. The latest fatalities were both 69-year-old men who had been transferred in the last month from the medical ward at the MacDougall-Walker prison in Suffield to an outside hospital. The inmates’ names were not released. The inmate who died Tuesday was serving a 12-year sentence for sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor. The inmate who died Monday had been serving a 30-year sentence for sexual assault and kidnapping. There were 431 infected inmates in the system Tuesday, according to the department. There also were 280 staff members currently recovering from the coronavirus, according the department’s website.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Another record has been set in Delaware for the number of people who have been hospitalized with COVID-19. The Delaware State News reported that Monday’s daily update from the Delaware Division of Public Health reported 419 statewide hospitalizations. Health officials said that 67 of those hospitalizations are considered critical. State health officials also reported nine new COVID-19-related deaths. The state’s death toll is now 871. The nine most recent deaths were individuals with underlying health conditions. They ranged in age from 64 to 91. Five of the nine were also residents of a long-term care facility. There have been 51,056 total cases in Delaware since March. And the state’s seven-day rolling average for percentage of positive tests is at 9.2%. That’s still above the World Health Organization’s recommended mark of 5%.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:A temporary ban on indoor dining in D.C. was set to begin Wednesday night, WUSA-TV reported. A new rule will be in place for at least three weeks in the District as city leaders work to tame coronavirus numbers. Starting at 10 p.m. Wednesday, restaurants and bars in D.C. will not be allowed to seat customers inside to eat. The order by Mayor Muriel Bowser will be in place at least until Jan. 15th. According to D.C. Health, restaurants and bars accounted for about 14% of coronavirus outbreaks between August and November. “Every week we’re watching the news waiting to see what’s going to happen next,” said chef J.R. Robinson, owner of Kitchen Cray, which is located in Northeast D.C.’s H Street Corridor. The concerns for workers who primarily depend on tips to survive were echoed at other restaurants across the city, and some people in the industry feared businesses might not survive the shutdown. Businesses will still be open for outdoors seating and to-go orders. The District announced a $100 million grant program to help businesses and workers who have been impacted by the pandemic and the restrictions.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Presidential daughter Ivanka Trump helped load boxes of food into the cars of people who showed up at a South Florida drive-through food distribution event for those in need. “Merry Christmas,” Trump said as she hauled a black box into a car’s trunk in the parking lot of King Jesus Ministry in Miami-Dade County, according to WSVN. Food recipient Vivian Lopez said she had lost her job because of the coronavirus pandemic. “We are living really hard times,” Lopez said. Karla Fuentes, told WSVN that she had gotten to the church more than 12 hours earlier to get in line for the food and slept in her car. “It’s a big help for my house, for my neighbor,” Fuentes said. “We can share with everybody.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgia will again use a convention center for patient beds amid a surge in coronavirus cases that is straining hospital capacity, Gov. Brian Kemp said. The Georgia World Congress Center will have 60 beds and should be able to take patients starting next week, Kemp said. He said he expects the center to serve as an overflow hospital through January. The convention center served as a hospital during the pandemic in April, when the state signed a contract to build a 200-bed health care facility at the site. Kemp said the virus remained a threat despite the rollout of a vaccine, and he encouraged residents to meet virtually over the holidays or gather outdoors with just a few people in the same household. The state’s coronavirus infection numbers are soaring above their worst peaks of the summer. Health officials reported more than 6,200 new cases on Tuesday, bringing the total number of people infected in the state since the start of the pandemic to nearly 519,000. The virus has claimed more than 9,500 lives in Georgia.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: City officials will no longer count COVID-19 cases among prisoners at Halawa Correctional Facility in metrics used to decide whether to tighten or loosen pandemic restrictions on Oahu. The city will still include infections among prison guards and staff, Hawaii Public Radio reported. Honolulu consults weekly averages of confirmed positive cases on the island to determine whether it’s safe to allow more businesses to reopen or whether it should force more to close. The state Department of Health on Monday reported 104 new cases on Oahu. Of these, 55 were connected to Halawa prison. Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell said the outbreak at the prison is inflating the island’s numbers and that residents and businesses shouldn’t be punished for that. He said the city wants to avoid going back to its most restrictive rules. Subtracting infections among Halawa inmates from Oahu’s numbers would give the island a seven-day average of 82.6 cases, he said. That would put the island below the threshold that requires the city to adopt the most restrictive “Tier One” rules.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Idaho is in a race to get people vaccinated against the coronavirus while simultaneously limiting its spread long enough to avoid running out of health care capacity, Gov. Brad Little said. The Republican governor said during an hourlong call-in program put on by the American Association of Retired Persons of Idaho that the vaccination program is a high priority for him and Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen. “Don’t let your guard down,” Little told listeners. “It’s going to be a while before we get enough people vaccinated.” Idaho’s top public health leaders earlier this month cleared the way for state officials to impose crisis standards of care if the number of COVID-19 patients increases so much that the state’s strained hospitals end up completely overwhelmed.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Illinois U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin is touting the benefits of the pandemic and omnibus spending bill passed by Congress, but on Tuesday warned the state’s leaders not to count on federal help to balance the state’s budget. During a conference call with Illinois journalists, Durbin noted the pandemic spending bill passed Monday contains funding for specific programs to help Illinois and Chicago, including mass transit aid, support for airlines, restaurants and entertainment venues. The $900 billion pandemic relief package that includes a $300 federal stipend to unemployment checks and $600 in direct payments to taxpayers along with aid packages for various industries. Durbin said even if runoff races in Georgia give Democrats control of the U.S. Senate, legislation for state and local government pandemic relief would be difficult to pass under a Joe Biden administration. Gov. J.B. Pritzker forecasts a $3.9 billion deficit for the budget year that ends June 30, attributing about half the hole to lost tax revenue because of pandemic restrictions affecting business and jobs.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Indiana’s COVID-19 hospitalizations are down about 10% since peaking Nov. 30 but remain nearly four times higher than in September when the state’s steep increase began for deaths, hospitalizations and new infections. The Department of Health’s daily update showed coronavirus hospitalizations going back above 3,000 as of Monday after falling below that mark on Friday for the first time since Nov. 16. Gov. Eric Holcomb said although the state could celebrate that it didn’t see a surge of cases following the Thanksgiving holiday, Indiana was still at an “abnormally” high rate of virus spread. State Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box said the recent decline in hospitalizations was encouraging but remained “much higher than we would be comfortable with going forward.” “I’m very concerned about what will happen over Christmas, in the new year’s time and really want Hoosiers to be very, very careful and to really follow the social distancing, wearing your mask and, as much as possible, limit your celebration to those individuals that are in your household,” Box said.\n\nIowa\n\nJohnston: The vaccination of Iowa’s nursing home residents is set to begin next week, after an error in the distribution of vaccines threatened to delay the process. State officials said that to be able to begin vaccinating people at long-term care facilities on Dec. 28, as planned, the state had to have at least 50% of the vaccine needed for its nursing home population held in reserve, according to a federal rule. The government, however, eased that regulation since the state was shorted on its initial vaccine shipment. Iowa initially expected 172,000 doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in December, but that amount was cut last week by 22% to 138,300. Gen. Gustave Perna, the head of logistics for the federal Operation Warp Speed initiative, accepted blame for the error, saying he didn’t realize not all vaccines were ready to ship. Gov. Kim Reynolds called the mistake a bump in the road and asked Iowans to be patient as officials work through the logistics. Iowa Department of Public Health interim director Kelly Garcia said at a news conference that despite the error in initial vaccine delivery, arrangements have been made with pharmacy companies to deliver the vaccine to nursing homes next week.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly named the Kansas Department of Labor’s deputy secretary as its top administrator as she works to find another, permanent leader for an agency that struggled for months to process a surge in claims from workers left unemployed by the coronavirus pandemic. Acting Secretary Brett Flachsbarth became the third person to lead the Department of Labor in less than seven months. Kelly’s first labor secretary, Delia Garcia, resigned in June amid problems with the system for distributing unemployment benefits. Her replacement, Acting Secretary Ryan Wright was allowed by law to serve only six months, which ended Tuesday. The Democratic governor credited Wright with improving the Department of Labor’s operations and making “significant progress” in building a system to handle a program created by Congress to provide benefits under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program to independent contractors and other workers who normally don’t receive benefits. But top Republican in the GOP-controlled Legislature said the department continues to struggle and he’s still getting complaints from constituents about their benefits being delayed.\n\nKentucky\n\nShepherdsville: State Rep. Thomas Huff, R-Shepherdsville, is in a hospital intensive care unit with COVID-19, according to his social media posts. Huff said Tuesday marked his sixth day in isolation in an intensive care unit, The Courier Journal reported. Huff was not present at a Dec. 14 meeting for an interim committee of which he is a member. House Minority Leader Joni Jenkins, a Democrat, told the newspaper she learned of Huff’s medical condition on social media. “I’m worried about being able to keep our members and our staff safe when we don’t get timely information about others with COVID,” she said. On Dec. 3, Kentucky Democratic leaders released a joint statement calling on Republican House and Senate leaders to enforce public health rules at the Capitol Annex building. Huff has been in the state house since 2018. On social media, he has also expressed doubts about COVID-19 data and has been seen without a mask in the Capitol.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge:Warning the holidays threaten to exacerbate Louisiana’s latest coronavirus surge, Gov. John Bel Edwards said he’s keeping COVID-19 restrictions on businesses and activities across a Christmas season he’s cautioning shouldn’t look like previous ones. The Democratic governor’s rules, which he toughened in late November, were set to expire Wednesday. Edwards said he renewed them through Jan. 13, announcing the decision as Louisiana reached its highest number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients since April. “It remains a very perilous situation for the state with respect to COVID,” Edwards said. “If we insist on traveling and having those holiday-related activities and gatherings like we normally would, then we’re obviously going to be in even more trouble.” The decision to maintain restrictions wasn’t a surprise. Edwards had said he wouldn’t loosen the limits, which include a statewide mask mandate. The only question going into Tuesday’s announcement had been whether he would tighten them further, which he decided against.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The Maine Department of Labor has sent one-time payments of $600 to thousands of residents left unemployed by the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills authorized the payment, which differs from financial relief Americans might receive in the new federal coronavirus relief package. The Maine Department of Labor distributed the state payments to about 40,000 people on Monday. The state used $25.2 million in federal coronavirus aid to make the payments. Mills has said the payments differ from unemployment benefits, and are intended to help residents who were likely to exhaust or lose benefits from federal unemployment programs. Maine Department of Labor Commissioner Laura Fortman said the state will also “work to implement any federal changes to unemployment programs as quickly as possible after they are passed into law.”\n\nMaryland\n\nTowson: Baltimore County has limited the amount of fees third-party food delivery services charge to support restaurants during the coronavirus pandemic. County Executive Johnny Olszewski issued an executive order Tuesday slashing fees apps such as Uber Eats and GrubHub can take from the total cost of orders to 15%, news outlets reported. The popular apps typically take commissions from restaurants at about 30% of the total costs of orders. Paolo Romeo, a restaurant owner in the county, told WBAL-TV some services charge higher than that. “It’s a lot of fees, and I know for restaurants that are struggling, it’s another expense on top of everything else,” he said. As patrons have been forced to limit dining out because of state restrictions, restaurants across the country have been calling on them to avoid using the apps in order to boost sales. Other cities like San Francisco have also capped the fees. Olszewski said at a Tuesday news conference the 15% cap will make sure more money “goes into the pockets of restaurant owners and their staff.” The order will last until the end of the county’s COVID-19 state of emergency.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Many businesses will be limited to 25% capacity and hospitals have been directed to postpone nonessential surgeries starting the day after Christmas to help curb an anticipated increase in new coronavirus cases that could swamp the state’s health care system, Gov. Charlie Baker said. In addition, social gatherings will be limited to 10 people inside and 25 people outside, the Republican governor said at a news conference. The new restrictions take effect Saturday and are scheduled to run for two weeks. Baker also urged people to avoid large family gatherings at Christmas to prevent a surge in new cases that the state saw after Thanksgiving. “Together, the intent of these restrictions will be to pause activity and reduce mobility so we can reduce the spread of the virus without closing our schools or our businesses,” he said. The rules will create what Baker called a “bridge” to widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines, the first doses of which have already been administered to 26,000 workers in health care settings. The 25% capacity limit applies to restaurants, health clubs, casinos, museums, theaters, retailers and other businesses, Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito said. It also applies to houses of worship and libraries.\n\nMichigan\n\nCheboygan: Nearly two dozen school buses drove past the northern Michigan home of a beloved driver who died from COVID-19. It was a surprise tribute for Dale Wiersum’s wife. He was a driver for seven years in Cheboygan, a rural district near the tip of the Lower Peninsula where buses play a crucial role in getting children to school. “He was a friend first,” co-worker Demi Posh said. “Always giving, thoughtful, generous, sincere. There’s not enough words to describe what kind of man Dale was. Everybody went before him. Always.” His wife, Karen, was overwhelmed when she saw the buses Tuesday. “I’m shocked. It was wonderful to have all those buses come through,” she told 9&10 News. Karen was also given a Navy flag to honor Dale, who was a 69-year-old veteran. He died Dec. 6. “All of the drivers go along with him wonderfully,” Cheboygan transportation director Tammy Cage said. “He has a lot of friends and, well, family – our bus garage family.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis:Minnesota nursing home residents began receiving doses of the newly approved Moderna vaccine this week as the state prioritizes the high-risk population in its vaccination rollout plan. Residents and staff at the St. Cloud VA Community Living Center and an assisted living facility in the Prairie Island Indian Community were among the first to receive doses of the vaccine, which received emergency approval over the weekend. A number of other facilities across the state are planning to begin vaccinations this week, MPR News reported. State health officials expect to receive 94,800 doses in its initial shipment of the Moderna vaccine this week. Minnesota long-term care facilities suffered tremendous losses during the pandemic, with a majority of the state’s death toll of nearly 5,000 people consisting of residents of facilities around the state. State health officials placed residents and staff of the facilities first in line for the vaccine alongside health care workers.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The total number of coronavirus cases in Mississippi surpassed 200,000 on Wednesday, two days before the Christmas holiday when health officials said they expect a spike because of social gatherings. During a virtual briefing with the news media Tuesday, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, Mississippi’s state health officer, pleaded with residents to adhere to state guidelines around masks and social distancing on Christmas. The safest way to celebrate the holiday is to confine gatherings to nuclear family only, Dobbs said. “Be aware of the superspreader at your dinner table,” he said. “Please know how vulnerable we can be when we mix people who are younger and older.” One holiday-related event in the state has caused an outbreak, according to local news reports. The Sun Herald reports that at least 10 people on the Mississippi coast have tested positive after a week of events tied to the Biloxi Yacht Club. The club held the Commodore’s Ball, an evening of dinner and dancing in cocktail attire, inside the yacht club Dec. 12. Organizers said mask-wearing and social distancing was enforced. However, now-deleted social media posts showed attendees pictured without masks dancing shoulder to shoulder, according to The Herald.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Missouri’s tradition-bound Senate is installing an audio monitoring system in its committee hearing rooms so employees, lobbyists and the public can listen to debate in their homes or offices during the pandemic. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that Senate Administrator Patrick Baker said the changes could mean fewer people in a building that is often crowded during the nearly five-month annual session. “It’s all because of COVID,” Baker said. Bringing Senate hearings to the internet is notable because the chamber has largely shunned technological innovation, with laptops barred from the chamber and votes cast verbally. The House also is making changes in an attempt to give people an option of staying away from crowded corridors, with video links being installed in committee rooms that will allow people to submit testimony virtually.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: State health officials reported 556 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, continuing a decline in daily reported cases of the virus. The state totaled 3,877 cases in the last seven days, down from 4,745 cases in the preceding week. Daily case totals peaked in mid-November and have been gradually declining since then. Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock previously attributed the decline to new restrictions that went into place Nov. 20, which expanded an existing mask mandate to the entire state and required bars and casinos to close by 10 p.m. Bullock endorsed on Tuesday guidance for medical providers and staff in the event of scarce medical supplies, space and staff because of the coronavirus pandemic. Hospitals in the state reached peak occupancy in November. More than 200 contracted health care workers were hired by the state and deployed in Montana’s hospitals this month.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Nebraska might soon relax its social distancing restrictions again because the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus has continued to decline. Gov. Pete Ricketts has said he will relax those restrictions if there are consistently less than 15% of the state’s hospital beds occupied by virus patients. Currently, 14% of Nebraska’s staffed hospital beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, and that number has remained below 15% for six days in a row. The state said the number of people being treated in hospitals declined again Tuesday to 566 from the previous day’s 582. That total remains well below the record of 987 set on Nov. 20 but it remains high compared to Oct. 1, when 227 people were hospitalized.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A hospital has announced that more than half of its staff, about 2,000 employees, received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. University Medical Center in Las Vegas started vaccinations Dec. 14, once the first doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine arrived, officials said. Second doses of the vaccine are scheduled to be administered on Jan. 4. “UMC has provided COVID-19 vaccinations to a significant portion of our workforce, promoting the safest possible clinical environment for our team members and patients,” CEO Mason Van Houweling said in a statement on Tuesday. The facility employs about 4,000 people across its hospital campus and clinic locations. Officials said the first shipment of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine is scheduled to arrive soon. Health officials are expecting tier one vaccinations to be completed before 2021, including front-line health care workers with the highest risk of exposure.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A legal fight continues over the collection of income taxes from New Hampshire residents who are employed by Massachusetts companies but have been working from home during the pandemic. New Hampshire asked the U.S. Supreme Court in October to block Massachusetts from collecting such taxes from roughly 80,000 people. On Wednesday, New Hampshire filed a brief responding to an earlier filing in which Massachusetts argued the court should not hear the case. “Massachusetts’ current position is a far cry from our country’s rallying call of ‘no taxation without representation,’ – which they seem to have forgotten originated in their state,” said New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu. “We remain confident that the Supreme Court of the United States will take up this case of national importance and that the State of New Hampshire will prevail.” Under a temporary rule enacted by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, residents of other states who were working in Massachusetts before the pandemic remain subject to Massachusetts’ 5.05% income tax while they work from home. Although the regulation will expire Dec. 31 or 90 days after the coronavirus state of emergency in Massachusetts is lifted, New Hampshire officials argue it represents a permanent shift in underlying policy and amounts to an “aggressive attempt to impose Massachusetts income tax” beyond its borders.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton:Although many people across New Jersey have cheered the videos of the first hospital workers receiving COVID-19 vaccines, a far greater challenge looms for the state in the weeks ahead. New Jersey is about to embark on the largest immunization program in its history, with limited resources and – so far, at least – insufficient funds. Reaching the goal of inoculating 70% of New Jersey’s population – 4.7 million people – will require manpower and sites with room to do it, a massive expansion of data systems to schedule and track the two-dose vaccines, and a blitz of public information and advertising unlike anything seen before. But public health departments at the state and local levels already are struggling to keep up with the demands of the pandemic. Underfunded for years, their hopes of expansion have dwindled along with tax revenue. Hospitals are grappling with a rising tide of coronavirus cases while their budgets falter because fewer patients seek elective surgeries and other types of care. “We need a lot more help,” Gov. Phil Murphy said, referring to financial assistance from Washington. In October, he predicted that “if we do not receive any additional funds, achieving a 70% vaccination rate will take many years, if it even happens at all.” The coronavirus relief bill approved by Congress on Tuesday is a start, Murphy said. The package includes $103 million for vaccine distribution, planning, promotion, monitoring and tracking in the state. But it is unknown whether President Trump would sign the bill.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: It’s official, at least according to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham: Santa Claus and his reindeer are immune to COVID-19 and can safely visit homes all across the state. Lujan Grisham’s office on Wednesday announced that she had issued a proclamation assuring New Mexico children that health experts had determined that the coronavirus poses no danger to Santa and his hoofed helpers. As for the formalities, the proclamation designates Santa as an essential worker and exempts him from New Mexico’s social distancing and travel requirements. “The good cheer and glad tidings of the holidays are so important this year,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “I know we’re all excited to celebrate the holidays we’ve missed because of the pandemic – next year, the moment it’s safe to do so. There is hope, and there is light at the end of the tunnel. However you celebrate this holiday season, please be safe, please tell your loved ones you love them, and hold tight to the hope of next year, a brighter tomorrow, and putting this pandemic behind us,” she added. “Happy holidays, New Mexico!”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The city will send sheriff’s deputies to the homes or hotel rooms of all travelers coming from the United Kingdom to ensure they comply with the city’s two-week COVID-19 quarantine requirement, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday. De Blasio announced the enforcement action amid concern about a new, fast-spreading strain of the virus detected in the U.K. Airlines flying from London to New York agreed this week to test passengers before they board. All travelers to New York, regardless of where they’re arriving from, are required to fill out forms with contact information and where they will be staying. They will then be sent a quarantine order by certified mail, de Blasio said. People who fail to comply will face a fine of $1,000 a day, de Blasio said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper advised residents to avoid traveling over the holidays, saying Tuesday that he would limit his Christmas gathering in Raleigh to immediate family members. Speaking at a news conference, Cooper warned of increases in coronavirus spread similar to the one that occurred over Thanksgiving if people disregard public health guidelines. He did not add any new restrictions on gatherings or travel, however. Residents are currently limited to indoor parties of 10 or fewer people. The Democratic governor pointed to rising case numbers, limited staffing capacities at hospitals and a rise in the share of tests coming back positive, though he said Tuesday that numbers have “plateaued” in recent weeks. All but eight of the North Carolina’s 100 counties are seeing substantial or critical levels of community spread.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Department of Health said it is reinstating contact tracing for all people who test positive for the coronavirus. The department had cut back on much of its contact tracing among the general public in October as the virus surged, focusing on health care facilities, schools and universities. Officials asked other people to self-notify their close contacts. Contact tracers notify individuals who have been within 6 feet of someone who tested positive for the coronavirus for more than 15 minutes in a 24-hour period so they can quarantine. “Active cases and hospitalizations across North Dakota continue to decrease, and that’s promising,” Disease Control Director Kirby Kruger said in a statement. “To keep our numbers and hospital capacity manageable, we need individuals to continue to isolate when they test positive and quarantine when they are a close contact.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine’s veto of a bill limiting the Health Department’s ability to fight the pandemic will stand after Republican lawmakers wrapped up their two-year session without making good on a veto override threat. The bill that DeWine vetoed Dec. 3 would have allowed the Legislature to adopt resolutions to rescind Health Department orders to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. It would also prevent the agency from implementing regional or statewide quarantines for people who haven’t been directly exposed or diagnosed with the disease. DeWine, a Republican, said the bill would hamstring the state from responding quickly to situations that might require a quarantine, such as a bioterrorism attack. The measure was one of several that Republican lawmakers passed this year trying to limit the governor’s coronavirus protection efforts.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The arrival of doses of the newly approved Moderna vaccine in Oklahoma this week will expedite the state’s effort to quickly deliver vaccinations because it doesn’t require the same ultra-cold storage as the Pfizer shot, health officials said Wednesday. Deputy Health Commissioner Keith Reed said Oklahoma received 66,200 doses of the Moderna vaccine this week that will be distributed to more than 150 federally qualified health centers across the state. “Moderna is much easier on the logistics side,” Reed said. “The Moderna vaccine gives us options to send it to locations that don’t have the storage facilities for Pfizer.” Reed said Oklahoma has received more than 131,000 total doses of both vaccines this week, and health officials have said people in the second phase of the vaccine distribution plan could begin receiving vaccinations as early as next week. That includes first responders such as police and firefighters, adults over 65 or with underlying health conditions, teachers and support staff in schools and health care settings.\n\nOregon\n\nUmatilla: The Two Rivers Correctional Institution, one of the state’s largest prisons that is experiencing another COVID-19, outbreak has been grappling with a major power outage for the last week. The outage began on Dec. 16 and has affected six housing units and about 600 inmates, or a third of the prison’s population, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. Staff and outside contractors have been on site trying to determine the cause and how best to resolve it, according to the Department of Corrections. Prisons officials don’t yet have a firm time frame for when power will be restored. The outage comes as the state’s prison system has been rocked by the pandemic. More than 1900 inmates have tested positive for the coronavirus and 20 have died. As of Monday, 85 inmates at the Two Rivers prison were being treated for the virus. Jennifer Black, a spokeswoman for the state corrections department, said backup generators run during the night and are off during the day so crews can work. The inmates “have small battery-powered lights in each cell on the affected units,” Black said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf proposed spending $145 million in a worker’s compensation fund to help businesses cope with the pandemic. The Democratic governor’s plan requires a vote from the Republican-led Legislature to appropriate the money, and there has been no deal to accomplish that. Wolf said he wants the money to go out in the form of grants to businesses that have been most harmed by the pandemic, among them restaurants, bars and gyms. During an online news conference, Wolf said people were worn out by the pandemic, even as vaccines are starting to be administered. House Republican spokesman Jason Gottesman blamed Wolf’s policies for the pandemic’s effect on businesses and urged him to lift those restrictions. It’s unnknown whether legislative Republicans will bite on the governor’s idea; the General Assembly returns to work early in January.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has agreed to spend $10 million in federal coronavirus stimulus funds to make sure providers of services to the state’s developmentally disabled population can function well into next year. State Sen. Louis P. DiPalma told The Providence Journal that the fiscal health of 30 businesses that provide those services is of grave concern. “What we need to ensure is that when we come out of the pandemic they will still be there,” the Middletown Democrat said. The estimated 4,000 Rhode Islanders living with intellectual and developmental disabilities are among the populations most vulnerable to the virus, with about 1,200 living in group homes and some with preexisting health conditions. As of mid-November, 232 people with intellectual and developmental disabilities had tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the state. The providers have had to suspend services or reduce capacity while incurring expenses related to the pandemic.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville:Vice President Mike Pence will visit Greenville on Thursday to talk about COVID-19 vaccinations before traveling to a campaign rally in Augusta, Georgia. According to his office, Pence is visiting Greenville to take part in a roundtable discussion highlighting the public-private partnership to fight the coronavirus, Operation Warp Speed, and South Carolina’s operational plan for vaccinations once approved. The roundtable is scheduled to begin at 11:35 a.m. Thursday at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine campus in Greenville on Grove Road. Pence will then travel for a Defend the Majority Rally in Georgia, where voters will cast ballots in two U.S. Senate runoffs next month. The outcome of those races will determine which party has the majority in the Senate. Pence's visit to the Upstate comes at a time when new cases of COVID-19 are soaring in the Upstate and across South Carolina. The past four days have marked the highest totals of new COVID-19 cases in the state since the pandemic began in March. The state has recorded a total of 10,136 new cases of COVD-19 since Friday, according to the state Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Dozens of Rapid City residents and business owners filed complaints against City Council President Laura Armstrong for her social media posts and supporting a website they said targets those who are opposed to a mask mandate. Tonchi Weaver brought almost 100 complaints to the city attorney’s office accusing Armstrong of “abuse of office, illegal activity and cyber bullying” related to her posts on social media sites. Weaver is asking the city council to remove Armstrong from office, the Rapid City Journal reported. Many of the complaints refer to Armstrong’s support of a Facebook page called “Caring Businesses of Rapid City,” which Armstrong said promotes local businesses that have followed CDC guidelines during the pandemic. Others said Armstrong has posted on sites that include lists of Rapid City businesses to avoid because of mask requirements. Armstrong said many of the complaints are “grossly misstating the facts” about the website that is meant to protect the most vulnerable members of the community.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state is halting most in-person state and local court proceedings for a month as it fights one of the worst recent COVID-19 surges in the nation. The Tennessee Supreme Court issued an order Tuesday that pauses all but a few types of in-person courtroom happenings from Dec. 28 to Jan. 29 and extends a delay on jury trials through Feb. 26. Some exceptions include bond-related matters, preliminary criminal hearings or plea agreements for inmates, orders of protection, emergency child custody, child safety placement, temporary injunction filings, emergency mental health orders, emergency protection of the elderly or vulnerable, and other exceptions approved by the chief justice.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Health officials in the state capital again urged people to avoid holiday gatherings to slow the spread of the coronavirus, as hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients soared heading into the Christmas weekend. There is such a high rate of transmission in Austin that people should consider themselves at risk anywhere they go in the city, Dr. Mark Escott, the interim head of the Austin-Travis County Health Authority, said during a news conference. Most often, people are passing the coronavirus to family and friends who they feel comfortable around without wearing a mask. There has been a 97% increase in positive coronavirus cases and an 80% increase in the seven-day average number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus in Austin since Dec 1, Escott said. “This is a critical moment for the community,” Escott said. “We must decrease the spread of the virus in the community now. We cannot allow another increase in cases and hospitalizations following the upcoming holidays. Our hospitals will become overwhelmed and people will needlessly die.” Travis County Judge Andy Brown echoed the cries for caution and called on businesses to voluntarily limit occupancy, move to contactless operations and not operate between 10:30 p.m. and 5 a.m.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Health officials in Utah have said the state is in the lowest category of reported flu cases, along with much of the country as coronavirus cases are on the rise. Republican Gov. Gary Herbert made a push for residents to get the influenza A and B vaccine early in the season, KUTV-TV reported. “This year, it is more important than any before to get your flu shot. By getting vaccinated, you are greatly reducing your risk of becoming sick and thereby saving critical hospital space for others,” Herbert said. A weekly map of the U.S. shows the entire country has low-to-moderate flu activity, with the exception of Oklahoma. More than 650 people of all ages have been diagnosed with influenza A or B across the country, officials said. Health officials previously warned of a “twindemic” with coronavirus cases on the rise, but that has not happened with flu cases at record lows nationwide. Flu vaccine doses are also readily available because of low cases.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Utility regulators have reinstated a moratorium on the disconnection of electricity, natural gas and landline phone services because customers have not paid their bills. In an order dated Tuesday, the Public Utilities Commission said the moratorium will last through March 31. The commission first prohibited disconnections in March, but that moratorium was lifted on Oct. 15. Since the original moratorium was lifted, utilities were able to work with their customers so they could seek funds through a program designed to help pay the overdue bills of people in danger of having service cut off. But that program ended Dec. 15. The worsening pandemic and winter conditions prompted the commission to reconsider the moratorium. “Vermonters need to be able to keep the lights on, their homes warm, and their phone lines open as they survive the winter months of the pandemic,” said Commission chair Anthony Roisman.\n\nVirginia\n\nVerona:The spread of the coronavirus continues inside Middle River Regional Jail as 60 additional inmates recently tested positive, according to a press release. The newest figure is up from 48 inmates the previous week. Since Nov. 25, 464 inmates at the jail have tested positive, the release said. A total of 71 staff have also contracted the virus since Nov. 13. The jail said out of its 30 inmate housing units, 19 had no inmates that tested positive, and eight of 11 units with positive cases had less than three inmates with the coronavirus. Middle River Regional Jail had 796 inmates as of Monday. Seven tests are still pending. Two inmates released Monday have since have tested positive, the jail said. Both were provided a letter with instructions for self-isolation pending their test results. The health department has been provided their names, the release said. Staff at Middle River Regional Jail are being assisted by Dr. Laura Kornegay, health director for the Central Shenandoah Health District. The jail said another round of testing is planned for next week.\n\nWashington\n\nKitsap:Passenger-only fast ferry service between Southworth and Seattle has been delayed until 2021, Kitsap Transit said. Southworth service – the final route planned between Kitsap County and Seattle – is being pushed back because of \"forces beyond (Kitsap Transit’s) control stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the agency said in a statement. Kitsap Transit now plans to start service sometime in the first quarter of 2021. In October, Kitsap Transit riders voted to start Southworth service in 2020 without a backup boat. Although Kitsap Transit has officially taken delivery of the M/V Enetai, a 255-passenger bow-loader that will operate the route, crews have reported several additional issues with the vessel that need fixing. “There’s a handful of things that we need to get in place so that when we do start it, it’s being started correctly and it’s being started with the expectation that it’s going to be as reliable as we can make it,” Kitsap Transit executive director John Clauson said. “We’ll be starting service as soon as we can feel confident that we’re going to be able to operate it safely and dependably.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCeredo: American Airlines will be restoring daily service at the Huntington Tri-State Airport. The daily flights to Charlotte, North Carolina, will begin Jan. 6, the Herald-Dispatch reported. American Airlines will offer daily flights to and from the Charlotte Douglas International Airport, said Brent Brown, executive director of the airport. He said flight reservations are now being taken at the American Airlines website. The daily flights were suspended in October.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Wisconsin Supreme Court turned away a challenge of Dane County’s ban on indoor gatherings in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. In a 4-3 vote, the high court rejected the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty’s request that it bypass lower courts and take up its case. Dane County has since relaxed restrictions on all private gatherings indoors, including sports activities and those in private homes. In his majority opinion, Justice Brian Hagedorn emphasized the Supreme Court isn’t designed to take up cases in the first instance, a job meant for circuit courts. “This court is designed to be the court of last resort, not the court of first resort,” Hagedorn wrote. “That is why we have historically been receptive to original actions only rarely. I hope we return there again.” Three justices wanted to take up the case, saying the high court should not delay in taking up cases that involve fundamental liberties.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state could receive 7,000 fewer coronavirus vaccine doses this month than initially estimated because of a production discrepancy, state health officials said. A county-by-county distribution schedule published by the Wyoming Department of Health estimated the state will receive 20,325 vaccine doses by the end of December – a decline of 7,000 from the previous estimate, the Casper Star-Tribune reported Wednesday. The schedule reflects a change because “Pfizer shipments decreased for the last 2 weeks of December due to differences between estimated production and actual production,” department spokeswoman Kim Deti said. The state will also see slightly fewer doses of the Moderna vaccine than expected, Deti said. However, she also emphasized that the numbers could change and the schedule is tentative. About 5,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were delivered to the state last week, officials said, adding that another 2,000 are expected this week. The Moderna vaccine was approved late last week and 10,000 doses are expected to be delivered this week to Wyoming.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/03/19/pandemic-popcorn-doctors-notes-red-lantern-award-news-around-states/115577868/", "title": "Pandemic popcorn, doctor's notes: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Two Alabama National Guard-staffed mobile vaccination units will begin canvassing counties in the Black Belt and Wiregrass regions next week in an effort to expand COVID-19 inoculations to some of the state’s most rural communities. Vaccinations will begin Tuesday in Covington and Sumter counties. Gov. Kay Ivey announced the locations Thursday, saying in a statement that delivering vaccine to rural Alabama is important to her due to her own upbringing in rural Wilcox County. “I am proud that our guardsmen stand willing to help our great state in any way, especially as we look to put this virus in our rearview mirror,” Ivey said. “I encourage everyone eligible to take advantage of this great resource, and please remain patient as we continue working to get our hands on as many doses as we are able from the federal government. Be sure to help get the word out to your family, friends and neighbors!” The ALNG units will be able to issue “at least 1,000” doses per day, per site, in a Tuesday-through-Friday schedule. Alabama State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said last week the extra weekday will be used for planning and handling data. The clinics, open to all Alabamians free of charge, are expected to run between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The final musher has crossed the finish line in this year’s Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, nearly three days after the winner reached the finish line near the small community of Willow. Victoria Hardwick finished the race at 12:22 a.m. Thursday, claiming the race’s Red Lantern Award. The lantern is an Alaska tradition, awarded annually to the competition’s last-place finisher. Race officials say the award honors the final musher’s perseverance in not giving up. Hardwick, of Bethel, Alaska, finished the race 36th, completing the 850-mile race in 10 days, 9 hours, 22 minutes and 6 seconds. It’s her second Red Lantern Award. She got her first in the 2019 race, when she placed 39th. This year’s race started March 7 with 47 mushers. Nine quit the race, and one was withdrawn after testing positive for the coronavirus. Because of the pandemic, mushers didn’t follow the traditional route that travels across Alaska and ends at Nome at the Bering Sea. It was shortened to a loop with mushers starting and ending the race near Willow, about 50 miles north of Anchorage. It was the first time Nome was not the finish line for the world’s most famous sled dog race. Dallas Seavey won his fifth Iditarod championship, crossing the finish line early Monday morning. He’s now tied with Rick Swenson for the most-ever Iditarod wins.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State lawmakers on Tuesday advanced legislation offering a broad shield from lawsuits related to COVID-19, saying businesses and health care providers deserve protection for doing their best during a challenging time. Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee backed the measure in a party-line vote over strong objections from trial lawyers and consumer advocates, who said the measure would reward bad actors who flouted health guidance. Very few lawsuits have been filed related to COVID-19, critics say. The bill, which has already passed the Senate, would raise the bar for successful pandemic-related lawsuits against businesses, health care providers, nursing homes, nonprofits, governments, churches and schools. Instead of proving negligence by a preponderance of the evidence, plaintiffs would have to prove “gross negligence” or “willful misconduct” by clear and convincing evidence. That’s a “double whammy” requiring plaintiffs to both show more egregious conduct and meet a higher standard of proof, said Barry Aarons, a lobbyist for Arizona trial lawyers. The legislation effectively creates broad immunity for anyone who can claim some link to the pandemic, he said. A nursing home might claim, for example, it was unable to properly respond to a patient’s stroke or heart attack because of COVID-19.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Supreme Court has said it will hear arguments in a lawsuit by a group of legislators challenging Arkansas’ coronavirus restrictions. Justices granted the request for oral arguments in the case late last week but did not immediately schedule the hearing. A Pulaski County judge last year dismissed the lawsuit, and the legislators appealed to the Supreme Court. The case is moving forward a week after Gov. Asa Hutchinson lifted most of the state’s virus restrictions but left the state’s mask mandate in place through at least the end of March. It also comes after the Senate passed a measure expanding the Legislature’s ability to terminate a disaster declaration during a public health emergency. The lawsuit argues that the restrictions put in place during the pandemic required legislative approval. Arkansas on Wednesday reported 14 more coronavirus deaths as the state saw a drop in its active virus cases. The Department of Health said the state’s COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic began now total 5,507. The state’s active virus cases, which don’t include people who have recovered or died, dropped by 67 to 2,808. The state reported 325 new cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 327,781. Its COVID-19 hospitalizations increased by three to 260.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: AMC Theatres says it will have 98% of its U.S. movie theaters open Friday as a bunch of theaters reopen in California. Even more are expected to open by March 26. AMC said more than 40 of its locations in the Golden State are reopening Friday, and the state is expected to open 52 of its 54 locations by Monday. The company is preparing to resume operations at the rest of its California locations once the proper local approvals are in place. AMC’s announcement is welcomed by film fans not only because more of them will get to return to reclining seats and a stadium-style format but also because it means the company has hopefully put the worst behind it. It was only in June that AMC cautioned it may not survive the coronavirus pandemic, as its theaters closed and film studios started releasing more movies directly to viewers on streaming services. More theaters opening will also mean more jobs. AMC spokesman Ryan Noonan said the company is welcoming back employees from before theaters were shut down, as well as bringing in new workers. All will be trained on its cleaning and safety protocols, which include social distancing and automatic seat blocking in each theater, mandatory mask-wearing, hand sanitizing stations, upgraded air filtration, contactless ticketing, and mobile ordering for food and drinks.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A state Senate panel advanced a bill Wednesday that would grant minimum wage and overtime rights to thousands of farmworkers and allow them to organize and join labor unions. The bill, sponsored by three Democratic lawmakers, would regulate working hours for overtime, rest and eating breaks and would guarantee farmworkers living in cramped quarters space that conforms with distancing guidelines recommended by health authorities to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Several states allow farmworkers collective bargaining to some extent – among the many rights originally denied them on the basis of skin color under U.S. labor laws first adopted in the 1930s. “Generations of workers have been exploited for profit,” said Sen. Jessie Danielson, a bill co-sponsor who was raised on a family farm in northern Colorado. Danielson told the Senate Business, Labor, and Technology Committee that most farmers and ranchers treat their workers well. But she cited a litany of abuse, including relentless work hours in all weather conditions, substandard housing, lack of regular access to medical care, and the fear of retribution, including firing, for workers who complain about their labor and living conditions. “The pandemic brought the struggle of these essential workers to the forefront,” Danielson said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state House of Representatives on Tuesday voted unanimously in favor of legislation that requires Gov. Ned Lamont to provide top legislative leaders with recommendations for spending the approximately $2.6 billion Connecticut expects to receive in state COVID-19 relief funds from the latest congressional package. The legislation creates an unusual process that ultimately gives the General Assembly’s Appropriations Committee until May 16 to report its approval or modifications to Lamont’s proposal, if any, to the leaders. “I wanted to make sure that we as a group, we are a team addressing the Coronavirus American Rescue Fund and that all of us are participating in making the decisions and supporting what we need to do with these dollars,” said Rep. Toni Walker, D-New Haven, the House chair of the Appropriations Committee. Rep. Mike France, R-Ledyard, the top House Republican on the committee, said he’s pleased the legislation also requires Lamont’s budget office to provide legislators with an accounting of how Connecticut spent earlier federal pandemic aid. The bill now awaits final legislative approval by the state Senate.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Officials at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Wilmington have announced that all veterans enrolled in Veterans Affairs health care are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. The Delaware State News reports veterans must be enrolled in VA health care. And they should preferably receive care at the Wilmington VAMC or one of its five Community Based Outpatient Clinics in Delaware or southern New Jersey. “By expanding the eligibility criteria, we will be able to vaccinate all of our veterans more quickly and get closer to having staff return to their team assignments so we can offer more routine care to veterans at a pre-pandemic level,” Vince Kane, director of the Wilmington VAMC, said in a statement. The Wilmington VAMC has so far administered more than 22,000 vaccine doses to veterans and medical center staff.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: More than two dozen clergy members from the capital region rolled up their sleeves inside the Washington National Cathedral and got vaccinated against COVID-19 on Tuesday in a camera-friendly event designed to encourage others to get their own shots. The interfaith “vaccine confidence” event targeted in particular Black, Latino and other communities of color, with the aim of overcoming reluctance among populations disproportionately hit by a pandemic that has killed more than a half-million people in the country. “Over 50% of all cases and almost half of all deaths are in persons of African American, Latino or Hispanic background, American Indian and Pacific Islanders,” said Dr. Eliseo Perez-Stable, director of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. “Now, much has been said about, ‘Well, the risk is greater because there’s more disease, more diabetes, more obesity, more heart disease.’ But the reality is that the infections are more likely because people live in more crowded conditions. They work in jobs that do not allow the privilege of teleworking. They cannot self-isolate at home.” Following a moment of prayer for COVID-19 victims, the socially distanced attendees applauded when the Rev. Patricia Hailes Fears from Fellowship Baptist Church became the first one present to be inoculated.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Claes Bell repeatedly called his doctor, desperate to get a state form signed so he could get a COVID-19 vaccine before traveling to be at his father’s bedside after heart surgery. But the 39-year-old, who suffers from hypertension, said he couldn’t get through and eventually called a private, 24-hour emergency doctors network where he paid $45 for a virtual consult. “I’m privileged. I have the money to pay for that,” said Bell, a father of three. “It just sets up a scenario where your outcomes are going to be different depending on your income and employment.” Gov. Ron DeSantis recently opened up vaccine eligibility for younger people with health conditions to get the jab at pharmacies and community centers, but they’re required to have their doctor’s OK. The form requires little more than a signature and is aimed at preventing healthy younger people from jumping the line. But critics say it’s an onerous added barrier for minorities and low-income residents without health insurance or access to a doctor. The inequitable distribution of has been an ongoing challenge for the governor. Of the 3.2 million people who have received one or two doses, less than 6% have been Black – about a third of the corresponding share of the state’s population. Even those like Bell with insurance say they can’t reach their doctors because their offices have been flooded with requests.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Pulling the plug on the South’s largest St. Patrick’s Day parade didn’t stop the party in Savannah, where gaudy green-clad tourists kept bars, restaurants and hotels busy for days and had police handing out thousands of masks amid fears the revelry could brew a coronavirus outbreak. Tourism officials and business owners said the Irish holiday Wednesday and the weekend preceding it were the busiest they’ve seen since the pandemic began a year ago. They credited visitors weary of the virus and given hope by rising vaccinations. “The ’rona might not be done with us, but there are a lot of people who are done with the ’rona,” said Jessica Walden, co-owner of the bar Bay Street Blues near Savannah’s riverfront. St. Patrick’s Day is typically the most lucrative time of year in Savannah, whose parade dates to 1824. It has since ballooned into one of the South’s biggest street parties after Mardi Gras. The celebration Wednesday was notably more subdued. Still, a steady stream of people strolled downtown sidewalks and the riverfront promenade of bars and souvenir shops. Tables outside restaurants were mostly full, and a daiquiri bar had more than a dozen people lined up waiting to enter. Only about half the people celebrating outside wore masks, despite a large green banner hanging from City Hall urging revelers to “MASK UP.”\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: As the coronavirus ravaged other parts of the U.S., residents of this rural Pacific island watched safely from afar. Kauai, one of the world’s most sought-after vacation destinations, has been nearly impossible to visit for most of the past year, with officials bucking pressure to ease quarantine rules as the state’s economy tanked. As a result, Hawaii’s least populated county has been one of the safest places to be. Hair salons were open, kids went to school and played team sports, and residents enjoyed restaurants, bars and beaches without the typical hordes of visitors – or the fears of surging virus numbers. As of Wednesday, Kauai has recorded only 218 confirmed COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic, compared with more than 28,000 statewide. Now, local officials are loosening restrictions, saying early measures and the island’s departure from a state testing program that allowed in more people gave it time to build a strong foundation of public health. A unique “resort bubble” program also helped Kauai bring back some tourists and prepare to reopen more broadly. Next month, the island will rejoin the state’s Safe Travels program, which allows travelers to avoid quarantine with a single negative pre-flight coronavirus test.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A fourth lawmaker in the state House of Representatives has tested positive for the coronavirus in less than a week’s time – and just as the Legislature is debating a bill that would ban local governments from requiring that people wear masks. The increasing number of lawmakers out sick with the virus has legislative leaders in the conservative state worried they may not be able to finish business in a timely fashion. “Of course I’m concerned,” Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke said Wednesday, before the announcement of the fourth COVID-19 diagnosis among his colleagues. Bedke wasn’t wearing a face covering but put one on before getting in an elevator in the Statehouse. “We’re reemphasizing the safety protocols. We also want to be done by the end of the month. I guess we’ll just see how it goes,” he said. Republican Rep. Julie Yamamoto said Thursday that she tested positive Wednesday afternoon and immediately left the Statehouse. She had been on the House floor earlier in the day without a mask as lawmakers debated a huge tax-cut bill. All four lawmakers out with the illness are Republicans who rarely or never wear masks. “I actually feel fine,” Yamamoto said. “The coughing is the worst thing. And I was doing that before with just the asthma and allergies.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city will expand COVID-19 vaccine eligibility this month to include people with underlying health conditions and more categories of workers, including in food service and construction, Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced Wednesday. The expansion to so-called Phase 1c is expected March 29. It’s the last category before vaccines are available to the wider public. Illinois has allowed people with some underlying health conditions to receive the shots since last month, but Chicago and its surrounding areas have largely held off because supplies are limited in the densely populated region. The expansion includes workers in finance, higher education and retail. Still, issues persist with snagging limited appointments and eligibility confusion. Criteria have changed several times at a federally backed mass vaccination site at the United Center, which has allowed people with underlying health conditions since it opened this month. Initially, it was supposed to be open to Illinois residents but then was narrowed to Chicagoans. Later, those in city ZIP codes hit hard by the pandemic were given priority, with officials saying suburban Cook County residents would be offered limited access. Also Wednesday, Chicago schools officials announced staff and vendors can sign up for vaccinations at four dedicated sites for educators.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state attorney general’s office vigorously defended Gov. Eric Holcomb’s emergency powers in response to a restaurant’s lawsuit challenging his order that masks must be worn inside restaurants – even though Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita, who took office in January, previously called for curbing the governor’s authority. Yergy’s State Road BBQ in Bluffton filed a suit in December against the Wells County Health Department, Holcomb and the state after it was shut down for violating face-covering requirements and capacity limits amid the pandemic. The lawsuit contends that the county health order closing the restaurant was based on unconstitutional executive orders issued by the governor and that Holcomb didn’t have authority to mandate mask-wearing without backing from the Legislature. The restaurant in the town about 20 miles south of Fort Wayne maintains the order caused “unjust injury to Yergy’s fundamental civil rights, liberty interests and property rights.” The state attorney general’s office, however, argues that based on “broad, clear, and unambiguous language” of Indiana’s emergency powers law, the General Assembly “intended to grant the executive branch the authority to protect Hoosiers through an emergency declaration.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Zero Iowa nursing homes have active COVID-19 outbreaks as of Thursday, a milestone in the pandemic response nearly a year after the disease wound its way into the state. Nursing home residents are particularly vulnerable to the disease and have accounted for nearly 40% of the state’s 5,600-plus deaths, despite making up less than 1% of the state’s population. Family visits to the facilities were strictly limited last spring as officials tried to keep the virus from finding a foothold in the facilities. That led to months of isolation for thousands of frail, elderly Iowans. “Without a doubt this has been probably the longest and most difficult journey for long-term care providers in their lifetimes,” Iowa Health Care Association Senior Vice President Lori Ristau said in an interview. “Residents are like a second family to them. So that was very traumatic and a lot to work through. That makes the progress we’re seeing even more meaningful and more joyful because of how long this road has been for them.” Nursing home residents, along with health care providers, were the top priority for immunization after vaccines arrived in the state in December. Gov. Kim Reynolds said during a Wednesday news conference that more than 90% of residents and 60% of staff have been vaccinated.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Legislators are working to give prosecutors and courts time to clear a backlog of several thousand criminal cases that built up during the coronavirus pandemic, though they disagree about how much is enough time. The Senate approved a bill Wednesday night that would suspend until May 1, 2023, a law aimed at protecting defendants’ constitutional right to a speedy trial. The law requires cases to come to trial within five months of a defendant who has been jailed entering a plea and within six months if the defendant is free on bond. Lawmakers have said there’s a backlog of about 5,000 criminal cases, and prosecutors worry many of them will have to be dismissed if the deadlines are not suspended. “This is a serious public safety issue,” said Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Kellie Warren, R-Leawood. “It’s a solution. It’s not ideal, but it’s that something that we still need.” The House approved its version of the measure three weeks ago, suspending the speedy trial deadlines for three years instead of two, until May 1, 2024. It can either accept the Senate’s version and send that to Gov. Laura Kelly or demand negotiations with senators. But some GOP conservatives and Democrats are nervous about suspending the deadlines, worried defendants will languish unnecessarily in jail.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Republican lawmakers have doubled down on demanding that the Democratic governor obtain their approval before spending the massive federal pandemic relief headed to the state. The lawmakers also started signaling their own priorities for allocating Kentucky’s share of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, passed by congressional Democrats over united Republican opposition. The state government is expected to receive about $2.4 billion. Friction between Gov. Andy Beshear and GOP lawmakers extended to the budget when the Legislature mostly held the line on spending, rejecting extra outlays Beshear wanted for education and other priorities. Now they’re trying to find a path forward on spending the federal relief. One potential place for common ground is broadband – a priority for Beshear and lawmakers alike. The GOP-dominated Legislature pushed through a bill Tuesday designating $250 million of the federal aid to extend broadband service to the hardest-to-reach regions of Kentucky. Meanwhile, Republicans tucked language into another spending bill Tuesday putting more restrictions on Beshear, saying the governor’s budget office would forfeit more than $900,000 into the state’s budget reserve fund if any of the federal funds are spent without the Legislature’s permission.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: With states receiving steady supplies of vaccine, Gov. John Bel Edwards on Thursday further expanded eligibility to a long list of healthy essential workers who don’t have one of the two dozen medical conditions that already provided access to the shots. As the Democratic governor announced the widened eligibility, the state also kicked off an outreach campaign aimed at getting vaccines to people in underserved areas and persuading those who are skeptical, as the state continues to see available, unused appointments for its vaccine doses. The new immunization eligibility rules, which take effect Monday, will include workers at grocery stores, bars, restaurants and colleges. That’s expected to be the last expansion of access before Edwards throws open vaccinations to all adults around the state. Already, most of the adult population is expected to meet one of the eligibility criteria on the books. Those added to the list Monday will also include people who work at agricultural sites, post offices, manufacturing facilities, utility companies, construction sites, banks and veterinarian offices. Judges and their staff, public transit workers, river pilots, clergy, communications workers, people in the media and security staff all will be eligible.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Younger Mainers account for a growing number of COVID-19 infections in the state, raising concerns that they could fuel another spike. People in their 20s make up the highest percentage of new cases, about 18%, and those under 20 account for nearly 16%, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Together, those groups account for about a third of new infections, compared with residents over 70, who account for nearly 12% of cases but 85% of deaths. There are signs pointing to another wave of COVID-19 cases, and young people are most likely to facilitate that spike, Dr. James Jarvis, COVID-19 incident commander for Northern Light Health, told the Portland Press Herald. While younger people aren’t as likely to suffer from severe illness, they can still spread the coronavirus to others, including at-risk groups, often while having no symptoms themselves, Jarvis said. “If young people are infected and then go visit (others), that’s just one step away from an outbreak occurring.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Restaurants, retail outlets and gyms are among locations that will see a further loosening of COVID-19 restrictions just days after Mayor Brandon Scott pushed back against Gov. Larry Hogan’s decision to reopen many businesses statewide. Beginning Friday, March 26, Baltimore will allow indoor dining at 50% of capacity and outdoor dining at 75% capacity, news outlets report. Religious facilities, retail, indoor and outdoor recreation, gyms and casinos will also be allowed to operate at 50% of capacity. Until now, indoor dining in Baltimore had been operating at 25% of capacity, as had gyms, retail, shopping malls and recreation. Outdoor dining was permitted at 50% of capacity. Scott’s order is still stricter than the reopening plan allowed under Hogan’s statewide order, announced last week, which allows for lifting capacity restrictions at restaurants and opening up large indoor and outdoor venues to 50% capacity. Scott weighed the city’s legal options for several days ahead of Hogan’s order becoming effective Friday and eventually announced the city would stick to its existing restrictions despite ambiguity about his power to do so under Hogan’s order. However, Scott, a Democrat, said Wednesday that the city will now begin reevaluating COVID-19 restrictions on a two-week basis.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Just in time for baseball season, ballparks, arenas, and indoor and outdoor stadiums will be allowed to open Monday with a strict 12% capacity limit after submitting a plan to the state Department of Public Health. The step is part of the state’s ongoing reopening efforts as Massachusetts continues to ramp up vaccination efforts and as hospitalizations associated with COVID-19 continue to drop, according to the Baker administration. Also Monday, gathering limits for event venues and in public settings will increase to 100 people indoors and 150 people outdoors. Outdoor gatherings at private residences and in private backyards will remain at a maximum of 25 people, with indoor house gatherings remaining at 10 people. Dance floors will be permitted at weddings and other events only, and overnight summer camps will be allowed to operate this summer. Exhibition and convention halls may also begin to operate, following gatherings limits and event protocols. Beginning Monday, Massachusetts will institute a new pandemic travel advisory that will urge everyone entering the state, including returning residents, to quarantine for 10 days after arriving if they’ve been out of state for 24 hours or more. An earlier advisory called for a 14-day quarantine and made it a mandate.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state had the country’s fifth-highest rate of new COVID-19 cases in the last week and is among 14 states where infections rose over the past two weeks, a trend that may be tied to the increasing prevalence of a more contagious coronavirus variant, health officials said Wednesday. The seven-day case average was 2,372, an increase of more than 1,000 from March 1. The average positivity rate, 6.4%, was 3.8% two weeks ago. Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive, said Michigan is in a “different place” than earlier in the pandemic because of vaccinations but warned that herd immunity is still quite some distance away. At least 25% of residents 16 and up have received at least one dose. State Health and Human Services Director Elizabeth Hertel said to achieve herd immunity and stop the uncontrolled spread of the virus, 90% to 95% of people will probably need to have immunity. Meanwhile, more than 220 Defense Department military and support personnel are expected at Ford Field in Detroit on Friday to support COVID-19 vaccination efforts. Shots are expected to start Wednesday and run for eight weeks. Lt. Gen. Laura J. Richardson, commander of U.S. Army North, said 6,000 vaccines can be administered each day at the site. “State government can’t tackle this pandemic and the vaccination drive alone,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Thursday during a news conference at Ford Field.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Officials at the Department of Natural Resources say sales of its statewide cross country ski pass have been the best in six years. The DNR says more than 17,900 people bought the Great Minnesota Ski Pass, which is required to access many trails in the state. The agency collected more than $510,000 from sales, which will go toward trail maintenance, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. The Legislature in 2019 increased prices from $6 to $10 for the daily pass, from $20 to $25 for the annual pass and from $55 to $70 for the three-year pass. DNR spokeswoman Rachel Hopper said the trail maintenance fund saw decreasing revenue in recent years that forced a delayed payment to clubs in 2019, before the new prices were in effect. This winter’s boost, which she attributed in part to the COVID-19 pandemic steering people toward outdoor activity, has helped refill the fund. “Sales were so good that we were able to move the payments back to the normal timing,” Hopper said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A Millsaps College and Chism Strategies State of the State quarterly survey showed 63% of the more than 600 participants said they will “definitely or probably” get vaccinated against COVID-19. Another 25% noted they either would not get the shot or were unsure about it. That’s a significant leap from January, when the survey found almost 50% of people said they would refuse the vaccine or were uncertain. “We have seen a massive turnaround in just two months in the way Mississippians perceive the coronavirus vaccination program,” Nathan Shrader, Millsaps College Department of Government and Politics chair, said Thursday. He pointed to education about COVID-19 vaccines and encouragement from state officials and public health experts as the drivers that surged vaccination support. As of Thursday, more than 330,000 Mississippians were fully vaccinated, 11% of the state’s population. Among survey results, 55% of participants disagreed with Gov. Tate Reeves’ repeal of all county mask mandates, saying the decision was made too soon. Although Reeves rolled back mask mandates, state health officials continue to urge mask-wearing and social distancing.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: A new effort has begun in St. Louis County to help homebound residents and people with disabilities get vaccinations. The county health department is working with 15 fire and emergency management services districts to deliver COVID-19 vaccine to homes and independent living facilities, St. Louis Public Radio reports. “We’ve lined up a lot of partners, and we already have a lot of people who have been asking us for this for quite some time,” said Spring Schmidt, the county’s deputy director of public health. A pilot program began earlier this month with five fire districts. Schmidt said the county is expanding the effort to prioritize people who have no other choice than to have a vaccine delivered to their home. “Some homebound residents can rely on family members or loved ones to drive them to schedule appointments, but not everyone can immediately respond when a vaccine becomes available,” said Dawn Chapman, a member of the county’s disability commission who also is helping schedule vaccine appointments. Meanwhile, the Kansas City region is seeing a slight uptick in the rolling average for new coronavirus cases. The region, which includes Kansas City and its suburbs in both Missouri and Kansas, reported 160 new cases Wednesday.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state has a total of 19 confirmed cases of coronavirus variants in 11 counties, the state health department said Wednesday. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified the state this week of 11 tests that identified variants matching two California strains and another that originated in New York, along with three more cases of the United Kingdom variant already identified in Gallatin County. The California and New York variants involve specimens that were submitted for testing from January to early March in Beaverhead, Cascade, Glacier, Hill, Jefferson, Madison, Phillips, Roosevelt, Silver Bow and Valley counties. When these samples were initially submitted for testing, the California and New York versions had not yet been classified by CDC. Gallatin County has 11 known cases of the U.K. variant, including the three that were confirmed this week. “Montana continues to submit both random and suspect COVID-19 samples to the CDC for testing,” said Adam Meier, director of the Department of Public Health and Human Services. Meier stressed the best thing Montanans can do to protect themselves is get vaccinated and continue to follow CDC guidelines about wearing masks, social distancing, staying home if sick, washing hands often and avoiding large crowds.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A variant of the coronavirus first found in Brazil has been found in the city, state health officials said. On Wednesday, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services confirmed two people in Douglas County had tested positive for the so-called Brazil P.1 variant, the Omaha World-Herald reports. That strain is believed to be responsible for a surge in hospitalizations in Brazil even though many people there had already developed COVID-19 and made antibodies against it. Investigations into the Douglas County cases are underway, state health officials said. As of Thursday, the state’s virus-tracking dashboard showed more than 205,500 people in Nebraska have tested positive for the virus, and 2,130 have died from COVID-19 since the outbreak began last year. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has decreased over the past two weeks, going from nearly 261 new cases per day March 2 to just over 232 new cases per day Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The city is making all residents 16 and older eligible for COVID-19 vaccines starting April 5 as part of its efforts to inoculate the population as quickly as possible. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak on Wednesday said opening eligibility was made possible through the approval of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and increased production. But whether shots would be available, he said, depended on the supply delivered by the federal government. The timeline could mean appointments in the coming weeks open to hundreds of thousands more people in Nevada, where roughly 61% of the population is older than 18 and younger than 65. The state’s new timeline satisfies the goal that President Joe Biden announced last week, when he said he wanted everyone in the U.S. 18 and older to be eligible for vaccines by May 1. The timeline would not require Nevada to alter its vaccine playbook that prioritized and designated available doses for seniors and front-line workers. Throughout the state, teachers, health care workers, police officers and hospitality industry workers have already been made eligible to receive the vaccine, as have individuals ages 65 and older. Nevada also plans to make residents 16 and up with underlying health conditions eligible for shots Monday through partner pharmacies.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nKeene: Keene State College is planning for a fully in-person fall semester. Currently, classes have been a mix of in-person, hybrid or online, with many campus activities curtailed because of the coronavirus pandemic. But officials are planning to resume all in-person classes, athletic events, on-campus student activities and study-abroad opportunities in the fall. Keene State President Melinda Treadwell said officials expect to be in a better place by the end of the summer with the vaccine rollout underway. “Our students have told us loud and clear that they want to be together on campus in our community. We are having a successful spring semester, and are actively planning a shift to additional on-campus and in-person community experiences for the fall 2021 semester,” she said in a statement Wednesday. “Safety guided by science will remain a priority in the fall, and we will continue to carefully monitor the pandemic to make decisions accordingly.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJackson Township: Nothing, not even a global pandemic, can stop the team at Six Flags Great Adventure from entertaining guests year after year. The Jackson thrill park launches its 2021 season this month, with innovations necessitated by caution for COVID-19 still in place. “The pandemic required us to pivot and explore new ways to entertain, which included bringing back something from our past with a new twist,” said park marketing and public relations manager Kristin Fitzgerald. That something was the Six Flags Wild Safari Drive-Thru Adventure, which kicks off its season Saturday. The 4.5-mile trip across a 350-acre preserve housing approximately 1,200 animals resumed operation as a drive-thru experience in 2020 for the first time in nearly a decade. Across the park, COVID-19 safety measures remain in place, including a limit on daily attendance. All guests, including park members and season pass holders, must make advance reservations and are required to have been healthy for at least 14 days prior to visiting. All employees and guests older than 2 are required to wear masks covering their nose and mouth at all times, with the exception of designated mask break zones and in pools and waterpark attractions. Temperatures will be checked on arrival, and social distancing will be encouraged.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nKewa Pueblo: Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, made his first solo trip as the nation’s second gentleman Wednesday, stopping at a vaccination clinic in an Indigenous community in northern New Mexico and later meeting with a group of working mothers as part of an effort to promote the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package. Looking east toward snowcapped mountains, Emhoff told tribal leaders it was an honor for Kewa Pueblo to be his first stop in the state as he and other top Democrats have spent the past few days traveling and talking about the funding that will be trickling down to families, businesses, tribes, cities and state governments over the coming months. He watched as Kylea Garcia got her vaccination and took the opportunity to encourage others to do the same. “Get the vaccine when it’s your turn,” he said, “because it will save your life, and it will save the lives of others. It’s the right thing to do. It’s safe, it’s painless, and it’s going to help us all get through this pandemic.” Kewa Pueblo, formerly known as Santo Domingo Pueblo, has vaccinated more than 4,300 people, including most of its tribal members. At the heart of its efforts to combat COVID-19 has been the pueblo’s health clinic, which has been transitioning from testing and contact tracing to vaccinations. It recently opened a drive-thru for second doses.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Mayor Bill de Blasio got his COVID-19 shot Thursday, then ripped embattled Gov. Andrew Cuomo, accusing the fellow Democrat of letting his personal political crisis influence important decisions on pandemic restrictions. The mayor’s ire revolved around Cuomo’s decision Wednesday to lift a ban on indoor fitness classes – just a day after de Blasio said it was still unsafe for groups of people to exercise together indoors. “The state of New York continues to make decisions without consulting the city of New York or our health experts or any locality, and this is why we need local control,” said de Blasio, who has long chafed under Cuomo’s broad power to set coronavirus policy. De Blasio implied that Cuomo, who is facing sexual harassment allegations from several women, is easing coronavirus restrictions to curry favor with a virus-weary public. “Is this being done because of what the data and science is telling us, or is this being done for political reasons?” de Blasio asked. “Because it sure as hell looks like a lot of these decisions are being made by the governor because of his political needs.” Reporters were barred from a news briefing Thursday at which Cuomo announced a plan to let fans return to Yankees and Mets games this season.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A sizable group of college students will be eligible for a vaccine in April, under guidance from the state Department of Health and Human Services. When North Carolina drafted its initial COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan in October 2020, college students were listed as a priority, just ahead of the general public. When schools reopened in August, the cohort proved it had the ability to rapidly contribute to community spread and fuel outbreaks through off-campus parties. But in January, North Carolina bumped the group from the priority list amid a backlash from state lawmakers and encouragement from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to give stronger preference to older adults and those working in certain job sectors. On Tuesday, health officials released a statement saying college students who live on campus or in other congregate settings will be able to receive starting April 7, regardless of their age, health condition or employment status. “We want to prioritize those in congregate settings,” state health department secretary Mandy Cohen said at a news conference Wednesday. “We know that’s where the virus spreads fastest, so that is why we’re doing that prioritization. I don’t think there’s going to be a huge time difference.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring has announced that applications are again being accepted for 2021 Specialty Crop Grants due to additional one-time funding from a coronavirus relief package passed by Congress late last year. “Projects that solely enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops in North Dakota are eligible for these grants,” Goehring said. “We encourage organizations, institutions and individuals to submit proposals on their own or in partnerships.” North Dakota has not yet received an allocation amount from USDA’s Agriculture Marketing Service but is expected to receive it in the next few weeks. The North Dakota Department of Agriculture will distribute the funds through a competitive grant program. Goehring said an information manual with application instructions, scoring criteria and an application template can be found on NDDA’s website. Applications must be submitted in electronic form by 4 p.m. CDT April 7. Applications will then be reviewed, scored, ranked and provided to Agriculture Commissioner Goehring to determine which will be forwarded to USDA for final approval in May. Projects funded by the grants start Oct. 1, 2021, and must be completed by Sept. 30, 2023.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: High school juniors and seniors will be able to substitute their end-of-year grades for the statewide final exams as soon as the governor signs a bill passed nearly unanimously by the Ohio House and Senate on Wednesday. The legislation also waives the American history exam requirement, lets schools spend extra time administering all federally required tests and exempts home-schooled kids from yearly evaluations. “Our freshman and sophomore classes, though they were excluded, will still have time to meet the necessary requirements for graduation,” said Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond. The bill’s passage followed weeks of debate about how to modify state testing requirements for students during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Mike DeWine is expected to sign the bill. The original plan had been to let school districts choose whether they wanted to test kids at all. That idea became impossible in February when the Biden administration announced it wouldn’t be handing out waivers to federal testing requirements. So lawmakers quickly moved to determine how to test without harming students who’ve fallen behind during the pandemic. The exam results will be published by the Ohio Department of Education but won’t impact school rankings or eligibility for the EdChoice scholarship program.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The Muscogee (Creek) Nation Department of Health and the federal Indian Health Service said Wednesday that they will provide 4,000 vaccinations to all Native Americans and members of their households during a two-day clinic next week. Any member of a federally recognized tribe and members of their households, Native American or not, are eligible for an appointment, said Muscogee (Creek) Health Secretary Shawn Terry. The March 26-27 clinic will be held at River Spirit Expo Center, the Tulsa World reports. About 21,000 of the tribal nation’s estimated 65,000 Oklahoma citizens have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, and the clinic is an effort to reach out to a larger population of Native Americans, according to Terry. “It’s a way for us to do a large event in an urban setting and do it efficiently,” he said. The Oklahoma State Department of Health on Wednesday reported a total of 433,516 coronavirus cases since the pandemic began and nearly 1.5 million vaccinations. The federal Centers for Disease Control has reported 7,610 deaths in Oklahoma due to COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, according to the state health department.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: All adult residents will be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine beginning May 1, state health officials confirmed Wednesday. Last week, following President Joe Biden’s pledge to make all adults eligible for vaccines by May 1, Gov. Kate Brown said she would not change the state’s eligibility schedule until she was sure Oregon would receive enough vaccines. Since then officials said they have received an order from the United States Department of Health and Human Services that directs vaccination sites to make the change with eligibility. “We are following up with the administration for more specifics about when vaccine shipments to states will increase, but in a briefing with governors earlier this week, it was clear the White House has worked hard to secure additional vaccine supplies for states in the coming weeks,” Charles Boyle, a spokesman from the governor’s office, said Wednesday. Those who can currently receive the vaccine include health care workers, first responders, teachers and residents over age 65. People who are 45 or older with a preexisting condition, seasonal and migrant farmworkers, food processors, the homeless and those affected by last summer’s wildfires are scheduled to become eligible March 29.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Health officials on Thursday announced changes to the state’s vaccine provider map to make finding appointments more accessible. The provider map will now allow the public to easily see what pharmacies and providers have received first doses of vaccine each week, Executive Deputy Secretary of Health Keara Klinepeter said. “It is also important to remember that doses do not equal appointments,” she said. “Even if a provider has received an allocation of doses, the provider is the best source of information as to whether they have appointments available.” Klinepeter said the state intends to centralize information on which providers have appointments available onto the map in the coming weeks. That will be important as the state moves toward opening vaccination appointments to more Pennsylvanians by May 1. Acting Secretary of Health Alison Beam said the department is currently working to restructure where vaccine doses are being sent to make sure the most Pennsylvanians possible are receiving shots. Beam said Pennsylvania is ranked second in the nation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for number of doses administered per 100,000 residents statewide. In total, 1.3 million Pennsylvanians are fully vaccinated, and 2.5 million have gotten a first dose.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: All residents ages 16 and older will be eligible to get a COVID-19 vaccine starting April 19, Gov. Daniel McKee said Thursday. The change is possible because the state has learned it will be getting significantly more vaccine from the federal government in the near future, the Democratic governor said at a news conference. President Joe Biden promised last week that all the nation’s adults would be eligible by May 1. “If Rhode Island can get the vaccine supply we need, we can achieve and beat this goal,” he said. “We are confident the president will deliver.” He warned that it will likely take two weeks or so for everyone who wants an appointment to book one, but the goal is to provide a first dose of the vaccine to everyone who signs up by the end of May. The state has already given more than 282,000 vaccine first doses, while more than 136,000 people, or about 12% of the state population, have been fully vaccinated, state Department of Health Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott said. But she said mask-wearing is still important. If 70% of the state population is vaccinated, the state could lift COVID-19 emergency restrictions, McKee said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson: Clemson University is planning to have a mostly normal fall semester with more students in classrooms and more fans at football games. Thanks to weeks of low coronavirus spread on campus and the increased efforts of the state’s vaccine rollout, Clemson President Jim Clements announced the university would be almost all in-person next fall. “Almost all courses” will be offered completely in-person next semester, Clements said in a memo. This semester, about one-third of classes are completely in-person. Students and faculty will still be able to request virtual accommodations due to the coronavirus, but Clements said the school is banking on the community to be widely vaccinated by the time classes resume Aug. 18. Still, “we will continue to put the health of our staff, faculty, students, and community members first as we plan for the fall,” Clements said. Clemson spokesperson Joe Galbraith said the university will let employees and students continue to work from home only on a “case-by-case” basis. COVID-19 guidelines on capacity, masking and social distancing will remain in place until further notice, though, according to Galbraith.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The City Council has repealed an ordinance that required residents to put garbage containers curbside if their garbage hauler requested it. The ordinance, which was passed in April 2020 and repealed Tuesday evening in a 8-0 vote, was aimed at helping local garbage haulers facing workforce problems during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to save time during pickup. Its repeal means the city’s previous rules on garbage will once more be in effect, requiring garbage cans to be stored in an “inconspicuous place” and not put on the curb for pickup. Councilor Alex Jensen said he’d like to hear from Public Works at a future informational meeting about what they’d learned during that period and whether there were any changes that should or shouldn’t be considered.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Restaurant patrons can now sit eight to a table and dine until 1a.m., according to a new Shelby County health directive issued Wednesday. The directive, which goes into effect at midnight Saturday, still requires people seated together at restaurants to be from the same family or close contact group. Customers can stay until 1:30 a.m. to complete their meal or pay. Additionally, the Shelby County Health Department issued a new mask mandate, effective Wednesday, clarifying that people who cannot medically tolerate wearing a face covering do not have to wear a face shield. People declining to wear a face covering because of a medical condition are not required to show medical documentation. The mandate also clarifies that scarves, ski masks and balaclavas are not substitutes for masks, although coverings made of “suitable layered fabrics” are acceptable. Medical- or procedure-grade masks are recommended but not required.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: A woman who was recorded on police body camera video refusing to wear a mask at a bank last week was arrested Wednesday after declining to wear a mask inside another Texas business. Terry Wright, 65, already had a warrant out for her arrest after she refused to wear a mask in a Bank of America branch in Galveston last Thursday. On the video, she taunts the officer, asking if he’s going to arrest her. Police arrested Wright on Wednesday after she entered the Office Depot in Texas City and said she would not cover her nose and mouth to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, police spokesman Cpl. Allen Bjerke said. She was arrested on Galveston warrants for trespassing and resisting arrest, Bjerke said. Wright, of Grants Pass, Oregon, was taken into custody without incident, Bjerke said, noting that she was not charged for trespassing at the office supply store and that no additional charges were expected. Gov. Greg Abbott last week lifted statewide orders requiring people to wear face masks in public, declaring businesses should decide for themselves which COVID-19 precautions to take on their properties. Many businesses have kept their own mask rules in place.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: All adults can begin signing up for a COVID-19 vaccine next Wednesday – one week earlier than previously planned because the state has unallocated doses, Gov. Spencer Cox said Thursday. About 15% of the state’s supply isn’t being claimed by eligible people making appointments, the Republican governor said. He acknowledged that opening up eligibility so widely means there won’t be enough vaccines for all residents over 18 at first but the goal is to prevent vaccines from going unused. “We always want to keep demand above availability,” Cox said during a televised news conference on PBS-Utah. Utah teenagers 16 and older may also have a chance to get the Pfizer vaccine in some parts of the state starting next week too, Cox said. New coronavirus cases have been decreasing since January. More than 714,000 of the state’s 3.2 million residents have been fully vaccinated, according to state data. More than 380,000 virus cases have been reported in Utah, along with 2,041 known deaths, according to state data.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A committee of more than two dozen health care providers and advocates is calling for the immediate vaccination of the state’s prison inmates. WCAX-TV reports the memo from the COVID-19 Vaccine Implementation Advisory Committee to Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine, dated Monday, says inmates have little or no ability to protect themselves or demand better conditions. The memo comes as the Department of Corrections continues to cope with an outbreak of COVID-19 at the Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport, the state’s largest prison. Gov. Phil Scott has said inmates are vaccinated when they fit within the state’s guidelines for age or high-risk medical conditions. All inmates will be eligible for vaccination by the end of April. “There are dozens and dozens of groups, sectors and populations who have requested prioritization. A case can be made for each,” said Scott spokesperson Jason Maulucci. “But with a limited supply, everyone can’t be at the front of the line, so preservation of life must be the top priority.” On Wednesday, the Department of Corrections reported 12 new cases of the coronavirus at the Newport prison, 10 among inmates and two among staff. There are currently 40 cases among inmates and six among staff at the prison.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Schools and colleges can hold outdoor graduation ceremonies with as many as 5,000 attendees. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports Gov. Ralph Northam made the announcement Wednesday. The Democratic governor said Virginia will restrict capacity at outdoor ceremonies to 5,000 people or 30% of the venue’s capacity, whichever is lower. Indoor ceremonies will be capped at 500 people or 30% of the venue’s capacity. All attendees will need to wear masks and socially distance themselves. “While graduation and commencement ceremonies will still be different than they were in the past, this is a tremendous step forward for all of our schools, our graduates and their families,” Northam said in a statement. School districts and colleges across the state are still deciding how best to honor this year’s graduates, though Liberty University said Thursday that it will offer an outdoor, in-person ceremony and an online option. The University of Virginia is considering two proposals: holding an in-person graduation this spring with no guests or postponing graduation until guests can attend. Virginia Tech intends to host several in-person ceremonies with a restricted number of guests. It will also host an online ceremony.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A federal judge on Thursday dismissed an industry lawsuit that sought to block a $4-an-hour pay boost for Seattle grocery workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour issued the ruling after hearing oral arguments earlier in the day. “This is a big win for grocery store employees who have been critical and vulnerable frontline workers since the start of the pandemic,” City Attorney Pete Holmes said in a statement. The Seattle City Council in January approved the pay boost for workers at large grocery stores, to remain in effect as long as the city has a declared civil emergency related to the pandemic. Assistant City Attorney Jeremiah Miller told the judge the hazard pay was justified by the facts that the employees work among members of the public and are at higher risk of contracting the coronavirus and that grocery companies have made record profits during the pandemic. The judge rejected arguments by the Northwest Grocery Association and the Washington Food Industry Association that the pay increase interfered with collective bargaining and discriminated against large grocery stores. The industry warned that some stores would be unable to absorb the increased labor costs, especially those like Grocery Outlet that operate on smaller margins.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state Supreme Court won’t be making its annual trip to the West Virginia University College of Law in Morgantown this year as a result of COVID-19, but the special docket of cases will be heard virtually. The school and the court have made arrangements to allow students and the public to watch the arguments online, Chief Justice Evan Jenkins said in a news release. “We will miss being on campus next week and the opportunity to meet in person with the students, but the justices are committed to continuing our outreach efforts even in a COVID environment,” Jenkins said. Documents for the cases have been posted online. The arguments will be streamed Tuesday on the court’s YouTube channel through a link on the West Virginia judiciary website. The court also will judge the finals of the Baker Cup Moot Court appellate advocacy competition at 1 p.m. The final competition will also be livestreamed.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Implementing a new call center to help unemployed people 24 hours a day, seven days a week is moving ahead with the signing of a $1.2 million contract, Gov. Tony Evers’ administration announced Thursday. The state Department of Workforce Development received a $2.4 million federal grant that it is using to begin overhauling the 50-year-old computer system that Evers has blamed for causing delays in helping customers and getting out unemployment benefits amid the coronavirus pandemic. Problems with the state’s call center, which was unable to handle the massive spike in calls particularly early on in the pandemic, will be the first target for improvements with the system. Republicans have blamed the Democratic governor for not doing more sooner to address the problem, and a state audit showed less than 1% of calls to the hotline were answered by state officials. Evers fired Caleb Frostman, the former secretary of the department that handles unemployment claims, and pushed the Legislature to approve new funding to upgrade the computer system. Lawmakers have known for years that the department’s computer system and software were out of date, but the pandemic laid bare the problems. The department hopes to have the new call center up and running within six months.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Shots of COVID-19 vaccine are now available or soon will be for anybody over 18 in almost one-third of the state’s counties. In the past few months, vaccines have been available to health care workers, first responders, residents of long-term care facilities and senior citizens, among others. Vaccines are now widely available or close to being in eight of Wyoming’s 23 counties: Campbell, Converse, Fremont, Hot Springs, Johnson, Sheridan, Washakie and Weston, Wyoming Department of Health spokeswoman Kim Deti said Thursday. At the same time, anybody who qualified for a vaccine earlier can still get it, Campbell County Public Health Director Jane Glaser told the Gillette News Record. The department recently got almost $500,000 in federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act funding to help with vaccination clinic costs. “We were not getting complete supplies with the shipments of vaccines,” Glaser said. “We’ve had to use our own funds to purchase syringes and various things.” Campbell County Public Health has been doing three vaccination clinics per week, averaging between 260 and 300 vaccines per clinic. “We’re having a really good rollout with the vaccine so far, but it’s definitely not going to be over anytime soon,” Glaser said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/19"}]}

But that doesn't mean that LA will get left out in the cold.\n\nThe strangest Olympic bidding race in four decades will take clearer shape when the IOC board weighs opening up the 2024 contest to also include the 2028 award in September.\n\nThe expected agreement would fulfil IOC President Thomas Bach's wish to avoid making a loser of either world-class candidate, though it must be ratified by the Olympic body's voting members.\n\nBy meeting on Friday, the IOC can give the required month notice to upgrade an already scheduled 2024 campaign event in Lausanne into a formal session with rule-changing power. On July 11, up to 95 members are due in Lausanne to see LA and Paris bid leaders present their projects.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics: Follow USA TODAY’s coverage of the biggest names and stories of the Games.\n\nThe likely process lets IOC members retain their most important job of voting for Olympic hosts on Sept. 13 in Lima, Peru, to open the regular session. That's because the issue of which city gets 2024 and which must wait four more years will not be resolved Friday.\n\nStill, LA officials have set a tone suggesting they could accept 2028. That would help give the IOC clarity and security for the next decade after a turbulent period of cost overruns by Olympic host cities and local voters sinking potential bids, including some former rivals in the current contest.\n\n\"To be blunt, LA 2024 has never been only about LA or 2024,\" Casey Wasserman, chairman of the LA 2024 bid, said in a statement Thursday. \"Even when the issue of a dual award for the 2024 and 2028 Games was initially raised, we didn't say it's 'LA first' or it's 'now or never' for LA: that sounds like an ultimatum.\"\n\nParis, however, has stood by its claim that land to build a 1.7 billion euro ($1.9 billion) athletes village is guaranteed only for 2024.\n\nLos Angeles, Wasserman suggested, declined a similar strategy \"because we thought it was presumptuous to tell the IOC what to do and how to think. We're better partners than that.\"\n\nThe Paris bid declined requests to react to Wasserman's comments.\n\nThe IOC would prefer a consensus to emerge rather than impose a deal on the cities, and LA could be rewarded for being the most flexible.\n\n\"My dream is not so much just to bring the Olympics here, but is to bring youth sports for free to every zip code,\" LA Mayor Eric Garcetti said last week in confirming talks with the IOC to explore \"what it would take\" to agree which city would host first.\n\nBoth seek to follow London as three-time Olympic hosts. Paris hosted in 1900 and 1924, and Los Angeles in 1932 and 1984. Almost 40 years ago, LA was left as the only candidate when the Olympic hosting brand suffered in the 1970s.\n\nBach has sought to protect the IOC by driving the double award idea since December, though he asked his four vice presidents to draft a proposal for Friday's meeting.\n\nThe IOC president \"has done an excellent job of managing the process so far,\" Michael Payne, the Olympic body's former marketing director and a consultant to LA, told The Associated Press in Lausanne this week.\n\n\"I think you will get three winners out of it — the IOC and the two cities,\" Payne said, predicting that members would support a 2024-2028 award next month because \"there is increasing recognition that this is what has got to be done.\"\n\nThe 13-member board chaired by Bach has two American members — Anita DeFrantz and Angela Ruggiero. They should leave the room during the debate.\n\nIn other business Friday, the upcoming 2026 Winter Games bidding rules will be reviewed, with 2030 now also seeming in play if two strong candidates enter.\n\nNew medal events, led by 3-on-3 basketball, are also set to be added to the final 2020 Tokyo Olympic program.

Obviously we’ve shown that it’s a competitive sport. There’s other sports that aren’t as competitive and they’re not voted out.”\n\nTeammate Monica Abbott said she has seen the response on social media, that she’s heard from people from India, Slovenia and the Czech Republic who are trying to pitch like she does.\n\n“It hurts our sport that it’s going to be potentially another eight years, if not longer,” Abbott said. “Women thrive in this sport. You can be any age, size, shape, color in this sport. Softball does not discriminate and I think we deserve to be on the Olympic docket on a consistent basis.”\n\nThe IOC is aware of the concerns of those sports and the effects their status in the Olympics can have on funding and development, McConnell said, but offering flexibility to host cities is more important.\n\n“If we don’t do it that way, it means that a sport coming in is effectively committed to being in there and that makes the barrier to coming in even higher,” he said.\n\nSoftball may well get its chance on the Olympic stage again.\n\nLos Angeles is hosting in 2028, and softball – paired with baseball – seems a likely fit for those Games.

We asked what made the biggest impression during the 17 days of the Games?\n\nPARIS — It was an amazing experience to cover my first Olympic Games. As someone who for years has meticulously planned schedules to maximize my Olympic streaming at home, getting to be here in person was a joy and perhaps the highlight of my career.\n\nTwo memories stand out:\n\nPrior to covering the women’s synchronized platform diving competition, I was asked by a Chinese television station for an interview. They wanted my thoughts, as an American, about China’s diving tandem of Quan Hongchan, 17, and Chen Yuxi, 18. The request was as natural as if I’d asked them about Simone Biles or LeBron James. But I politely declined, explaining how I didn’t know much beyond names and reputations.\n\nOnce the competition began, though, I understood: These two are a very big deal. Their performing in tandem from a 10-meter platform was the most beautiful and impressive thing I witnessed in these Olympics. The synchronization was flawless and stunning. Of course, they won gold in a rout, and afterward, Chinese media swarmed the two teenagers, who sheepishly answered questions best they could between embarrassed smiles. It was a lesson to me about how sports can be both universal and surprisingly disparate. That on this big planet we’ve got, something so significant in one massive country can go mostly unnoticed in another.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics: Follow USA TODAY’s coverage of the biggest names and stories of the Games.\n\nI’ll admit, too, feeling a twinge of Olympic envy at the national pride displayed by other countries at venues (and the boisterous French fans in particular). Just because it feels like we’re such a mess back home, with too many influential politicians and polemics spreading anger and division for their own self-interest.\n\nI wish all Americans had been with me by the 18th green at Le Golf National, watching Scottie Scheffler, a PGA Tour star who has won millions, sob on the podium after winning a tournament worth only a tiny fraction of that amount in dollars. I can tell you that there is nothing like hearing the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" while in another country. Nothing. And when Scottie cried, my eyes watered up a bit, too. — Gentry Estes\n\nA trip to Normandy with USA Wrestling and a request for a cigarette\n\nPARIS — My first Olympics are in the books and the best way to describe them is as an exhaustively invigorating experience.\n\nI saw 16 different Olympic disciplines in my 19 full days on the ground, logged more miles on trains than I ever have in my life and came away grateful for the professional challenge. After more than a decade covering the Detroit Lions for the Detroit Free Press, it was an interesting change of pace to spend three weeks reporting on new sports and new people.\n\nTouring the Olympic Village was fascinating, watching world-class athletes win and lose and handle the highs and lows of competition was enlightening, and visiting Normandy with U.S. wrestler Mason Parris, whose great-grandfather stormed the beaches there 80 years ago, was an experience I won’t soon forget.\n\nBut what I’ll remember most about these Olympics are the people.\n\nThe Spanish soccer fans singing joyously on the train on their way to a game. The Australian kayak contingent dancing proudly on the banks of Vaires-sur-Marne Lake after their flag bearer, Jessica Fox, capped her career with gold. Even the Greek reporter (I think he was a reporter, at least) who burst into the media center looking to bum a cigarette for the country’s wrestling coach.\n\nThe long nights and early mornings weren’t always pleasant, and getting a text from my 9-year-old asking when I was coming home so we could play catch almost broke me. But the Olympics were a reminder of the joys, big and small, we all need in life no matter who we root for or where we're from. — Dave Birkett\n\n15 minutes of joy watching Katie Ledecky in 1,500\n\nPARIS — I’ve watched the fastest swimmers in the world compete for most of my life, but never in person until the Paris Olympics.\n\nProfessionally, covering the Olympics, and specifically Olympic swimming, wasn’t just a goal; it was the goal. And it wasn’t until the first night of swimming – watching Katie Ledecky, Ariarne Titmus and Summer McIntosh face off in the women’s 400 freestyle – that it hit me. I was finally there, watching it with my own eyes and able to ask my own questions.\n\nAnd it was exhilarating, better than I imagined, in large part thanks to the raucous fans creating the wildest atmosphere I’ve ever seen at a swim meet. Léon Marchand, Sarah Sjöström, Torri Huske and so many more stars made it the most incredible nine-day stretch of my professional life.\n\nAmong the many moments I’ll never forget was Ledecky dominating the 1,500 free like she does. But it was about more than watching her crush it.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I remember being so perplexed that women couldn’t swim the 1,500 — only men — in the Olympics. The longest distance for women in the pool was the 800. I swam my first mile when I was 10; why couldn’t the fastest women in the world do it at the Games? Finally in 2021 in Tokyo, it was added to the lineup.\n\nLedecky is the one and only women’s 1,500 Olympic champion, and that won’t be the case forever. But seeing her race in an event women were once thought to be too fragile for — following a correction of an antiquated mentality — was incredible.\n\nI got chills many times throughout Olympic swimming, but I think they were with me for all 15 1/2 minutes of the women’s 1,500. And my kid self was overjoyed seeing it in person. — Michelle Martinelli\n\nA gold medal for a dedicated volunteer at cycling\n\nGive Kalani Kayser a gold medal.\n\nThere were some 45,000 Paris Olympics volunteers, after all, more than four times the number of athletes. Surely the best of the best deserve a medal ceremony, and this judge is scoring Kayser's performance as a perfect 10.\n\nWhen the Games began, the first venue I was assigned to was the Grand Palais, which served as the media center for road cycling events. It's a massive, 56-floor Parisian landmark of 775,000 square feet, and it had to be navigated in one direction to reach the mixed zone, where reporters speak to athletes post-event, and an entirely different direction (and floor) to reach the press conference.\n\nOne wrong turn, and you're lost. So imagine the stress when I arrived to cover road cycling only to realize that A) My laptop Wi-Fi was failing, and B) poor signage and the sheer size of the Grand Palais gave me zero chance of finding the mixed zone and press conference on my own. Keep in mind, this trip was not only my first Olympics, but my first trip to Europe as well, and I arrived understanding about six words in French.\n\nKayser to the rescue.\n\nWith a warm smile and perfect English, the Colorado native not only helped me through the Wi-Fi snag, but also walked me − not pointing or spouting directions, but actually taking me − to the key locations I needed to be familiar with. All told, he probably spent an hour with me, and there were maybe eight volunteers trying to serve well over 100 media.\n\nHe was so helpful, I took note of his name. Told him I wouldn't forget him if I received an exit survey on volunteer help. I haven't gotten a survey.\n\nBut I've got this. Thanks, Kalani. — Chase Goodbread\n\nThe smallest Olympic fans in Paris and the athletes I'll remember\n\nPARIS — I get asked frequently what the best part of my job is. My answer remains the same, no matter the assignment or the venue: It’s the people.\n\nWhether we’re talking about athletes, coaches, colleagues or fans, it’s always the people — and often, their kindness — who leave the biggest impression. That’s definitely been the case for me in covering my first Olympics.\n\nIt started before Paris, when I was chatting with Jordan Larson, one of the best volleyball players in the history of the U.S. She asked if Paris would be my first Olympics. When I said yes, she responded with enthusiasm, telling me she couldn’t wait to hear what I thought, gushing about how much fun I would have because there’s nothing quite like watching people from all over the globe come together to celebrate sport.\n\nI’ve found her to be more than accurate.\n\nI’ll remember people like Ashleigh Johnson, the best water polo goalie in the world, talking about her sport’s weird, wonderful new relationship with rapper Flavor Flav and her passionate insistence that he would help bring new eyeballs to water polo.\n\nFrom track, I’ll remember Gabby Thomas’ joy at the finish line and Sam Kendricks’ smirk.\n\nI’ll remember the fans, too, particularly the home crowd’s volume. I think I’m going home to Portland, Oregon, having permanently lost my hearing thanks to hundreds of thousands of French residents. Will it be like that in Los Angeles in 2028 with Americans screaming themselves hoarse? I hope so.\n\nMy biggest takeaway from the Games – other than the fact that you will climb more stairs than you ever have in your life – is that there’s no party like a Brazilian crowd party.\n\nI’ll remember the littlest Olympic fans too, from the toddlers hanging around USA Basketball to the young kids able to spend time with their parents in the first-ever nursery in the Athlete Village (provided, fittingly, by super mom and super Olympian Allyson Felix).\n\nMostly I’ll remember the 4-year-old boy on one of the many trains I took, visiting from Spain and going to every Olympic event his parents could get tickets to. “I’m going to weightlifting!” He told me, doing his best Hulk flex.\n\nWill he be an Olympian some day? I hope I get to cover more Games and find out. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nGetting comfortable on the red carpet and interviewing US stars\n\nI tucked my hair behind my ears, took a deep breath and stepped onto the red carpet. Well, technically it wasn’t an actual carpet but instead a chic track that twisted around the egg-shaped Louis Vuitton Foundation. I was waiting with my colleague Sandy Hooper for some of the biggest celebrities and athletes in the world to arrive, and she could sense my nerves.\n\n\"Relax,\" she said. \"They’re just people.\"\n\nThis is a mantra I frequently repeated to myself throughout my first Olympics as Paris reminded the world what a Games is supposed to be – a glamorous intersection between celebrities, the best athletes in the world and normal people like you or me.\n\nThroughout my experience reporting on the ground in Paris I’ve been floored by the way that the city made these Games a spectacle that all attendees could experience, not just the VIPs. From purple and pink arenas, to the utilization of famous architecture like the Grand Palais, to hosting the opening ceremony on the Seine, there’s a special energy and awe felt by all spectators.\n\nBy the end of the Games, I was interviewing gold medalists with ease, making jokes about the weight of their medals and chatting with their parents. I talked to Simone Biles about the boot on her foot and got told I was nosey. I asked Stephen Nedoroscik about what it’s like to become an internet sensation. And when I asked Tara Davis-Woodhall what kind of summer she was having, she smiled and responded with \"a golden one.\"\n\nAnd I think that sums it up better than I ever could. This summer was golden for the USA, for athletes, for celebrities, for fans, and for our mighty team of journalists here in Paris. — Sydney Bergan\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast.Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2022/05/02/salt-lake-sapporo-head-race-to-2030-olympics-and-maybe-34/50173537/", "title": "Salt Lake, Sapporo head race to 2030 Olympics, and maybe '34", "text": "AP\n\nFraser Bullock, who leads Salt Lake City's bid to return the Winter Olympics to Utah, sounds very confident about success.\n\n“I believe we'll host a future Game(s). It's a question of when,” he said last week in a local television interview.\n\nBut will it be in 2030, the first opening on the IOC calendar? Or might the International Olympic Committee make a double award and also name the 2034 host? When it had two strong candidates 4 1/2 years ago for the Summer Games, the IOC selected Paris for the 2024 Olympics and Los Angeles for 2028.\n\nThe IOC isn't saying. An announcement is expected early next year, with media reports in Salt Lake City suggesting a decision in May 2023.\n\n“I've obviously got my fingers crossed for 2030, but whenever we're asked to host them, we'll be ready,” Bullock told the Deseret News in Utah.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics: Follow USA TODAY’s coverage of the biggest names and stories of the Games.\n\nThe Associated Press requested an interview with Bullock but was told he was talking only to local media. Bullock was the No. 2 to Mitt Romney when Salt Lake City hosted the 2002 Games.\n\nUnder its revised but opaque bid process, the IOC appears to have four possible candidates. Three have held Winter Olympics before: Sapporo (1972), Salt Lake City (2002), and Vancouver (2010). There is also interest from Barcelona, which held the 1992 Summer Games and could propose a bid with regions in the Pyrenees.\n\nAn IOC “technical team” was in Salt Lake City last week inspecting venues, and is in Vancouver this week. Meanwhile, a similar visit to Spain is reported to have been delayed.\n\nSapporo is not known to have a technical visit lined up, but a Japanese bid would have to be among the favorites after officially spending $13.6 billion to organize the one-year delayed Tokyo 2020 Olympics. At least 60% was public money and probably more, with government audits showing Olympics costs were higher than reported.\n\nA study by the University of Oxford says Tokyo was the most expensive Olympics on record.\n\nSapporo has organized an “All Japan” conference next week, led by former Prime Minister Taro Aso to promote the bid and showcase the backing of government and Japanese business.\n\nSalt Lake City puts the cost of the Games at $2.2 billion, and Sapporo has a similar figure — $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. However, Olympic expenditures typically overrun estimates, and accurately predicting costs a decade from now is impossible.\n\nThe Winter Games have become a tough sell for the IOC. The choice for 2022 came down to Almaty, Kazakhstan, and Beijing after a half-dozen European candidates dropped out after failed public referendums, or fears about costs.\n\nNeither Sapporo nor Salt Lake City will hold referendums. Sapporo Mayor Katsuhiro Akimoto has said surveys of 10,000 people — online, on-street and by post — show support at between 52% and 65%, Akimoto has given no details of the methodology or the reliability of the surveys.\n\nThe Vancouver council last month declined to put a referendum on the ballot for an October municipal election. Vancouver's proposal is being called the first “Indigenous-led” bid for an Olympics, with First Nations people of Canada planning a feasibility study.\n\nMark Conrad, who teaches sports law and ethics at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, told the AP that a joint award seemed possible. He is not involved in the process and watches an an outsider.\n\n“Salt Lake City facilities remain from 2002 and are used, and in good shape,” Conrad said, also noting strong public support for the bid. “But the IOC owes Japan big-time and I believe that many facilities may be there or shared via Nagano.”\n\nNagano held the 1998 Winter Olympics and paid off the debt from those Games several years ago.\n\nWith the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028, it would be unusual for the IOC to stay in the United States for the 2030 Winter Games. However, if sponsorship is strong, it might change course. The IOC also generates much of its broadcast revenue from North America.\n\nIOC President Thomas Bach, who leaves office in 2025, might also prefer to leave the awarding of 2034 to his successor.\n\nThe 2030 and 2034 Winter Olympics are the only Games open on the immediate Olympic calendar. Paris, Los Angeles and Brisbane, Australia, are lined up for the next three Summer Olympics.\n\nItaly's Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo will hold the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe IOC has tried to streamline its bid process, partially because of bribery scandals linked to the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, and Tokyo in 2019 that forced the resignation of IOC member Tsunekazu Takeda.\n\nA bribery scandal also soiled the selection of Salt Lake City.\n\nThe host-city selection has been largely taken out of the hands of rank-and-file IOC members who will be asked to rubber-stamp the recommendation of the IOC's executive board.\n\nThe IOC technical team in Salt Lake City was not made available to the media, and members' names were not disclosed. Members of the technical team were not believed to be IOC members. The IOC said that members who are on the Future Host Commission were not “on-site.”\n\n“The IOC meets regularly, in person or virtually, with interested parties and potential hosts of the Olympic Games and Olympic Winter Games,” the IOC said in a statement. “The IOC respects the confidentiality of all these discussions.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/winter-olympics and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2017/07/05/olympic-panel-praises-outstanding-la-paris-hosting-plans/103439744/", "title": "Olympic panel praises 'outstanding' LA, Paris hosting plans", "text": "Associated Press\n\nGENEVA (AP) — Los Angeles and Paris have been praised by an International Olympic Committee panel for having \"outstanding\" plans to host the 2024 Summer Games.\n\nStorytelling skills and cutting-edge technologies from LA, plus \"stunning backdrops\" in Paris where the modern Olympics was reborn, were anticipated eagerly by an IOC evaluation commission which assessed the bidders in a 180-page dossier and 15-minute video published Wednesday.\n\n\"Their candidatures have put the Olympic Movement in a win-win situation, with very little to separate the two projects,\" said Patrick Baumann, the panel chairman and an IOC member.\n\nBoth cities should get hosting rights for the 2024 or 2028 Olympics on Sept. 13, at the IOC's annual meeting being held in Lima, Peru.

Many events would take place in the city center, and use the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe and Louvre art gallery as a backdrop.\n\nLA's privately-financed project scored better than Paris, which calls for hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money, in the IOC's own polling of public support for hosting the Summer Games.\n\nIt is always unclear in Olympic bidding contests how much the technical analysis of candidates' plans affect the choice of more than 85 IOC members eligible to vote.\n\nStill, Los Angeles and Paris have long been viewed as high-class, low-risk options. The IOC has seemed grateful to have them after years of spiraling spending and cost overruns by host cities, and public opposition that ended other bids.\n\nIOC President Thomas Bach has pushed for a double award since December, aiming to seize the chance of stability for the next decade.\n\nSeeking to avoid construction costs and risks of creating white elephant venues, LA and Paris are praised for proposing to use existing and temporary arenas for 97 and 93 percent, respectively, of their Summer Games' needs.\n\nThe only permanent venue yet to be built in Los Angeles is the $2.6 billion stadium in Inglewood to be shared by the NFL's Rams and Chargers. It would host the opening ceremony on July 19, 2024.\n\nPlans for an athletes' village have been a potentially key difference between the bids.\n\nLA proposes to use existing student accommodation at UCLA described by Baumann's team as \"outstanding in all aspects.\"\n\nThe Paris plan to build a $1.45 billion village near the Stade de France, which would host track and field plus the opening ceremony on Aug. 2, 2024. The village has shaped up as the riskiest project in either bid, though it will be underwritten by the national government.\n\nHowever, the IOC panel described its \"idyllic waterfront setting\" and praised the plan to convert the athletes' residence into \"much-needed housing ... in one of the youngest, most diverse areas of the city.\"\n\nLA scored better than Paris in the IOC-commissioned polls conducted in February which sought the opinions of 1,800 adults at city, regional and national level.\n\nIn the city of LA, 78 percent of residents supported the project and 8 percent were opposed. In Paris, it was 63 percent for and 23 percent against.\n\nParis was judged stronger on public transport, with the IOC panel praising the \"amazing feature in such a huge metropolis\" of \"high-capacity public transport within 400 meters of every venue.\"\n\nBoth cities have full government guarantees to plan and fund security for the games, the report said, noting that the current risk levels are \"high\" in Paris and \"low to medium\" in Los Angeles.\n\nDetails of the dossier will be pored over in Lausanne next week, with the IOC members expected to vote for awarding both games at the same time.\n\nIf they do, the choice of the host cities may even be agreed among the two bidders informally, ahead of the meeting in Lima.\n\n\"Both cities are open to being approached by the IOC after such a vote to discuss how to achieve a win-win-win.\" Bach said last month.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2022/07/08/us-olympic-leaders-tab-former-la28-ceo-gene-sykes-as-chair/50468995/", "title": "US Olympic leaders tab former LA28 CEO Gene Sykes as chair", "text": "AP\n\nThe U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee chose Gene Sykes as its next chairman Friday, elevating the former CEO of the Los Angeles 2028 organizing committee to a role that will shape policy throughout America's Olympic movement for the next four years and beyond.\n\nDetails of the board vote were not immediately released. Sykes was vying for the seat against Dexter Paine, a current board member with deep ties to the ski community and the more than 50 national governing bodies that run the individual sports across America.\n\nBut the board chose Sykes, who built relationships in the international community during a process that started with LA trying for the 2024 Games, then landing the Olympics for 2028 in a complicated deal with the IOC that reshaped the bid process.

The management team led by CEO Sarah Hirshland must shuffle the priorities of athlete safety, athlete performance, fundraising, a potential bid for the Winter Games in Salt Lake City and the direction of the LA organizing committee, which now runs sponsorship and revenue initiatives.\n\nThe conflicts inherent in all those competing agendas — for instance, the Larry Nassar sex-abuse scandal, which led the USOPC to place increased responsibilities on NGBs despite essentially flat budgets — came to the fore last month at the federation’s annual assembly.\n\nA recurring theme from NGB leaders was that they were being asked to do more with less, and that the USOPC leadership was not squaring with them about how the money is divvied up.\n\n“We didn’t give them extra money to hire a lot of staff,” Lyons told The Associated Press in an interview last month. “So they’re trying to make do with the same money, but they have more things to do. So, you have to grow the pie.”\n\nThe marketing for the USOPC is now in the hands of the LA 2028 committee, which makes the former leader of the overall enterprise a seemingly natural fit.\n\n“The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee is an integral partner for the LA28 Games, and I look forward to collaborating with Gene over the coming years to celebrate and strengthen the Olympic and Paralympic movement in the U.S.,” LA28 chair Casey Wasserman said in a statement.\n\nSykes’ election might draw some loose connections to Peter Ueberroth’s term as chair. But Ueberroth became chair two decades after he shaped the successful LA 1984 Olympics — the games that restored a faltering Olympic movement across the globe.\n\nNearly four decades later, the Olympics are under pressure again — a reality best illustrated by dismal TV ratings for both last year’s Summer Games in Tokyo and this year’s Winter Games in Beijing.\n\nEveryone at the USOPC is well aware that a shrinking fan base will ultimately spell huge trouble both for the U.S. team and the movement overall. It’s the key issue Sykes will be tasked with when he officially takes the job on Jan. 1.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2017/04/02/la-paris-head-to-2024-olympics-event-unsure-of-iocs-goal/99949994/", "title": "LA, Paris head to 2024 Olympics event unsure of IOC's goal", "text": "AP\n\nGENEVA (AP) — As the IOC moves the goalposts in the 2024 Olympic contest, bid leaders from Los Angeles and Paris head to a campaign event in Denmark on Tuesday unsure of exactly what they are shooting for.\n\nWhile both cities are bidding for the 2024 Games, the 2028 hosting rights are also in play, according to IOC President Thomas Bach.\n\nLA and Paris will send 12-member delegations to lobby and make 10-minute presentations in Aarhus at a conference of global Olympic sports officials — the first of only three set-piece events ahead of the IOC's scheduled decision in September.\n\nThe audience will include some of the near 100-strong IOC membership who normally pick host cities.\n\nThe 2024 campaign is no longer normal.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics: Follow USA TODAY’s coverage of the biggest names and stories of the Games.\n\nWhen Bach lamented in December a bidding process that produced \"too many losers,\" he sparked speculation of a mid-game rule change to allow awarding both the 2024 and 2028 Games, and so avoid letting a coveted potential host slip away.\n\nBach has only fueled the idea since, and last month said \"all options are on the table\" when he asked the four IOC vice presidents to examine change. They should report back in July, days before the next bid presentation event in the IOC's home city of Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nLos Angeles and Paris, and their armies of retained Olympic consultants, now have to include strategizing for which games to get in a contest that no longer seems winner-take-all.\n\n\"We can't accept '28,\" Paris bid co-chairman Tony Estanguet said in London two weeks ago. \"It's not possible. Either the IOC family wants to choose Paris for '24 or we will not come back for '28.\"\n\nLA bid chairman Casey Wasserman has taken a more cooperative public line, and published an article Friday titled: \"An opportunity, not an ultimatum.\"\n\nStill, Wasserman's message concluded: \"LA's vision for 2024 is relevant now, and cannot wait until 2028.\"\n\nBach will be in Aarhus on Monday and see the bid city mayors — Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles and Anne Hidalgo of Paris — for a \"routine meeting\" with each, the IOC said in a statement.\n\nIt is unclear which of the four-man panel of IOC VPs will attend the week-long conference, or even seek out bid leaders. Bach has said they could decide how and when to consult the candidates.\n\nAlso in Aarhus will be the IOC member, Patrick Baumann of Switzerland, overseeing evaluation of how the cities' technical operating plans shape up.\n\nBaumann chaired a two-day meeting in Lausanne last week, ahead of his team's three-day visits to the cities in May. As expected, he declared both \"great cities\" that \"would deliver an excellent experience for athletes, spectators and other Games participants.\"\n\nThe IOC news release carrying Baumann's comments referred three times in the top four paragraphs to \"Olympic Agenda 2020.\" The big idea of Bach's presidency, it is designed to cut costs of bidding and hosting an Olympics after a decade of budget overruns and huge-spending vanity projects.\n\nThe 2024 vote on Sept. 13 in Lima, Peru, is at the exact mid-point of Bach's eight-year first term and will help define it.\n\nLA has pushed the idea that its privately funded project with no major construction needs — eliminating white elephants — better fits Bach's vision for safeguarding the Olympic future. Paris proposes some taxpayer spending in a 3 billion euro ($3.2 billion) budget for infrastructure, including an athletes village that bid leaders say is on a site that cannot wait four more years.\n\n\"This bid campaign isn't about whether a city is capable of hosting the Games? —? it's about which city is best suited to serve the future of the Olympic Movement,\" Wasserman wrote on Friday.\n\nThe candidates' rival visions — though perhaps not the IOC's — should be a little clearer by Tuesday evening.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2022/12/14/winter-olympics-focus-on-climate-change-rotating-hosts/51072585/", "title": "Winter Olympics focus on climate change, rotating hosts", "text": "AP\n\nTo hear the world's Olympic leaders tell it, the bidding for future Winter Games has been jumbled by internal disputes at India's Olympic committee, a newfound affinity for streamlining the bidding process and, most recently, a long-overdue nod to the impact of climate change.\n\nLeft unsaid might be the biggest reason of all: It's becoming nearly impossible to find any place, outside of Salt Lake City, that truly wants to host these events.\n\nIt's a reality that has been building for decades, and one the IOC said could reach a tipping point soon, when its Olympic Games executive director, Christophe Dubi, raised the idea at a meeting last week that the narrow list of eligible cities could be narrowed further by the realities of a warming planet with fewer mountain towns that can realistically host the Games.\n\nThat, in turn, leads to the idea that the Olympics could someday be rotated between a handful of cities — an idea that long has been floated for both summer and winter as the bloated budgets and overbuilt infrastructure of Olympic hosts becomes as inevitable as the lighting of the flame.\n\n“No conclusion has been reached yet, as this needs further debate,” Dubi said.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics: Follow USA TODAY’s coverage of the biggest names and stories of the Games.\n\nFor now, the plan appears to be to award the Games for 2030 and 2034 at the same time, much the way the IOC awarded Paris and Los Angeles the 2024 and 2028 Summer Games simultaneously five years ago while facing a similarly shrinking pool of potential bidders.\n\nWhen the dual award for the upcoming Winter Games might be come is TBD. (The 2026 Olympics will be held in Italy.) They were supposed to be decided at next year's IOC meeting in India, but that get-together has been postponed indefinitely due to fractures inside the country's Olympic committee that must be healed before the IOC will commit to a date.\n\nThe postponement gave the IOC a convenient reason to hold off on the decision.\n\nAmong the three cities that have put forth serious proposals to host, only Salt Lake City's bid appears ready. Earlier this year, the provincial government in British Columbia delivered a near-death blow to a bid in Vancouver, saying the $1.2 billion in public funding needed was too big a bill. And Sapporo, Japan, is still in the mix, though questions persist about public support to bring an Olympics back to that country so soon after the COVID-19-delayed and corruption-tainted Summer Games held in 2021.\n\nIf the IOC has its way, it would lock in Sapporo and Salt Lake as soon as possible, then try to figure out next steps, which would presumably include finding a European town or two that would be willing to get into the mix.\n\n“The way it was presented, is saying by a double allocation, we would win some time to then establish a sound rotation system,\" IOC President Thomas Bach said of the process explained to IOC executives by Dubi's organizing group.\n\nIt's conceivable that one host in a far-off rotational system could come from Asia, even though the last three Winter Games have been held on that continent in a twist that underscored the weakness of the franchise.\n\nFirst, the time zone made it a ratings killer in the West, where NBC pays big bucks to televise the Games in the United States. Second, two of those Olympics were held in authoritarian countries, Russia and China. Those countries essentially produced blank checks (more than $50 billion for Sochi; unknown for Beijing) and zero moral compass (Russia spawned an international doping crisis, while China used the COVID-19 pandemic as a rationale to be even more opaque than usual) to produce Olympics that came off as less-than-satisfying for many participants and viewers. Would the IOC have the stomach to make those countries permanent hosting partners?\n\nAlso, there were only two bidders for 2022 — China and Kazakhstan — which left the IOC dealing with the embarrassing reality that no one in the West wants to do this anymore.\n\nExcept, it seems, for Salt Lake City.\n\nThe rotation system — something many Olympic watchers feel is long overdue — could be an easier sell for the Winter Games due to climate change. Though much was made of this year's Olympics being held entirely on fake snow, snowmaking has long been a staple of Winter Games not only because there isn't enough of the real stuff, but because it is easier to shape and form into ski and snowboard courses.\n\nMore relevant is a recent study in “Current Issues in Tourism” that projected that without a dramatic reduction of global emissions of greenhouse gases, only one of the previous 21 Winter Olympics sites would be able to reliably provide fair and safe conditions by the end of this century.\n\n“To take a pause in the process to have that greater conversation, to look at the research and to see how it is affecting the movement on the winter side, as well as the summer side, is an important step for what they’re doing at this point,” said the chair of the Salt Lake bid, Catherine Raney-Norman.\n\nLeaders at the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee welcomed the IOC debate about a possible new format. Though Lake Placid and Denver occasionally get serious about getting into the hosting business, CEO Sarah Hirshland left no doubt about Salt Lake City's standing in that conversation.\n\n“We all collectively had a smile on our faces as we came out of that news,\" Hirshland said. “It is a region and a part of the country that will always be ready to host these Games.”\n\nThe bigger question is — who else is?\n\nIn Europe, Stockholm and Barcelona are among those that have gotten in, then out, of the bidding game in recent cycles. Given the recent trends in international sports hosting, it's wise to keep an open mind. Saudi Arabia recently won rights to stage the 2029 Asian Winter Games. It is spending $500 billion to build a winter wonderland that the host claims will be carbon neutral but that has received scorn and ridicule from nearly every other corner of the globe.\n\nThe IOC said it was never consulted about that arrangement and that its priorities are sustainability and reducing costs. Which sounds like a “No” when what it really needs are a few more places to say “Yes.”\n\n___\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/winter-olympics and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2021/02/24/australian-bid-put-on-ioc-fast-track-to-host-2032-olympics/115501612/", "title": "Australian bid put on IOC fast track to host 2032 Olympics", "text": "AP\n\nGENEVA (AP) — Did the Australian city of Brisbane just get picked as the host of the 2032 Olympics?\n\nIt looked that way Wednesday when the International Olympic Committee named the bid centered on the coastal city in the state of Queensland as its preferred candidate.\n\nThe decision by the IOC's executive board puts Brisbane on a fast-track to victory 11 years ahead of the games and before several expected rival candidates have publicly developed their plans.\n\nOfficials in Brisbane, Queensland and the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) will now begin “targeted dialogue” with an IOC panel overseeing a reformed bidding process.\n\nThe IOC's new bidding process, developed in part by Australia's top Olympic official, seeks to find a winning host more efficiently and avoid turning other campaigns into expensive losers.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics: Follow USA TODAY’s coverage of the biggest names and stories of the Games.\n\nThe 2032 race was expected to include bids from Doha, Qatar -- which is hosting the 2030 Asian Games -- and Budapest, Hungary. Neither has launched a formal bid yet, and Wednesday’s decision will likely be a deterrent for either to enter the race.\n\n“This decision is not a decision against anybody,\" IOC president Thomas Bach said at a news conference. \"This is just a decision in favor of one interested party at this moment in time.”\n\nIf Brisbane is eventually approved by the full IOC membership, potentially next year, it would cap the second straight unconventional bidding process for the Summer Games.\n\nParis and Los Angeles were awarded the 2024 and 2028 editions, respectively, at the same time when in 2017 the IOC changed its rules mid-contest to allow a double award.\n\nBudapest's late withdrawal from the 2024 contest paved the way for Los Angeles being offered the 2028 edition unopposed.\n\nThe process was changed again for the 2032 Olympics to speed up the selection. The IOC wanted to move away from two-year bidding campaigns that ended with a host being picked seven years before the games in a contested vote.\n\nThese were typically expensive for cities, often ended with rejection of the Olympic brand by voters in local referendums, and invited controversy including allegations of vote-buying.\n\n“This (former process) was not the best procedure, neither not for the future of the games nor for the reputation of the IOC,” Bach said Wednesday, aiming critical comments at consultants and lobbyists hired by candidates.\n\nIn 2019, the IOC created panels for each of the Summer and Winter Games to enter into rolling dialogue with possible candidates and even approach bidders. The panels can recommend a host that may now be picked without a contested vote.\n\n“We cannot, I suggest, continue to be damaged as we have in the past,” John Coates, a veteran IOC member, said in 2019 while presenting the new bid process he helped shape at Bach's invitation.\n\nQueensland's quick progress raised questions about possible conflicts of interest for Coates, who has led the Australian Olympic Committee for more than 30 years.\n\nCoates returned to the IOC board last year as a vice president and is viewed as one of Bach's closest allies. He also leads the IOC's oversight of preparations for the postponed Tokyo Olympics this year.\n\nAsked about the perception of Coates's role in creating a process that first benefited Australia, Bach said his colleague was not involved in the board's debate Wednesday.\n\n“This is best practice that whenever a conflict of interest arises you solve it by not participating in related discussions or decisions,\" the IOC president said.\n\nChina, Germany, India, Indonesia and Russia had also worked on possible bids for 2032.\n\n“It’s not a done deal\" for Brisbane, said Kristin Kloster Aasen, on IOC member from Norway who chairs the panel that engages with potential Summer games bidders. \"But it’s progress made today.”\n\n“The decision to advance the process was taken now given the uncertainty the world is facing at this moment and which is expected to continue even after the COVID-19 health crisis is over,” she said.\n\nThe IOC urges hosts to avoid building white elephant projects and control spending which typically overshoots the budget target set during a bid.\n\nThe government-backed Queensland bid was made more likely after hosting the Commonwealth Games — a two-week multi-sport event for former British Empire countries — at Gold Coast in 2018.\n\nKloster Aasen praised the region's existing venues, experience in sports hosting sports and a favorable climate in July and August, when average temperatures in Brisbane, a city of about 2.5 million people, peak at around 22 Celsius (71 Fahrenheit).\n\nThe 2000 Sydney Olympics, which Coates helped bid for and organize, was also a popular recent success for the Summer Games.\n\n\"We are very clear that we must continue to work hard in outlining our vision for a successful Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2032,“ Coates said in an Australian Olympic body statement.\n\nCoates was to attend a media conference in Brisbane on Thursday morning with Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and other officials.\n\nPeter Conde, chairman of the Australian Institute of Sport, said Australia is well-placed to host a successful Olympics because of a more united sporting system and a sharpened focus on athlete development.\n\n“There is no doubt that the build-up to Sydney 2000 united Australian sport and the AIS, along with our state and territory partners, have taken positive steps over the past few years to further enhance our collaboration,” Conde said.\n\nCOVID-19 has impacted sport participation and volunteering, but Sport Australia chief executive Rob Dalton said the next decade was shaping up as one of the most inspiring periods for Australian sport.\n\n“Things have been tough, but we’ve said all along that sport will play a prominent role in lifting the nation’s energy and spirits again, and there are few events that can match the inspiration of a home Olympic and Paralympic Games,” Dalton said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2021/07/21/brisbane-picked-to-host-2032-olympics-without-a-rival-bid/47852053/", "title": "Brisbane picked to host 2032 Olympics without a rival bid", "text": "AP\n\nTOKYO (AP) — Brisbane was picked Wednesday to host the 2032 Olympics, the inevitable winner of a one-city race steered by the IOC to avoid rival bids.\n\nThe Games will go back to Australia 32 years after the popular 2000 Sydney Olympics.

For the latest news on Ernesto as it moves across the Caribbean, view USA TODAY's story on the storm for Thursday, Aug. 15.\n\nErnesto intensified into a Category 1 hurricane Wednesday as it churned north of Puerto Rico, where it unleashed torrential rain and damaging winds that triggered flash flood warnings and cut power to nearly half the island.\n\nAs of 11 p.m. ET, Ernesto had left Puerto Rico well behind and was 175 miles northeast of Grand Turk island, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm was about 690 miles south-southwest of Bermuda, a British island territory, and moving northwest near 16 mph with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph.\n\nErnesto could become a Category 3 hurricane by Friday before approaching Bermuda on Saturday, according to the NHC. The Bermuda Weather Service issued a hurricane watch.\n\nForecasters warned of rainfall and flash flooding later in the week with possible hurricane conditions in Bermuda on Saturday. Though Ernesto is expected to remain offshore on the U.S. East Coast, the NHC said swells are forecast to reach the region into the weekend — increasing the risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents.\n\nThe storm pummeled Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands through much of Wednesday, quickly dumping several inches of rain. All told, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands were in line for widespread rainfall of up to 6 inches, while the total for southeastern Puerto Rico could climb to as much as 8 to 10 inches.\n\nPuerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said the power outages also left more than 200,000 homes and businesses without water.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for Puerto Rico, ordering the federal government to assist in local response efforts. Ahead of the storm, officials in Puerto Rico closed government offices, shuttered schools, activated the National Guard, and opened hundreds of shelters.\n\nForecasters expect Ernesto to drift for a couple of days along the warm waters of the western Atlantic toward Bermuda before eventually developing into a major hurricane and remaining far east of the continental U.S.\n\nStart your day smart: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing newsletter.\n\nErnesto:Track where the storm is heading as it barrels towards Puerto Rico\n\nSign up to get updates about current storms and weather events by location.\n\nHundreds of thousands left without power in Puerto Rico\n\nAs many as 730,000 utility customers — almost exactly half the total in the U.S. territory — were out of power at one point Wednesday after Ernesto brought tropical storm-level winds and heavy rain to the island of more than 3 million American citizens.\n\nBy 8 p.m. ET, the blackouts were down to 649,000, still 44% of homes and businesses, according to LUMA Energy, the operator of Puerto Rico’s power grid. The company serves 1.47 million customers.\n\n\"We are on the road to reestablish service,\" said LUMA President Juan Saca, who did not have an estimate for when that might happen across the island but said 1,500 company employees were working at it. By Wednesday evening, more than 60% of customers still didn't have electricity in four of LUMA's seven regions.\n\nBlackouts have been commonplace in Puerto Rico ever since Hurricane Maria destroyed the power grid in 2017.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, mudslides and cows wading through neck-high floodwater\n\nThe numerous flash-flood warnings across Puerto Rico for most of Wednesday provided an indication of the soaked landscape left behind by Ernesto, but not nearly as vivid as the sight of cows wading through neck-high water.\n\nThat was the image captured on video by El Nuevo Dia, Puerto Rico's leading newspaper, which said rising waters in the Gurabo River − in the east-central part of the island − forced the cows to \"fight for their lives.\"\n\nThe newspaper also reported that heavy rains caused mudslides and left some municipalities without drinkable water, and numerous roads throughout the island have become impassable because of flooding and fallen trees or other objects, like power lines. More than 80 medical facilities, including at least 20 hospitals, were running on generators because of the outages, El Nuevo Dia reported.\n\nTemperatures of up to 94 degrees and humidity in the low 80s are forecast for San Juan over the next several days and into next week, making for miserable conditions for the hundreds of thousands without power.\n\nErnesto knocks out power throughout the US Virgin Islands\n\nTwo of the three U.S. Virgin Islands – St. John and St. Croix – were completely in the dark Wednesday as officials worked to restore service in the wake of Ernesto.\n\nDaryl Jaschen, the director of the Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management Agency, said in a news conference Wednesday that, in addition to the outages, six cell phone towers were knocked offline across the territory.\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. in the same news briefing said \"the territory is in good shape\" but urged residents and tourists not to venture outside as some rain bands continued lashing the islands.\n\n“There’s a lot of branches on the road, there’s a lot of water coming off of hills on all three islands – and there’s sporadic flooding,” he said.\n\nStorms, stars and our planet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter.\n\nDamaging wind gusts, flooding in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands\n\nAs Ernesto pummeled Puerto Rico early Wednesday morning, officials issued flash flood warnings and the National Hurricane Center reported damaging wind gusts.\n\nBy 7 a.m., between 2 and 6 inches of rain had fallen in parts of eastern Puerto Rico, and an additional 2 to 3 inches was projected. \"Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly,\" the weather service in San Juan said.\n\nAs rain totals climb, the Rio Grande de Loiza and its tributaries \"continue to rise, and the flooding risk continues to increase,\" the weather service said, adding that the rivers would likely overflow.\n\nMeanwhile, St. John and St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands received between 3 and 5 inches of rain through Wednesday morning, leading the weather service to warn of the potential for \"life-threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets, and underpasses.\"\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service office in San Juan, an 86 mph wind gust was recorded in Culebra, a small island off the eastern coast that's part of Puerto Rico.

Other guests are “hunkering down” with staff and were provided an extra night for free to stay safe and dry, she said.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nWill Ernesto impact the mainland US?\n\nWhile Ernesto isn't expected to hit the mainland U.S., authorities have warned of potentially dangerous beach conditions — such as rip currents and rough surf — along the nation's Atlantic coast as the storm churns toward Bermuda.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard on Monday cautioned recreational boaters, fishermen, beachgoers, and water sports enthusiasts in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico to stay out of the water \"due to deteriorating sea state conditions and dangerous rip currents associated with Tropical Storm Ernesto.\"\n\nForecasters said strong swells will begin to reach North Carolina beaches by Friday and advised beachgoers to be aware of the risks and dangers.\n\n\"The storm may be hundreds of miles out to sea and the weather could look great at beaches along Florida, the Carolinas, even up to New England, but everyone needs to be aware of the risks and dangers at the beach,\" according to AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva. \"We expect the rip current risk along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. to start later this week along the Southeast and ramp up over the weekend, expanding to the north.\"\n\nErnesto fifth named storm in 2024 hurricane season\n\nIn a revised forecast issued earlier this month, the federal government called for an \"extremely active\" Atlantic hurricane season, one that could rank among the busiest on record. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted 17 to 24 named storms with about 8 to 13 becoming hurricane-strength, over the average 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.\n\nIn a statement, NOAA head Rick Spinrad said the season started \"early and violent\" with Hurricane Beryl being the earliest Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic on record. He added the agency's update signifies that the peak of the hurricane season is near, which typically includes the most impactful storms and hurricanes.\n\nOverall, NOAA says there's a 90% chance of an above-average season, which is among the highest chances ever issued by the agency, lead seasonal hurricane forecaster Matthew Rosencrans told USA TODAY.\n\nErnesto comes on the heels of deadly Hurricane Debby\n\nErnesto emerged in the Atlantic as residents and authorities across the eastern U.S. were recovering from former tropical storm Debby.\n\nDebby made landfall last week along Florida's Big Bend region as a Category 1 hurricane before the storm's remnants caused major flooding across much of the Eastern Seaboard, inundating entire neighborhoods as authorities conducted water rescues and evacuations. At least eight deaths have been tied to the storm.\n\nIn July, Hurricane Beryl pummeled the Caribbean as a major hurricane before slamming Texas, inflicting massive power blackouts that led to several fatal cases of heatstroke.

This widespread outage follows many other smaller blackouts in Puerto Rico since the catastrophic hurricane in September. Last week, half the island lost power when a tree fell on a power line.\n\nPREPA’s interim director Justo González said Wednesday that Cobra Energy, a U.S. private contractor, hit the transmission line with a crane, as reported in El Nuevo Dia. The same company caused the big outage last week, the newspaper says.\n\nLionel Orama, an electrical engineer and University of Puerto Rico professor, said what most likely happened is that two main power plants, AES and Aguirre, immediately unplugged from the power system to protect their large generators after the transmission line was toppled. That sudden loss of power transmission, he said, then makes it impossible for substations to keep running.\n\n“That is a huge transmission line that connects both plants,” Orama said. “The problem is both plants (in the south half) were delivering power to the north half of the island. Whenever there’s a huge outage from one of them, especially Augerrie, the system is in danger to go out completely.”\n\nMarla Pérez, an associate professor at the University of Puerto Rico, said she was working from her home in Mayagüez, on the island’s far west side, when the power suddenly went out. Pérez and Orama are members of the university's National Institute for Island Energy and Sustainability.\n\n“Everything went silent,” Perez said. “My first thought was here we go again.” She said she knew it wasn’t just her home once she heard her neighbor’s generator kick on and started to smell the machine's diesel fuel. One traffic light in her town is still working somehow, she added.\n\n“This is the second blackout in less than a week,” she said. “The service is not reliable.”\n\nTens of thousands of people have not had electricity since the massive storm seven months ago.\n\n“This is all very worrisome, obviously, as we approach another hurricane season,” said Cathy Kunkel, an energy analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “The grid is so fragile and they’re just barely able to get the lights back on.”\n\nWith a debt of $9 billion, PREPA filed for a form of bankruptcy last year. Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló is pushing a bill to privatize the power system. The island's legislature held public hearings this week.\n\n“Until PREPA is back on a more stable financial footing, it seems like they are continuing to have major problems with reliability,” said Kunkel, who served as an expert witness in several proceedings regarding Puerto Rico's energy system. “It’s very worrisome.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/09/30/hurricane-fallout-puerto-rico-could-face-6-months-without-power/717005001/", "title": "Hurricane fallout: Puerto Rico could face 6 months without power", "text": "After Puerto Rico was pummeled by Hurricane Maria last week, a Category 4 hurricane with 150 mph winds, the island has been left in shambles. After suffering widespread power outages thanks to Hurricane Irma the week before, 1 million Puerto Ricans were left without electricity. 60,000 still hadn’t gotten power when Maria brought a total, island-wide power outage, and severe shortages of food, water, and other supplies.\n\nThere’s still no power on the island except for a handful of generators powering high-priority buildings like select hospitals, and the island likely won’t return to full power for another half a year. This also means that there are next to zero working cell phone towers and no reception anywhere on the island.\n\nDue to the blackout, many residents are relying on small gas-fed generators, and fuel is running out (though authorities in Puerto Rico insist that it’s a distribution problem, not a shortage). Puerto Ricans are waiting in six-hour lines for fuel, while many stations have run completely dry. In most of Puerto Rico there’s no water either — that means no showers, no flushable toilets, and no drinkable water that’s not out of a bottle. In some of the remoter parts of the island, rescue workers are just barely beginning to arrive.\n\nPrior problems exacerbate the issue\n\nPuerto Rico is experiencing all of the normal catastrophes brought on by a major hurricane — and then some. In Houston after Harvey and Florida after Irma, wastewater pumping systems failed, causing significant sewage spillage. The same is almost guaranteed to happen in Puerto Rico thanks to the sustained power outages, but will be greatly exacerbated by the fact that the island’s electrical system was already “degraded and unsafe”.\n\nIn fact, nearly every problem typically faced in the wake of natural disaster will be amplified and accelerated in Puerto Rico thanks to long-existing financial and environmental problems and far fewer rescue and relief workers. Florida and Texas also dealt with contamination from Superfund sites, but Puerto Rico has a whopping 23 in its relatively tiny area.\n\nMore:San Juan mayor outraged after DHS chief calls Hurricane Maria relief 'a good news story'\n\nMore:Trump on hurricane-damaged Puerto Rico: 'We've never seen a situation like this'\n\nMore:Florida, other states brace for exodus from Puerto Rico\n\nMore:Follow USA TODAY Money and Tech on Facebook\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Public Services, a superfund site is “any land in the United States that has been contaminated by hazardous waste and identified by the EPA as a candidate for cleanup because it poses a risk to human health and/or the environment.” These sites are put on the National Priorities List (NPL), a list of the most dire cases of environmental contamination in the U.S. and its territories. These are places where a person can’t even walk on the ground and breathe the air without seriously endangering their health.\n\nEven within the designation of Superfund, sites can be ranked in their level of catastrophism, and Puerto Rico is home to one of the very worst. For 60 years the U.S. military used Vieques, an outlying island, for extensive bomb testing. Two-thirds of the island now have extreme levels of contamination which have been related to disproportionately high cancer rates among the 9,000 residents. Even today Vieques remains blanketed with unexploded bombs, bullets, and projectiles.\n\nCoal contaminants, too\n\nPuerto Rico also has more contaminants to worry about thanks to the coal industry, which has been stockpiling coal ash in southern Puerto Rico. According to Adriana Gonzales of the Sierra Club, an uncovered five-story pile of coal ash situated next to a low-income and minority community in the town of Guayama threatens to toxify the entire area thanks to its content of heavy metals like arsenic, mercury, and chromium that will be released when the rain liquefies the ash.\n\nThe coal industry also dumped thousands of tons of coal ash in Puerto Rican landfills for years, a common practice that has recently mushroomed into a disaster as local landfills overflow thanks to the territory’s financial crisis. While the ash is not Puerto Rico’s (it’s owned by Pennsylvania-based Applied Energy Systems) they are now faced with its toxic burden, despite the fact that the Puerto Rican government ordered the company to cover and secure the pile under the threat of Hurricane Irma, weeks before Maria hit.\n\nPuerto Rico’s fallout of Maria will result in a long, long road to recovery. Even though the island is home to 3.5 million U.S. citizens, help is few and far between compared to response in the U.S., and the island’s pre-existing poverty and environmentally dangerous Superfund Sites will make rebuilding a tricky and toxic business, costing in the billions of dollars.\n\nMore top reads from Oilprice.com:\n\nOil Prices At ACeiling, Or Just Getting Started?\n\nAramco Optimizes Oil Trading Operations Ahead Of IPO\n\nExpect Strong Crude Draws As Refineries Recover", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/09/26/why-puerto-rico-faces-monumental-recovery-effort/703515001/", "title": "Why Puerto Rico faces a monumental recovery effort", "text": "Almost a week after Hurricane Maria pounded its way across Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm with sustained winds of 155 mph, the outlook for anything but a long and arduous recovery is bleak.\n\nFEMA reported Tuesday that only 11 of 69 hospitals had power, and Gov.

Maria then dealt the system a death blow.\n\nRosselló said the power grid has been \"devastated.\" Transmission lines were destroyed and towers and poles toppled to the ground.\n\nAmy Bach, executive director of the non-profit advocacy group United Policyholders, said Puerto Rico's water, roads and communications systems were similarly fragile before the storms. That adds to the workload before the needs of individuals can be fully addressed.\n\n\"Those kinds of efforts can absolutely hinder recovery,\" she said.\n\nMore:San Juan mayor on Trump tweets: 'You don't put debt above people'\n\nFEMA was stretched to begin with\n\nFEMA had already dealt with a series of historic storms this summer before Maria even began quietly forming in the Atlantic. First Hurricane Harvey slammed into the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana. Then came Irma, bringing unprecedented damage to Florida and serious flooding to Georgia, South Carolina and beyond.\n\nAfter Hurricane Sandy tore through much of the East Coast in 2012, about 120,000 households registered for federal aid, Bach said. The count from Harvey alone was about 800,000, she said.\n\nLong said FEMA is not running out of money. Earlier this year, however, the Trump administration proposed cutting FEMA state and local grants by about $600 million.\n\n\"FEMA was under-resourced and under attack,\" Bach said. \"Right now the nation's attention is somewhat focused on aid packages, but there is a finite amount of money.\"\n\nInsurance is not pervasive\n\nBach says home insurance isn't nearly as common in Puerto Rico as on the mainland.\n\n\"I assume it's because State Farm's NOT there,\" she said, referring to the insurance giant's jingle, \"Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.\"\n\nOf the estimated 1.6 million housing units on the island, only 1% have flood insurance and about half have wind insurance, Bach said.

For the latest news on Hurricane Beryl please follow USA TODAY's live updates on the storm for Thursday, July 4.\n\nHurricane Beryl was retreating from Jamaica late Wednesday and is expected to pass just south of the Cayman Islands overnight as a major hurricane, bringing intense winds and heavy rain, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAs of 2 a.m. ET Thursday, Beryl was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 125 mph and was about 110 miles southeast of Grand Cayman — the largest of the Cayman Islands. After roaring by Jamaica's southern coast, the hurricane was expected to unload \"devastating hurricane-force winds, life-threatening storm surge, and damaging waves\" across the Cayman Islands, according to the hurricane center.\n\nThe Cayman Islands could get up to half a foot of rain through Thursday. Weather officials are also warning about life-threatening surf and rip currents along parts of western Cuba, the Yucatan Peninsula, and the coast of Belize.\n\nBeryl was on track to approach the Cayman Islands on Wednesday night and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula about 24 hours later, still as a hurricane but weakened by expected wind shear.\n\nIn Jamaica, emergency crews evacuated people living in flood-prone communities and nearly 500 people were in shelters by Wednesday afternoon, according to Prime Minister Andrew Holness.\n\n“We’re concerned about widespread damage and potentially catastrophic impacts in Jamaica,” said Bernie Rayno, AccuWeather's chief on-air meteorologist. \"Flooding may last days to even weeks. Widespread power outages are expected. Beryl will likely damage many homes and businesses and cause severe coastal inundation.\"\n\nThe chances of Beryl impacting part of the Texas Gulf Coast have increased with the projected path veering northwest, AccuWeather reported, although it would not bring anywhere near the ferocity of its devastating assault on the southern Windward Islands earlier this week. The current track calls for Beryl to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan and then becomes a hurricane again before making landfall along the coast near the border of Mexico and Texas.\n\nThe storm is projected to drench Jamaica with 4 to 8 inches of rain, and 12 inches are forecast in some places, which could cause \"life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides,\" the NHC said. Holness declared all of Jamaica a \"disaster area\" and imposed an islandwide curfew Wednesday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nOn Monday, Beryl made landfall in Grenada's Carriacou island as a Category 4 hurricane, ravaging the southern Caribbean Islands, flattening hundreds of buildings and causing the deaths of at least seven people. On Monday night, Beryl became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record. Driven by record-hot ocean temperatures, Beryl's rapid strengthening has stunned experts.\n\nAmazing drone footage:As Hurricane Beryl tears through Caribbean, a drone sends back stunning footage\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The death toll from the powerful hurricane rose to at least 10, according to Reuters. But that figure is expected to increase as communications come back online across islands damaged by flooding and intense winds.\n\n∎ The Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston, Jamaica posted on X that a small section of the roof of its passenger boarding pier was damaged by Beryl. \"Once the storm has completely passed, a full assessment of damage will be done,\" the airport stated on X.\n\n∎ The Meteorological Service of Mexico issued a hurricane warning for the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun, a popular tourist destination, according to the NHC. Tropical storm warnings were also issued for other parts of the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\n∎ Venezuela's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, and senior officials in her traveling party were injured by a falling tree Tuesday night while surveying an area near the country's Caribbean coast where the Manzanares River overran its banks after heavy rainfall caused by Beryl.\n\nHurricane Beryl tracker:See projected path of storm\n\nWill Hurricane Beryl hit Texas?\n\nPortions of South Texas are now within the forecast cone of Hurricane Beryl, which meteorologists say could arrive in the state over the weekend or early Monday.\n\nHowever, forecasters remain unsure of what Beryl will do and how strong it will be as it approaches the Gulf Coast after hitting Mexico: \"High uncertainty remains with both the track and intensity of Beryl,\" the National Weather Service said Wednesday.\n\n\"From Panama City, Florida to New Orleans, there is a low risk of direct impacts from Beryl, but from about Corpus Christi to Brownsville, Texas, the risk increases significantly due to the potential for Beryl to have more direct impacts,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Jonathan Porter said. \"That southern portion of the Texas coast is the zone we have to really watch.\"\n\nCoastal threats could begin this weekend, Weather.com warned: \"Well ahead of Beryl, onshore winds could lead to increasing surf, rip currents and coastal flooding along parts of the Gulf Coast from eastern Mexico to Texas and western Louisiana beginning as soon as Saturday, and continuing until just after Beryl's final landfall, Weather.com said. The rip current threat could also even extend farther east along the northern Gulf Coast.\n\nBrennan said Tuesday that \"folks in the Texas coast, as we go into the holiday weekend, you're going to want to make sure you check back on the forecast and make sure you're ready for any potential impact. If we were to see tropical storm conditions affect those areas in the far western Gulf of Mexico, it could be during the day Saturday.\"\n\n– Doyle Rice\n\nMore than 90% of the homes, buildings destroyed\n\nMore than 90% of homes and buildings across at least three islands were destroyed or severely damaged after Beryl tore through the southeast Caribbean, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency reported Wednesday. The agency was assisting with the disaster response in Grenada, St. Vincent, and the Grenadines.\n\nBeryl struck the islands with winds of 150 mph and higher gusts on Monday, causing significant impacts to the islands, according to Elizabeth Riley, the disaster management agency's executive director. In addition to infrastructure damages, some islands have also faced power outages and disruptions to communications.\n\nIn a briefing late Tuesday, Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"total destruction\" on the islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique.\n\n\"There's really nothing that can prepare you to see this level of destruction,\" Mitchell said. \"It is almost Armageddon-like, almost total damage and destruction of all buildings. Complete devastation and destruction of agriculture. Complete and total destruction of the natural environment.\"\n\n— Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nAirlines waive fees for some in Hurricane Beryl's path\n\nSix major U.S. airlines said they're waiving various fees for travelers who have flights booked in Beryl's path. In most cases, flights booked before July 1 are eligible for the changes. The listed flights include departures from or arrivals in airports in Mexico, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and Belize.\n\nAmerican, JetBlue, United, Delta, Southwest, and Spirit Airlines are offering a variety of fee waivers because of the hurricane. Passengers are encouraged to check directly with the airlines on what amended policies apply to them.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation said on its website travelers on international flights may be able to recover expenses from a delayed or canceled flight by filing a claim with the airline.\n\n\"If the claim is denied, you may pursue the matter in court if you believe that the carrier did not take all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the damages caused by the delay,\" the agency said.\n\n− Krystal Nurse\n\nResort manager in Jamaica maintains composure as Hurricane Beryl approaches\n\nThe coming hurricane doesn't scare Tamar Atkinson, the manager of a small resort in Hanover, a community on Jamaica's northwest coast.\n\n\"The way I look at it, I can't stop it,\" she told USA TODAY. \"If the hurricane is going to blow your house down, it's going to blow the house down.\"\n\nAtkinson, 42, who moved back to Hanover a year ago after she lived in the U.S. for 20 years, already has her sea legs in weathering Jamaica's hurricanes. She remembers facing Hurricane Gilbert, a Category 5, as a little girl – the storm blew the roof off her aunt's house, where she sheltered, but left her mother's house in \"perfect condition.\"\n\nWhen Hurricane Ivan hit two decades ago, Atkinson sheltered at a nearby school. Once again, the storm blew out the school's windows but left Atkinson's house untouched. \"I'm not leaving my house, and I'm not going to go crazy like the rest of the people,\" she said, adding that she's told her guests to \"relax their nerves.\"\n\nJamaica closes all international airports as Hurricane Beryl nears island\n\nThe Jamaica Tourist Board announced Wednesday that the Sangster, Norman Manley, and Ian Fleming international airports were closed as Hurricane Beryl approached the island.\n\nJamaica's travel website, VisitJamaica.com, doesn't list a reopening time for the airports and encourages travelers to contact their travel agents and/or airlines for flight updates. The website also encourages travelers to heed any instructions from their hotel or private accommodation on sheltering.\n\n\"We also encourage you to register with your Embassy for country-specific guidance and support,\" the board said on the website.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Jamaica is open on a limited basis and encourages Americans to not visit the embassy for shelter and instead seek a government-run shelter. Citizens in Jamaica are encouraged to call the embassy at (876) 702-6486 if they need assistance.\n\n– Krystal Nurse\n\nAhead of Hurricane Beryl, Jamaicans prepare their homes\n\nDonae Maye stocked up on water, candles, and food earlier this week, before supermarkets across her hometown of Montego Bay, a city on Jamaica's northern Coast, emptied.\n\n\"There was no bread, no essentials that you actually need, no candles, very few tin products,\" she said on Wednesday, after a recent visit to some local grocery stores.\n\nMaye, 27, also prepped her home, where she will shelter with her fiance, her son and his father. \"We cleared away any trees that might be blocking any electrical wires and stuff like that that might fall and break the window,\" she said.\n\nShe's confident that her house, which is made of concrete, will stand up to the storm better than many buildings did to Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago. Back then, more structures were made of board, which didn't fare well in the storm, she said. Today, \"most structures are built to withstand the winds and the hurricane,\" she said.\n\nHumanitarian groups rally relief for impacted countries\n\nGlobal Giving and Americares are among the humanitarian organizations collecting money for those affected by Hurricane Beryl. Both promise donations to support various impacted communities, focusing on those who are disadvantaged and on decimated medical facilities.\n\nCora Nally, international emergency response director of Americares, said the organization focuses on restoring damaged medical facilities and expects to deploy its workers to Jamaica soon after Beryl leaves.\n\n\"That is really going to serve as a home base for them, and we are asking them to do an assessment of all the impacted islands in the Caribbean, and we are going to be keeping an eye on the storm as it moves towards Mexico and the United States,\" she said.\n\nIs Cancun in the path of Hurricane Beryl?\n\nAmong the parts of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and surrounding areas under hurricane warnings were Cancun and the island of Cozumel, two popular tourist destinations packed with luxury resorts and cruise ship ports.\n\nThe hurricane warnings were issued by the Meteorological Service of Mexico as forecasters warned residents and tourists of the projected impact of Hurricane Beryl.\n\nBrennan, the director of the NHC, said in a YouTube livestream on Wednesday that the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, including Cancun, faces 3 to 5 feet of storm surge as well as up to 8 inches of rain.\n\nThe record-breaking hurricane is expected to make landfall along the Yucatan Peninsula on Thursday night or early Friday, NHC said.\n\nIn Jamaica, tourists shelter in hotel ballroom from Hurricane Beryl\n\nCecilia Garcia and her family initially planned to weather the beginning of the hurricane in the bathroom of their hotel room in Ocho Rios, on Jamaica's northern coastline. \"We do have windows in our room, so I think the safest option would probably be to go in our restroom,\" she said.\n\nMoon Palace Jamaica, where Garcia, 25, is staying with her parents, brother, sister and two kids, told hotel guests to evacuate to a ballroom. When Garcia and her family first visited the shelter, they found it too chaotic. \"We ended up back in our room because it was very crowded,\" she said. \"It was very hot in there.\"\n\nBut later on Wednesday morning, as the winds picked up, the family returned to the packed ballroom, where thin cots were arranged in rows, according to a video Garcia shared with USA TODAY.\n\nGarcia and her family's flight back to their home of Houston, Texas, isn't until Saturday – the hurricane will strike at the midpoint of their week-long vacation. Garcia said if they chose to end their stay earlier, they wouldn't get a refund.\n\nLooking out at skies still partially clear on Wednesday morning, Garcia said the family was keeping calm ahead of the storm. \"We're kind of used to bad weather and floods like that in Houston,\" she said. \"But again, it's different when you're not at home, so that's the only scary part.\"\n\nHurricane Beryl spoiling graduation trip\n\nMona Parhar, 23, and Arezoo Rafkhani, 24, didn't start searching for early return flights from their vacation to Jamaica until Tuesday night, less than 24 hours before Hurricane Beryl was expected to sweep across the island. By then, they learned airports had closed.\n\n\"We really have no choice but to stick it out,\" Parhar said Wednesday from their hotel room at the Hotel Riu in Montego Bay on the island's northern side.\n\nThe two Toronto natives booked their trip to celebrate their recent graduations – Rafkhani from Toronto Metropolitan University and Parhar from York University. \"We've never experienced something like this as Canadians,\" Rafkhani said. \"It's kind of nerve-wracking.\"\n\nThe pair were comforted by the hotel staff, who kept guests informed and safe. \"Since last night, they've been sending us messages about how to get prepared, what they're doing and will be doing this morning,\" Rafkhani said. \"They've been keeping us calm,\" Parhar said.\n\nJamaica braces for Hurricane Beryl\n\nJamaican officials warned residents to stock up on food, batteries, candles, and drinking water. Residents in flood-prone areas were also advised to prepare for evacuation.\n\n\"Secure your critical documents and remove any trees or items that could endanger your property,\" the Office of the Prime Minister in Jamaica said on X on Tuesday. \"Everyone, including those living alone, should take these necessary steps now.\"\n\nAs a precaution, Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness said Tuesday night that electricity and water services will likely be shut off \"if the storm reaches a serious threshold\" to prevent fires and protect equipment.\n\n\"Only one hurricane has ever affected Jamaica during July,\" according to AccuWeather meteorologist Jesse Ferrell. \"Category 4 Hurricane Dennis in 2005 did not make landfall but killed one person and caused a lot of damage.\"\n\nRecord-breaking path:Hurricane Beryl tears through the Caribbean\n\nHurricane Beryl breaks records\n\nForecasters have projected 2024 to be one of the busiest hurricane seasons on record. Beryl has already surprised forecasters and broken records since it formed, including becoming the earliest Category 4 or 5 storm on record.\n\nBeryl broke the previous record set by Hurricane Emily on July 17, 2005, for the strongest Category 5 hurricane. Beryl rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a major hurricane in about 48 hours.\n\nThe storm is also the earliest Category 4 or larger storm by more than a week, breaking the record set by Hurricane Dennis, a Category 4 storm on July 8, 2005.\n\nIt was fueled by much warmer than normal ocean temperatures in the Atlantic and aided in that development by light winds that allowed it to build a strong inner core.\n\n— Jennifer Borresen, Dinah Voyles Pulver and Ramon Padilla\n\nHurricane Beryl tracker:See projected path of Category 5 storm\n\nSmaller islands hit hard by Beryl\n\nBeryl hit St. Vincent and the Grenadines especially hard, according to Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves.\n\n\"The hurricane has come and gone, and it has left in its wake immense destruction,\" he said, adding that Union Island had 90% of homes \"severely damaged or destroyed.\"\n\nAfter making landfall in Grenada's Carriacou Island on Monday, strong winds and high water levels smashed fishing boats in Barbados, downed power lines in Grenada and St. Vincent, and knocked out drinking water in St. Lucia, according to officials.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell noted on Tuesday that the islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique were significantly impacted by the hurricane. In addition to downed power lines, roads remained impassable and fuel stations were destroyed.\n\n\"The situation is grim. There is no power. There is almost complete destruction of homes and buildings,\" Mitchell said.\n\nContributing: Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY Network-Florida; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2024/08/14/hurricane-ernesto-cruise-changes-carnival-royal-caribbean-norwegian/74803366007/", "title": "Hurricane Ernesto cruise itinerary changes: What to know", "text": "Cruise lines are changing itineraries in an effort to avoid Hurricane Ernesto. The storm brought heavy rain and wind to Puerto Rico Wednesday, leaving close to half the island without power and prompting flash flood warnings.

The ship left Miami on Sunday for an Eastern Caribbean cruise.\n\n“As the safety of our guests and crew is our priority, we will continue to watch the storm and factor in guidance from the National Hurricane Center, U.S. Coast Guard and the local port authorities to provide timely updates as more information becomes available,” the cruise line said in a news release.\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line rerouted Eastern Caribbean cruises on its Norwegian Sky and Norwegian Breakaway ships to the Western Caribbean, according to a spokesperson.

The ship departed from San Juan on Sunday.\n\nIcon of the Seas, which departed from Miami on Saturday, is sailing a Western Caribbean itinerary rather than an Eastern Caribbean cruise as planned.

She will begin Sept. 30, taking over from President Chris Kimball, who is stepping down.\n\nThe private university made the announcement Tuesday following a seven-month search conducted by a committee of regents, faculty, staff, students and alumni, and ultimately decided by the Board of Regents.\n\nVarlotta said CLU's mission of educating leaders who are committed to service and justice resonated with her.\n\n\"I’m really drawn to helping in making sure that’s not just rhetoric but reality,\" Varlotta said.\n\nAt Hiram College, which has an enrollment of about 1,100 students, Varlotta was the school's first female president when she joined in 2014. Varlotta said she takes pride in being CLU's first female president.\n\n\"I consider myself a proud feminist,\" she said. \"A woman leader is one of many adjectives to my leadership style. It’s an important one and it’s not the only one. There’s pride in that. It’s an important opportunity for me to be a role model, not only to women students but to male students as well.\"\n\nMore:CLU President Kimball to step down after 12 years\n\nVarlotta is a Pittsburgh native and a first-generation college student who grew up with three brothers in a home that valued a strong work ethic and community connectedness. Her father worked on the assembly line of General Motors and drove a Greyhound bus, working 80 hours a week for four decades. Her mother was a stay-at-home mom who helped with homework and took her children's education very seriously.\n\n\"There’s not a day that I don’t think about the sacrifices they made,\" Varlotta said.\n\nVarlotta received a bachelor's degree in philosophy at the University of Notre Dame, a master's degree in cultural foundations of education from Syracuse University and a doctorate in educational leadership and feminist philosophy from Miami University in Ohio.\n\nBefore becoming president of Hiram College, Varlotta held leadership positions at CSU Sacramento, University of Wisconsin-Whitewater and University of San Francisco. At CSU Sacramento, Varlotta was senior vice president of planning, enrollment management and student affairs. In that position, Varlotta led more than 30 departments, including those in the areas of retention, educational equity and NCAA Division I athletics.\n\nSusie Lundeen-Smuck, chair of the CLU Board of Regents, said Varlotta is uniquely qualified.\n\n“She stood out from the beginning of the search process as an energetic, creative and inspirational president, and we are thrilled that she will be steering this university into its next era,” according to Lundeen-Smuck in a statement.\n\nIn her academic career, Varlotta has published and conducted research on diversity and inclusion aimed at bringing systemic change to higher education. She said in addressing racial tensions, it's important to be open-minded and be willing to listen to each other. That is especially important in a small community like CLU, where people feel very connected to each other, she said.\n\nMore:Forum at California Lutheran University focuses on campus racism concerns\n\nNot long before campus closed due to the coronavirus, a forum was held on campus to address a series of racist incidents that shook the campus community. The racial tensions discussed in February are particularly relevant today as the country wrestles with issues of race, justice and policing in America. Just four miles away from campus was the site of a recent protest in the name of George Floyd, an African American man who died after a Minneapolis police officer restrained him by kneeling on his neck.\n\nVarlotta said in these discussions, the community must recognize that people are angry and that emotions need to be expressed.\n\n\"We have to be open enough as a community to understand that we are flawed, that we make mistakes and sometimes we hurt each other,\" she said. \"We can not sweep things under the rug. We recognize where we had a sidestep and mitigate those sidesteps and move forward.\"\n\nIn the fall, Varlotta will take helm on a campus that will have far fewer people than typical due to coronavirus measures. While enrollment is about 4,300, some programs, including the bachelor's degree for professionals and the Graduate School of Psychology, will be virtual.\n\n\"I think there will be ongoing ramifications of COVID-19. We’ll be facing the impacts many months or perhaps a year to come,\" she said.\n\nCLU will be flexible as data and public health guidance change, Varlotta said.\n\n\"It's a volatile environment for everyone,\" she said.\n\nWhen Varlotta and her husband move to the campus this summer, she will likely keep busy getting acquainted with the CLU and Ventura County community. But in her spare time, Varlotta leads an active lifestyle by running, hiking and cross country skiing. She's a home cook who likes to read and listen to music, particularly at outdoor concerts.\n\nVarlotta takes over from Kimball, who has led the university for 12 years. Kimball plans to teach and work on writing projects.\n\nWendy Leung is a staff writer for the Ventura County Star. Reach her at wendy.leung@vcstar.com or 805-437-0339.

The police murder of George Floyd played out on screens across the country, tipping off a racial reckoning that seemed to touch every facet of American society.\n\nThat included the state’s higher education system and Board of Governors, whose chairman at the time, real estate developer Sydney Kitson, began the June meeting with a somber recognition and call to action.\n\nDEI DOA?DeSantis pushes Florida universities to the right, targeting tenure, diversity initiatives\n\nDEI audit:DeSantis wants to know how much Florida colleges spend on 'trendy ideology'\n\nBroken promises:Employees say their companies aren't sticking to the promises they made on racial justice\n\n“The shocking and horrific events of these past weeks have both angered and saddened all Americans,” Kitson said. “It is time for everyone to examine the inequities of our society, recognize the conditions that have created those inequities, and work to repair the racial divide and restore equal justice for all Americans.”\n\nKitson, who was appointed by Republican Gov. Rick Scott, continued with a plan for how the Board would address those racial inequities, saying that he and other Board leaders would be speaking to faculty and students at Florida universities.\n\n“We want to learn,” Kitson said, “what actions our universities are taking to address issues of racial diversity, equity and inclusion and what best practices can be implemented throughout the system to engage our students in these issues.”\n\nTwo and a half years later, in January, DeSantis embarked on a similar inquiry — but with opposite aims.\n\nWhile Kitson would go on to form a diversity, equity and inclusion committee that concluded such efforts \"will need to continue long after our urgent responses to the crises of 2020,\" DeSantis announced Jan. 31 that he would dismantle them.\n\nThe announcement has left campuses reeling from the whiplash as jobs and millions of dollars in state funding hang in the balance. Coupled with previous DeSantis initiatives to scrutinize academic freedom and faculty tenure, critics worry his latest announcement will further hurt the university system’s ability to recruit and retain high-level students and faculty and ultimately erode its reputation as the top university system in the country.\n\nHis announcement, on the eve of Black History Month, comes as state universities are experiencing a decline in Black enrollment in line with a national trend. The total in Florida has fallen 12% since 2010, from more than 36,000 students to 32,000 in 2022.\n\n“Only when we began to embrace diversity did we become a prominent flagship outstanding university,” said Paul Ortiz, president of the faculty union at the University of Florida, which the last two years U.S. News and World Report ranked the fifth best public university after a years-long campaign by university leaders to crack the top five.\n\n“Just as we have established this excellence, which the Board of Governors was trying to affirm in 2020, the state of Florida is trying to roll back the clock.”\n\nBoard of Governors expected DEI progress in 2021; chair says they don't 'want to go backwards'\n\nKitson, who stepped down from the board in 2021, initially said he would talk to a reporter but did not return multiple calls and text messages.\n\nBut current board Chair Brian Lamb, said he recalled when Kitson formed the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) workgroup, which he tasked Lamb with overseeing.\n\nThe goal, he said in an exclusive interview with the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida, was to discuss best practices with university leaders. The committee met from June to September 2020, and Lamb said they didn’t hand down any mandates.\n\nFrom 2020 - Part 1:Board of Governors to assess diversity, inclusion efforts on campuses\n\nFrom 2020 - Part 2:Board of Governors: Achieving a diverse university system is a shared responsibility\n\nPersonal profile:'My dad modeled the way for me': A look at Chairmen Eugene, Brian Lamb's parallel successes\n\nBut in his update to the board in November 2020, he said “We will tell you, though, that as we spend more time with the universities, we will expect progress in the execution of how you are driving diversity, equity and inclusion throughout the university system.\"\n\nWhile Lamb acknowledged that recent events may feel like a “pendulum swing,” he said the focus of the workgroup ties into a more recent priority to foster civil discourse and free expression on campuses.\n\nLamb sidestepped commenting on DeSantis’ plan to dismantle DEI initiatives and how, exactly, that would empower universities to foster such an open environment.\n\n“It’s really early for us,” he said, noting that he learned about the governor’s plan with everyone else. “I don’t have, really, any specific comments on exactly what’s come out so far.”\n\nLamb, who was appointed to the board by DeSantis, said that he and board Chancellor Ray Rodrigues will talk to the governor and the Legislature about how best to implement DeSantis’ agenda. He added that while he hasn’t heard much criticism of DeSantis’ plans, he would talk to university leaders to understand their concerns.\n\nRegardless, he said, the board will remain focused on ensuring that state universities remain accessible to all.\n\n“I don’t think I’ve heard anyone wanting to go backwards on that, and I’m sure the Board of Governors doesn’t want to go backwards on that,” Lamb said. “The outcomes around cost and affordability, the outcomes around access and diverse representation across the university system … are going to continue to be priorities.”\n\nDEI is a space that Lamb knows well. He served as JPMorgan Chase’s first ever global head of diversity, equity and inclusion for two years, a role in which he oversaw a multi-billion-dollar racial equity plan to close the wealth gap among minority communities, Florida Trend reported.\n\nThe price tags for DEI initiatives at Florida universities ranged from $8,400 at Florida Polytechnic University to $8.7 million at the University of South Florida, and no institution spent more than 1% of its total budget on such programs, according to a Chronicle of Higher Education report.\n\nLamb pointed to several metrics he said prove the Board’s commitment to accessible education, and Board spokeswoman Renee’ Fargason followed up with more. Among them: 46% of all Florida undergraduate students, and 45% of all bachelor’s degree recipients, identify as African American or Hispanic/Latino; and the four-year graduation rate for recipients of federal Pell Grants, which are awarded to students with serious financial need, is 54% — already higher than the Board of Governors’ goal for 2025.\n\n‘It takes years to get where we’ve gotten. It takes days to destroy it.’\n\nThe governor’s plan to dismantle DEI programs is part of a long line of policies aimed at reshaping higher education in Florida.\n\nDeSantis has signed laws that would make it more difficult for faculty to retain tenure and require that “intellectual freedom” surveys be distributed to faculty, staff and students.\n\nLast year, the governor signed the Stop WOKE Act, which restricts how colleges and workplaces could talk about race and gender with the goal of preventing anyone from feeling guilty over past wrongs. A federal judge struck down a portion of the bill regulating universities, writing that it was “positively dystopian.”\n\nThe governor’s most recent plan puts a new spin on his efforts to reign in public institutions that he sees as liberal indoctrination sites, although he’s offered few specifics to back up that claim and has faced significant pushback for spreading it.\n\n“You cannot ask me to go forward and argue that we are indoctrinating students here,” said Patricia Okker, the former president of New College of Florida, before she was forced out of the job amid a conservative takeover of the college. “I understand there’s a difference of opinion about that. ... I know it to be different.”\n\nThe situation has grown so extreme that the American Association of University Professors took the rare step to form a committee to examine the state of academic freedom in Florida, said association President Irene Mulvey.\n\n“Anyone who cares about democracy should be really frightened,” Mulvey said, “because DeSantis is demonizing educators and weaponizing education. Look to history: when the state is demonizing educators and education, we are heading toward autocracy.”\n\nThe governor, though, said during his announcement that “academia, writ large, has lost its way” and he is undoing a DEI \"agenda\" imposed on students.\n\n25 days that shook New College:How Ron DeSantis swiftly transformed the Sarasota school\n\nMany supporters of Florida’s higher education system have said diversity programs serve a legitimate purpose to create a welcoming, culturally sensitive environment for students and faculty of different backgrounds to learn from each other. Along with fostering ethnic and gender diversity, such programs in some cases also serve veterans and people with disabilities.\n\nDEI initiatives and trainings have been around for decades. But Floyd’s murder in 2020 led many business and education leaders to take a more comprehensive approach, wrapping it into their hiring processes and tackling concepts such as unintentional bias or how systemic racism contributes to modern-day disparities.\n\nThe fact that DeSantis is attacking DEI efforts so soon after calls for racial justice fits into a larger pattern in America, said Matthew Kincaid, the CEO of the DEI training firm Overcoming Racism, which no longer has clients in Florida.\n\n“After every single moment of racial progress in this country, there is always a moment of significant racial backlash,” Kincaid said.\n\n'Trendy ideologies':Gov. Ron DeSantis sworn in for second term, calls Florida a 'citadel of freedom'\n\nDeSantis’ characterization of DEI efforts as “trendy” is particularly insulting, Kincaid said, when “people of color have been calling out for racial justice on campuses for generations.”\n\nThat includes in Florida, said Steve Uhlfelder, a former member of the Board of Governors from 2002 to 2004 and its previous iteration, the Board of Regents, from 1994 to 2000.\n\nAttracting a diverse faculty and student body was a focus back then, he said. But even before it was a priority of state leaders, students of color took the fight into their own hands.\n\nIn 1971, when he was student body president at UF, a group of Black students protested outside the then-university president’s office to seek an appointment to talk about Black enrollment, which was abysmal at the time, Uhlfelder said.\n\nThe president called the police and had them arrested, leading several Black students to disenroll from the university. The protest and fallout, Uhlfelder said, spurred the creation of an office of minority affairs.\n\n“It takes years to get where we’ve gotten,” Uhlfelder said. “It takes days to destroy it.”\n\nFirst up: New College\n\nState lawmakers will determine how, and to what extent, DeSantis’ plan will be carried out when they convene next month for the annual Legislative Session. But leaders at one institution have already begun the discussion.\n\nDeSantis has taken a special interest in New College, where he appointed six new conservative members to the college’s Board of Trustees with a mandate to overhaul the progressive liberal arts school.\n\nThat board met for the first time on the same day DeSantis announced his DEI plan and, already, one of DeSantis’ new appointments moved to abolish the school’s Office of Outreach and Inclusive Excellence, which would eliminate the jobs of four employees.\n\nSubscriber exclusive:25 days that shook New College: How Ron DeSantis swiftly transformed the Sarasota school\n\nNew target?FSU faculty say it's 'rubbish' as Christopher Rufo targets FSU 'radical' diversity programs\n\n“The governor was really clear in his remarks this morning,” said board member Christopher Rufo, a conservative activist who has gained a wide following stirring up controversy around DEI efforts. “Rather than saying, ‘Oh, we should follow the state,’ I think it’s time for us to lead. I think it’s time for us to set a new standard and anticipate this may well be the standard everywhere.”\n\nBut Rufo’s desire for swift action hit a snag.\n\nThe Board of Trustees is beholden to the regulations of another governing body, which has a rule in place to ensure access to and equity on college campuses, said the board’s legal advisor.\n\nThat body is the Board of Governors.\n\nTallahassee Democrat reporter Tarah Jean contributed to this story.

For many faculty leaders, it’s another worrying delay.\n\nFaculty members and administrators have maintained for months that the stalled search process is hamstringing the school’s efforts to move forward. Filling high-level vacancies has been difficult without a top leader, they said, and many important strategic decisions are on hold.\n\nBut the Board of Governors decided the process had to restart on account of what an investigator called a series of legal and policy violations in the initial search.\n\nThe primary problem, the university system’s inspector general said, was the search committee’s decision to use an anonymous survey of its members to help narrow the list of applicants being considered.\n\nSuch surveys are commonly done during presidential searches, the inspector general found, but a decision by the search committee’s chairperson to make the survey anonymous violated Florida’s open-government law, which requires that most government actions be transparent.\n\nIndeed, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody concluded in October that state law “prohibits ranking that occurs by way of anonymously surveying and organizing members’ input, even if those rankings are not a final vote.”\n\nNot only did the use of the anonymous survey reduce transparency, but the secret ballot also meant it was impossible to identify a committee member who failed to vote and led to errors in the tallying of the top vote-getters.\n\n“The manner in which the survey was administered prevented (the private search firm) from knowing which committee members responded, whether committee members responded more than once, or whether the responses submitted were from actual committee members,” the inspector general wrote.\n\nAn FAU spokesperson did not respond to a message seeking comment. Board of Trustees Chairperson Brad Levine declined to comment.\n\nThe probe into whether the search process was conducted properly has been overshadowed by efforts to put state Rep. Randy Fine, a firebrand Republican legislator from Brevard County, in the president's job.\n\nFine had support from Gov. Ron DeSantis, and insiders say, Barbara Feingold, the board of trustees’ vice chairperson and a political donor to both DeSantis and Fine.\n\nBut when Fine failed to make the list of finalists announced in July, the state university system’s chancellor ordered the search process halted two days later, citing concerns about the anonymous ballot. The timing of the move led to widespread speculation that Fine's exclusion had influenced the decision to intervene.\n\nFine retracted his presidential endorsement of DeSantis in October and threw his support behind former President Donald Trump, a move Fine said was prompted by the candidates’ stances on Israel but that DeSantis dismissed as sour grapes because Fine “didn’t get” the top job at Florida Atlantic University.\n\nFAU communications professor William Trapani, a member of the faculty senate, said the Board of Governors’ decision was unsurprising and criticized the way its members let the university languish for months.\n\n“The big takeaway is continued disappointment that the Board of Governors has intervened in this process and taken so long to do so,” he said. “The university remains in limbo for an extensive period of time, and it’s all on the Board of Governors.”\n\nMembers of the Board of Governors decided Thursday that the new search will not restart until the board has updated its rules and policies for university search committees, a step that Lamb said could be completed at the board's next scheduled meeting Jan. 24.\n\n“I don’t want to suggest to the FAU Board of Trustees that we are going to belabor this,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Marra is a reporter for The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA Today Network.

The impacts on the University of Missouri, just to scratch the surface, are new leadership, deep cuts as student enrollment crashed and an examination of how almost everything is administered.\n\nThe impact on Columbia is also broad. The enrollment crash brought to a halt a student housing boom downtown just as hundreds of new residences were threatening to overwhelm city infrastructure.\n\nOtherwise, however, the growth of Columbia and Boone County continued at an almost-record pace, showing the local economy is less dependent on MU to drive prosperity. The university remains the largest employer in Boone County, but it has not grown as it did in previous years and the unemployment rate has remained one of the lowest in the state.\n\nThe Tribune looked through the files this past week and decided that there are 10 stories of the past 10 years that stand out as most impactful on our town.\n\nConcerned Student 1950 protests\n\nOn Oct. 10, 2015, a handful of students organized as a group they called Concerned Student 1950 blocked UM System President Tim Wolfe’s car during the Homecoming parade, the first public action by a group that would become known worldwide.\n\nThey took their name from the year the first black student was admitted to MU. They demanded a more inclusive campus, a greater percentage of minority faculty and dialogue about the university.\n\nWolfe ignored them that day and when he did meet with them, it was too late. Matters escalated to the campout on Carnahan Quadrangle, where graduate student Brandon Butler began a hunger strike demanding Wolfe resign. On the evening of Nov. 7, a group of players from the Tigers football team organized a boycott of athletic activities until Wolfe stepped aside.\n\nWolfe quit Nov. 9, 2015, and MU Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin was swept out as well. Wolfe and Loftin had been engaged in difficult administrative battles and Loftin was disliked on campus.\n\nOn the day they quit, an obscure assistant professor of communications, Melissa Click, tried to block reporters covering the Concerned Student 1950 campsite and was caught on video calling for “some muscle” to enforce a media-exclusion zone. The incident drew condemnation from free-speech and free-press groups, became fodder for conservative condemnation of the entire protest and contributed to a growing negative view of MU.\n\nThe damaged reputation led to a sharp decline in enrollment, with the campus shrinking by more than 5,000 students in three years.\n\nThe curators found University of Connecticut Provost Mun Choi to take over as president. Choi did important work on projects for NASA and emphasized bringing private money in to support research. To replace Loftin, the curators hired Alexander Cartwright, also a research engineer, from the State University of New York, where he was provost and executive vice chancellor.\n\nHe and Choi have emphasized affordability, cutting some costs and instituting new scholarship programs, and reduced reliance on state taxpayers for major investments. Little state money is involved in construction of the $221 million NextGen Precision Health Institute under construction on the Columbia campus.\n\nTurnover at City Hall\n\nWhen the decade began, Ken Burton was newly installed as chief of the Columbia Police Department, Mayor Darwin Hindman was finishing 15 years in office and Bill Watkins was heading to retirement after five years as city manager.\n\nThe smooth transitions were a marked contrast to the end of the decade, when Mike Matthes, hired to replace Watkins in 2011, and Burton both resigned within about a month of each other in late 2018 as public relations and administrative fights overtook them.\n\nMatthes, after seven years on the job, was becoming increasingly at odds with the council and segments of the city workforce.\n\nHe and Burton became targets of the Columbia Police Officers Association after they joined in a demonstration outside Columbia Police Department headquarters protesting a social media post by the association calling Aug. 9, 2015, “Darren Wilson Day” in honor of the Ferguson officer who shot Michael Brown.\n\nThe debate over whether and how the Columbia Police Department would implement community policing was the last fight of Matthes’ tenure and resistance to change was one of the reasons Burton followed quickly.\n\nBurton was also disliked by many of his officers and attacked by community critics. Interim City Manager John Glascock was upset about his short work hours and absence from important events.\n\nGlascock was installed as permanent city manager this year and he named Geoff Jones, a veteran of the department and a former union member, as chief.\n\nBoone Hospital Center lease\n\nIt has been clear since the middle of the decade that the Boone Hospital Center Board of Trustees would not renew the management lease with BJC Healthcare. What was not clear was what would follow.\n\nThe lease with BJC expires in 2020 and the trustees notified BJC formally in 2018 that it would not renew.\n\nThe uncertainty on one point was decided in August, when the trustees announced that the hospital would resume operation as an independent provider under direct management of the board.\n\nThe decision will ensure the long-term financial sustainability of the hospital, then-chair Brian Neuner said. It will also improve its ability to recruit doctors and nurses, he said.\n\n“We are now focused on the independent hospital option and are working to ensure this option will give us the ability to meet patients’ needs for generations to come,” Neuner said.\n\nWhat many viewed as an ideal match — and others worried would monopolize health care in Boone County — was a partnership negotiation in 2017 with the University of Missouri. Those negotiations ended in January 2018 and the trustees spent the ensuing 21 months studying their options.\n\nDan Atwill, presiding Boone County Commissioner, said in August that he’s pleased to see a resolution to the hospital’s operation. The hospital is the county’s most valuable asset.\n\n“It’s good to see the trustees moving forward with confidence and determination,” Atwill said.\n\nRapid growth\n\nPerhaps the best indicator of how fast Columbia and Boone County are growing is that when Battle High School opened its doors in 2013, it was the first high school built in the Columbia Public Schools since Rock Bridge High School opened in 1973.\n\nWhen the Columbia Board of Education discussed future bond issues recently, it included talk of another high school that would open by 2030.\n\nThe population of Columbia on July 1, 2018, was estimated at 123,180 people. When the last official census was taken in 2010, the count was 108,500. That works out to an additional 1,835 new residents every year.\n\nThe population of Boone County outside Columbia is growing rapidly as well. The county, including Columbia, had 180,005 people on July 1, 2018, the Census Bureau estimates, up 17,363 in eight years. That’s a growth rate of 2,170 people per year.\n\nDowntown high rises\n\nIn 2014, as MU enrollment growth continued unabated, setting a new record, the boom in downtown developments reached a critical phase — city officials raised alarms about the capacity of electric and sanitary sewer infrastructure to serve thousands of new residents in the area.\n\nThe new developments began going in about 2012 and one of the first, the Brookside construction at College Avenue and Walnut Streets, had a major fire in May of that year that only delayed construction by a few weeks.\n\nThe city tried creating a tax increment financing district to raise new funds for infrastructure improvements and a moratorium on new projects until the problems could be sorted out.\n\nThe 2015 protests and resulting crash in enrollment did what city efforts to control development could not — no new high rises have been started since. Those that have been completed since have engaged in price wars to win residents.\n\nRyan Ferguson\n\nRyan Ferguson’s long journey through the state’s criminal justice system ended in 2013, when he was freed after 10 years of confinement for a conviction on second-degree murder and first-degree robbery charges for the Nov. 1, 2001, slaying of Tribune Sports Editor Kent Heitholt.\n\nFerguson, who had become a near-household name in Central Missouri because of the case, was sent to prison for 40 years after his 2005 conviction that came after former classmate Charles Erickson confessed and testified against Ferguson in exchange for a plea deal. Erickson and another witness changed their stories years later.\n\nAn appellate court found that Ferguson had not been given a fair trial because then-Prosecuting Attorney Kevin Crane failed to disclose material evidence. Ferguson maintained his innocence throughout the years, and his family, headed by his father, Bill, worked tirelessly to bring attention to his case.\n\nSince his release, Ferguson has won an $11 million judgment in federal court over constitutional violations by six Columbia officers that led to his wrongful conviction. He has also worked on behalf of other inmates who claim to have been wrongfully convicted.\n\nGun violence\n\nThe death of Nadria Wright on Sept. 13 when she was shot while riding in a car with a friend taking her for food brought into stark relief the magnitude of the gun violence problem in Columbia.\n\nGun violence was serious enough to make the top stories lists of the Tribune in 2012 and 2017, but Wright’s death — one of six gun deaths in a two week period of early September — was especially troubling. The man accused of shooting her, Javion Martae Lawhorn-Wallace, was apparently stalking Sam Baldwin IV, who was driving the car, and the two were “on opposite sides of a feud,” according to documents filed in Boone County Circuit Court.\n\nBaldwin was severely injured.\n\nFriends, classmates and co-workers filled the Second Missionary Baptist Church for her funeral.\n\n“She was an angel, man,” an uncle said before her funeral. “There ain’t no one perfect, but she was close.”\n\nIn response, Columbia Mayor Brian Treece has met several times with mayors of St. Louis, Kansas City and Springfield to work on a common package of measures for lawmakers to consider when they meet next month.\n\nUniversity of Missouri to SEC\n\nMU cut its traditional ties — and ended its greatest rivalry — when it jumped from the Big 12 to the SEC in 2011.\n\nFor some supporters, it meant that 2012 — the Tigers first season in the new conference — ushered in a bright new era with competition against the likes of Florida, Georgia and Tennessee. For others, it meant the school turned its back on a century of history and traditions, namely its long-standing rivalry with the University of Kansas.\n\nBut with money and exposure the two most important aspects of college athletic success, those who wanted it were eager for the change.\n\n“There’s a lot of great things historically that have happened here,” MU football coach Gary Pinkel said. “But this is our shot.”\n\nMamtek\n\nThe only non-Boone County story on this list is the biggest economic boondoggle in the state of the past decade.\n\nIn July 2010, with unemployment still at near-record post-recession levels, Gov. Jay Nixon went to Moberly to announce that a California businessman, Bruce Cole, and his partners in Mamtek would build a factory making artificial sweetener with $39 million in industrial bond financing and $17.6 million in state tax credits and other incentives.\n\nThe factory would employ 600 at wages averaging $17.50 per hour, Cole promised.\n\nBy Sept. 1, 2011, the bond money was gone, the construction site was idle and no one had been hired. A year later, Cole was arrested, charged with securities fraud and theft for skimming $6.6 million from the bond funds. The companies that sold the bonds became the targets of investor lawsuits.\n\nCole went to prison in 2014, sentenced to seven years. He has an active lawsuit seeking to have his conviction set aside although he has been out of prison since June 2018.\n\nA federal bankruptcy court case is still in process but seems to be winding down.\n\nWild weather\n\nThis decade has seen some of the greatest weather extremes of 130 years of record keeping in Columbia.\n\nA blizzard on Feb. 1, 2011, brought 17.5 inches of snow — the second-greatest amount in a single 24-hour period on record. The summer of 2012 brought drought and extreme temperatures.\n\nFor the most part, the evidence from the record books is that Columbia is warming up. The decade saw three of the top 10 warmest springs, including the warmest in 2012, two of warmest 10 summers and falls and three of the warmest winters.\n\nAnd this year, the Missouri River had the longest flood on record and the levels reached were the second- or third-highest crests.\n\nrkeller@columbiatribune.com\n\n573-815-1709", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/11/18/mass-protests-global-unrest-iran-to-hong-kong/4226826002/", "title": "Mass protests from Iran to Hong Kong accelerate", "text": "The fortified campus of a sprawling Hong Kong university became the focal point of a months-long standoff between anti-government protesters and authorities in Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China that enjoys a high degree of autonomy.\n\nHong Kong's protesters have been clashing with police for five months over fears China's central government in Beijing is undermining the territory's judicial independence. But on Monday, demonstrators who have barricaded themselves inside Hong Kong's Polytechnic University since last week were met by police tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets as they tried to break out of the university's grounds.\n\nAs night fell in Hong Kong, several protesters were arrested and hundreds were driven back by police. Some protesters rappelled off a nearby footbridge to a road below, where they were met by motorbike riders helping them flee. It was unclear if they got away.\n\nHong Kong's Polytechnic University has turned into a battleground, and it is the third time in recent days demonstrators have tried to flee the surrounded campus, from where protesters have been retaliating against police with gasoline bombs.\n\nHong Kong’s high court ruled Monday that a government ban on face masks, worn by many protesters, was unconstitutional. The ban made wearing any facial coverings during public assembly punishable by jail time and fines.\n\n\"These rioters, they are also criminals. They have to face the consequences of their acts,\" Cheuk Hau-yip, a police commander for Hong Kong's Kowloon West district, told reporters at a daily briefing Monday. \"Other than coming out to surrender, I don’t see, at the moment, there’s any viable option for them.\"\n\nLater Monday, at a news conference in Washington, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo commented on several protests taking place across the globe and said the U.S. is \"gravely concerned by the deepening political violence and unrest in Hong Kong.\" The top American diplomat also said the Chinese communist party \"must honor its promises to the Hong Kong people who only want the freedoms and liberties that they have been promised.\"\n\nHong Kong's protests began peacefully in early June.\n\nThey were sparked by proposed legislation that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China, where the legal system is far more opaque. When the bill was withdrawn, the protests hardened, and broadened, into a resistance movement, sometimes violent, against the territory's government and Beijing.\n\nThe U.S. Senate is considering a bill that could pave the way for sanctions on Hong Kong over its response to the protests, but such a move may not easily pass through the White House, which is pursuing a trade deal with China. President Donald Trump has shown little interest in supporting human rights in Hong Kong, and he has not commented on the unfolding incident at Hong Kong's Polytechnic University.\n\nThe head of a nationalistic Chinese newspaper said Hong Kong police should use snipers to fire live ammunition at violent protesters.\n\n\"If the rioters are killed, the police should not have to bear legal responsibility,\" Global Times editor Hu Xijin wrote on his Weibo social media account.\n\nUnrest goes global\n\nThe escalation of the unrest in Hong Kong coincides with recent mass protests around the world. These protests – in Bolivia, Iran and elsewhere – are not connected and have different causes and aims. But they are loosely linked thematically in that they concern inequality, political freedoms, corruption and climate change.\n\nIn Iran, after a decision by authorities to dramatically raise gas prices, violent protests spread to a reported 100 cities and towns Monday.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has backed his government's decision to raise gas prices by 50% and called protesters who have been setting fire to public property over the increase \"thugs.\" Iran also imposed a near total Internet blackout over the weekend, according to NetBlocks, a group that monitors international Internet access.\n\nBy Monday, Iran's Internet connectivity stood at 7%, NetBlocks said.\n\nThe gas price increase is especially controversial in Iran because the country is home to the world’s fourth-largest reserves of crude oil, and gas has long been inexpensive despite decades of economic struggles since its 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nProblems for Iran's economy have been compounded by Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and reimpose crippling economic sanctions on the Middle East country.\n\nCrisis ahead: Iran announces nuke deal violations 40 years after hostage crisis\n\nDemonstrators have abandoned cars along major highways and ransacked about 100 banks and stores, according to Iran's semi-official Fars news agency.\n\nThe Internet blackout has made it difficult to know how many people have been arrested, injured or killed. Iranian authorities on Sunday raised the official death toll to at least three. It said about 1,000 protesters have been arrested.\n\nIran's government cracked down on large-scale economic protests in late 2017 into 2018, as well as those connected to its disputed 2009 election.\n\nThe White House said in a statement that the U.S. \"supports the Iranian people in their peaceful protests against the regime that is supposed to lead them.\"\n\nBows, arrows:Protesters battle police for control of university, dozens arrested\n\nSenior China adviser: Trump to blame for delays in securing final trade deal\n\nIn India, hundreds of students from a New Delhi university on Monday were in a standoff with police, who stopped their march toward parliament to protest increased student housing fees. The students from Jawahar Lal Nehru University chanted slogans and tried to cross police barricades. Several students were arrested, part of demonstrations that have been going on for more than two weeks.\n\nAnd in Lebanon, one month on from protests that have seen hundreds of thousands of people take to the streets over a ruling class seen as corrupt and incompetent, the country's political crisis has intensified.\n\nOn Monday, Saad Hariri, Lebanon's outgoing prime minister who resigned over the protests three weeks ago, severely criticized the party of the country’s president, Michel Aoun, for its failure to establish an interim Cabinet. Aoun has yet to start the parliamentary process for appointing a new prime minister.\n\nHariri and Aoun have pointed the finger at each other for the stalemate as Lebanon experiences its worst economic and financial crisis in decades. The small Arab country is one of the most heavily indebted countries in the world and was already dealing with a severe fiscal crisis before the protests, one rooted in years of heavy borrowing and expensive patronage networks run by entrenched political parties.\n\nSecurity forces in Iraq have killed at least 320 people and wounded thousands as part of the response to anti-government protests linked to corruption and inequality. The unrest began in October. Protesters, who have blocked roads and called for national strikes, want a complete overhaul of Iraq's inexperienced government.\n\nBolivia has been rocked by weeks of protests after last month's disputed presidential election that led to the resignation of President Evo Morales.\n\nBolivia:Evo Morales resigns amid election-fraud allegations, deadly protests\n\nIn Chile, at least 20 people have been killed and 2,500 injured since protests began in October in relation to student protests over an increase in subway fares. The protests have since expanded to include a range of issues from spiraling living costs to the effect of climate change on their daily lives.\n\nTens of thousands of Catalan pro-independence protesters in Spain have been out in the streets of Barcelona and nearby areas since a Spanish court in October imposed stiff prison sentences on the group's separatist leaders.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/02/08/willa-beatrice-player-educator-akron-bennett-college-oberling-ohio/4408609001/", "title": "Willa Beatrice Player, an educator from Akron, led an amazing life", "text": "Someone on the yearbook staff may have misunderstood her quiet demeanor.\n\nThere’s a quote next to Willa Beatrice Player’s senior portrait in the 1925 annual at West High School: “Led by simplicity divine, she pleased and never tried to shine.”\n\nIt’s an excerpt from English poet Hannah More’s work “Florio,” a 1797 satire about social graces. While the Akron teenager was soft-spoken and driven to help others, she practically glowed with potential. Given the opportunity, the petite girl grew up to be a giant in education, far exceeding the expectations of Ohio classmates.\n\nMore:Rock hall to offer virtual Black History Month discussions\n\nPlayer made history as the first African American woman from Akron to earn a doctorate and the first in the country to serve as president of a four-year college. She gained national attention as a civil rights activist and as a federal administrator for education.\n\nWilla Beatrice Player's background and beginnings\n\nThe story began in Jackson, Mississippi, where Beatrice Day Player and Clarence Cromwell Player welcomed their third child Aug. 9, 1909. Willa was the baby sister of Clarence Jr., born in 1903, and Edith, born in 1907.\n\nIn 1917, the family joined the Great Migration and moved 800 miles north to the bustling industrial city of Akron. Player later said the move was to escape “oppressive living conditions in the South,” but it also was a chance for a fresh start. The family was still grieving the 1915 death of Clarence Jr. at age 12.\n\nIn Akron, the family settled into a two-story Colonial home at 754 Euclid Ave. near Perkins Woods. Father was a plastering contractor. Mother was a homemaker. Edith studied piano while Willa favored violin.\n\nAt West High, Willa took classical courses, joined chemistry club, performed in the orchestra and served as a student tutor. There was no question that she would be a teacher. She attended the University of Akron before joining her sister at Ohio Wesleyan, where they were two of the school’s three Black students.\n\nThey had to live in Delaware, Ohio, because the residence halls weren’t open to people of color. Willa Player majored in Latin and minored in French and religion.\n\n“I wanted to take something hard so I could get a job,” she later explained.\n\n'There had never been a Black teacher in Akron'\n\nBefore graduating in 1929, Player served as a cadet teacher in Akron.\n\n“When I showed up Black, they were just bowled over,” she said. “There had never been a Black teacher in Akron.”\n\nUpon earning her master’s degree at Oberlin College in 1930, Player joined the faculty at Bennett College, a private, historically Black school for women in Greensboro, North Carolina. She taught Latin and French at the Methodist-related college.\n\nBennett President David D. Jones saw tremendous potential in the young educator and shared his philosophy: “We take each student where we find her and treat her as if she has already come to the place where we wish her to be.”\n\nPlayer excelled at teaching. She won a Fulbright Scholarship and studied at the University of Grenoble in France in 1935. When she returned, she was named director of admissions and acting dean at Bennett.\n\n“As opportunity unfolded, I was never afraid of the hard work and the challenge,” she said.\n\nThere were many memorable moments along the way. She recalled when first lady Eleanor Roosevelt visited Bennett for two days in 1945.\n\n“Bennett never had a tradition of segregation,” Player said. “Everyone came to Mrs. Roosevelt’s speeches. There were about 3,000 children, Blacks and whites together. It was so wonderful to see that this kind of thing could happen in the South.\n\n“I shall never forget Mrs. Roosevelt walking down the aisle of Bennett’s chapel in a beautiful embroidered gown. She was a woman of great charm and poise, just the most charming person you could imagine. She never mentioned the race issue during her visit, but you just had the feeling that here was a person who was with us every step of the way.”\n\nIn 1948, Player earned her doctorate in education from Columbia University in New York. At Bennett, she rose from coordinator of instruction to vice president to acting president when Jones became ill. In 1952, she turned down an offer to lead Spelman College in Atlanta, citing loyalty to the Greensboro school.\n\nPlayer was inaugurated as Bennett's president Oct. 14, 1956, becoming the first African American woman to lead a four-year liberal arts college. At the ceremony, Player said she accepted the post “with an expressible depth of gratitude, with full awareness of the office and with a firm resolve to devote every resource at my command to bring to fuller fruition the ideals and purposes for which this college stands.”\n\nDuring her nine-year tenure, Player oversaw construction of two residence halls, a gymnasium and the first Olympic-size pool at a Black college. In addition, she helped raise $1 million for a science building.\n\nIn 1958, the Greensboro NAACP invited a 29-year-old Atlanta minister to give a talk, but no local facility would agree to host the event.\n\n“Bennett College is a liberal arts school where freedom rings, so Martin Luther King Jr. can speak here,” Player announced.\n\nKing delivered a 72-minute speech Feb. 11 in the college chapel, noting: “We’ve broken loose of the Egypt of segregation, and we’re moving through the wilderness of adjustment toward the promised land of integration, and we’re going to get in.”\n\nVisiting Akron two months later, Player said she was pleased to see her hometown make strides in race relations.\n\n“A great community consciousness has been achieved here,” she said.\n\nIn February 1960, Player supported the F.W. Woolworth sit-ins to integrate lunch counters after four Black students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University were denied service in the Greensboro store.\n\nBennett students joined the nonviolent protest and were arrested in droves. Player visited students in jail and arranged for professors to deliver class assignments to them.\n\n“We don’t teach our students what to think,” Player announced. “We teach them how to think. If I have to give exams in jail, that’s what I’ll do.”\n\nNearly 40% of the student body went to jail for the cause. After five months, Woolworth backed down. Lunch counters were integrated by July.\n\nJoining the U.S. Office of Education\n\nIn March 1966, Player resigned at Bennett to join President Lyndon B. Johnson’s administration as director of the Division of College Support in the U.S. Office of Education. She said she'd miss her students, but “I have a feeling we shall be helping more students in Washington than would be possible through direct contact with them.”\n\nHer 20-person staff oversaw Title III provisions for developing institutions and training faculty as outlined in the Higher Education Act of 1965. Title III provided grants to schools with financial limitations and a high percentage of needy students.\n\n“I had this reputation of being this little woman with a soft voice, but I had a tough stance,” she recalled years later. “I always did my homework. If I didn’t know what I was talking about, I didn’t open my mouth like some of those men.”\n\nPlayer’s sister Edith, a pianist and painter, married Raymond R. Brown, who served as director of the Akron Community Center and Urban League from 1945 to 1964. They had four children who grew up to be an architect, a college instructor, a musician and a novelist.\n\nBut Willa Player never married, explaining: “I didn’t have time for men. I was too busy educating the youth.”\n\nShe received many accolades, including honorary doctorates from Bennett College, Morehouse College, Ohio Wesleyan, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Albion College, Lycoming College, Keuka College and Prairie View A & M University.\n\nBennett gave her the title of president emerita, named a residence hall for her and established an endowed chair in her honor. Ohio Wesleyan elected her as trustee, the first Black woman to hold the post at the school. Player also was the first woman president of the National Association of Schools and Colleges of the Methodist Church.\n\nShe was inducted into the Ohio Hall of Fame in 1984 and the Ohio United Methodist Hall of Fame in 1985.\n\nShe retired in 1986 and moved back to Akron, saying she was happy to “just sit.”\n\n“I’ve had a good life,” she said.\n\nWilla Beatrice Player was 94 years old when she died Aug. 27, 2003. She is buried at Akron’s Glendale Cemetery near her parents, sister and brother-in-law.\n\nIn 2005, the North Carolina General Assembly passed a bill honoring Player for outstanding service to Bennett College and for making “a difference in the lives of countless women across the nation.”\n\n“There were people who said, ‘How did that one lone little woman do this?’ ” she once told a reporter. “… I wonder how I ever did it without being afraid, but it never occurred to me to be afraid.”\n\nMark J.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden officially announced his student loan forgiveness plan, but there are so many questions that remain, including:\n\nHow much, exactly, will it cost?\n\nWill it add to inflation?\n\nDoes Biden actually have the authority to wave a pen and make this happen?\n\nBut the overriding question for a lot of people who didn’t go to college, those who already paid off their loans or folks who make more than $125,000 (or more than $250,000 if they’re married couples or heads of households) is this: What about me?\n\nPeople who are interested in buying an electric vehicle with help from a federal tax credit but who make more than $150,000 ($300,000 if married) are asking the same thing.\n\nUniversal proposals are a thing of the past\n\nIt’s a 180 in the national conversation from the 2020 presidential campaign when serious candidates like Andrew Yang were pushing the idea of a universal basic income for all Americans – the idea that every adult American should get a $1,000 per month paycheck, regardless of their income – and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey was pushing “baby bonds” to be given to nearly every American child to address racial inequality.\n\nIncome limits, or means testing, is the government’s way of targeting help to the people that really need it.\n\nIt also creates new layers of government bureaucracy to verify income and can lead to complaints about unfairness and stigmas. More on that below.\n\nInflation fears are real\n\nThere are also valid concerns that funneling all this cash out in the economy – it will be hundreds of billions of dollars, but we don’t know exactly how much – will only add to the rampant inflation that has made American life so much more expensive.\n\n“We need to make college affordable, not send a $10,000 gift to people that already have, in many cases, advanced degrees,” said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, during an interview with CNN’s Poppy Harlow before the loan forgiveness was formally announced.\n\nThe larger problem is the cost of college\n\nGoldwein argued that targeting people with college loans at all is unfair to people who don’t go to college or don’t pursue advanced degrees.\n\n“Disproportionately, student debt is held by people that have advanced degrees and pretty good income, and they can bear it a lot more than everyday Americans that are seeing the cost of their gasoline and clothing go up,” Goldwein said.\n\nNot everyone with college debt finishes college\n\nIndivar Dutta-Gupta of the Center for Law and Social Policy agrees that college affordability is a larger program that must be addressed. But he pushed back during our phone conversation when I said Biden’s program is focused on people who have degrees and earning potential.\n\n“A lot of them don’t have degrees,” he said. “About 40% of people with student debt have no college degree. That’s one thing people don’t realize.”\n\nThere is overlap, he said, between people in poverty and people who have attended some college. His concern is that the income limit creates barriers to getting the help to people who may struggle to prove their income.\n\n$125,000 does not go as far in some places\n\nIt’s also true that individuals with loan debt making $125,000 or less today may earn more in the future.\n\nThere is an added geographic disparity to consider. There are likely more people in New York or California, for example, who make more than $125,000 and yet still feel crushed by their student loan debt than people in more affordable states.\n\nIt’s a step toward racial equality\n\nOne major selling point of the college debt forgiveness announced by Biden is that it can particularly help people of color and also people who take jobs that help society function.\n\nNAACP President Derrick Johnson told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Thursday that while he opposes means testing for loan forgiveness, he can appreciate that it is targeted.\n\n“Now we’re talking about teachers, we’re talking about federal employees, we’re talking about state and municipal employees, individuals who make sure that our economy grows, that maintain the necessary services for our citizens, and who really make democracy work,” Johnson said.\n\nHe also argued – and it’s a valid point – that the government did not ask for means tests when it helped businesses during the pandemic or cut corporate taxes in the hope of fueling job growth.\n\nThere’s been some attention on Twitter to the fact that people like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia who oppose the student loan forgiveness had loans for small businesses forgiven during the pandemic through a government program.\n\nExpanded child tax credit was a much broader benefit\n\nAnother pandemic program that was more broadly applied and had more potential to transform the country was the temporary expansion of the child tax credit, which cut down on poverty by putting money in the pockets of the vast majority of American parents and lifting millions of kids out of poverty while it was in effect, according to studies.\n\nIts income threshold was very high and determined by the IRS, which cut down on the difficulty of applying it. A major issue for the tax credit was that families who made too little to file income taxes were not always identified and paid by the IRS.\n\nThe expansion of the tax credit ended when Democrats could not convince Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia to keep it without substantial tweaks. Read more from CNN’s Tami Luhby.\n\nThe end of the child tax credit expansion was a throwback to 1996, when a Republican Congress and then-President Bill Clinton agreed to drastically scale back the federal government’s role in applying welfare programs and instituted new work requirements that cut down on who qualified.\n\nSome programs are nearly universal\n\nNot all US programs have means testing. Every child in the US is guaranteed a spot in a public school. Every American senior has health insurance through Medicare. Every American who works for about 10 years gets Social Security benefits. Most Americans who lose a full-time job are eligible for unemployment insurance.\n\nThere are catches. Public education varies greatly from state to state and district to district. Social Security benefits are based on income. And some of Medicare’s premiums are on a sliding scale. Unemployment insurance often misses people with gig or part-time work and businesspeople.\n\nThe cost of unlimited benefits makes them politically untenable in the US.

At the time, Tedros said the emergency committee advised that at the moment, “the event does not constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern” but acknowledged the “evolving health threat” that WHO would be following extremely closely.\n\nWHO defines a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, as “an extraordinary event” that constitutes a “public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease” and “to potentially require a coordinated international response.”\n\nThe organization’s emergency committee on monkeypox first met in late June, when its members reported serious concerns about the scale and speed of the virus outbreak but said it didn’t constitute a PHEIC. Tedros reconvened the committee in order to provide the latest information, he has said.\n\nThe PHEIC designation comes from the International Health Regulations created in 2005, and it represents an international agreement to help the prevent and respond to public health risks that have the potential to spread around the globe.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes the regulations as “a legally binding agreement of 196 countries to build the capability to detect and report potential public health emergencies worldwide. IHR require that all countries have the ability to detect, assess, report, and respond to public health events.”\n\nThere are two ongoing public health emergencies: polio, which began in 2014, and Covid-19, starting in 2020.\n\nFour other PHEICs have been declared since the regulations were put into place: H1N1 influenza from 2009 to 2010; Ebola from 2014 to 2016 and from 2019 to 2020; and the Zika virus in 2016.\n\nCurrently, the US is reporting over 2,800 probable or confirmed monkeypox cases in 44 states, DC and Puerto Rico, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Globally, there are over 16,500 cases reported in 74 countries.\n\nMonkeypox is a much less severe cousin of the now-eradicated smallpox virus. It is endemic to parts of West and Central Africa and is usually contracted from a rodent or small mammal.\n\nThe monkeypox virus can spread through contact with body fluids, sores or items such as clothing and bedding contaminated with the virus. It can also spread from person to person through respiratory droplets, typically in a close setting, according to the CDC.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnyone who has had contact with someone with a monkeypox-like rash, or who has had contact with someone who has a probable or confirmed case of monkeypox, is at high risk for infection. A large number of cases this year have been in men who have sex with men, and public health officials are focusing their prevention efforts in this group.", "authors": ["Carma Hassan Carolyn Sung", "Carma Hassan", "Carolyn Sung"], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/07/23/who-monkeypox-outbreak-global-emergency/10134299002/", "title": "WHO chief: Monkeypox now a global emergency", "text": "Monkeypox \"can be contained\" in the United States, a top government physician said Sunday, a day after the head of the World Health Organization declared the virus a global health emergency.\n\nDr. Ashish Jha, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, made the comment after Saturday's announcement, an unusual move that comes as nations grapple with a growing number of people sickened by a once-isolated virus.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the announcement Saturday after the U.N. health agency's expert committee couldn't reach a consensus on whether to apply the highest level of alert to the virus.\n\nThe U.S. government is considering that status, but isn't there yet.\n\n\"We're looking at public health emergency\" as something the Health and Human Services Department \"might invoke,\" Jha told CBS News' \"Face the Nation.\" But he added that the administration is weighing its options.\n\nHe said testing has been made more widely available, and hundreds of thousands of vaccines would be released in coming weeks. \"There is a very substantial ramping up of response that is happening right now,\" Jha said.\n\nWhat does a 'global health emergency' mean?\n\nThe \"global emergency\" designation may help spur more investment into combating the disease amid a scramble for scarce vaccines.\n\nThough a global emergency is the organization's highest alert level, it doesn't always mean a disease is highly transmissible or lethal. Similar declarations were made for the Zika virus in 2016 in Latin America and the effort to eradicate polio, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nGhebreyesus made the decision despite a lack of consensus among experts, calling himself “a tiebreaker.\"\n\nIt was the first time a U.N. health agency chief has unilaterally made such a decision without an expert recommendation.\n\nThere is \"a clear risk of further international spread,\" Ghebreyesus said in a statement.\n\n\"So in short, we have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly, through new modes of transmission, about which we understand too little,\" he said. \"For all of these reasons, I have decided that the global monkeypox outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.\"\n\nBut some experts have argued that the disease isn’t severe enough to warrant the attention, in part because most people recover without needing medical attention, although the lesions can be excruciating.\n\nSymptoms of the disease begin to appear seven to 14 days after exposure and include fever, muscle aches, exhaustion and a rash that can appear on the body. So far, monkeypox deaths have been reported only in Africa, where a more dangerous version of the virus is spreading.\n\nA WHO emergency committee decided last month that the outbreak did not at that time represent a public health emergency of international concern, Ghebreyesus said in his statement.\n\nAt the time, 3,040 cases had been reported in 47 countries, he said. Since then, the outbreak has ballooned to more than 16,000 reported cases in more than 70 countries.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. reported its first two cases of monkeypox in children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN:Rising reports of monkeypox cases in US and around the world raise concern\n\nMonkeypox a growing global concern\n\nThe virus has been found in parts of central and west Africa for decades, but monkeypox began to spread more widely in May as authorities reported dozens of outbreaks globally.\n\nAs a more dangerous version of the virus spreads mainly in Nigeria and the Congo, the only monkeypox deaths as of now have been reported in Africa, where it spreads mainly to people from infected animals such as rodents. But in Europe, North America and other regions, monkeypox is spreading from human to human without links to animals or travel to Africa.\n\nLGBTQ leaders say more testing kits, vaccines and additional health workers are needed to limit the outbreak, which is primarily striking gay and bisexual men.\n\nMonkeypox does not exclusively spread through sex, but some experts worry it could soon become an entrenched disease similar to gonorrhea, herpes or HIV.\n\nInforming men who have sex with men about the virus without causing stigma remains a balancing act, because the virus can affect anyone who gets in close contact with monkeypox, regardless of their sexuality.\n\nMonkeypox in the US\n\nThere were 2,891 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the U.S. as of Friday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. States reporting cases have received 370,000 vaccine doses.\n\nThe White House promised a robust strategy to combat the virus, including vaccines, testing, treatments and communication with areas where the virus has spread.\n\nSaturday's declaration \"is a call to action\" for health officials around the world, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement, adding, \"We are determined to accelerate our response in the days ahead.\"\n\nNew York has had the most confirmed cases of any state at 900. California, Florida, Georgia and Illinois each have more than 100 cases.\n\nIn New York and San Francisco, demand for vaccines has been exceeding the supply providers have available.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the Department of Public Health offers vaccine by invitation only to people who have a known exposure or are at high risk of one.\n\nThe federal government plans to release more than 1.6 million doses of the monkeypox vaccine Jynneos by the end of the year, but demand is so high that the 56,000 doses released in June have almost all been used.\n\nThe vaccine protects against monkeypox but can also be given after exposure to prevent illness, according to the CDC.\n\nOnly two U.S. cases have been reported among children, who are described as being in good health and receiving treatment, according to the CDC. How they caught the disease is being investigated, but officials think it was through household transmission.\n\nOlder adults who were vaccinated against smallpox as children probably have some protection against monkeypox, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious disease physician at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\n\nWHO recommendations\n\nIn Saturday's statement, Ghebreyesus stressed that countries like the U.S. experiencing human-to-human spread must try to stop that transmission and protect vulnerable groups.\n\nIdentifying cases of monkeypox through testing and then contact-tracing remains key to stopping community spread. Vaccines also are an important strategy, he said.\n\nAs with cases of COVID-19, people who have monkeypox should isolate for as long as they're infectious, the statement said.\n\nVaccines and personal protection equipment are also necessary to help prevent spread among health care workers.\n\nImmunosuppressed people, children and people who are pregnant may be at risk of severe monkeypox disease and should consider vaccines, according to the statement.\n\nGhebreyesus said anyone experiencing possible symptoms or anyone who was in contact with a monkeypox case should avoid all travel until they determine they can do so without possibly spreading the virus.\n\nExperts respond to global emergency declaration\n\nThough some experts questioned whether the declaration would help, others have pushed for the outbreak to be designated a global emergency, wondering why WHO hadn't made this decision earlier.\n\nMichael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at Southampton University, said the conditions for declaring monkeypox a global emergency were arguably met weeks ago.\n\n\"I think it would be better to be proactive and overreact to the problem instead of waiting to react when it's too late,\" Head said.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group, released a statement Saturday saying it commends the decision.\n\nThe designation is \"critical to rapidly increase testing capacity and vaccine distribution in order to reach communities most impacted by the virus, particularly gay and bisexual men and transgender women, who comprise the majority of current cases,” said Jay Brown, Human Rights Campaign senior vice president of programs, research and training.\n\nDr. Placide Mbala, a virologist who directs the global health department at Congo's Institute of National Biomedical Research, said efforts to stop monkeypox must be equitable, adding that vaccines should be sent to Africa and be made available to those at highest risk, such as hunters in rural areas.\n\n\"Vaccination in the West might help stop the outbreak there, but there will still be cases in Africa,\" he said. \"Unless the problem is solved here, the risk to the rest of the world will remain.\"\n\nContributing: Boris Q'va, Janet Loehrke, Sara Moniuszko, George Petras and Elizabeth Weise, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/11/coronavirus-live-updates-washington-ban-michigan-cases-us-death/5011587002/", "title": "Coronavirus updates: A pandemic, and Seattle, San Francisco issue ...", "text": "The day was hectic enough, with the World Health Organization declaring coronavirus a pandemic, deaths rising and stocks plummeting. Then the evening came with a range of even more shattering headlines.\n\nPresident Trump banned all EU air passenger travel to the U.S., the NBA suspended its season after a player tested positive, and iconic actor Tom Hanks announced to the world that he and his wife have the virus.\n\nWorld Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic as the global death toll rose above 4,600 and the number of confirmed cases topped 126,000.\n\n\"We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear,\" Tedros said at a news conference. \"We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.\"\n\nThe U.S. death toll climbed to 33 and the number of U.S. cases rolled past 1,300, federal health officials said. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told a congressional committee the virus has spread to at least 38 states. That number increased Wednesday when Mississippi reported its first case, along with Arkansas and Wyoming.\n\n“Right now the epicenter – the new China – is Europe,” Redfield said. “And there’s a lot of people coming back and forth from Europe that are now starting to seed these communities.”\n\nThe current coronavirus outbreak is the first to have drawn a pandemic designation, Tedros said. For weeks, he balked at calling the outbreak a pandemic, and Wednesday he noted that 81 nations have reported no cases of the virus. Another 57 have reported 10 cases or less. More than 90% of confirmed cases are in four countries, and two of them – China and South Korea – are seeing cases decline, he said.\n\nContainment remains as important as mass treatment of the infection, Tedros stressed.\n\n\"Several countries have demonstrated that this virus can be suppressed and controlled,\" he said. “Even those countries with community transmission or large clusters can turn the tide.\"\n\nHere's the latest on the outbreak of COVID-19:\n\nTrump bans people from traveling to U.S. from Europe\n\nThe president outlined strict travel restrictions on passengers arriving in the United States from hard-hit portions of Europe, a ban that will last for at least 30 days. The ban applies to people and not cargo.\n\nTrump said there would be exemptions for Americans who had undergone appropriate screenings.\n\nActing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the restrictions would \"deny entry to foreign nationals who have been in affected areas.\"\n\nWolf also said DHS would issue a notice in the next 48 hours \"requiring U.S. passengers that have been\" traveling in parts of Europe to \"travel through select airports where the U.S. Government has implemented enhanced screening procedures.\"\n\nDow futures fell 1,000 points after Trump's announcement of the ban.\n\nNBA suspends season after player tests positive\n\nThe NBA announced Wednesday night it is suspending its season after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19).\n\nThe league said it is halting operations “following the conclusion of tonight’s schedule of games until further notice. The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic.”\n\nWhile the league did not name the Jazz player in its news release, a person familiar with the situation confirmed it was Utah center Rudy Gobert. The person requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly because of the sensitive nature of the situation.\n\n- Jeff Zillgitt\n\nState Department raises global health advisory, advises against travel abroad\n\nThe U.S. Department of State raised its health travel warning to level 3 late Wednesday, saying that U.S. citizens should reconsider travel abroad due to the global impact of COVID-19. \"Even countries, jurisdictions, or areas where cases have not been reported may restrict travel without notice,\" the state department warned.\n\n- Curtis Tate\n\n‘Bottom line: It’s going to get worse'\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told lawmakers Wednesday that the U.S. has yet to see the worst of the new coronavirus outbreak. He explained that any time there is an outbreak with enough cases of “community spread,” which means the source of the infection is unknown, “you’re not going to able to effectively and efficiently contain it.”\n\nHow much worse will depend on the ability of the U.S. to contain the influx of infected people from other countries and the ability to contain and mitigate the virus here.\n\n“Bottom line: It’s going to get worse,” he said.\n\n– William Cummings\n\nMarch Madness behind closed doors\n\nMarch Madness will go on, but without fans.\n\nThe NCAA announced Wednesday that its popular men's and women's basketball tournaments will be played without spectators in an attempt to prevent further spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNCAA President Mark Emmert said in a statement he made the decision after consulting with public health officials and an advisory panel. Only essential staff and some family members will be allowed at the games.\n\n\"While I understand how disappointing this is for all fans of our sports, my decision is based on the current understanding of how COVID-19 is progressing in the United States,'' Emmert said.\n\nThe tournaments begin next week and conclude with the championship games, April 5 for the women and April 6 for the men.\n\n– Jorge L. Ortiz\n\nTom Hanks says he has tested positive\n\nThe actor confirmed on Instagram and Twitter Wednesday that he and wife Rita Wilson tested positive for COVID-19 in Australia after feeling ill.\n\n\"We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches,\" Hanks wrote on Instagram. \"Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive.\"\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor has been shooting Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis Presley film in Australia. Hanks said he will be \"tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires.\"\n\n- Cydney Henderson\n\nSAT test still scheduled for Saturday — at least for some students\n\nSaturday is one of three scheduled test dates this spring when students can take the SAT college entrance exam. Generally, the test will go on as planned at schools and testing centers around the country, although dozens of locations are scheduling make-up dates or asking students to report to alternate locations.\n\nThe list of closed testing centers is here, but officials cautioned they're not updating it in real time.\n\nIf a student's testing center is closed, the College Board site may list an alternate date or location. If one has not been confirmed, test takers will be notified once arrangements have been made.\n\nIn other parts of the world, the College Board canceled Saturday's test in 17 countries affected by the coronavirus, including China, Italy, South Korea, Japan and much of the Middle East.\n\n– Erin Richards and Chrissie Thompson\n\nSeattle, San Francisco, Oregon ban large gatherings\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee announced a ban on gatherings and events of more than 250 people in the Seattle metropolitan area, where the virus has killed more than 20 people.\n\n“This is not just your ordinary flu,’’ Inslee said in a news conference. “This is a virus that the experts tell us is at least 10 times more potentially fatal than the flu, and this demands a response consistent with the nature of the threat.’’\n\nSan Francisco will also forbid large events, but with a cutoff of 1,000 people, Supervisor Matt Haney tweeted. He added that the ban would last two weeks and that, starting Thursday, the Golden State Warriors would play their home games during that stretch without fans.\n\nPublic schools in San Francisco remain open, but some private ones have closed.\n\nLate Wednesday night, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown announced that all \"large gatherings over 250 people will be canceled statewide effective immediately for four weeks\" and recommended \"implementation of distancing measures\" as part of the state's strategy to slow the virus.\n\nInslee said that as of Tuesday there had been 268 confirmed cases and 24 deaths in Washington state; 19 deaths are linked to one suburban Seattle nursing home. Authorities in King County believe the virus has spread to at least 10 long-term care facilities. The three counties affected by the ban, King, Pierce and Snohomish, are home to nearly 4 million people.\n\nThe prohibition — aimed at social, recreational and spiritual functions as well as community meetings but not businesses like supermarkets and restaurants — will remain in place at least through the end of March. Inslee said it would likely get extended, and suggested the federal government will probably follow suit in implementing social distancing measures in the coming weeks.\n\nSchools in the three counties were not ordered to close yet but were asked to make contingency plans. Later in the day, the Seattle school district announced a two-week closure beginning Thursday, keeping 53,000 students out of the classrooms.\n\nInslee said more than 25,000 cases of COVID-19 are projected for Washington by early April if authorities don't intervene.\n\nAsked about penalties for violations of his emergency order to ban large gatherings, the governor said, “Penalties are that you might be killing your granddad if you don’t do it.’’\n\n– Jorge L. Ortiz\n\nSeattle Archdiocese cancels mass, citing coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe Seattle Archdiocese on Wednesday suspended mass, effectively immediately, because of coronavirus.\n\nCiting Washington Gov. Jay Inslee’s announcement that all gatherings of more than 250 people in three Seattle-area counties would be banned, Archbishop Paul Etienne shared in a video message that he’s asking every parish within the archdiocese to “suspend public celebration of the eucharist.”\n\nOther dioceses and parishes across the U.S. — as well as churches of other denominations — have changed protocols at services, including many Catholic parishes opting to not serve wine during communion. Additionally, many churches are using technology as a way to communicate with congregants, from streaming services live online to sharing podcasts.\n\nEtienne encouraged his parishioners to “pray with confidence, with faith, with hope that the Lord accompany us and protect us,” but also made sure to mention that they should “be very aware of the scientific facts at play in how the virus spreads.”\n\nHe also encouraged elderly parishioners to stay home and self-quarantine, if possible.\n\n– Lindsay Schnell\n\nSenate staff member tests positive, first case on Capitol Hill\n\nA staff member working in Washington, D.C. for Senator Maria Cantwell, D-WA., tested positive for COVID-19, the senator's office announced Wednesday night.\n\n“The individual has been in isolation since starting to have symptoms. On the advice of the Attending Physician, the senator has closed her Washington, D.C. office this week for deep cleaning and staff will be teleworking,” the statement said, explaining the senator will now be working remotely.\n\n“The individual who tested positive for COVID-19 has had no known contact with the senator or other members of Congress,” the statement said. “The senator is requesting that testing be done on any other staffers who have been in contact with the individual and show symptoms.”\n\nSo far, this is the first known positive case of coronavirus on Capitol Hill.\n\nThere have been several U.S. lawmakers who have self-quarantined over fears of contracting the virus after interacting with individuals who had tested positive.\n\n- Savannah Behrmann\n\nJetBlue's business loss worse than 9/11\n\nJetBlue's president, Joanna Geraghty, echoed fellow industry leaders who have said the drop in demand due to the coronavirus is not unlike the downturn airlines experienced after 9/11.\n\nGeraghty said that so far it looks even worse. JetBlue is seeking to cut its capacity by 5% in the coming months, and Geraghty said the airline will consider further cuts as needed.\n\nShe also sought to reassure passengers fearful of getting infected on a plane.\n\n\"If you’re outside of the high-risk category,\" she told USA TODAY, \"it’s as safe as anything else in your life.\"\n\n– Curtis Tate\n\nCoronavirus cover-up in China 'cost the world community'\n\nNational security adviser Robert O'Brien, a member of the coronavirus task force, accused Beijing of concealing the outbreak and hampering a faster response worldwide.\n\n\"Unfortunately, rather than using best practices, this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up,\" he said, referring to doctors who were silenced while trying to sound alarm bells over the coronavirus. \"It probably cost the global community two months to respond.\"\n\nSpeaking at the conservative Heritage Foundation, O'Brien said that if teams from the WHO and CDC had earlier access on the ground in China, it would have \"dramatically curtailed what happened in China and what's happening across the world.\"\n\n– Courtney Subramanian\n\nMarkets tumble; tax deadline could be delayed\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 plunged again Wednesday, narrowly avoiding its first bear market since the financial crisis with a dip of 4.9%. The broad index is off about 19.2% from its Feb. 19 high. The Nasdaq Composite shed 4.7%, also off just under 20% from its record last month.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1,464 points, entering a bear market, or a drop of 20% from its Feb.12 high. That marks its largest decline since the financial crisis.\n\nStocks have been swinging wildly for days, in large part over news of the coronavirus outbreak, and Wednesday's losses wiped out much of Tuesday's gains.\n\nThe Trump administration is weighing extending this year's April 15 deadline for filing income taxes to soften the outbreak's impact on U.S. households and businesses, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n– Jessica Menton and Jazmin Goodwin\n\nCoronavirus can live for hours or days, study finds\n\nNew tests reveal the coronavirus can live in the air for several hours and on some surfaces for as long as two or three days, though that doesn't necessarily mean people get infected by breathing it in or touching something that's contaminated.\n\nThe leading means of infection is still believed to be person-to-person contact.\n\nUniversity and U.S. government researchers simulated the effect of an infected person sneezing or coughing the virus into the air by using a nebulizer. They found the virus could be detected in the air up to three hours later and on plastic and stainless steel as much as three days later. The results were similar to those from tests done on the virus that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak.\n\n“We’re not by any way saying there is aerosolized transmission of the virus,” but this work shows that the virus stays viable for long periods in those conditions, so it’s theoretically possible, said study leader Neeltje van Doremalen at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nArkansas reports first coronavirus case\n\nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson confirmed the state's first case of coronavirus, a male currently at a hospital in Pine Bluff. The patient is being held in isolation, and the hospital and the Arkansas Health Department are gathering information about where he has traveled. He is reported to be stable and improving.\n\n– Pine Bluff (ArkCommercial\n\nGrand Princess to unload 1,000 passengers\n\nThe Grand Princess cruise ship was set to continue unloading passengers for a third day Wednesday in Oakland, California. As of Tuesday, 1,406 people had disembarked from the ship, leaving at least 1,000 still on board. Nineteen crew members who tested positive but \"have been deemed asymptomatic\" remain on the ship in isolated cabins, Princess Cruises said. The ship floated in limbo from Thursday, when 21 coronavirus cases were discovered on board, until docking in Oakland on Monday.\n\nAt least 30 cruise ships currently at sea with about 100,000 people list port destinations in the United States sometime this week, according to a USA TODAY satellite tracking analysis of 380 of the world’s largest cruise ships. It's not clear if all ports will be open to receive them.\n\nMeanwhile, a proposal submitted to the White House by the leading cruise trade organization would deny cruise boarding to any person over 70 unless they are able to present a doctor's note verifying their fitness for travel, according to a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly. Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) submitted a plan to Vice President Mike Pence proposing enhanced measures across the industry. Coronavirus concerns have forced two ships of passengers into quarantine and escalating fears on others.\n\n– Morgan Hines and David Oliver\n\nG7 ministers to meet virtually instead of in Pittsburgh\n\nThe State Department said it would change a planned in-person meeting of G7 foreign ministers to a virtual session conducted by video conference. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was scheduled to host the Group of 7 leaders – from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States – in Pittsburgh on March 24-25.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nMassachusetts infections more than double\n\nGov. Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency after state health officials said the number of presumptive positive cases of coronavirus in Massachusetts is now up to 92, more than doubling in one day.\n\nThe state identified 51 new cases since Monday, Massachusetts Health Secretary Marylou Sudders said at a news conference with the governor. The vast majority, 70, are tied to a conference the biotech company Biogen held in Boston last month. Four are travel-related and 18 are under investigation.\n\nBoston Mayor Marty Walsh said the Boston Marathon scheduled for April 20 is still on – for now. The annual St. Patrick’s Day Parade has been canceled.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nGermany: 70% of country could get coronavirus\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said 60%-70% of her country's population could eventually become infected with the coronavirus and that the key was to slow the spread as much as possible. The government has recommended the cancellation of all events with more than 1,000 people, among other measures.\n\nMerkel said the focus should be on making sure the \"health system not be overwhelmed,\" according to a translation from Deutsche Welle. \"So, it's not the case that it doesn't matter what we do,\" she said. \"First and foremost, it's about gaining time.\"\n\n– William Cummings\n\nMichigan reports first cases, declares state of emergency\n\nIn announcing Michigan's first two coronavirus cases Tuesday night, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer pledged to harness all of the government's resources to slow the spread of the virus. \"We're Michiganders. We're tough,\" Whitmer said. \"We know how to take care of each other. We will get through this, but for now, please make sure your family and friends are taking every preventative measure available to keep yourselves safe.\"\n\n– Kristen Jordan Shamus, Detroit Free Press\n\nNational Guard rolls out in New York City suburb\n\nThe National Guard has been deployed to a New York suburb after Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered schools, houses of worship and other large gathering places in a portion of New Rochelle to temporarily close. Cuomo announced a plan Tuesday to enforce a \"containment area\" of a 1-mile radius around the Young Israel synagogue at the center of the cluster, which includes part of the city of New Rochelle and stretches into the town of Eastchester, both of which are about 20 miles north of New York City in Westchester County.\n\nAny large gathering places within that containment area will be required to shut down through March 25, Cuomo said. Westchester remains at the epicenter of New York state’s coronavirus outbreak with more than 100 confirmed cases. The National Guard will help residents under precautionary quarantine and help disinfect public areas, Cuomo said.\n\n– Jon Campbell and Joseph Spector\n\nItaly's deaths surge\n\nItaly remained in a nationwide lockdown as confirmed coronavirus cases jumped past 12,000.

Purchases you make through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission\n\nAs of today, Thursday, May 11, COVID-19 is no longer considered a public health emergency in the United States. Last month, President Joe Biden signed legislation that would put an end to the emergency classification. The end of COVID-19's emergency status follows nearly a week after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is no longer considered a health emergency on a global scale.\n\nWith COVID-19 no longer considered an emergency, many changes are possible—case surveillance and health insurance policies are both liable to be modified, as well as changes in travel. Yet one thing that won't change as drastically is the COVID-19 itself. It's still out there, with the latest variant even causing pink eye.\n\nMake smart choices without hours of googling. Subscribe to The Checklist newsletter for expert product advice and recommendations.\n\nWhy isn’t COVID-19 considered an emergency anymore?\n\nThe public health emergency comes to an end as COVID-19 cases continue to trend lower and lower. Last week, there were 77,294 weekly cases in the U.S. This is the lowest number of cases seen in a week since tracking began in early 2020. The week before that, there were 90,318 cases and 99,318 cases in the week before that.\n\nRelated:The latest COVID-19 variant, Arcturus, can cause pink eye—here's what to know and ways to avoid\n\nWays you can still protect from COVID-19\n\nWear a mask\n\nWearing a mask has become a fixture of public life in many places across the country. Even with COVID-19 no longer being an emergency, masks remain a great option for protecting those with compromised immune systems and curbing the spread of viruses in general. N95 and KN95 are the gold standard when it comes to masking, blocking 95% of airborne particles, including the ones that cause COVID-19. 95% of airborne particles, including the ones that COVID-19.\n\nWash your hands with soap\n\nNot only does COVID-19 spread via airborne particles, but also via surfaces. When you touch a contaminated surface and then touch your nose, mouth or eyes, you can get sick with COVID-19. One way to avoid this is to regularly wash your hands with soap and water. To properly wash your hands, lather the soap for 20 seconds (about the time it takes to sing the alphabet) and then rinse with warm-to-hot water, per the CDC. Softsoap has one of the best-rated hand soaps on Amazon. With over 57,000 five-star reviews, buyers love that the soap smells great and moisturizes their skin. Softsoap has one of the best-rated hand soaps on Amazon. With over 57,000 five-star reviews, buyers love that the soap smells great and moisturizes their skin.\n\nUse hand sanitizer\n\nNo soap? No water? No problem. You can use hand sanitizer as a substitute for washing your hands in a pinch or when you’re on the go. As long as the hand sanitizer contains at least 60% alcohol, you’ll be able to kill the germs responsible for COVID-19.\n\nDisinfect your surroundings with wipes and spray\n\nInstead of disinfecting your hands after touching a contaminated surface, you can clean the surface itself. You have your choice of disinfectant spray or wipes, both of which can kill the virus and stop its spread. We recommend you disinfect widely used surfaces such as doorknobs, armrests and tables.\n\nPurify the air in your home\n\nAn air purifier can help curb the spread of COVID-19 in enclosed spaces, such as your home. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that using an air purifier can reduce the number of airborne contaminants in an area, including the ones responsible for COVID-19. If you’re looking for a new air purifier, we recommend the best one we've tested, the Blueair DustMagnet 5410i. It boasts exceptional particle removal, quiet operation and integration with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n\nMonitor your symptoms with a thermometer\n\nRunning a fever is one of the many symptoms of COVID-19. It’s particularly common in the Arcturus variant that’s rising in prominence. With this in mind, it’s helpful to keep a thermometer at hand. A great thermometer to have at your side is the Femometer Digital Infrared Thermometer thanks to its high-temperature warning.\n\nUse at-home COVID-19 tests\n\nHaving one or even a couple of common COVID-19 symptoms doesn’t necessarily mean you’re sick with the coronavirus. That's why you should use a COVID-19 at-home test kit, which takes the guesswork out of determining if you're sick and gives you results in as little as 15 minutes.\n\nGet a resistance band for post-vaccine discomfort\n\nStaying up to date with your vaccinations is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19. While mild, getting the vaccine comes with its own slew of side effects. Fortunately, there are many remedies to ease these temporary side effects, including using a resistant band to work out any soreness in your arm. is one of the most effective ways to stave off the spread of COVID-19. While mild, getting the vaccine comes with its own slew of side effects. Fortunately, there are many remedies to ease these temporary side effects, including using a resistant band to work out any soreness in your arm.\n\nStay hydrated\n\nWhether you’re staving off sickness, recovering from getting sick or working through the side effects of vaccination, staying hydrated is vital in staying healthy and comfortable. If you need a new reusable water bottle, we recommend our favorite, the Brita BB11 Premium Filtering Water Bottle which keeps water cold, filters out odors and opens easily with one hand.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

The disease is usually mild but can be fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body.\n\nThe outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact.\n\nIt has spread from Congo to neighboring countries, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, triggering this action Wednesday from the WHO.\n\n\"The detection and rapid spread of a new clade of mpox in eastern DRC, its detection in neighboring countries that had not previously reported mpox, and the potential for further spread within Africa and beyond is very worrying,\" Tedros added.\n\nTedros said on Wednesday WHO had released $1.5 million in contingency funds and planned to release more in the coming days. WHO's response would require an initial $15 million, and the agency plans to appeal to donors for funding.\n\nEarlier this week, Africa's top public health body declared an mpox emergency for the continent after warning that the viral infection was spreading at an alarming rate, with more than 17,000 suspected cases and more than 500 deaths this year, mainly among children in Congo.\n\nProfessor Dimie Ogoina, chair of WHO's mpox emergency committee, said all members unanimously agreed that the current upsurge of cases is an \"extraordinary event,\" with a record number of cases in Congo.\n\nVaccines and behavior change helped stop the spread when a different strain of mpox spread globally – primarily among men who have sex with men – when WHO declared an emergency in 2022.\n\nIn Congo, the transmission routes need further study, WHO said. No vaccines are available, although efforts are underway to change that and figure out who best to target. The agency also appealed to countries with stockpiles to donate shots.\n\nU.S. sees ongoing cases of different virus, urges vigilance\n\nThe global mpox outbreak in 2022 was caused by a different strain of mpox, clade II, which is still present in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nThe latest warning for mpox highlights the clade I virus and its variant, which is believed to be more transmissible and cause more serious illness. No cases from clade I have been reported outside of central or eastern Africa, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an alert last week. It said the spread in the U.S. was a “very low risk\" at this time.\n\nThe CDC's alert last week was the agency's second about clade I mpox since December. The federal health agency issued that alert in response to the worsening spread of mpox in and around Congo. Since January 2023, Congo has reported the largest yearly number of suspected clade I mpox cases.\n\nThe virus is endemic or naturally occurring and has spread beyond Congo’s borders. The WHO said there have been over 14,000 reported cases of the virus with 524 deaths in the region in 2024, a significant increase from 2023.\n\nBecause of the risk of spread, the CDC warned clinicians and health agencies to “maintain a heightened index of suspicion” for patients who had recently been in Congo or countries that share borders with it and present signs and symptoms consistent with mpox. Still, the CDC said the limited number of travelers entering Congo or visiting from neighboring countries lowers the risk of the disease spreading.\n\nIn a news release, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said that while clade I mpox causes more severe infections and deaths in Congo, American officials expect lower morbidity and mortality in the U.S.\n\nSymptoms, vaccine\n\nFor those who think they may have been exposed, the CDC offers this guidance on what to look for, including these possible symptoms of mpox:\n\na rash at the hands, feet, chest, face, mouth or near the genitals;\n\nfever;\n\nchills;\n\nswollen lymph nodes;\n\nfatigue;\n\nmuscle aches or backaches;\n\nheadache;\n\nrespiratory symptoms, such as sore throat, nasal congestion and cough.\n\nThe CDC recommends the JYNNEOS vaccine for people exposed to mpox. A two-dose regimen provides protection to people regardless of the type of mpox virus. However, the vaccine is generally not available in Congo, where it's most needed. On Wednesday, HHS said the U.S. is donating 50,000 JYNNEOS vaccine doses to Congo.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/06/health/monkeypox-testing-who-emergency/index.html", "title": "Monkeypox: WHO to consider again whether outbreak is public ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs monkeypox cases continue to rise globally, the World Health Organization plans to reassess whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.\n\nIn late June, WHO’s Emergency Committee determined that the outbreak did not meet the criteria for such a declaration.\n\nBut as the virus continues to spread, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wants the committee to take up the issue again, based on the latest data around the epidemiology and evolution of the outbreak.\n\nTedros said Wednesday that he will convene the committee during the week of July 18, or sooner if needed.\n\nWHO defines a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, as “an extraordinary event” that constitutes a “public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease” and that may “potentially require a coordinated international response.”\n\n“On monkeypox, I continue to be concerned by the scale and spread of the virus. Across the world, there has now been more than 6,000 cases recorded in 58 countries,” Tedros said.\n\n“Testing remains a challenge, and it’s highly probable that there are a significant number of cases not being picked up,” he added. “Europe is the current epicenter of the outbreak, recording more than 80% of cases globally.”\n\nMonkeypox, a viral disease, occurs mostly in central and western Africa, where the virus is endemic – but as part of the latest outbreak, the virus has spread to many regions of the world where it is not typically seen.\n\nCases are also being reported in African countries that previously were not affected by the virus, and in those places where the virus is endemic, record numbers are being recorded, Tedros said Wednesday. WHO teams are following the data closely, he said.\n\nWHO is working with countries and vaccine manufacturers to coordinate sharing of vaccines for monkeypox, which are scarce. The organization is also working with groups to break the stigma around the virus and spread information to help protect people.\n\n“I want to particularly commend those that are sharing videos online via social media channels, talking about their symptoms and experiences with monkeypox,” he said. “This is a positive way to break down the stigma about a virus that can affect anyone.”\n\nEarly data on the outbreak has suggested that gay and bisexual men and other men who have sex with men make up a high number of reported cases, leading to concern about stigmatizing the disease and the LGBTQ community.\n\nHowever, anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has the virus can be at risk.\n\nThe monkeypox virus can spread from person to person through direct contact with infectious body fluids or with the rash, scabs and sores that the disease can cause. Spread can also happen through indirect contact, such as through clothing or bedding contaminated with the virus.\n\nIt can also spread through respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact or during intimate physical contact, such as kissing, cuddling or sex.\n\nSymptoms of monkeypox can include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills, exhaustion and a rash on the skin that can look like pimples or blisters.\n\nThe rash goes through different stages, developing into pustules before healing.\n\nAbout 41,500 courses of vaccine distributed in US\n\nAbout 41,500 courses of the monkeypox vaccine Jynneos have been distributed to states and other jurisdictions across the United States, according to data published Wednesday by the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nA course of Jynneos involves two doses four weeks apart.\n\nThe Biden administration announced last week that the strategy for distributing monkeypox vaccines would focus on areas with the highest case rates and overall risk. The District of Columbia has the most reported cases per capita, by far, and has received the most vaccine doses per capita, the new HHS data shows.\n\nVaccine distribution has also been heavily concentrated in California, Illinois and New York, particularly the three largest US cities: New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\nMassachusetts, Hawaii and Colorado also received a large share of the vaccine distribution to date.\n\nEleven states have not received any monkeypox vaccine, according to the data; none of them has reported any cases to the CDC.\n\nUS monkeypox testing ramps up\n\nEfforts are also underway to ramp up testing for the virus in the US.\n\nThe commercial laboratory company Labcorp will begin monkeypox testing Wednesday at its largest facility in the United States, doubling the nation’s capacity to test for the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe CDC announced Wednesday that Labcorp will be able to accept specimens for testing from anywhere in the United States, and the company expects to perform up to 10,000 tests per week.\n\nThe outbreak has led to 605 probable or confirmed cases in the US as of Wednesday evening. Cases have been reported in 34 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Three of the cases were non-US residents.\n\n“The ability of commercial labs to test for monkeypox is a key pillar in our comprehensive strategy to combat this disease,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday. “This will not only increase testing capacity but will make it more convenient for providers and patients to access tests by using existing provider-to-lab relationships.”\n\nIf someone thinks they could have a monkeypox infection, a provider will have to order a test. “The public will not be able to go to a Labcorp lab and submit a specimen,” the CDC said in its statement.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe CDC’s Laboratory Response Network has been conducting most of the monkeypox-specific testing in the US, but on June 22, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced that monkeypox testing would expand to five commercial labs: Aegis Science, Labcorp, Mayo Clinic Laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Sonic Healthcare.\n\nThe CDC confirmed Wednesday that it had shipped tests to the labs and that their employees have been trained on how to administer the tests. “CDC anticipates additional commercial laboratories will come online and monkeypox testing capacity will continue to increase throughout the month of July.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/07/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/08/15/mpox-who-global-health-emergency/74800667007/", "title": "WHO declares mpox global health emergency amid outbreak across ...", "text": "The World Health Organization has declared mpox, an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus, a global health emergency following a surge of cases in Africa, officials announced Wednesday.\n\nThe declaration follows mpox outbreaks in 13 African nations, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Central African Republic and other nations.\n\nIt's the second time in two years the WHO has issued an emergency for the mpox virus.

Within one to three days of infection, a patient will develop a facial rash that spreads to other parts of the body, the CDC said. The fluid-filled lesions go through a series of stages before drying out and falling off.\n\nThe incubation period, the time between infection and symptoms, is usually 6 to 13 days but can be 5 to 21 days.\n\nSymptoms of mpox include:\n\nMpox symptoms, while similar to smallpox, are less severe, WHO says. Those infected with mpox often get rashes and other symptoms. Rashes go through several stages, including scabs, before healing, the CDC says.\n\nAbout 10 million vaccine doses are needed for the outbreaks in Africa, according to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\nTedros said WHO had released $1.5 million in contingency funds and planned to release more in the coming days.

Vaccines also are an important strategy, he said when declaring the global emergency.\n\nWhy declare an emergency?\n\nDeclaring the virus a public health emergency raises awareness, frees up money, removes some bureaucratic barriers and enables the federal government to collect more data from states on the outbreak, officials said Thursday.\n\nIt also allows the FDA to quickly change the way the vaccine is administered, vastly increasing the number of available shots.\n\nWho's eligible for vaccination?\n\nThe people at highest risk for infection are being prioritized for vaccination, including people living with HIV, men who have sex with men and people who are already eligible for preventive HIV therapy, Walensky said.\n\nThat includes about 1.7 million Americans, she said.\n\nAbout 600,000 doses have been made available, and nearly the same number is due to arrive shortly, administration officials said.\n\n\"If you have the opportunity to get the Jynneos vaccine, please consider getting it immediately,\" Califf said.\n\nDelivering the vaccine to a shallower layer of the skin would allow five people to be vaccinated from the same vial now used for each person. Califf said the new route of administration is just as easy to deliver as well as safe and effective. \"We're very confident about the administration of the dose.\"\n\nThe FDA will make a final decision about whether to change the shots within the next few days, he said.\n\nWhat about treatments?\n\nAn antiviral called TPOXX is available to patients with monkeypox, though it has sometimes been hard to access during the outbreak.\n\nTPOXX was initially approved to treat smallpox, which kills 30% to 50% of its victims, and has only been studied in healthy people, not those who are infected with monkeypox.\n\nCaliff said it is \"critical\" to collect data on how the antiviral is performing during the outbreak, and the FDA is planning a clinical trial now.\n\nMonkeypox symptoms\n\nSymptoms can begin to appear seven to 14 days after exposure and include fever, muscle aches, exhaustion and a rash or lesions, which can be extremely painful, with some patients requiring hospitalization. The lesions can be extremely painful, with some patients requiring hospitalization.\n\nWhile it can be fatal in areas with poor medical care, five deaths have been reported worldwide, none in the U.S. outbreak.\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n\"We don't have the capacity we need,\" Adams told USA TODAY July 21, \"but we're seeing it gradually start to build up, and experts such as myself are calling on the CDC and the federal government to do more, to increase testing, to increase vaccines and to increase communication about monkeypox.\"\n\n\"While this outbreak is spreading in a particular social network right now, I think we've messaged from the start that there could be cases that occur outside those networks and that we need to be vigilant for it and ready to respond,” said Jennifer McQuiston, the deputy director of the Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology at the CDC.\n\n\"We continue to marshal forward the tools we need to make sure we can take on monkeypox and keep it from spreading to the point of becoming endemic,\" said Xavier Becerra, secretary, Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nWant to know more?

The public health emergency declared in the U.S. due to COVID-19 ended that same month.\n\nBut COVID-19 hasn't vanished, as the post claims.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID Data Tracker shows an average of more than 6,000 people in the U.S. are still being hospitalized with COVID-19 every week. More than 1 million people have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. since the pandemic began, and hundreds of additional deaths continue to be tallied on a weekly basis.\n\nThe WHO, meanwhile, reported more than 174,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide for the week of June 12, along with more than 1,200 deaths.

Current CEO Ursula Burns announced earlier this year that she would step down as CEO but remain as chairman of the new company.\n\n\"With his previous public-company CEO experience and his track record and achievements at Xerox, the board and I are confident he is the best person to lead Xerox forward,\" Burns said in a prepared statement.\n\nJacobson joined Xerox four years ago as its president of Global Graphic Communications Operations when he had offices in both Webster, where Xerox has sizable operations, and at Xerox's headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut. Company officials have said no decision has been made on where his office will be once he becomes CEO.\n\nHe became president two years ago of Xerox technology, the core business for one of the two companies Xerox will become. The other, named Conduent, will be led by an outsider to Xerox, Ashok Vemuri. The move was announced in January with Xerox facing another quarter of declining revenues.\n\nConduent: Xerox names spinoff company\n\n\"As an independent company and with the benefit of the strategic transformation we are aggressively implementing, we will capture the many opportunities available to us to strengthen core businesses and pursue select growth opportunities,\" Jacobson said, in prepared remarks. \"We will build a bright future for Xerox on the foundation of disciplined management, operational excellence and customer focus that is in place today.\"\n\nJacobson was formerly the president, CEO and chairman of digital offset printing solution supplier Presstek. He also held several executive roles at Eastman Kodak Co., having served as chief operating officer of its $3.6 billion Graphic Communications Group and CEO of its Polychrome Graphics venture with Sun Chemical.\n\nThe 56-year-old graduated from the State University of New York at Buffalo and holds a master's degree from the Cornell School of Industrial Relations and a Juris Doctor degree from Pace University School of Law. He has been admitted to the bar in New York and New Jersey.\n\nCompany officials said Jacobson is already heavily involved in the strategic transformation of Xerox's technology business. The company had hoped to see savings of as much as $2.4 billion over three years through the corporate split. Some of the savings have already come in layoffs for some workers, including 48 jobs when it closes a distribution center in Webster later this summer.\n\nTCLAUSEN@Gannett.com\n\nXerox names Ashok Vemuri new CEO of BPO company", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/2021/05/20/alene-candles-offers-1-200-signing-bonus-short-work-week-fill-jobs/5182857001/", "title": "Alene Candles offers $1,200 signing bonus, short work week to fill jobs", "text": "Alene Candles, like many companies, is so desperate for employees at its New Albany facility, it not only offers new hires a job, but also a $1,200 signing bonus and four days off a week.\n\nThe New Hampshire-based company, which opened its Licking County facility in 2012 and expanded in 2019, announced in April it seeks to hire 400 for its operation in the New Albany Personal Care and Beauty Campus, including 300 candlemakers for seasonal work and 100 full-time, year-round positions.\n\nRod Harl, company president and CEO, said Tuesday there are still 80 open skilled positions and almost 200 factory positions available. The sign-on bonuses are for certain positions and a restructured shift schedule allows employees to work a three-day, 36-hour week with a minimum hourly rate of $14.50.\n\nThe company, one of the nation’s leading contract and private-label candle manufacturers, will increase starting salaries and hourly pay for all employees so everyone earns the equivalent of the 40-hour week previously worked while still enjoying four-day weekends. It has 200 full-time employees and 600 total.\n\n\"We need people now,\" Harl said. \"We need people not just to sign on, but stay with us. We’d like to hire people, even temporary, looking for a full-time job. We’re adding people every week, but it’s a challenge.”\n\nOhio Means Jobs/Licking County workforce development administrator Angela Carnahan said many employers are using incentives such as signing bonuses, retention bonuses, referral incentives for current employees and wages increases.\n\nA $300 weekly supplement to unemployment benefits will end in late June. Last year, unemployed received a $600 weekly supplement ending in late July/early August.\n\nHarl said he believes the supplements to unemployment have delayed some people from returning to work, but Licking County's March unemployment was 3.8%, down from 4.7% in March 2020. Two years ago, the county's unemployment was 3.6%.\n\n\"Last year, we offered $600 bonus to come in early,\" Harl said. \"We saw a change in applications. We’re seeing a similar phenomenon this year. It’s bringing people in, but we still are struggling.”\n\nAlene Candles' productivity in 2020 eclipsed its 2019 numbers, despite closing its factory for several months to produce face shields for medical personnel and first responders. The company paid all of its 200 New Albany employees during the shutdown, but 20 to 25 employees volunteered to come in to make the face shields.\n\nTwo-thirds of its candles sold are in the second half of the year, and 40 percent in the fourth quarter. The company's growth is expected to continue into 2022.\n\n“We’re finding our customers are asking us for as much product as we can turn out, even though it’s not typical holiday season,\" Harl said. \"It’s the highest demand, at this time of year, we’ve ever seen.”\n\nAlene Candles began manufacturing in a 100,000-square foot space in a multi-tenant building at the New Albany campus in 2012. Then, in October 2019, it broke ground on a $30 million, 280,000-square foot warehouse a mile from its manufacturing facility.\n\nHarl said he's not sure if fear of COVID has kept job seekers away, but said the company has a good safety record.\n\n“It’s tough to tell,\" Harl said. \"We’ve had good success internally. There's no evidence of community transmission on site. We’ve let people go because they're not following safety protocols. Those following the rules have not gotten sick.\n\n“I’d probably say child care, that may be a bigger impediment than fear (of COVID) at this point. We’re also looking at transportation, a bus service to serve people living some distance away, at a reduced or low cost.\"\n\nHe said the Newark-Granville market is important to the company, which also depends on immigrant workers, enjoying a good relationship with the Somalia community. Still, finding workers is a problem not likely going away, he said.\n\nThe county's workforce of 91,300 and employment of 87,900 is more than March of 2020 or March of 2019. There were 3,400 unemployed in Licking County in March, down from 4,300 the previous year.\n\n“We knew the location of New Albany would, in time, be challenging for attracting workers, but it’s terrific from a supply chain and integration with other suppliers,\" Harl said.\n\n“The central Ohio focus has been on attracting companies that create jobs, and that’s terrific for our economic development. But, it's time to get people to move (here). We’d love to help attract people to central Ohio.”\n\nkmallett@newarkadvocate.com\n\n740-328-8545\n\nTwitter: @kmallett1958", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/energy-resource/2022/01/19/continental-resources-oklahoma-city-doug-lawler-jack-stark-retires/6562294001/", "title": "Former Chesapeake CEO Doug Lawler added to Continental ...", "text": "Continental Resources is reshuffling its leadership team as one key executive departs and another who needs little in the way of introduction to Oklahoma's oil and gas industry joins the team.\n\nThe company announced Tuesday that Jack Stark, Continental's president and chief operating officer, is retiring after a nearly 30-year career with the company.

Investors appear to like the idea of the company going private in some manner, as the stock price shot up 20% immediately after Friday’s announcement and has continued to climb since then. Shares closed at $19.40 on Wednesday, their highest closing price in nearly four years.\n\nUntil Limoneira announced it was pursuing a deal, the value of its stock had dropped lower than when it was first listed on the Nasdaq on May 27, 2010.\n\nHad Limoneira stock gained value at just the rate of inflation since that day in 2010, it would be worth $22.11 now. If the company had gained value at the same rate as the S&P 500, a broad-based index often used as a stand-in for the entire U.S. stock market, its shares would now be worth more than $70, or nearly five times their price before Friday’s announcement.\n\n“The value the market perceives we have versus what we believe is the intrinsic value — there’s always been a big difference between those two things,” said Harold Edwards, who has been Limoneira’s CEO since 2004. “The idea is that maybe there’s a better way for us to operate. Maybe there’s a better ownership structure that isn’t public. Maybe it’s private, or maybe it’s merging together with another public company.”\n\nLimoneira went public in 2010 almost by accident. The company was owned mostly by members of the families that founded it, or the families that owned farms that later became part of Limoneira. But there were so many of those owners that Limoneira exceeded the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s limit for shareholders of privately held firms, and the company had no choice but to list its stock on a public exchange.\n\nEdwards said it typically doesn’t make sense for a company as small as Limoneira to be traded publicly, because there are costs associated with offering stock to the general public and filing the required financial statements with the SEC. Investors also want consistent growth in revenue and earnings, and that's not always possible in the farm business.\n\nUntil the recent spike in value associated the planned ownership change, Limoneira’s market capitalization — the total value of all of its shares — was usually below $300 million.\n\n“That may seem like a lot of money, but for Wall Street, it's not even worth acknowledging,” Edwards said.\n\nStreamlining\n\nThe decision to explore a sale or other major transaction is the result of a re-examination of Limoneira’s business that the board of directors undertook in 2021, he said. The board decided at that time to streamline Limoneira’s operations by selling land and other assets and using the proceeds to pay down the company’s debt.\n\nSince then, Limoneira has sold 3,500 acres of farmland in the San Joaquin Valley for about $100 million and a packing house in Oxnard for $20 million. It has paid down its debt from about $100 million to $20 million, Edwards said.\n\nThe company still farms on that land in the San Joaquin Valley and it still processes fruit at the Oxnard packing house. Instead of owning those properties, it acts as a contractor for the new owners.\n\nThat has allowed Limoneira to keep its headcount at about 350 employees while cutting costs and reducing the land it owns worldwide from 16,000 acres to 11,000, Edwards said.\n\nThe Limoneira that emerges from any future transaction to leave the Nasdaq would be very different from the one that joined the exchange in 2010. There’s no going back to ownership by the founding families and other insiders; the new owner will likely be either a larger company or a private equity firm, hedge fund or other institutional investor. The odds are that owner will have no ties to Santa Paula or Ventura County.\n\n“We understand this is just an exploration,” said Santa Paula Mayor Andy Sobel. “But we would hope that the outcome would be that Limoneira remains part of our economic community here in Santa Paula and part of our branding as the citrus capital of the world.”\n\nLimoneira has been a “more than exemplary” member of the Ventura County business community, said Bruce Stenslie, president and CEO of the Economic Development Collaborative. Edwards is a board member of the Camarillo-based nonprofit, which advocates for a strong business climate and offers consulting and other services to small businesses.\n\n“I have a huge appreciation for Limoneira for several reasons,” Stenslie said. “They have some 130 years of legacy and history and leadership in Ventura County, doing it with a land stewardship ethic that has been extraordinary, setting an example for how business can be done in Ventura County and in California.\"\n\nLimoneira was one of the primary sponsors of Ventura County’s 150th birthday celebration, Stenslie said. The company is also responsible for developing Harvest at Limoneira, a new residential neighborhood on the east side of Santa Paula. The county of Ventura is planning a new public hospital in Santa Paula on former Limoneira land, and the Ventura County Community College District has also had talks with the company about acquiring land for a college campus in Santa Paula.\n\nStenslie said he has “faith that the leadership, both their executives and on their board, will maintain their adherence to their fundamental values” when it comes to selling the company.\n\nMcIntosh, the CLU professor, worked in finance for both Amgen and Patagonia, two of Ventura County’s biggest names in business. He said it’s always possible that a new owner could move Limoneira’s headquarters or make other big changes, but he doesn’t think it’s very likely.\n\n“The reason these companies are valuable is because of the mission and the culture,” McIntosh said. “If you’re the buyer of a company like that, if you come in and you change the mission and the culture to something that’s very slash and burn, and you change the vibe that much, the company probably becomes a lot less valuable.”\n\nEdwards said he is mindful of Limoneira’s history and its prominence in the community. He said the board of directors — of which he is a member — has a mandate that goes beyond just finding the highest bidder and extends to “stewardship” of a company that has been based in or near Santa Paula since 1873.\n\n“All of those issues are front and center and being contemplated and considered,” Edwards said. “I grew up here. I’m five generations deep here. This is my family’s company. It’s not a light decision, but at the same time, I believe there’s an ability to continue to operate and keep it here. It may just have a slightly different profile and ownership, but that may not necessarily be a bad thing.”\n\nTony Biasotti is an investigative and watchdog reporter for the Ventura County Star.

The University of Maryland law school graduate is the only new addition to Mangum’s executive staff who she recruited prior to coming to Tallahassee.\n\nJimmy Miller, the new vice president for Communications and External Affairs, was hired in mid-June. He and Mangum were graduate students together at the University of Wisconsin 40 years ago, and he has spent his professional career working for state and local government agencies in New York and Connecticut. Their connection, Mangum said, was sparked by Miller’s wife, an attorney who was on the board of trustees at Cornell.\n\n“I haven’t brought in anybody close to me for my leadership team. They are professional people who I knew in passing,” Mangum said. “I was looking for people with different skill sets who have the ability to manage with different ideas and new ideas; people you could trust to take an agenda forward.”\n\nThe new CFO who Mangum expects to name in the coming days, also will come from outside the university. She worked with an internal committee to identify four finalists and Mangum was scheduled to have dinner with the fourth candidate last week.\n\nThe only key position left to fill is provost, the vice president for academic affairs and the No. 2 leader on campus. Rodner Wright, former dean of the School of Architecture, is beginning his second school year as interim provost but he has said he never intended to have the position on a permanent basis. Mangum is working with a faculty committee to recruit a provost, and said she hopes to have that person in place before the start of the spring semester in January.\n\nFAMU National Alumni Association President Tommy Mitchell believes there is a widespread misconception that FAMU traditionally likes to “keep it in the family.” He points to some of the university’s legends, Marching 100 founder William Foster, football coach Jake Gaither and Sybil Mobley, founder of the highly regarded business school; none attended FAMU before making a mark at the institution.\n\n“The only thing we ask is that they bring success to the table,” Mitchell said. “FAMU has always been more concerned about what people bring us.”\n\nMarybeth Gasman, a higher education professor at University of Pennsylvania who is widely recognized as one of the country’s foremost authorities on HBCUs, said she believes Mangum is doing exactly what needs to be done to take FAMU in a new direction.\n\n“She’s cleaning house, which is what was needed to be done and what happens at universities across the country. I think it’s important for presidents to bring in people who they absolutely trust. I do not think you need to have HBCU experience to work at an HBCU,” Gasman said. “I think you just have to have an appreciation for the HBCU experience and how important HBCUs are. I think it’s very smart to have a cross section of various people.”\n\nFocus on students\n\nMangum much prefers talking about the students at FAMU than her leadership team. She has created a “customer service initiative” for students that Abdi is leading. It is designed to help students navigate sections of the university, such as the financial aid and registrar’s offices that have been a source of frustration for many students.\n\nMangum also has established an institution-wide “efficiency and effectiveness initiative,” being led by Linda Barge-Miles, who served as chief of staff under interim President Larry Robinson. The two initiatives, Mangum said, are designed to improve how the university functions.\n\n“We’re going full customer service,” she said. “The students should see a change in the behavior at the offices they interact with.”\n\nMangum earned her undergraduate degree at North Carolina Central University, an HBCU in Durham, her hometown. Coming back to an HBCU, so to speak, has given Mangum a greater appreciation for the important role they play, particularly for students who come from what she calls “low-wealth” households.\n\n“I would say I have a better understanding and I’m learning more about the university and the importance of FAMU to historical black colleges in particular,” she said.\n\nThe university’s long-standing commitment to providing opportunities for students who weren’t finding them elsewhere is critical, Mangum said, especially for the state of Florida.\n\n“Without the commitment to low-wealth students, they’re gong to get lost,” she said. “It’s essential that we continue to keep these doors open, that we continue to keep these opportunities available.“\n\nWith the dramatic drop in enrollment, from about 13,300 in August 2011 to an estimated 9,500 this fall, Mangum said it is important that the university take a new approach to preparing its budget so it can properly adjust to reductions in revenue as a result of fewer students paying tuition. The decline in enrollment has been attributed to a variety of factors, particularly changes by the federal government for obtaining and retaining Pell grants and student PLUS loans. The university has also drastically reduced the number of “profile admits,” or students who did not meet minimum state standards for enrollment.\n\nMangum believes a new approach to budgeting will make it easier for the institution to adjust to changes in enrollment.\n\n“I think (the budget) just needs some organization around it, more structure and some controls,” she said. “It was less systematic in approach than I would have liked.”\n\nA challenging trustee\n\nPresidents at public HBCUs have at times found their greatest challenge to be the board of trustees, the same men and women who hired them. At Alabama State in nearby Montgomery, Gwendolyn Boyd’s high-profile, ongoing dispute with several trustees has prompted that state’s governor to intervene. Tallahassee native George Cooper, who gave the commencement address at FAMU’s summer graduation, was fired by South Carolina State in 2010, rehired in less than a month by the same board and then fired again two years later.\n\nSolomon Badger, chairman of the FAMU board that chose Mangum with an 11-2 vote in January, is convinced that Florida A&M hired exactly who it needed when it selected Mangum.\n\n“I think she has a lot to offer. I think she gives 100 percent. I think she brings all the tools to move the university in the direction it should go,” Badger said. “As time has progressed, I see her as an excellent hire.”\n\nHowever, FAMU’s trustees had a difficult time agreeing on a contract with Mangum. The protracted conference calls involving board members and FAMU’s chief legal counsel were at times contentious.\n\nMangum got a taste of just how ugly things can get on what should have been a routine conference call on Aug. 11, to approve the university’s final budget in order to submit it to the Board of Governors.\n\nTrustee Rufus Montgomery, an Atlanta-based lobbyist, insisted that other matters be addressed before a vote on the budget. Among other things, he was incensed that Mangum had not responded to an email he sent three days earlier; she had spent that weekend at the annual Chamber Conference in Amelia Island.\n\nWhen Mangum attempted to explain, Montgomery, his voice rising, said he should not be interrupted and went so far as to announce that Mangum’s microphone could be silenced.\n\nTwo days later, Mangum told the Democrat she felt “bullied” during the call. She said she was bothered by the lack of respect for the university’s president.\n\n“It is a new experience. I have worked with boards of trustees for a number of years,” she said. “I think by and large this group is a good group to work with. You have exceptions who define themselves by being exceptions. Most boards have the best interests of the institution at heart.”\n\nReminded that Montgomery is closely affiliated with Gov. Rick Scott, who appointed him to FAMU’s board, Mangum responded: “What does that say about the people that appointed him?”\n\nGasman, at University of Pennsylvania, is on the board at Paul Quinn College, a private HBCU in Dallas. She is keenly aware of the situation at Alabama State, and is following developments at Tennessee State and FAMU, which all have black women presidents. The lack of respect that some male trustees show is blatant sexism, Gasman said.\n\n“The history of black colleges is a history of black men. Women have been kind of swept away in terms of the history of black colleges,” Gasman said. “You’re seeing a number of women coming into these roles, and they’re pretty powerful women. Guess what? That doesn’t sit well with all men. I think a lot of this reeks of sexism.”\n\nCommunity connector\n\nMangum gets visibly excited when talking about her upcoming inauguration, which takes place Oct. 3 on Founders’ Day. A gala that night will be the culmination of a weeklong series of events.\n\nIf she had her way, every citizen in Leon County and the surrounding region would find his or her way to Florida A&M University’s campus at some point that week.\n\nThe events kick off the preceding Sunday afternoon, with a 5K run (or walk) from FAMU to Cascades Park, followed by a free concert. Mangum is a big fan of the new city park not far from the president’s house, and has enjoyed attending the 8 p.m. water symphonies.\n\nAlas, Mangum is afraid that far too many people in greater Tallahassee have never set foot on the university’s campus — and many aren’t even sure where FAMU is. She heard that time and again during the three-day Chamber Conference earlier this month, much to her surprise.\n\nMangum is determined to change that. She wants local business owners to be keenly aware of how much FAMU students, faculty and staff contribute to the local economy. She is eager to establish relationships with as many companies in town as possible.\n\nMangum also believes FAMU needs to do a better job of promoting itself, including a prominent sign or monument on South Adams for motorists coming into the city.\n\n“There’s nothing that says you’re passing FAMU when you come north on Adams Street. It looks like another strip that went bad,” Mangum said. “What is the reason they are going to come over here? Those are things that we see that we can develop, and we will in time.”\n\nMangum was very visible at the Chamber Conference, meeting key community leaders who had yet to make her acquaintance during her first four months in Tallahassee. This Tuesday, Mangum is the featured speaker at a Network of Entrepreneurs & Business Advocates luncheon.\n\nSue Dick, president and CEO of the chamber, said she talks frequently with Mangum and Abdi, Mangum’s chief of staff.\n\n“(Mangum) wants to be a part of the community and to communicate what the priorities are for the campus,” Dick said. “We’re trying to do whatever we can to support our higher ed institutions. People are very much impressed with her and her team.”\n\nMangum hopes so. She’s already presided over three commencement ceremonies, two in May and one this month. She said she is looking forward to many more.\n\nINAUGURATION WEEK EVENTS\n\nSUNDAY, SEPT. 28\n\nHealthy Families 5K Walk/Run/Roll/Stroll\n\n4 p.m.\n\nFAMU Campus to Cascades Park\n\nSmooth jazz concert in the Capital City Amphitheater at Cascades Park\n\n5:30 p.m.\n\nTUESDAY, SEPT. 30\n\nInaugural Presidential Lecture Series\n\n“Health Care and Equity:\n\nHistorical and Contemporary Injustices”\n\n6:30 – 8 p.m.\n\nPharmacy school auditorium\n\nWEDNESDAY, OCT. 1\n\nWine and Cheese\n\nFeaturing products by the College of Agriculture\n\nand Food Sciences\n\n6 – 8 p.m.\n\nBlack Archives Research Center\n\nFRIDAY, OCT. 3\n\nFAMU’s 11th President Installation Ceremony\n\n10:10 a.m. –12:10 p.m.\n\nLawson Center\n\nCommunity Celebration\n\n12:30-2:30\n\nGaither Gym\n\nInauguration Sponsorship Gala\n\n(Black tie)\n\n7:330 p.m. Lawson Center\n\nShamis Abdi\n\nChief of Staff\n\nFunmi Ojetayo\n\nSpecial Assistant\n\nto the President\n\nJimmy Miller\n\nVice President for\n\nCommunications and External Affairs\n\nKellen Winslow\n\nAthletic Director\n\n‘’", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/11/28/iowa-factories-thrive-but-will-good-times-last-amid-recession-fears/69610330007/", "title": "Iowa factories have been expanding and hiring.

He's been threatening me and blackmailing me and telling me you need to resign over this, otherwise it's being released publicly. And, you know, I was 100% transparent when I applied for this position, as well as several other government positions,\" Pontes said before the meeting.\n\n\"I'm not gonna be blackmailed into that kind of bullying,\" he said.\n\nFollowing the closed-door performance evaluation, the board issued a statement Wednesday morning supporting Pontes.\n\n\"The Board of Supervisors appreciates the leadership, dedication, and resolve that Mr. Pontes has shown over the last two years as county executive officer. During that time, Mr. Pontes has skillfully led the county team through numerous local emergencies including a pandemic, multiple wildfires, and drought,\" the statement said.\n\n\"The Board is confident in CEO Pontes’ leadership in these efforts which are of great importance to our community, and offers its full support moving forward,\" the statement said.\n\nSupervisor Mary Rickert told the Record Searchlight after the vote it was time to move forward and start focusing on real issues like the drought and the upcoming fire season.\n\n\"So we will see what happens, but I think moving forward Matt got a strong sense of support from four of the board members and that's what counts,\" she said.\n\nBefore the supervisors' meeting, members of the board who voted unanimously to hire Pontes two years ago said he divulged the information to them about the conviction during the hiring process and that he didn't try to hide the information.\n\n\"We were all aware. He stepped up; he was responsible. It just makes me furious — of all people to point the finger,\" Rickert said before Tuesday's meeting of Jones' efforts to target Pontes. \"Because Matt has had a stellar, exemplary career.\"\n\nMore from the Board of Supervisors:Shasta County officials endorse Win-River casino relocation to I-5. Here's how they voted\n\nJones, who was not on the board when Pontes was hired, said he received information about Pontes on April 8 about Pontes' criminal past. Jones did not say who gave him the information.\n\nHe said he believed the information was of “grave nature” and he contacted Supervisor Les Baugh, who chairs the board.\n\n“I told him I had concerns and we need to have a closed session regarding the information I had come by,” Jones said.\n\nJones added that once the information was given to him he was “compelled to bring it forward.”\n\nAccording to Jones, he confronted Pontes on April 11 and the county executive officer said he had pled guilty years ago to the charges.\n\nJones told the Record Searchlight that he doesn’t know if supervisors were aware of Pontes’ criminal background before they hired him.\n\n“I just need more information,” Jones said, acknowledging that Pontes' past would not preclude the county from hiring Pontes.\n\nAsked what he plans to do with the information he has on Pontes, Jones said, “Now it’s going to be up to the public.”\n\nJones said Baugh told him before supervisors hired Pontes they talked about his “troubled past when he was a kid.”\n\nMore:Who's Matthew Pontes? 5 things to know about Shasta County's new CEO\n\nPontes, 48, was hired in January 2020, after four years as assistant CEO in Santa Barbara County.\n\nA short few months after Pontes was hired, the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Following that, a groundswell of public anger over coronavirus restrictions led to the attempted recall of three members of the board.\n\nThe weekly board meetings became a venue for public anger, threats and recriminations toward the supervisors.\n\nWhile recall backers could not gather enough signatures to force a vote on removing supervisors Joe Chimenti and Rickert from office, the effort led to District 2 Supervisor Leonard Moty being recalled in February.\n\nThe election also brought in Tim Garman of Happy Valley to replace Moty on the board.\n\nPontes said he thought it was suspicious that Jones was bringing up a conviction for stealing $420 in cash back in 1994, when he was 20 years old.\n\nHe became involved with others in the theft, Pontes said, and because the total amount stolen was more than $500, the charges were elevated to a felony. Santa Barbara County Superior Court records indicate the amount of cash stolen was more than $950.\n\nPontes said he pleaded guilty to the charges, has atoned for his mistakes and has worked to get past them.\n\n\"I proved over the last 30 years that this was just a massive mistake as a young man, and I worked really hard to get that trust and garnered a proven track record for the next three decades,\" he said.\n\nRead more:Reverge Anselmo rears heard in Shasta County District 5 supervisor race\n\nThe new majority on the board has had a negative effect throughout the county, Pontes said.\n\n\"My county employees are terrified of these supervisors and you know, a lot of leadership positions that we have here, they're worried that they're just going to be fired for no reason,\" Pontes said.\n\nMoty, who was among the five supervisors who unanimously voted to hire Pontes, said the CEO's background was well known by every supervisor before he was hired.\n\n“And anybody saying differently is not telling the truth,” Moty said.\n\nBaugh did not reply to a text message.\n\nMoty believes what Jones is doing to Pontes is another effort by the District 4 supervisor “to take control of the county.”\n\n“I think this is about him trying to destroy somebody,” Moty said.\n\nMoty believes the board’s new majority, led by Jones and Baugh, also is attempting to exert its will with county Health Officer Dr. Karen Ramstrom.\n\nRead more:Shasta supervisors take no action on mystery personnel item, receive warning about legal feud\n\nRamstrom has drawn the ire of many who have protested mask mandates, vaccination requirements and other safety measures due to the 2020-22 coronavirus pandemic, and those protesters have found a sympathetic ear in Baugh and Jones.\n\nSupervisors gave the embattled health officer a performance evaluation on March 14 and then went into closed session on April 5 for an item titled “public employee discipline/dismissal/release.” The item did not identify the public employee but many who came to the April 5 meeting suspected it referred to Ramstrom.\n\nSupervisors took no action on the personnel matter on April 5.\n\nDonnell Ewert, who retired this month as director of the county's Health and Human Services Agency, also cited the political atmosphere in the county as one of the reasons for leaving the job.\n\n“I just hope people in Shasta County are paying attention,” Moty said.\n\nDamon Arthur and David Benda are part of a team of dedicated Record Searchlight journalists whose work centers on local issues, including business, government, housing, land development, politics and the criminal justice system, and coverage of breaking news.

Of its top-50 streamed songs in the final week of February, 16 were country songs. That’s compared to just one between Apple and Spotify combined. Of its top-50 albums, 18 were country albums compared to zero between Apple and Spotify.\n\nThough it did not disclose the raw numbers, Amazon confirmed that country music’s percentage of total plays on its streaming service is two-times the industry average.\n\nCD sales paved the way\n\nSpotify and Apple have been active in the Nashville music community for years and both services boast impressive overall streaming statistics and subscriber numbers.\n\nRyan Redington, who heads Amazon’s music division, said the company’s success in country music is due at least in part to the in-roads made before its streaming service began to gain traction.\n\n“Amazon is unique in the sense that we sell physical products,” Redington said. “We have physical customers already as part of our base. We’ve been selling CDs since 1998. So we’ve been in the music business for almost 20 years and built long relationships with those physical customers.\n\n“And a lot of those customers are country music customers. Then I think on the streaming side, what’s nice is as those customers choose to migrate from the physical to the streaming world, we have a very welcoming platform for the country music customer.”\n\nAt a presentation at the annual Country Radio Seminar in Nashville in late February, Redington touted the company’s success with country fans. He said the company has demonstrated the importance of country with its recent investments. Amazon sponsored Garth Brook’s record-breaking tour and was the exclusive streaming partner when the country legend released finally released his catalog on the increasingly popular delivery platform.\n\nAnd Amazon’s success comes as the company staffs up its Nashville office. The company announced in late February that it has hired Music Row veteran Kelly Rich as senior label relations manager for Nashville. Emily Cohen also works out of the Nashville office as music curator, focusing on tracking trends within the country genre, identifying emerging artists and building out playlists.\n\nRich joined Amazon after working at Big Machine Label Group, where she was the senior vice president of sales.\n\n'Amazon is disproportionately country'\n\nAmazon’s success has not gone unnoticed on Music Row. Warner Music Nashville Chairman and CEO John Esposito said his company is fully aware of how well country music is doing on Amazon Music.\n\n\"Amazon is disproportionately country,\" Esposito said. \"Their top 50 has (16) songs, compared to four in the overall top 200 in any given week. So it's noteworthy. Country and classic rock seem to be over-indexing for them.\"\n\nCountry is already the No. 1 station on Amazon Music. And Christian music, which is also largely headquartered in Nashville, is the No. 5 station, the company said.\n\nRedington said Amazon is betting on its voice-operated speaker system called Echo bringing in more streaming customers in the near future. Echo users can sign up for Amazon’s premium streaming service for just $4 per month.\n\n“I can walk home and say, ‘Alexa start playing country music,’ and she’ll just start playing country music on Echo just like that,” Redington said. “You can play country music by genre and by era, so I can say, ‘Play country music from the 70s or the 80s.’ We’ve created a very frictionless way to ask for music.\n\n“You can even ask Alexa to play a song by just singing certain lyrics to Alexa. We’re hoping and we’re confident that this frictionless, welcoming platform draws in more country fans.”\n\nCultivating new artists\n\nLynn Oliver-Cline, the founder and owner of independent music company River House Artists, which is the home to emerging star Luke Combs, said Amazon has already proven to be a great partner for up-and-coming artists. Much like John Marks with Spotify, Amazon is working to cultivate new artists and expose them to fans.\n\n“They are a great partner for us already and we still have some room to grow,” Oliver-Cline said. “They are continually coming up with new opportunities for country artists.”\n\nReach Nate Rau at nrau@tennessean.com or 615-259-8094.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/20/joe-biden-in-arizona-live-coverage/73036185007/", "title": "Joe Biden in Arizona: Recap of presidential visit", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nPresident Joe Biden, after cruising to victory in Tuesday's presidential preference election, switched from campaign mode into chief executive mode Wednesday, his second day in Arizona.\n\nHe appeared at a massive Intel Corp. campus in southwest Chandler to announce billions of dollars in grants to the semiconductor company. The funding, designed to rebuild America's technological leadership in semiconductors, could be spread among multiple Intel projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon, with Arizona receiving one of the largest commitments.\n\nFighter jet responds to flight restriction violation during Biden's visit to Arizona\n\nAn Arizona fighter jet responded to an unidentified threat during a temporary flight restriction during President Biden's trip to Arizona Wednesday morning, according to the North American Aerospace Defense.\n\nAt about 7:30 a.m., radar in Phoenix detected a \"track of interest\" that was not in communication with air traffic control during a temporary flight restriction issued by the Federal Aviation Administration, according to NORAD.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThe detection caused NORAD to deploy an F-15 aircraft that was ultimately unable to identify the threat, according to Michael Dougherty, public affairs specialist with Continental United States NORAD Region.\n\n\"As far as I can tell, there isn't much to investigate because they couldn't identify anything,\" Dougherty said.\n\nDougherty added the reason for the announcement of the possible threat and response was because Valley residents may have noticed the fighter jet as it flew at an altitude of about 7,000 feet.\n\nA spokesperson for Luke Air Force Base said they had no report of the incident or the deployment of a F-15.\n\n— Rey Covarrubias Jr.\n\nBiden departure delays Loop 101 traffic\n\nLoop 101 saw delays Wednesday afternoon in order to accommodate President Joe Biden's departure from Phoenix.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Public Safety said that the highway leading up to the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport will be among the areas that are closed off. It was not specified how long the area would be closed off and the agency did not provide further details.\n\n— Dylan Wickman\n\nBiden departs from Phoenix Sky Harbor\n\nAir Force One took off from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport just before 2 p.m. on Wednesday, wrapping up Biden's trip to metro Phoenix.\n\nPrior to his Wednesday visit to Intel, Biden attended a campaign in Phoenix that kicked off a new campaign initiative called Latinos con Biden-Harris, which aims to \"engage and mobilize Latino voters, communities, and leaders across the country.\"\n\n— Abigail Beck\n\nBiden 'tired of being at the end of the supply chain' on semiconductors\n\nA desire to lessen America's dependence on advanced semiconductors also factored into his talk during the sunny and warm noontime hour. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the country's vulnerability to supply chain disruptions, Biden said. Advanced chip manufacturing is making a comeback in America after 40 years.\n\n\"If it was invented in America, it ought to be made in America,\" he said, in reference to semiconductors.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo earlier said Biden is \"tired of being at the end of the supply chain,\" adding that the CHIPS Act funding is designed to change that.\n\nThe administration seeks to have 20% of advanced semiconductors made in this country by the end of the decade, up from none currently, she added.\n\n— Laura Gersony\n\nBiden says his administration 'ignited a manufacturing boom in America'\n\nPresident Joe Biden took the stage just after noon on Tuesday at Intel's Ocotillo Campus in Chandler to announce a multi-billion dollar grant for the company to build out semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of hundreds of people, Biden portrayed the grant as evidence that his economic program has begun to work.\n\nHis program of targeted investments in U.S. industry, which the White House has dubbed the 'Investing in America' program, has \"ignited a manufacturing boom in America, a clean energy boom, a jobs boom, all here in America, finally,\" the president said.\n\n\"We have more to do. I get it: we have more to do. But no question, our plan of delivering for the American people is working now.\"\n\nConstruction spending on manufacturing has roughly doubled since 2021, according to U.S. Department of Treasury data.\n\n— Laura Gersony\n\nBiden in Arizona:Why 'chips' are one of the most important projects of his presidency\n\nIntel CEO touts CHIPS Act as 'investment in America'\n\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger, with construction of the tech giant’s new plant as a backdrop, told the crowd awaiting the remarks of President Joe Biden that his CHIPS and Science Act investment would usher in ‘the next great chapter of innovation.”\n\nBiden was at the Chandler plant to announce an $8.5 billion grant to Intel to build cutting-edge microchips.\n\n“What an investment in America,” Gelsinger said. “What an investment in the future.”\n\nTouting Arizona as the Silicon Desert, the tech boss said the timing of that investment, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the supply chain crisis it caused, “couldn’t be more critical.”\n\nHe added: “This is a once-in-a-generation defining moment.”\n\n— Sean Holstege\n\nNo protesters in Chandler for Biden's Intel visit\n\nBiden's visit to Intel's Ocotillo Campus in Chandler on Wednesday drew no protesters to the tech manufacturing plant.\n\nNearby Dobson and Ocotillo roads only stayed busy with the daily commuters ahead of Biden's arrival in south Chandler.\n\nA United States flag hung from a construction crane adjacent to the stage where Biden would give his speech.\n\n— Rey Covarrubias Jr.\n\nBiden tours Intel facilities\n\nBefore he was scheduled to deliver remarks, President Joe Biden toured parts of Intel’s facilities in Chandler.\n\nThe tour included a stop in a room usually used for semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nBiden’s entourage included Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Rep. Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, and Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger.\n\nFive chip “wafers” were displayed on the table in front of Biden.\n\n“I was stunned at how thin the fibers are,” Biden said, holding one of the wafers.\n\n“I’ll be darned,” he said. “You’re bringing the future back to America.”\n\nThe president has touted the CHIPS and Science Act, which he signed in 2022, as part of his efforts to revitalize American manufacturing.\n\n— Laura Gersony\n\nIntel exec projects 2025 marketplace entry, says federal money ‘definitely not a bailout’\n\nIntel expects its advanced chips from CHIPS Act funding to start showing up in the marketplace by 2025.\n\nKeyvan Esfarjani, Intel's chief operations officer, also bristled at one reporter's question about the need for a well-capitalized company like Intel to need $8.5 billion in federal grants. \"This is definitely not a bailout,\" he said. \"Intel is investing billions of dollars ourselves.\"\n\nEsfarjani said there's often a 13-times multiplier effect of local communities, meaning that each dollar invested by Intel in Chandler will engender $13 in other investments from local suppliers and even secondary firms like hotels.\n\n\"When we come (to a community), the suppliers come with us,\" he said.\n\n— Russ Wiles\n\nIntel exec stresses importance of domestic supply chain\n\nKeyvan Esfarjani, Intel's chief operations officer, emphasized the need for the U.S. to re-establish dominance in advanced semiconductors, partly for national security reasons.\n\n\"More than 90% of the advanced chips are currently made outside the U.S.,\" he told reporters covering the event. \"That is definitely not OK.\"\n\nEsfarjani also emphasized the need to develop more of a domestic supply chain for this critical industry.\n\n— Russ Wiles\n\nRoughly 40% of new jobs won’t require a college degree, Intel says\n\nWhile the focus of the CHIPS Act and Intel's involvement centers on expanding U.S. manufacturing of advanced semiconductors, many of the jobs that will be created won't require a college education. Around 40% could involve technician positions, company officials said.\n\nChristy Pambianchi, Intel's chief people officer, encouraged potential applicants to see what's available on the company's website. She also emphasized the company's training and apprenticeship program through the Maricopa Community College system.\n\nPambianchi said those programs are a way for people who lack a college degree to gain employment with the company. Even current Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger started as a technician at a company plant in California, she said.\n\n— Russ Wiles\n\nBiden visit prompts focus on workers’ rights\n\nPresident Joe Biden's visit already has resulted in calls for treating workers well.\n\nIn a news release Wednesday morning, a coalition of labor and environmental groups asked Intel to sign agreements they say will ensure workers and surrounding communities around the new projects “have a fair deal.”\n\nThe coalition includes the Sierra Club, an environmental group, and the United Auto Workers, one of the nation’s larger unions with outsize political clout in the swing state of Michigan.\n\nTaking questions from press on Wednesday morning, top Intel officers didn’t directly answer whether such an agreement would be on the table.\n\n“We have a longstanding history of working very closely with all the communities within which we operate. We’ve been here in Arizona for over 40 years,” said Christy Pambianchi, Chief People Officer at Intel. “It’s hard to tell where Intel and the communities are separated. For us, that’s just a way of doing business.”\n\nWhile running for president in 2020, President Joe Biden said he would ensure federal contracts only go to employers that sign an agreement saying they won’t oppose unionization efforts, also known as a “neutrality agreement.”\n\n— Russ Wiles and Laura Gersony\n\nWhy Intel? What to know\n\nIntel is the world’s second-largest producer of semiconductor chips, which are basically tiny brains that help power everything from cellphones to air conditioners.\n\nIt set up shop in Chandler in 1980 and the city is now home to Intel’s only two large-scale facilities in Arizona. The company generates nearly $9 billion in statewide economic impact each year.\n\nThe company also is spending $20 billion to expand one of its Chandler facilities. It will make the local campus Intel’s largest manufacturing complex anywhere on earth at a time when the world needs a secure supply of chips more than ever.\n\nThe company’s two main facilities in Chandler are called the Ocotillo campus and the Chandler campus. The Ocotillo campus is almost exclusively focused on manufacturing semiconductors. The Ocotillo site is massive. It’s made up of more than a dozen buildings and occupies roughly 700 acres in southwest Chandler.\n\n— Sam Kmack\n\nHow big a deal is the microchip industry in Arizona?\n\nIt’s huge. Metro Phoenix is one of the nation’s hubs for this technology.\n\nSince January 2020, 35 companies in the semiconductor industry have announced plans to expand or relocate to Arizona, representing $65 billion in investment, according to data from the Arizona Commerce Authority.\n\nThose companies include massive fabrication facilities, like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel, which are both underway on multi-billion-dollar projects to manufacture semiconductors in Phoenix and Chandler. The list also includes dozens of smaller companies that work in the supply chain, including chemical manufacturers, packaging, transportation and other areas that serve the industry.\n\nIn total, the companies represent more than 13,000 jobs, according to the Arizona Commerce Authority.\n\n— Corina Vanek\n\nDid other presidents visit Arizona microchip plants?\n\nYes. Biden and former President Barack Obama have both come to the Valley to promote chip manufacturing plants.\n\nIn December 2022, Biden visited Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s north Phoenix campus for the “tool in” ceremony. At the ceremony, Biden and TSMC executives also announced the expansion of the facility, growing the investment from $12 billion to $40 billion.\n\nObama visited Intel’s campus in January 2012. At the time, the plant was under construction on a $5 billion expansion. Obama used the visit to emphasize the need for domestic manufacturing.\n\nObama's visit was remembered for a tense encounter with then-Gov. Jan Brewer, who stuck her finger in the president's face not long after Air Force One landed.\n\n— Corina Vanek\n\nWhat is the CHIPS Act?\n\nThe CHIPS and Science Act was signed into law in August 2022. It paved the way for investment of $53 billion into semiconductor manufacturing and research around the country.\n\nThe law was a significant step for Arizona's semiconductor industry, which has been rapidly growing since Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. announced plans to build a massive factory in Phoenix in 2020.\n\nThe Arizona Commerce Authority and other organizations formed the Arizona Small-Scale Supplier Consortium, aimed at showing the importance of individual suppliers in Arizona.\n\nAbout 20 companies are taking part in the supplier consortium, an ACA spokesperson said. In total those companies represent about $1.8 billion in investment and expect to create 3,800 jobs.\n\n— Corina Vanek\n\nWhat is President Biden doing at Intel in Chandler?\n\nBiden was to appear at Intel Corp.’s Ocotillo campus to announce funding from the CHIPS Act for cutting-edge microchip production.\n\nIntel, already one of Arizona's largest employers, will receive up to $8.5 billion in federal grants as part of a preliminary agreement to be announced by President Biden and U.S. Commerce Department officials. The grants would mark one of the largest-ever semiconductor manufacturing investments.\n\nThe $8.5 billion in CHIPS funding that Intel stands to receive, in addition to up to $11 billion in federal loans, will help expand two fabs, or factories, in Chandler. It will also help bring the company's most advanced semiconductors to the market. Building factories like these \"are like building a city,\" said Keyvan Esfarjani, Intel's chief operations officer.\n\nOver the next five years, Intel expects to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. as it expands capacity in Arizona and the other three states, with an estimated creation of more than 10,000 manufacturing jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs.\n\nThe proposal also calls for about $50 million to develop the company's semiconductor and construction workforces.\n\n— Russ Wiles", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/27/government-shutdown-2023-odds-probability-live-updates/70978602007/", "title": "Possible government shutdown 2023: How a shutdown affects you", "text": "Editor's note: This page is the news of a potential government shutdown from Wednesday, Sept. 27.

Because it's not impacted, employees will be paid normally.\n\n\"Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown, and all Post Offices will remain open for business as usual,\" the statement said.\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nBiden says government shutdown not ‘inevitable,’ urges House Republicans ‘do their job’\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Americans need House Republicans to “do their job” as he held out hope Wednesday that a government shutdown can be avoided before the end-of-week deadline for congressional action.\n\n“I don’t think anything is inevitable in politics,” Biden said, speaking in San Francisco at the president’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, which recommends federal policy on science and technology.\n\nBiden said a government shutdown would impact “vital work in science and health” including cancer research and food-safety policies.\n\n“The American people need our Republican friends in the House of Representatives to do their job: Fund the government,” Biden said.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWill military get paid in October?\n\nMilitary pay for millions of active-duty service members and reservists could dry up with a government shutdown – a major difference between the current threatened shutdown and previous recent suspensions of non-essential spending.\n\n“Military personnel will not be paid until such time as Congress appropriates funds available to compensate them for this period of service,” the Defense Department said in a September memo to Pentagon leaders preparing for a potential lapse in spending.\n\nBut the department said personnel would continue working regardless. Federal workers are traditionally reimbursed for lapses in funding once Congress agrees to resume spending, but the lapse in paychecks can be difficult for staffers without savings.\n\n“Military personnel on active duty, including reserve component personnel on Federal active duty, will continue to report for duty and carry out assigned duties,” the department said in a Sept. 12 announcement in preparation for a shutdown.\n\nThe government has about 1.3 million active-duty service members and 800,000 reservists.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nWill a government shutdown affect flights?\n\nThe deepest impact would not be on your flight or cruise.\n\nFunding to agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration, Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection would be on hold. However, the agents who you typically interact with at airports and seaports, and the controllers who oversee your flights are considered essential and will be working without pay during the shutdown.\n\nImpacts on those agencies have more to do with things like hiring and training. All the crucial safety functions like inspections and air traffic control continue.\n\nConsular operations in the U.S. and internationally will also continue normally “as long as there are sufficient fees” collected to support them, according to the most recent guidance from the State Department. “This includes passports, visas, and assisting U.S. citizens abroad.”\n\nThere could be economic repercussions, though. A government shutdown is estimated to cost the country's travel economy as much as $140 million per day, according to an analysis for the U.S. Travel Association.\n\n− Zach Wichter and Nathan Diller\n\nWould a government shutdown affect Social Security?\n\nSocial Security recipients will continue to receive checks in the event of a government shutdown and Medicare benefits will not be interrupted.\n\nHowever, employees in the Social Security Administration are likely to be furloughed and government food assistance benefits could see delay.\n\nA few services that are not directly related to Social Security payment benefits and direct-service operations would be temporarily suspended.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill a government shutdown affect food stamps and WIC?\n\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP, will continue for at least the month of October, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said in a press briefing Monday. But he warned that “if the shutdown were to extend longer than that, there would be some serious consequences to SNAP.”\n\nFunding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children − better known as WIC − will stop “immediately when the shutdown occurs,” he said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has a contingency fund that may extend the program for a day or two, and some states may have leftover WIC benefits not spent that could extend the program for a week or so in that state.\n\n“But the vast majority of WIC participants would see an immediate reduction and elimination of those benefits, which means the nutrition assistance that’s provided would not be available,” Vilsack said.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat happens to the IRS in a shutdown?\n\nThe IRS may have to partially close starting this weekend if there is a government shutdown.\n\nWhile the agency initially said it would be able to continue operations and pay employees through a shutdown, the IRS reversed course last week, telling the National Treasury Employees their new contingency plan would include some furloughs.\n\nMillions of Americans are still waiting for their tax refunds from the last filing season, and there is concern a shutdown and IRS closure would escalate this backlog.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhat is the deadline for the government shutdown?\n\nThe U.S. government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 1 if lawmakers don't pass a continuing resolution or a federal budget by Sept. 30.\n\nThe continuing resolution, a stopgap measure that would temporarily fund the government while lawmakers work to pass a comprehensive budget, would prevent a shutdown from occurring on Oct. 1.\n\nSpeaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the House will vote Friday on a continuing resolution, but it's unclear if it has enough votes to pass.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDoes a government shutdown affect state employees?\n\nA shutdown could impact state employees whose employers depend on federal funds to operate and must shut down certain activities that the government has deemed non-necessary.\n\nIn this case, certain state employees could be furloughed until a shutdown passes.\n\nBut state employees who receive salaries from private employers who do not rely on federal funds wouldn’t necessarily be impacted.\n\n-Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow does a government shutdown affect the stock market?\n\nWhile a potential shutdown isn’t expected to have much of an impact on the stock market, experts say it has contributed to the S&P 500's more than 5% dip so far this month, to 4,275.\n\nIt's “one of the reasons why you've seen the market weaken,” according to Marc Zabicki, chief investment officer of LPL Financial. But after the potential shutdown begins, “I don't know that you're going to get any stark reaction from asset markets come Oct. 2 next week. I think it's already largely been built into prices.”\n\nWhile the looming shutdown is contributing to the recent market dip, it’s not the only driver.\n\nSeptember is also a historically weak month for stocks, according to Jeffrey A. Hirsch, CEO of Hirsch Holdings and editor-in-chief of the Stock Trader's Almanac.\n\nMeanwhile, there are a \"lot of other items going on\" that are affecting the market, including higher interest rates, looming student loan payments, the United Auto Workers strike, rising oil prices and more, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices\n\n“We're in a very volatile time now,\" Silverblatt said.\n\nThere have been six partial or full government shutdowns since 1990. While some were resolved in less than a week, the most recent in late 2018 and early 2019 lasted over one month.\n\nWhen looking at the S&P 500’s median performance one month after the shutdown compared with one month prior, the benchmark gained a median of 5.5% with positive returns five out of six times, according to a Wednesday note from Bespoke Investment Group co-founder Paul Hickey.\n\n“Like the people that occupy the chambers of Congress, past shutdowns have been a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing,” the note reads.\n\nIn other words, the looming shutdown is \"more of a headline event than a bottom-line event,\" according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. Past shutdowns, he said, left \"angered tourists more than disappointed traders.\"\n\nA Sept. 13 Wells Fargo report led by global strategist Gery Schollberg and analyst Jennifer Timmerman notes that while the S&P 500 tends to sag before and through the early part of longer shutdowns, “it did not take long for stocks to regain composure after the government reopened in each instance.”\n\n“This time, however, a shutdown risks aggravating other potential body blows to the economy … leaving stocks more exposed to volatility and to extended weakness.”\n\nThe report's authors said they believe a shutdown, if it does occur, has the potential to last at least a few weeks because of hardened positions in an increasingly polarized Congress.\n\n\"The longer it goes, the more difficult it will become economically and also from an asset market perspective,\" Zabicki of LPL said, adding that Washington's polarization \"increases the risk that something could go wrong.\"\n\nHowever, he said recent history shows that \"these are typically not long-lasting events.”\n\n− Bailey Schulz and Daniel de Vise\n\nWhat is a government shutdown?\n\nA government shutdown means all federal agencies and services officials don’t deem “essential” have to stop their work and close their doors.\n\nSome of those essential services include the U.S. Postal Service delivering mail and people receiving Medicare and Social Security benefits. Those will continue whether or not the government shuts down.\n\nBut so-called “non-essential” work can still have significant impacts for federal employees and Americans across the country. Thousands of federal workers would be furloughed, government food assistance benefits could be delayed and some food safety inspections could also be put on pause.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat is the meaning of furloughed?\n\nA furlough occurs when an employee is required to take a mandatory and temporary unpaid leave of absence from their work. An employer can furlough employees to cut back costs or manage operations during a potential government shutdown.\n\nA furlough is different from a layoff, which are permanent terminations in which employees can’t return back to work.\n\n-Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen would a government shutdown start?\n\nA government shutdown would start Sunday if lawmakers cannot pass a federal budget or stopgap measure by Sept. 30.\n\nThe stopgap, known as a continuing resolution, would prevent an Oct. 1 shutdown by temporarily extending government funding.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\n'Are we going to shut down this weekend? I believe we will'\n\nA government shutdown, some Republicans say, is inevitable at this point given the time crunch Congress is facing and the gridlock between lawmakers.\n\nMcCarthy has committed to voting Friday on a stopgap bill to keep the government open, but even if House Republicans pass it along party lines, it’s a non-starter with the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nWhen asked if the two chambers could reconcile their differences ahead of the Sept. 30 funding deadline, Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., a senior appropriator, told reporters, “We all know the answer to that: No, there’s not enough time.”\n\n“Are we going to shut down this weekend? I believe we will and I think conventional wisdom should tell you that,” Womack added. He said he hopes lawmakers could have an “epiphany” and avert a shutdown in the waning days.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nSenate blames fractured House GOP caucus for looming government shutdown\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor Wednesday morning that McCarthy is aiming for a government shutdown by adhering to ultraconservatives in his party.\n\nHe encouraged the House speaker to work in a bipartisan way to pass a stopgap measure in the lower chamber and said the California lawmaker has “twisted himself into pretzels” to “avoid his responsibility of governing.”\n\n“Every bill House Republicans have pushed has been partisan. Every C.R. has been aimed at the hard right and every path they’ve pursued to date will inevitably lead to a shutdown,” Schumer said.\n\nMcConnell echoed Schumer’s call for bipartisanship, saying on the Senate floor Wednesday that shutting down the government “isn’t an effective way to make a point.\" For Congress to move forward on unresolved funding priorities, they must avert a shutdown, he said.\n\n− Rachel Looker\n\nWhat's the probability of a government shutdown?\n\nHold off on placing any bets. If lawmakers in the House and Senate can reach a compromise by Sept. 30 on a dozen bills that would fund the government, a shutdown is off the table. Congress could also pass a temporary measure to keep the government funded, known as a continuing resolution.\n\nBut both of those options are unlikely as of Wednesday afternoon. Lawmakers haven’t agreed on all 12 bills they would need to pass, and a group of conservative House Republicans have insisted on hardline spending cuts that have no chance of passing in the Senate, which is currently controlled by Democrats.\n\nLast week, House Democrats and moderate Republicans appeared to start working on a fallback plan, but it’s not clear the rare bipartisan push would receive enough support to dodge a shutdown.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat are the 12 appropriation bills?\n\nIn order to fund the government, lawmakers must pass 12 appropriations bills – each tailored to a specific government function.\n\nThe appropriations bills are handled by their respective subcommittees in both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. For example, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense steers the Defense spending bill, which provides funding for the Department of Defense and other related activities.\n\nIn previous years, Congress passed an “omnibus” package – a massive bill combining all 12 appropriations bills into one piece of legislation. The change this year is among the concessions House Speaker Kevin McCarthy made to hardline conservatives in his bid for the job in January when he promised to pass all 12 bills separately.\n\nHard-right lawmakers have argued a vote on each bill would allow for more transparency in the spending process. But with three days left before a government shutdown, it is virtually impossible for Congress to pass all 12 bills in time considering the House has only passed one of the 12 and the Senate hasn't passed any.\n\nThe only likely resolution to avert a shutdown is a short-term stopgap measure to keep the government open and buy lawmakers more time to move through the appropriations process.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nLatest updates on the government shutdown\n\nGOP lawmakers emerged from a closed-door weekly conference meeting Wednesday, deriding the Senate’s version of a temporary funding bill for its lack of border security provisions. It's the major sticking point for most House Republicans in the government shutdown fight who say any funding measure must include border security language.\n\n“The Senate is going to have to realize that the House is not going to move something that doesn't have border security at its core,” Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., a key negotiator and chair of the centrist Republican Main Street Caucus, told reporters Wednesday morning.\n\nBut House GOP requests for an aggressive border security package have almost no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate. That's why Johnson and other Republicans are pinning the blame on Democrats for refusing to cede to their demands even though the House has been consumed by GOP infighting for the past weeks in spending negotiations.\n\n“If they’re not willing to accept that fact, they are standing in the way of us funding this government,” Johnson said.\n\n−Ken Tran\n\nWhat would happen if the government shuts down?\n\nIn a government shutdown, all federal agencies that are not \"essential\" — think U.S. Postal Service, Medicare and Social Security — would stop work.\n\nThis means thousands of federal employees would be on furlough and Americans would go without government benefits such as food and housing support.\n\nAir travel will be generally spared: Air traffic controllers and TSA agents will continue working, though without pay. Travelers may also contend with longer wait times and flight delays.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow long would the government shutdown last?\n\nGovernment funding is set to expire on Oct. 1. How long a potential shutdown would last depends on how soon the House and Senate are able to pass a new appropriations plan that President Joe Biden signs.\n\nThe length of past government shutdowns have varied, lasting from five days to 21 days.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-FL., said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that if the departments of Labor and Education \"have to shut down for a few days as we get their appropriations in line, that’s certainly not something that is optimal.”\n\n“But I think it’s better than continuing on the current path we are to America’s financial ruin,” Gaetz said.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow long was the last government shutdown?\n\nThe last government shutdown lasted from Dec. 22, 2018 to Jan. 25, 2019. Spanning 35 days, it was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nIt was also the third federal shutdown to occur during the Trump administration; the first lasted three days in January 2018, and the second lasted only a few hours in February 2018.\n\n−Olivia Munson\n\nGovernment shutdown history chart\n\nOver the last five decades, there have been 21 federal shutdowns:\n\n1976 : Under President Gerald Ford.

Some lawmakers however, have introduced bills in the past to withhold pay for lawmakers during a shutdown. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., introduced legislation doing just that last Wednesday.\n\n“I’m introducing legislation to block Member pay during a McCarthy shutdown, because it’s ridiculous that we still get paid while folks like TSA workers are asked to work without a paycheck,” Craig said in a statement.\n\nTheir staffers however, will not receive pay. Like other federal employees, Congressional staffers and aides considered essential work without pay and receive their paychecks retroactively after the shutdown ends.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nMajority of Americans want Congress to prevent government shutdown: poll\n\nA Monmouth University poll released Wednesday found over 60% of Americans want Congress to compromise to avert a government shutdown.Americans polled reported they do not feel President Joe Biden or lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are looking out for Americans.According to the poll, 43% of Americans would hold Republicans most responsible for a shutdown. Others, 27%, place the blame on Biden while 21% are pointing fingers at Democrats.− Rachel Looker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2024/04/08/biden-new-student-loan-forgiveness-proposal/73218916007/", "title": "Student loan forgiveness: Biden commits to new plan ahead of ...", "text": "President Joe Biden’s administration gave a much-anticipated preview Monday of his final plan to bring student debt forgiveness to millions of Americans.\n\nMore than 4 million student loan borrowers − many of whom have been paying down their debt for 20 years or more − could see their debt fully canceled under the proposal, according to the White House. In addition, more than 10 million borrowers could get $5,000 or more in relief.\n\nBiden also hopes to eliminate interest past the original loan amounts of 23 million borrowers.\n\nThough experts say the regulations aren’t expected to fully take effect until July of next year at the earliest, the Department of Education is considering taking actions to expedite parts of the plan, which could bring relief to some borrowers as soon as this fall.\n\nThe announcement represents Biden's most aggressive action yet trying to work around the Supreme Court’s rebuke of his first student loan relief gambit, which would have canceled up to $20,000 in student loan debt for millions of low- and middle-income borrowers.\n\nThe final regulation hasn’t been released and it isn't likely to be set in stone for months. The White House’s eagerness to promote it at this in-between moment underscores how central student loan forgiveness has become in Biden’s reelection effort.\n\nBiden and his surrogates – including Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Douglas Emhoff – will fan out across the U.S. on Monday to tout the proposal.\n\nAt an event Monday in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin, Biden argued that student loan payments too often prevent Americans from spending money that could otherwise stimulate the economy. The gains he projects from his forgiveness plan would far outweigh the costs, he said.\n\n“That’s not hyperbole,” he said. “That’s the truth.”\n\nAfter months of talks, student loan panel greenlights plan\n\nAdministration officials say they’re confident the plan will pass legal muster. But potential court challenges could derail the federal government’s timeline for waiving debt. Meanwhile, the bungled rollout of a new college financial aid form has prompted Republicans such as Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., to criticize the Education Department for prioritizing student loan forgiveness.\n\n“It seems the reason students don’t know what schools they can afford this year is because Biden’s Department of Education is spending its time concocting student loan schemes instead of fixing the mistakes they’ve already made on FAFSA,\" Cassidy said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe Job Creators Network Foundation, a conservative advocacy group, said the latest attempt at student loan forgiveness is illegal, given the Supreme Court's ruling last year.\n\n\"The Biden administration is lawlessly ignoring the Supreme Court and Congress by launching another massive student loan bailout program,\" Elaine Parker, the organization's president, said in a statement Monday. \"Biden has made it clear that he won't respect this decision. He is acting as a King, not a president.\"\n\nOn a call with reporters Sunday, Cardona said the administration remains \"unapologetic\" about its aggressive debt cancellation strategies.\n\n\"It means breathing room,\" he said. \"It means freedom from feeling like your student loan bills compete with basic needs like grocery or health care.\"\n\nHigh-profile Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and student loan relief advocates commended the White House's proposal.\n\nAissa Canchola Bañez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, said the plan provides a \"road map\" for the administration to deal with \"a hostile Supreme Court majority captured by right-wing special interests.\"\n\nThe surest path to relief, she said in a statement, is to \"call the high court’s bluff by aggressively using the full power of the law and delivering for working people.\"\n\nBiden’s first attempt at delivering broad student loan forgiveness relied on exercising his emergency authority during the COVID-19 pandemic. Legal challenges halted the plan before it got off the ground, though, and last summer the Supreme Court struck it down.\n\nThe president immediately pledged to come up with a Plan B. Rather than use his emergency powers, he promised to seek changes to federal higher education law, triggering a process that involved a lot more government red tape.\n\nAfter months of sometimes contentious meetings, a panel of student loan experts greenlighted parts of Biden’s new plan in February.\n\nWho could get relief?Biden's student loan relief plan would help borrowers with old loans, ballooning interest\n\nWho could get student loan forgiveness under Biden’s new plan?\n\nBiden’s old plan hit legal snags because it would have relieved the student loan debt for broad swaths of borrowers. His new plan makes similar promises but in different ways.\n\nBorrowers experiencing specific forms of \"hardship,\" such as big expenses for child care and medical bills, could get their debt entirely canceled if they fill out an application. The Education Department also hopes to use government data to calculate which borrowers are likely to default on their loans. They could have their debt canceled, too.\n\nIndividual borrowers who make $120,000 a year or less could see all the extra interest on their loans forgiven if they enroll in Biden’s income-driven repayment plan. In addition, people in repayment for at least 20 years may also have their balances wiped.\n\nBiden focuses on debt relief as election, lawsuits loom\n\nBecause student loans are a top issue for voters, Biden is keen on finalizing the new rules as soon as possible.\n\nStill, Monday's announcement won’t be the end of the story. Legal challenges are likely – Biden’s conservative opponents have been poised to sue the administration over student loan forgiveness efforts at every turn.\n\nIn late March, attorneys general in nearly a dozen red states sued in federal court over Biden’s signature student loan repayment initiative. The income-driven plan, known as Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, was launched last fall and has led to the cancelation of balances for tens of thousands of participants.\n\nWhen news began percolating Friday that Biden was hinting at more student debt relief this week, critics were quick to pounce.\n\n\"The Biden administration is once again looking to have a huge, unilateral – and hence unconstitutional – student debt cancellation,\" Neal McCluskey of the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute, said on X, citing a Wall Street Journal article that first reported the news.\n\nDeep look:Biden promised to make student loan forgiveness in bankruptcy court easier. But has he?\n\nWhat student loan debt has Biden already canceled?\n\nThe administration has already used several other creative levers to relieve roughly $146 billion in student loans. Those efforts include:\n\nNearly $46 billion for about 900,000 borrowers through one-time fixes to their income-driven repayment plans.\n\nAbout $62.5 billion for up to 872,000 borrowers through Public Service Loan Forgiveness fixes.\n\nMore than $22.5 billion for 1.2 million borrowers who attended predatory or defunct schools.\n\nClose to $12 billion for several hundred thousand borrowers with disabilities that make it difficult for them to pay off their loans.\n\nRoughly 4 million borrowers have had student loans forgiven thanks to policies or changes implemented under Biden.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/07/politics/summit-of-the-americas-joe-biden/index.html", "title": "Snubs from key leaders over Summit of the Americas reveal Biden's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe decision by Mexico’s President to boycott this week’s summit for regional leaders in Los Angeles rendered futile months of work by President Joe Biden and other top officials to convince him to attend.\n\nNow, key nations in Central America are following President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s lead, dispatching only lower-level delegates instead of their leaders. And by the time Biden arrives to the summit Wednesday, questions over the event’s invitation list and attendees will have obscured its larger purpose, a source of frustration to administration officials who didn’t necessarily expect the mess.\n\nThe decision by several countries to stay away from the southern California gathering, a protest of Biden’s decision not to invite three regional autocrats, has underscored the struggle to exert US influence in a region that has become fractured politically and is struggling economically.\n\nAnd it has exposed the difficulties and contradictions in Biden’s vow to restore democratic values to American foreign policy. Even as he takes a stand against inviting dictators to a summit on US soil, prompting anger and boycotts from those key regional partners, his aides are simultaneously planning a visit to Saudi Arabia — seen as a necessity at a moment of a global energy crisis, despite the kingdom’s grave human rights record. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday the kingdom is an “important partner,” though Biden once said it must be made a “pariah.”\n\nIn the end, the White House announced Tuesday that 23 heads of state will attend this week’s Summit of the Americas, which administration officials said was in line with past iterations of the triennial confab. One leader who was on the fence, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, will attend and meet Biden for the first time.\n\nYet the absences of the presidents of Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are still notable since the United States has worked to cultivate those leaders as partners on immigration, an issue that looms as a political liability for Biden.\n\nAdministration officials on Monday dismissed concerns about attendance at the summit, saying they did not believe lower-level delegates from certain countries will alter the outcome.\n\n“We really do expect that the participation will not be in any way a barrier to getting significant business done at the summit. In fact, quite the opposite, we are very pleased with how the deliverables are shaping up and with other countries commitment to them,” one senior administration official said, adding the commitments will range from short term to long term.\n\nAnd the White House insisted the President was firm in his view that the autocratic leaders of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua should not be invited to participate — even if it means widening rifts with other countries in the region.\n\n“At the end of the day, to your question, we just don’t believe dictators should be invited. We don’t regret that, and the President will stand by his principle,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\nTroubles have been on the horizon for months\n\nBiden, who arrives in Los Angeles on Wednesday, is expected announce a new partnership with countries in the Western Hemisphere during the gathering as part of a broader effort to stabilize the region, according to the officials.\n\nHe and his administration have been working since last year to organize the summit, which was formally announced last August. The city of Los Angeles was selected as the venue in January. Biden named former Sen. Chris Dodd, his friend and former colleague on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as the special adviser for the event.\n\nDodd traveled in the region to muster support, one of a number of administration envoys to Central and South America that included Vice President Kamala Harris and even first lady Jill Biden. Yet as the summit approached, it became evident an event designed to reassert American leadership in the region was facing serious hurdles.\n\nFor weeks before the summit began, López Obrador hinted that he would boycott unless all leaders from the region were invited – including those from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, each of whom has faced US opposition because of their human rights records. Other, mostly leftist leaders signaled they, too, may not attend if invitations did not go to everyone.\n\nAdministration officials privately cast doubt those leaders would follow through on their threats, suggesting they were instead attempts to play to domestic audiences that are often skeptical of the United States.\n\nDuring an April telephone call between Biden and López Obrador, the subject of the summit arose. In a readout, the White House said the men “looked forward to meeting again at the June Summit of the Americas,” a sign the administration believed then the Mexican president would attend.\n\nOver the past weeks, Dodd spent lengthy virtual sessions lobbying López Obrador to reconsider his threat of a boycott. Members of Congress – including Sen. Bob Menendez, Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee – began to publicly agitate against inviting any leaders from Cuba, Venezuela or Nicaragua. And frustration mounted among administration officials that questions over the invitations and attendees were clouding out the summit’s intended goals.\n\n“The biggest problem is that the focus on attendance takes us away from the focus on substance, but that is the logical thing that happens ahead of a summit. It’s like the sausage-making period. We don’t talk much about the substance because the summit hasn’t started yet, we talk only about who might be there,” said Roberta Jacobson, the former US ambassador to Mexico who also served as an adviser to Biden on southern border policy.\n\nUltimately, the weeks of speculation were put to rest — but not in the way the White House had hoped.\n\n“There cannot be a Summit of the Americas if all countries of the Americas cannot attend,” López Obrador said at a news conference in Mexico City. “This is to continue the old interventionist policies, of lack of respect for nations and their people.”\n\nMexican President’s absence not a part of a larger rift, officials say\n\nMexican officials had conveyed their President’s decision to the White House beforehand, and Biden was made aware before the news became public. Instead of meeting at the summit, Biden and López Obrador will meet in Washington next month.\n\n“The fact that they disagree about this issue is now very clear,” a senior administration official said.\n\nOfficials sought to emphasize the decision to boycott was rooted in a specific disagreement over the invite list and was not indicative of a larger rift.\n\n“What we have done in recent weeks, going back almost a month now, is consulted – consulted with our partners and friends in the region so that we understood the contours of their views,” the senior administration official said. “In the end, the President decided and very much made this point in all of the engagements that we had … which is that we believe the best use of this summit is to bring together countries that share a set of democratic principles.”\n\nBiden is turning his focus to the Americas after a series of foreign policy crises in other parts of the world, including the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He completed his first visit to Asia at the end of last month.\n\nThat region is one where his animating message of “autocracy versus democracy” is playing out in real time, as China works to make inroads and economically challenged nations look for support from abroad.\n\nIn opening remarks Wednesday, Biden will unveil the so-called “Americas partnership” that will focus on five issues, including economic recovery, mobilizing investments, supply chains, clean energy and trade – all with the hopes of strengthening US partnerships in a region many US leaders have been accused of ignoring.\n\nDuring the summit, Biden is also expected to announce more than $300 million in assistance to fight food insecurity, in addition to other private sector commitments, as well as health initiatives and a partnership on climate resilience.\n\nBiden to unveil new initiatives at summit\n\nWhile at the summit, the President and his team will be unveiling a series of new initiatives.\n\nHarris, who arrived in Los Angeles earlier in the week, on Tuesday announced two updates to her work in addressing the root causes of migration to the southern border. First, she announced that through her “Call to Action,” which aimed to promoting economic opportunity, she has now secured more than $3.2 billion in private investment for the region.\n\nCNN previously reported the new commitments come from 10 companies totaling more than $1.9 billion, including the Gap Inc. which has pledged $150 million by 2025 to increase their sourcing from Central America, according to a fact sheet from the White House. Other companies include Millicom, Yazaki, Unifi, San Mar, Pantaleon and Fundación Terra.\n\nHarris also said she will be launching “In Her Hands,” a new private sector program aimed at empowering, training and protecting men in the northern Central America region and across the Western Hemisphere.\n\nAnd on Wednesday the Biden administration will unveil an “Action Plan on Health and Resilience in the Americas,” which is aimed at helping partner nations “prevent, prepare for, and respond to future pandemic threats and other public health emergencies while also expanding the equitable delivery of healthcare and public health services to remote, vulnerable, and marginalized populations,” a senior administration official said. The senior administration official said the plan is expected to be fully implemented by 2030.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra is expected to announce the initiative at the CEO Summit Plenary Session as well..\n\nAs part of Wednesday’s announcement, the administration is slated to announce roughly $100 million in funding, in concert with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), to provide basic and specialized training for 500,000 public health, health science and medical professionals through the next five years through the newly launched Americas Health Corps, or Fuerza de Salud de las Americas.\n\nCaravan highlights need to work fast on migration\n\nAs the summit was getting underway, the imperative to make progress on immigration was being starkly illustrated in southern Mexico. A new migrant caravan there set out on foot Monday, timed to bring attention to the issue as leaders were gathering in Los Angeles.\n\nAn official with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said a group of about 2,300 people left the southern Mexican city of Tapachula on Monday heading north. The official said the group is comprised mostly of Venezuelans, but also includes migrants from Nicaragua, Cuba, El Salvador and Honduras.\n\nA regional immigration group, Colectivo de Observación y Monitoreo de Derechos Humanos en el SE Mexicano, said in a bulletin that the group included principally families and children “who demand access to migration procedures and dignified treatment by the authorities.” Tapachula, located just across the border from Guatemala, is a popular way station for migrants traveling from Central America.\n\nUnder Mexican immigration laws, migrants and asylum-seekers are often made to wait in the area for several months with limited opportunities for work. Northward caravans of migrants have left Tapachula regularly in the past year, although this week’s appears to be one of the largest. This caravan gathered partially in protest to immigration policies and it would be weeks before they arrived to the US southern border, assuming they all do.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Biden and other leaders are expected to agree to a new migration document, dubbed the Los Angeles Declaration, during their Friday meetings. It’s meant to spell out how countries in the region and around the world should share responsibility for taking in migrants.\n\nOfficials said they were confident Mexico would sign on.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/23/politics/congress-legislation-january-6-capitol-attack/index.html", "title": "Congress passes first legislative response to January 6 Capitol ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nCongress has passed a measure aimed at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election, a major moment that marks the first legislative response to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and then-President Donald Trump’s relentless pressure campaign to stay in power despite his 2020 loss.\n\nThe legislation, which would overhaul the 1887 Electoral Count Act, was included as part of a massive $1.7 trillion government funding bill that the Senate passed on Thursday and the House passed on Friday. It will now go to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.\n\nThe measure to overhaul the Electoral Count Act would clarify that the vice president’s role in overseeing the electoral result certification in Congress is strictly ceremonial. It would raise the threshold to make it harder for lawmakers to force votes attempting to overturn a state’s certified result. Additionally, it includes provisions that would prevent efforts to pass along fake electors to Congress.\n\nThe bill is the result of intense bipartisan negotiations that won over the support of top Republicans, including Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell. But a number of House Republicans have pushed back on efforts to overhaul the election law. So with Republicans set to soon take control of the House, lawmakers pressed to send the bill to Biden’s desk, knowing it was likely to be doomed in the next Congress.\n\nSens. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, and Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, announced on Tuesday that the bill had been included as part of the broader government funding package.\n\n“We are pleased that our legislation has been included in the omnibus appropriations bill and are grateful to have the support of so many of our colleagues. We look forward to seeing this bill signed into law,” the senators said in a joint statement.\n\nThe Electoral Count Act is an 1887 law that Trump has sought to exploit and create confusion over how Congress counts Electoral College votes from each state in a presidential election. Constitutional experts say the vice president currently can’t disregard a state-certified electoral result, but Trump pushed then-Vice President Mike Pence to obstruct the Electoral College certification in Congress as part of his pressure campaign. Pence refused to do so and, as a result, became a target of the former president and his mob of supporters who stormed the Capitol on January 6.\n\nThe new legislation seeks to make clear that the vice president only has a ceremonial role in overseeing the certification of the electoral results – and does not have the power to unilaterally accept, reject or settle disputes over electors.\n\nIt would also make it more difficult for members of Congress to attempt to overturn an election by increasing the threshold for the number of House and Senate members required to raise an objection to election results when a joint session of Congress meets to certify them.\n\nThe legislation “raises the threshold to lodge an objection to electors to at least one-fifth of the duly chosen and sworn members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate,” according to a fact sheet. Under current law, just one senator can join one House member in forcing each side to vote on whether to throw out results subject to an objection.\n\nThe bill also includes changes intended to prevent efforts to install fake electors. For example, each state’s governor would be responsible for submission of a certificate that identifies electors – and Congress would not be able to accept a slate of electors submitted by any other official. “This reform would address the potential for multiple state officials to send Congress competing slates,” the fact sheet states.", "authors": ["Clare Foran"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/success/layoffs-advance-notice-severance-packages-ctrp/index.html", "title": "Getting laid off? Know your rights | CNN Business", "text": "The abrupt and unceremonious way that thousands of Twitter employees got laid off last week was a spectacle.\n\nBut it was also a helpful reminder that while employers can get rid of many workers at will (and with zero graciousness), employees are not without rights when they are laid off en masse.\n\nHere’s a quick primer on what employees need to know.\n\nHow much advance notice should I get?\n\nFor a plant closing or a mass layoff, you should get at least 60 days notice, under the federal Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. Some states may require more notice – New York, for instance, requires 90 days. And states also may set stricter standards than the federal law, such as requiring employers with fewer workers to comply with the WARN Act.\n\nIf an employer is found to have violated the WARN Act, in addition to paying penalties to the state, it will be required to pay out up to 60 days (or more, depending on the state requirement) of back wages and benefits to those laid off, depending on how many days’ notice the company actually gave.\n\n“Notice” in this instance means notifying the community at large but also each individual who will be laid off, said employment attorney Michael DuPont, who is managing shareholder at the Minnesota-based law firm Wagner, Falconer & Judd and also provides legal services through LegalShield.\n\nIf a company lays you off abruptly, it may be found to have complied with the WARN Act so long as the effective date of your layoff is at least 60 days after the day you got notice that you’re being let go, said employment attorney Alex Granovsky, cofounder of the New York-based law firm Granovsky & Sundaresh.\n\nTechnically you will remain on the company’s payroll and will continue to receive pay and benefits in the interim, and then any severance you’re given would kick in.\n\nHow much severance am I entitled to?\n\nUn-fun fact: No law – federal or state – requires employers to offer you any severance when they lay you off, unless you have a union or individual employment contract that includes a provision for it.\n\nThat said, many employers do offer some form of severance to protect themselves from any potential legal claims you might bring as a result of your employment or termination.\n\nA second reason many offer severance: “Good will and fairness to the employees and to the community as a whole. To offer additional compensation in recognition of the potentially tough time the employee and community would [experience],” DuPont said.\n\nWhat do I give up in exchange for accepting severance?\n\nAn employer will want you to waive certain rights in exchange for money.\n\nPut bluntly, “the company covers itself in every way a former employee can hurt [it],” Granovsky said.\n\nGenerally speaking you will waive your right to bring a claim against the company, such as discrimination, hostile work environment, pay violations or any other alleged wrongdoing.\n\nYou also typically will need to agree to several clauses that prohibit you from harming the company, he said. They include:\n\nA confidentiality clause: This clause prohibits you from sharing details of the company’s business or even the terms of your severance agreement.\n\nA non-disparagement clause: This prohibits you from badmouthing the place.\n\nA cooperation clause: You agree to assist the company if it gets sued in the future over a matter that you know something about as a result of your tenure there.\n\nA non-cooperation clause: This prohibits you from helping anyone else trying to sue the company.\n\nA non-solicitation clause: This typically means you can’t poach your soon-to-be former employer’s clients or employees should you start working elsewhere or launch your own business.\n\nWaiving these types of rights does not, however, excuse the employer from having to pay you what is already owed, such as a pension or earned vacation or sick leave. “The consideration offered for the waiver of the right to sue … must be something of value in addition to any of the employee’s existing entitlements,” the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) notes.\n\nCan I negotiate the terms of the severance?\n\nIf you think you have legitimate claims against the company, your employer would almost certainly rather you not sue, so it will likely be more open to negotiating the terms of your severance instead.\n\n“A company would rather pay $100 now to avoid having to pay $150 later,” DuPont said.\n\nIf you don’t have a strong case that could justify filing a lawsuit, which you could use as a bargaining chip, you can still try to make the case for why your employer might sweeten your severance package.\n\n“Asking is fine. You should ask. There’s no harm in asking,” Granovsky said.\n\nYou might ask for more months of paid health benefits if you or a family member on your insurance plan is battling cancer, DuPont noted as an example. Or if you’re a long-term employee in good standing or you have a special skill set that the employer might want to tap in the future, you might make a compelling case for why the company should offer you some additional pay.\n\nShould I hire a lawyer?\n\nSince a severance agreement is an important legal document that will affect your immediate future, it can be helpful to have an employment lawyer with experience in severance cases review the company’s offer.\n\nIf hiring a lawyer directly is too expensive, you might consider a less expensive service like LegalShield, which only charges about $30 a month to gain access to an employment attorney in your state who can review your offer, make sure it complies with the law and make a call on your behalf to your employer if you’re seeking modifications to the agreement.\n\nIf your case is complicated and involves further legal action, or if your severance agreement is more than 15 pages long, your costs will be higher, but you will get a discount on the hourly fees of the lawyer on your case.\n\nOr, if you just have some very simple questions, some employment lawyers might offer a free consultation by phone.\n\nHow long will I have to decide whether to accept a severance package?\n\nUnder federal laws, if you’re 40 or older, you must be given at least 45 days in a group termination (21 days if your layoff is not part of a mass layoff) to decide whether to sign your severance agreement.\n\nIn either case, if you accept the offer you also must be given a 7-day period afterward to change your mind.\n\nThat said, each state may have its own requirements above the federal minimum requirements, DuPont said. So check your state’s Department of Labor site to see what its specific requirements are.\n\nWill I lose my severance if I start earning income again?\n\nMany employers may stop your severance payments if the company rehires you for a new position.\n\nIf you find a job elsewhere or start freelancing for others, some employers may choose to reduce your severance payments if your new source of income is less than what you used to be paid.\n\n“They may say, ‘If you make less money we’ll only pay the delta,’” Granovsky said.\n\nIn either case, your severance agreement should state explicitly what the employer’s policy is. So don’t sign it until you’re clear about those terms.\n\nBut if the agreement is silent on the issue then you likely may continue to receive your full severance while also earning income from another source. “So that’s a win for the employee,” DuPont said.", "authors": ["Jeanne Sahadi"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/19/joe-biden-gay-friendly-president-lgbtq-issues/70233287007/", "title": "Joe Biden helped a movement when he changed his mind on ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Joe Biden wasn’t prepared to answer a question about gay rights when he walked into a meeting of the North Star Civic Association that Monday evening in Delaware.\n\nThe state’s junior U.S. senator, Biden was just a few months into the job. He’d been invited to speak to a small group of constituents and listen to whatever was on their mind. But Biden was startled when Robert Vane, a gay rights activist, demanded to know where he stood on employment and military regulations that were discriminatory against gay Americans.\n\n“My gut reaction is that they (homosexuals) are security risks,” Biden responded, according to an account published in The Morning News, a Delaware newspaper.\n\nFive decades pass. On the White House South Lawn, hundreds of gay men and women gather with their family and friends on a sweltering June afternoon. Some proudly wave rainbow flags. Others hoist small children on their shoulders to get a better view. All are there for a celebration, reportedly the largest gay Pride event ever held at the White House.\n\nTheir host: Joe Biden, president of the United States.\n\n“You’re some of the bravest and most inspiring people I’ve ever known,” Biden says, his speech interrupted repeatedly by raucous cheers and thundering applause. “You set an example for the nation and, quite frankly, for the world.”\n\nTaken together, those two events – in 1973 and 2023, two generations apart – can be seen as bookends to Biden’s remarkable evolution on LGBTQ rights. Over the course of his career, Biden’s views on gays and lesbians have advanced along with the forward march of the gay rights movement.\n\nIn politics, leaders who are decisive and unwavering are frequently lauded as strong and effective while those who change their minds are branded as “flip floppers,” a reproach that can derail and possibly even end a career. That can be especially true amid the partisanship of the current political climate, the most polarizing period of American history since the Civil War.\n\nBut with the passage of time often comes a deeper understanding of those issues and of the leaders whose positions on them shifted.\n\nSo it is that Biden, who once suggested gay men and women might jeopardize national security and who as a senator took positions that often mystified and infuriated LGBTQ advocates, is now regarded as the most LGBTQ-friendly president in U.S. history\n\nHow he got there during his 50-year career can be traced in part to overall shifts in public opinion that have led to greater acceptance of gays and lesbians. But that’s not the complete story.\n\nIf Biden’s interest in LGBTQ issues seems deeply personal, it’s because his views have been molded in part by his personal interactions with LGBTQ Americans. They have counseled him on policy, connected him to personal stories and now become a part of his public image. In part because of their influence, Biden has not only changed with the times, but also shown a willingness to get ahead of others in his party on issues like same-sex marriage.\n\n“I’ve literally seen the tears in his eyes as we talk about violence against transgender people,” said Sarah McBride, a longtime friend of Biden and his family and someone whose advice Biden has sought on LGBTQ issues, particularly transgender rights.\n\n'Dignity and respect':How Joe Biden became the most LGBTQ-friendly president in U.S. history\n\n'You know, senator. I'm gay.'\n\nMcBride, a transgender state senator from Delaware, was just 10 or 11 when she first met Biden in a pizza parlor in Delaware, where she grew up.\n\nHer parents were sitting at a table next to him and the future first lady, Jill Biden. They interrupted the Bidens’ dinner and told them how much their child looked up to him. Biden ripped a page out of his briefing book and signed it. McBride would cherish that inscription for years.\n\nHer relationship with the Biden family deepened when she worked for their oldest son, Beau Biden, on his attorney general campaigns and after she came out as transgender while the student body president at the University of Delaware. Beau Biden’s death in 2015 brought her even closer to the Biden family.\n\nIn his memoir “Promise Me, Dad,” published just two years after his son's death, Joe Biden wrote that it took a long time for many Americans to understand what he called “the simple and obvious truth” about gay men and women: That they are “overwhelmingly good, decent, honorable people who want and deserve the same rights as anyone else.”\n\nBiden concedes he didn’t fully grasp the difficulty they face until one night in the 1990s. He was a senator at the time and was on a train back to Wilmington, Delaware, after a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gays in the military. One of the men servicing the snack bar on the Amtrak train, whom he had known for years, had been watching the proceedings and was demoralized by the talk he’d heard from the anti-gay crowd.\n\n“You know, senator,” he said. “I’m gay.”\n\n“No, I didn’t know that,” Biden responded.\n\nThe man, who Biden did not identify by name, said that not only was he gay, but that one of his two sons was also. “You know what gets me about these guys?” the man said of the anti-gay rhetoric. “They think this is a behavior. They think we woke up one morning and said, ‘…Wouldn’t it be great to be gay? … This will make life easier. … I think I’ll be gay.”’\n\nA decade later, when he was vice president, Biden made a stunning declaration in a television interview when he announced his support for same-sex marriage. Biden’s revelation created a stir in political circles because he had gotten ahead of his boss, President Barack Obama, who followed days later with his own public endorsement of same-sex nuptials.\n\nBut Biden had foreshadowed the announcement just a few weeks earlier during a reception at the home of Michael Lombardo, an HBO executive, and Sonny Ward, an architect, in Los Angeles. Pressed on why the Obama administration had not come out in favor of same-sex marriage, Biden pointed to the couple’s two children and said no one could question whether they were cared for, loved and nurtured.\n\n“Things are changing so rapidly, it’s going to become a political liability in the near term for someone to say, ‘I oppose gay marriage,’” he predicted. “Mark my words. And my job – our job – is to keep this momentum rolling to the inevitable.”\n\nBiden’s endorsement of same-sex unions is now regarded as a watershed moment in the push for marriage equality. Last December, before a celebratory crowd of thousands bundled up for a chilly ceremony on the White House South Lawn, Biden went even further and signed legislation that codified protections for same-sex and interracial marriage into federal law.\n\nIt was another sign of the extraordinary progress made in the long fight for equality – and of how far Biden himself had come on the issue. As a senator, he had supported the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman.\n\n'Extreme' and 'hateful' bills:Biden moves to protect LGBTQ Americans amid onslaught of attacks\n\nWho advises Biden on LGBTQ issues?\n\nMcBride was speaking last fall at an event on the health worker shortage in Delaware when she suddenly noticed she’d missed two calls from a familiar number. A few minutes later, she got a text message from the White House.\n\n“The president is trying to reach you,” it said.\n\nMcBride quickly returned the call. The president wanted to pick her brain about the fight over transgender rights, Beau Biden’s work on the issue and the steps his own administration was taking to provide protections for a vulnerable community under attack.\n\nMcBride reminded Biden that members of the trans community take great comfort in seeing the leader of the free world fight to protect their rights. It's important, she said, \"for people who are feeling isolated and scared right now to see and know their president loves them and has their back.\"\n\nSince he walked into the Oval Office as president on Jan. 20, 2021, Biden’s administration has taken a number of actions that support the gay community, including signing executive orders to advance LGBTQ equality and protect transgender Americans from the recent onslaught of legislative attacks in Republican-led states.\n\n“This is a core conviction for Joe Biden – a core conviction of his spanning decades – that the promise of America is to respect the human dignity of every single American, and that includes every single LGBTQ+ American,” said Neera Tanden, the White House’s chief domestic policy adviser.\n\nAt the White House, a team of advisers, gay and straight, works behind the scenes to take Biden’s vision of equality and mold it into policies that will directly impact the lives of millions of LGBTQ Americans.\n\nAs president, Biden has surrounded himself with LGBTQ people. Some 14% of the roughly 1,500 people he has appointed to various positions in his administration identify as LGBTQ individuals. But a smaller group of aides has a direct role in crafting policies and the legislation on LGBTQ issues.\n\nIssues of equity – whether they involve LGBTQ rights or other matters like racial justice and disability policy – flow through the Domestic Policy Council, which is staffed by individuals with expertise in a broad range of areas. Across the federal government are individuals whose portfolio also includes LGBTQ issues.\n\nThose who play a significant role in crafting policies on LGBTQ issues include key advisers like Tanden, who leads the Domestic Policy Council, and Steve Ricchetti, who has been a top Biden aide for more than a decade and currently serves as counselor to the president. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay cabinet secretary confirmed by the Senate, is seen as an important voice on LGBTQ issues.\n\nOthers who may not be as well known to the public but who are regarded as trusted advisers on LGBTQ matters include Gautam Raghavan, director of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel; White House counsel Stuart Delery; and Emmy Ruiz, director of the White House Office of Political Strategy and Outreach.\n\nWhite House communications director Ben LaBolt helps find compelling narratives to inform the public what the administration is doing to advance the LGBTQ cause. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre often speaks out from the briefing room podium about the administration’s efforts to promote equality and protect LGBTQ Americans under attack.\n\n'Close to sinful':President Biden leads charge to protect LGBTQ rights as GOP legislates culture wars ahead of 2024\n\nBiden and his administration also seek advice from Americans who have no formal role in the administration but whose counsel is considered invaluable, such as Tim Gill, a prominent entrepreneur and philanthropist who was among the first openly gay people to be included on the Forbes 400 list of America's richest people. The Gill Foundation, Gill’s Denver-based non-profit, partnered with the White House to put on the Pride event in June. His husband, Scott Miller, is the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland and Lichtenstein.\n\nAnd then there’s McBride, who has no direct role in shaping administration policy but who Biden often turns to for advice.\n\nBiden has described transgender discrimination as “the civil rights issue of our time.”\n\nTo that end, McBride, now a candidate for Delaware’s lone seat in the U.S. House, said he is well versed on trans rights and, during her conversations with him, often asks detailed questions.\n\nAt times, she said, their conversations will involve in-depth discussions that cover the ins and outs of non-discrimination protections. Other times, Biden will just share his passion for the issue, she said.\n\nBiden will sometimes stun McBride by reciting from memory the most up-to-date statistics on trans violence – “information that I’m not even as versed on,” she said. There have been times when he didn’t know that they were going to interact, she said, “yet he had that information top of mind.”\n\nWhite House aides recount similar stories in which Biden has demonstrated how deeply he is invested in LGBTQ issues. He listens closely, they say, and almost always asks follow-up questions. Sometimes, his queries are so detailed that his staff is caught off guard and not immediately prepared to answer.\n\nRaghavan, who served as White House liaison to the LGBTQ community under Obama and later worked as a consultant to the Biden Foundation, recalled Biden meeting last year in the White House Roosevelt Room with the Congressional Equality Caucus, a group of lawmakers who pledge to advance LGBTQ rights. During the meeting, Biden highlighted the 14% of his administration that identifies as LGBTQ.\n\n“But the thing he focused on was not the number,” Raghavan said. Biden emphasized instead that these are people who feel comfortable in coming out and that the White House is an environment in which they knew they would be protected.\n\n“It never occurred to me before that that would be something to celebrate, too,” Raghavan said. “But I think it’s a really important point.”\n\n'An out gay woman':Karine Jean-Pierre hopes to empower LGBTQ youth as White House press secretary\n\n'Freeing the soul of America'\n\nWhen McBride was completing her first book chronicling her journey as a transgender woman, her editors had an idea. “What do you think about asking Vice President Biden to write the forward?” they asked.\n\nMcBride approached Biden with the idea, and he agreed. Her story was powerful, he wrote in the book’s forward, because “it’s not just a singular issue of identity, it’s about freeing the soul of America from the constraints of bigotry, hate, and fear, and opening people’s hearts and minds to what binds us all together.”\n\nBiden’s words meant a lot, McBride said, not only to her, but to other transgender individuals because it signaled growing support within the Democratic Party for trans people and their rights.\n\nIt was also a reminder of how Biden’s evolution on issues of equality had been heavily influenced by many of the people in his orbit.\n\n“The president’s legacy on these issues is the byproduct of a lot of amazing work by a lot of people,” McBride said. “And I'm honored to be part of that journey.”\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

But they don't deserve to get rich in a neighborhood that's been largely abandoned.\"\n\nDuggan on Friday submitted proposals to Council to proceed with 104 acres of the solar field buildout in the first three neighborhoods, kicking off the process of acquiring land, community benefits to the surrounding residents and installing the solar fields. By early 2025, the administration will recommend three more neighborhoods of the initial eight finalists Duggan narrowed down last year, and build out 200 acres to power 33 megawatts of energy.\n\nHow neighbors of the solar fields will be helped\n\nSurrounding the solar neighborhoods are 159 owner-occupied homes. Those homeowners will receive various home improvements ranging from $15,000 to $25,000 of work, including: windows, roof repairs, residential solar panels, energy-efficient appliances, home insulation and air sealing, energy-efficient furnaces and water heaters, smart thermostats, energy-efficient lighting or battery backup.\n\nOne of those residents is Patricia Kobylski, of the Gratiot/Findlay neighborhood, who will seek energy-efficient siding for her home to help reduce her heating bill.\n\n\"I've painted that house twice myself, but I'm 78 years old. I can't paint it anymore, so this energy-efficient vinyl siding, I just have to hose it off. I don't need a new furnace, I don't need a hot water heater, the windows are in good shape,\" Kobylski said. \"I don't want to sell. I have a great house and I have good neighbors. There's no reason for me to sell, and who's going to give a nearly 80-year-old lady a 30-year mortgage? Nobody. And I don't want to move out to the suburbs. This is where I'm supposed to be.\"\n\nJean Holt, who raised her family and lived in the State Fair neighborhood for 53 years, remembers a thriving neighborhood full of shopping, families and children, and an area full of opportunities. But it has deteriorated over time, she said.\n\n\"There was nothing left that was viable for the neighborhood. Everything was burned, falling down, overgrown, people left their trash everywhere. It had become a dumping ground,\" Holt said. \"People began to move out. Young people, as they grew up, they left the city, not just the neighborhood, the city, so that made less occupancy in those areas.\"\n\nHolt added that she was more than willing to move and that solar fields will benefit Detroiters.\n\n\"We need more energy. We need more power. Mine went out when my kids were like 2 months old, I think, and I didn't like being cold. Not at all. That's a horrible feeling. So I think this would be, with all the electronics and energy burning going on, this will be an opportunity I think for them and generations to come as well as for those that are in the neighborhoods now that want to remain in those areas,\" Holt said.\n\nTwo developers selected\n\nThe city will maintain ownership of the land and lease it to the developers. Detroit selected Boston-based Lightstar to build 63 acres of solar fields in the Gratiot-Findlay and State Fair neighborhoods for the first phase. DTE Electric Company will build the 40-acre field in Van Dyke-Lynch. Duggan said he wanted developers who have experience building solar fields.\n\nInstallations will beautify the city's neighborhoods and the surrounding community benefits with energy-efficient upgrades will help reduce energy bills by 10%-20%, said Councilman Coleman Young II.\n\n\"This is a good thing, because the greatest thing that people can do with their life is something that will outlast us. And what we build today and the environmental impact this will have, the education and the jobs that this will have, the energy savings that the people will save long-term is a legacy that will outlast all of our lives,\" Young said.\n\nProject funding\n\nDuggan plans to use $14 million from the city's utility conversion fund, which is legally required to be used on energy conversion. The fund dates to when the city operated its own power system, and the $14 million will be used for upfront costs of acquiring and clearing the land.\n\nThe mayor also praised President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act for allowing the city to undertake a project he could not previously financially justify.\n\n\"When President Biden passed that bill in 2022, this made it possible. Before that, you could not have financially afforded to do this. But what the president and the country have done is there is now 30% off of all of these costs,\" Duggan said.\n\nNet operating costs are expected to reach $1.1 million per year. The city currently spends nearly $2.4 million annually on the three neighborhoods to address illegal dumping and trash pickup, mowing and maintenance of overgrown lots and abandoned houses, police and fire runs, and street maintenance, building inspections and enforcements, and stormwater backups.\n\n\"One of the things I thought about coming over here were my kids,\" said Councilman Fred Durhal. \"To invest in an environment where they can have safe air to breathe, clean water to drink, is priceless. It's absolutely priceless ... at one time, we were spending money and we were polluting the environment. Now we're utilizing funds to help clean the environment for generations to come.\"\n\nSecond phase and future green sites\n\nAs the five remaining neighborhoods await the next phase's selection process, at least 28 homeowners of the 31 owner-occupied homes signed letters of intent to sell their homes, Duggan said. The city would dip into the utility conversion fund to pay them to sell their homes before being chosen, but they are not required to sell if homeowners are not interested.\n\n\"We're going to go to them in 30 or 60 days and say, 'If you want to go ahead and sell anyway, we'll buy it now whether we pick your zone or not.' And if they want to do it, fine, if they don't want to do it, fine,\" Duggan said.\n\nThe city is proposing a $4.4 million equity fund, using reserves from the utility conversion fund, to pay for it.\n\nUnder the project agreement, solar fields will operate and generate power for 35 years. Once they no longer operate, the contracts require developers to remove all equipment and return the property as a green field.\n\n\"We have the best of all worlds with this agreement,\" said Tepfirah Rushdan, director of sustainability.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe administration is required to submit several items to City Council for approval. These include a resolution to acquire private property in each of the neighborhoods, contracts with the developers, and a resolution to create an equity fund for voluntary purchases of owner-occupied homes in the five remaining neighborhood finalist areas.\n\nDana Afana is the Detroit city hall reporter for the Free Press.

Trying is the key word.\n\nBy day, she’s an associate vice provost at Miami Dade College, where she spends much of her time fretting about financial aid for the school’s tens of thousands of enrolled students. By night, she's a mom trying to use that same expertise to shepherd her son through the college application process.\n\nWhile applying for financial aid is rarely a stress-free endeavor, this year has been especially tricky for her, both personally and professionally. That’s because the Education Department upended college application season when it made long-awaited improvements in December to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. The form, used by millions of American families and thousands of colleges each year, is one of the linchpins holding the higher education system together.\n\nThe rollout of those changes, however, has been filled with delays and unforeseen problems. The latest hiccup occurred this week when the Biden administration said colleges and state agencies wouldn’t start receiving students’ FAFSA information until the “first half of March” at the earliest. Federal officials had initially told schools they could expect to receive that data by late January.\n\nIn a normal year, schools would have had that data on hand months earlier.\n\nRead more:Colleges will have to wait longer for FAFSA data, in latest frustration with rollout\n\nThe announcement came after the department admitted it made a major error in the new form by not accurately adjusting families’ incomes for inflation. Officials promised to fix the oversight. But the glitch caused the timeline to be thrown out of whack – again. Now, it’s possible students won’t start getting financial aid offers from colleges until April, just before the May 1 commitment deadline that is common among many schools.\n\nIn other words, millions of students may soon be forced to make one of the most important decisions of their lives in a matter of weeks.\n\n“We’re going to have to adjust,” Amaya told USA TODAY. There's little choice for the students she works with, she said. “It is what it is.”\n\nThe fiasco raises new questions about the trade-off the Biden administration is making to overhaul the financial aid system for college students before the end of the president's first term. The Education Department made big promises about how many more students – 610,000, officials say – will be eligible for financial aid because of their efforts.\n\nYet exactly how many of the same vulnerable students could be deterred from going to college, or remaining there, as a result of the bungled rollout remains to be seen.\n\n“Time will tell whether it was worth it,” Amaya said.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Education Department spokesperson Johanny Adames said the administration is working tirelessly to open the door to college for more students.\n\n“These are the most significant changes to the financial aid system in over 40 years,” Adames said. “And we’ve done all of this with flat funding from Congress and no budget in sight four months into the fiscal year.”\n\nMarch delay is ‘quite a curveball’\n\nColleges are now facing widespread calls to push back the traditional May 1 cutoff.\n\nSome have already obliged. Oregon State University, for instance, said this week it would postpone its advanced tuition deposit deadline for freshmen by a month. The school said in a statement the original May deadline would “impose impossible constraints on parents and students.”\n\nUSA TODAY reached out by email and phone to 50 of the colleges and universities in the U.S. with some of the largest enrollment numbers. Some said they have been reassessing whether the May deadline is still feasible. Others are in more of a wait-and-see mode, or already have their own unique cutoff dates.\n\n“This year has been beyond frustrating,” said Rachelle Feldman, the vice provost of enrollment at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. “March is quite the curveball.”\n\nFeldman said she and other college administrators have been warning the Education Department for months about the inflation problems with the new income formula. But instead of communicating with schools sooner, the agency corrected the error at the eleventh hour.\n\nWhen will FAFSA be processed?As ED fixes formula mistake, applicants may see more delays\n\nEven with the fix, the form still isn’t perfect. Parents who don't have social security numbers have no way of submitting it, an error that disproportionately impacts immigrant families. Angie Jaral, a 19-year-old freshman at National Louis University in Chicago, still hasn’t submitted her form because her stepdad doesn't have one.\n\n“It’s really frustrating,” she told USA TODAY. “I need to figure this out.”\n\nThe Education Department says it’s working on that glitch, but it hasn't articulated when the problem will be corrected.\n\n“It’s just going to be a really challenging time for everybody,” said Jose Aviles, the vice provost for enrollment management at Temple University, a private school in Philadelphia.\n\nOn Thursday, Temple announced a generous new financial aid program that promises to cover tuition and fees for freshmen students who live in Philadelphia County and whose families make $65,000 a year or less. Aviles said the news will likely be a comfort to Temple applicants who’ve had any trouble filling out the FAFSA. If they meet those standards, he said, they'll already have a good idea of what their financial aid offer will look like.\n\nNot every college can afford to give families that same peace of mind, though. Ultimately, smaller colleges with fewer resources may bear the brunt of the ongoing delays, said Jon Boeckenstedt, the vice provost for enrollment management at Oregon State.\n\n“We’re big,” he said of his university. “We can throw a lot of horsepower at this problem.”\n\nOther schools, he said, aren’t so lucky.\n\nFederal watchdog launches audit of FAFSA rollout\n\nThe stakes of the FAFSA controversy were raised higher still on Thursday when a federal government watchdog said it would grant a request by congressional Republicans to audit the delays. Charles Young, a spokesperson for the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, confirmed in an email that the agency is looking into the matter.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a frequent critic of President Joe Biden’s education policies, was one of the lawmakers who requested the GAO audit. At a press conference Thursday afternoon, Cassidy said the messy rollout could push some students away from college for good.\n\n“Many students may forgo college because they don’t know they can afford it,” he said. “That is the issue here.”\n\nAdames, the Education Department spokesperson, told USA TODAY the Biden administration has repeatedly requested more financial aid funding from congressional Republicans – “to no avail.”\n\n“Despite their criticism and opposition,” Adames said, “we are making college more accessible.”\n\nZachary Schermele is a breaking news and education reporter for USA TODAY.

They spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the matter.\n\nRoss declined the offer because he wants to keep the assets in his family, the two people said. Still, the offer shows the ceiling of NFL franchise valuations and sports conglomerates continues to rise exponentially.\n\nRoss and Garfinkel have successfully infiltrated and elevated F1 thanks to the capital and vision devoted to transforming their stadium campus, where 90,000 people will roam daily Friday through Sunday as reigning F1 champion Max Verstappen aims for his third consecutive Miami win and artists, such as Ed Sheeran and Marc Anthony, will perform.\n\nFans can flaunt status and spread FOMO vibes to their social media followers after spending anywhere from $450 for a campus pass to roam about the grounds (down from $590 last year) to $600-$1,225 for seats to watch the action from the grandstands. Others could spend $4,000 to $12,200 (before resale) in premium luxury areas with high-end food and alcohol for the three-day event.\n\nAll things Dolphins: Latest Miami Dolphins news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nThere is also a \"fair expectation\" South Florida will see more than $1 billion combined economic impact following its third race, according to Jeremy Aguero, principal analyst for economic research firm Applied Analysis, which reported the first two races brought $798 million to the area.\n\nSportsCorp Ltd. founder Marc Ganis, a longtime consultant who has worked closely with NFL teams and other sports franchises, said the Dolphins’ stadium overhaul is \"one of the great sports business success stories of the last decade.\"\n\n\"I put the Dolphins' entire operation, not just the team, in the Top 5 in the NFL,\" Ganis said. \"It’s the transformation of the entire operation to arguably the most successful, diversified, regional sports entertainment operation in the country – and by the way, let me just say – and globally in the world.\"\n\nDolphins' F1 race is 'huge for the sport' in U.S.\n\nRoss has privately invested more than $1 billion into the property since 2008 to host Super Bowls, college football national title games, this summer’s Copa America final and World Cup games in 2026. The massive undertaking in 2022 to transform their parking lot into a world-class racetrack has already paid off for F1’s expansion in the U.S.\n\n\"Miami joining Formula 1 has been huge for the sport in the United States, and the vision and enthusiasm Stephen Ross and Tom Garfinkel have for the event is incredible,\" F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports.\n\n\"The event has quickly established itself as a destination for our fans, as well as the biggest stars from across music, sport, and entertainment. We continue to see our fanbase grow across the country on all our platforms and standout events like the Miami Grand Prix are a huge driver of this.\"\n\nRoss was committed to bringing a race to Miami – even after he tried to acquire F1 before it was sold to Liberty Media in 2016, and faced strong local opposition for a downtown Miami street race. Garfinkel’s background as an executive with Chip Ganassi Racing (2001-06) and Hall of Fame Racing (2007-09) also fueled Miami’s F1 pursuit.\n\nMiami has one of three F1 events in the U.S., along with the United States Grand Prix in Austin, Texas (Oct. 18-20) and the Las Vegas Grand Prix (Nov. 21-23).\n\nDallas Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones praised the Dolphins’ innovation and aggressive pursuit of other revenue streams.\n\n\"They’ve verbalized all they’ve done down there, but I really look forward to seeing it,\" Jones said. \"My hats off to the whole crew there, starting with Stephen Ross, obviously. They’re very innovative in how they go about it. I think they’ve done an amazing job with the way they’ve brought their building along.\"\n\nBaltimore Ravens president Sashi Brown added: “It’s a spectacular vision that really required a great amount of know-how, creativity and courage. It’s not easy to go get one of the premier global events in terms of sports, and bring it to a venue that had not done that before. And to bring it domestically to the U.S. is an outstanding accomplishment.”\n\nMiami curates fan experience, raising the bar in Formula One\n\nMiami’s race slogan is \"where racing meets luxury,\" and living up to the mantra has forced other F1 locations to elevate their fan offerings.\n\nThe 72 Club includes black car service to and from the race, along with all-inclusive food and drinks, while the Hard Rock Beach Club will have Sheeran, Steve Aoki, Don Omar and Kaskade among performers. Other fans can access 75 local bar and restaurant vendors, bucking the trend of traditional stadium food options.\n\nThen, there’s The Trophy House, featured in Haute Living as an invite-only VIP section, where Grammy winners perform private sets for a “singular alchemy of visionaries and influential leaders” dining on Michelin-starred dishes.\n\n\"They’re not just wanting to do another grand prix. They wanted to do their grand prix, which was good for everyone in F1,\" popular former F1 team principal and Netflix star Guenther Steiner, who is serving as Miami GP ambassador this year, said of Ross and Garfinkel.\n\n\"A lot of other race venues see what is actually possible, and they realized if we want to be around in Formula One in five years, we need to get close to this. Miami has the advantage of being the first one to put all this stuff on the map.\"\n\nCould the Dolphins be a Top 5 valued NFL franchise?\n\nAlthough Forbes valued the Dolphins 11th at $5.7 billion last August, and Ross’ sports empire 16th globally at $6.9 billion earlier this year, the recent $10 billion offer could influence a rise on the Forbes list.\n\nCitadel hedge fund founder Ken Griffin, considered the richest person in Florida with a net worth of $35.4 billion, was in negotiations for a minority stake in the Dolphins, Hard Rock Stadium and the F1 race valued at $7.5 billion before talks amicably ceased, two people with knowledge of the situation said.\n\nGriffin did not propose the $10 billion controlling offer, a person close to him told USA TODAY Sports. The person spoke under the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the matter.\n\nIt’s important to note: Investors buying minority shares typically receive a 20-30% “non-control discount” on overall value, Ganis said. Other factors like location, and the scarcity to own one of 32 NFL teams contribute to rises in controlling premiums. Doing the math, the $10 billion controlling offer Ross received is in line with those numbers.\n\nThe Cowboys ($9 billion), New England Patriots ($7 billion), Los Angeles Rams ($6.9 billion), New York Giants ($6.8 billion) and Chicago Bears ($6.3 billion) were the Top 5 valuations in the NFL, according to Forbes.\n\nMarc Anthony, Fergie, Venus and Serena Williams and Bruce Beal, president of real estate firm The Related Companies, are Dolphins minority partners. But Ross, who is also chairman and founder of The Related Companies and has a net worth of $10.1 billion, still seeks investors for minority shares to fund further sports endeavors.

Washington owner Daniel Snyder also was interviewed.\n\n\"Based on Wilkinson's review, the Commissioner concluded that for many years the workplace environment at the Washington Football Team, both generally and particularly for women, was highly unprofessional,\" the league said in a statement Thursday. \"Bullying and intimidation frequently took place and many described the culture as one of fear, and numerous female employees reported having experienced sexual harassment and a general lack of respect in the workplace.\n\n“Ownership and senior management paid little or no attention to these issues. In some instances, senior executives engaged in inappropriate conduct themselves, including use of demeaning language and public embarrassment.”\n\nThe $10 million will be donated to \"organizations committed to character education, anti-bullying, healthy relationships and related topics,\" the NFL said, as well as \"programs directed more broadly at improving the workplace, particularly for women and other underrepresented groups.\"\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nNews of the long-running misconduct and harassment allegations first became public following a lengthy investigation by The Washington Post last summer.\n\nThe reports detailed incidents in which cheerleaders were secretly video taped in various stages of undress, and other female employees were subjected to sexual advancements and lewd comments from team employees.\n\nSnyder claimed ignorance and blamed himself for being too hands off in his leader ship of the team. He initially enlisted the services of Wilkinson to conduct an extensive investigation in July 2020 and then turned the oversight of that investigation over to the NFL.\n\nEarlier this week, Washington announced Snyder had named his wife Tanya Snyder co-CEO. On Thursday, the team and the NFL announced Tanya Snyder would be the face of the organization moving forward.\n\n\"As co-CEO, Tanya Snyder will assume responsibilities for all day-to-day team operations and represent the club at all league meetings and other league activities for at least the next several months,\" the league said in its release.\n\nDaniel Snyder, who said he will now focus on a plan for a new stadium, released a subsequent statement saying that he agreed with the decision of the NFL.\n\n\"I have learned a lot in the past few months about how my club operated, and the kind of workplace that we had. It is now clear that the culture was not what it should be, but I did not realize the extent of the problems, or my role in allowing that culture to develop and continue,\" Snyder said. \"I know that as the owner, I am ultimately responsible for the workplace. I have said that and I say it again.\"\n\nAttorneys Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, who represented 40 former Washington Football Team employees, took issue with both the ruling and process of the investigation, including the decision not to have Wilkinson issue a written report.\n\n\"In response to a year-long investigation in which more than 100 witnesses were interviewed, and which we believe substantiated our clients' allegations of pervasive harassment, misogyny and abuse at the Washington Football Team, the NFL has chosen to protect owner Dan Snyder,\" Banks and Katz said in a statment. Ignoring our requests that it make the report prepared by Beth Wilkinson public, the NFL has chosen instead to receive only an oral report of the findings and to fine owner Dan Snyder what amount to pocket change.\n\n\"This is truly outrageous, and is a slap in the face to hundreds of women and former employees who came forward in good faith and at great personal risk to report a culture of abuse at all levels of the Team, including by Snyder himself.

And if history is any indicator, it won't take long for deals to start flying, as some of the biggest names set to hit the market won't last long before they come to terms with their new team.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports will have updates on all the latest deals and buzz throughout the day, so check back often for up-to-the-minute news from our staff and around the USA TODAY Network on the start of NFL free agency:\n\nVikings set to sign QB Sam Darnold\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings appear to have their contingency plan after losing Kirk Cousins to the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nSam Darnold is set to join the team on a one-year deal worth $10 million, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe move could mark Darnold's possible return to starting status after the former New York Jets and Carolina Panthers quarterback spent last season as a backup for the San Francisco 49ers. With the Vikings potentially in the market for a rookie signal-caller, Darnold could serve as a bridge starter.\n\nJets add backup QB\n\nWoody Johnson got his wish.\n\nThe New York Jets have their backup quarterback to serve as insurance behind Aaron Rodgers, as the team reached a two-year deal worth up to $18 million with veteran signal-caller Tyrod Taylor, according to multiple reports.\n\nJohnson had made clear that his team needed to bring on a stable No. 2 after the Jets' season was undone by poor quarterback play. The team has also given Zach Wilson permission to seek a trade.\n\nTaylor stepped in to start five games for the New York Giants last season, throwing for 1,341 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nPanthers continue to overhaul interior offensive line\n\nMany assumed that the Carolina Panthers' focus this offseason would be at wide receiver as the team tries to boost the supporting cast for No. 1 pick Bryce Young. Instead, the team has made it clear that the interior line needed to be upgraded.\n\nHours after the team reached a five-year, $100 million deal with offensive guard Robert Hunt, the Panthers also came to an agreement on a four-year, $53 million contract with Carolina.\n\nThe moves give some semblance of consistency to a front that used 11 different combinations of starting offensive linemen last season. Young had the second-most sacks of any quarterback (62) last season, and the additions of Hunt and Lewis - along with a potential move to center for Austin Corbett - could help provide a more stable pocket for the signal-caller.\n\nJets add more help for Aaron Rodgers\n\nThe New York Jets are still formulating a full-fledged protection plan for Aaron Rodgers, but the team added a key piece to its front.\n\nFormer Baltimore Ravens offensive guard John Simpson agreed to a two-year deal with the Jets worth $18 million, according to multiple reports.\n\nSimpson, 26, was a fourth-round pick out of Clemson by the Raiders in 2020 but was waived by the team in 2022. He latched on with the Ravens and managed to secure a starting spot last season, helping pave the way for the league's top-ranked rushing attack.\n\nBengals releasing RB Joe Mixon, to sign RB Zack Moss\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals shook up their running back room on the first day of free agency.\n\nOn Monday night, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero and Mike Garafolo reported that the franchise released Pro Bowler Joe Mixon.\n\nThe running back spent seven seasons with the Bengals after they picked him up in the second round of the 2017 NFL draft. He had four 1,000-yard seasons, including last year when he racked up 1,034 yards and nine touchdowns. He was named to the Pro Bowl in 2021 after having a 1,205-yard season with 13 touchdowns.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter added that the Bengals signed Zack Moss to a two-year, $8 million deal. While All-Pro running back Jonathan Taylor sat out the beginning of last year with injury, Moss had two 100-yard games. In a win over the Tennessee Titans, he had 165 rushing yards and two touchdowns.\n\nSeahawks re-sign DL Leonard Williams\n\nAfter surrendering a second-round pick for versatile D-lineman Leonard Williams at last year's trade deadline, the Seattle Seahawks are making him more than a half-season rental.\n\nWilliams, a nine-year veteran comfortable in even and odd fronts who is adept both as a run stuffer and pass rusher, gets a three-year deal worth $64.5 million (per multiple reports) to stay in the Pacific Northwest with new coach Mike Macdonald. Williams played 18 games, split between the Giants and Seahawks, in 2023, finishing with 5½ sacks and 23 pressures.\n\nPatriots add a quarterback\n\nA day after agreeing to trade Mac Jones to the Jacksonville Jaguars, the New England Patriots are backfilling their quarterback room with a familiar face.\n\nJacoby Brissett, who launched his itinerant NFL career in Foxborough in 2016, will return on a one-year, $8 million deal, per NFL Network. He'll join a roster where Bailey Zappe and Nathan Rourke are currently the only other QBs. Of course, New England owns the third overall pick of the 2024 draft, and Jones' departure could be a major signal that new personnel boss Eliot Wolf intends to pick a passer.\n\nIn 48 career starts, Brissett is 18-30, though he didn't start for Washington in 2023. He has 10,574 career passing yards and 51 touchdowns. The Patriots traded him to the Indianapolis Colts before the start of the 2017 season.\n\nSeahawks re-sign TE Noah Fant\n\nAmid what has been an expectedly quiet start to free agency for the Seattle Seahawks, general manager John Schneider and Co. have made their first significant move.\n\nTight end Noah Fant is re-signing with the team on a two-year, $21 million contract, according to multiple reports.\n\nFant, 26, was one of the pieces the Seahawks received in the Russell Wilson trade with the Denver Broncos. He has not reached 500 receiving yards in either of his seasons in Seattle, but he could be in for a more significant role under first-year head coach Mike Macdonald after Will Dissly was cut and Colby Parkinson departed for the Los Angeles Rams in free agency.\n\nTexans poach former Titans LB\n\nLinebacker Azeez Al-Shaair will not be coming back for a second season with the Tennessee Titans but, like one of his former Titans teammates, he isn't going far.\n\nAl-Shaair is expected to sign with the Houston Texans in NFL free agency, per NFL Network and The Athletic. Al-Shaair led the Titans and finished fifth in the NFL with 163 combined tackles in 2023, his first season with the franchise. Al-Shaair came to Nashville after spending his first four professional seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, but Al-Shaair made nearly as many tackles in his first season with the Titans as he did in his previous four combined. In addition to his 163 tackles, Al-Shaair also logged two sacks, nine tackles for loss and four pass breakups.\n\nAl-Shaair is the second Titans defender who's reportedly defected to the division rival Texans on Monday. Defensive lineman Denico Autry has also reportedly agreed to terms with Houston. Al-Shaair played for Texans coach DeMeco Ryans when Ryans was the defensive coordinator in San Francisco.\n\n- Nick Suss, The Tennessean\n\nMichael Onwenu re-ups with Patriots\n\nThe New England Patriots are keeping one of their offensive staples in place.\n\nOffensive lineman Michael Onwenu is re-signing with the team on a three-year, $57 million contract, according to NFL Network.\n\nOnwenu has proven to be a versatile and reliable piece along the Patriots' front, seeing time both at guard and offensive tackle. At 26, he was expected to be one of the most highly sought-after blockers in free agency.\n\nAustin Ekeler finds landing spot with Commanders\n\nLast offseason, Austin Ekeler organized a Zoom meeting among the NFL’s best running backs to discuss their sunken market in recent years.\n\nSo it was fitting Ekeler signed his new deal on a day several other notable backs found new homes.\n\nThe Washington Commanders and Ekeler agreed to a two-year deal, according to multiple reports. Per NFL Network, it is worth up to $11.43 million.\n\nIn Washington, Ekeler will once again play for his former head coach with the Los Angeles Chargers, Anthony Lynn, who is the team’s running backs coach. He’ll also join a backfield that includes Brian Robinson Jr.\n\nEkeler, 28, has never eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark but scored 25 touchdowns between the 2021 and 2022 regular seasons before injuries, a career-worst 3.5 yards per carry and overall Chargers dysfunction marred the 2023 campaign.\n\nThe Commanders are quickly spending their way through the $96 million in cap space they had entering free agency.\n\nGiants land star pass rusher Brian Burns in trade\n\nOn a day when the New York Giants lost one star player in Saquon Barkley, the team now is set to welcome another.\n\nThe Giants agreed to a trade with the Carolina Panthers for Brian Burns, according to multiple reports. The Panthers will receive second- and fifth-round picks in the deal, per reports. Meanwhile, Burns landed a five-year, $150 million extension as part of the swap. That deal leaves him behind only the San Francisco 49ers' Nick Bosa for the title of highest-paid edge rusher.\n\nBurns, who turns 26 next month, had been seeking a long-term deal but had not received one, instead getting the franchise tag from the Panthers earlier in March.\n\nA two-time Pro Bowl selection, Burns has recorded 46 sacks in five seasons. In New York, he joins a defensive front that includes two-time Pro Bowler Dexter Lawrence and edge rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux, who notched 11½ sacks last season.\n\nLions trade for CB Carlton Davis in deal with Bucs\n\nTo address a problem area at cornerback, the Detroit Lions looked to the trade market rather than free agency or the draft.\n\nThe Lions are acquiring Carlton Davis from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, according to multiple reports. The Buccaneers will receive the Lions' 2024 third-round pick while the Lions will also get two sixth-round picks as part of the deal.\n\nDavis, 27, has been a staple of the Buccaneers' defense since he was selected in the second round out of Auburn in the 2018 NFL draft. He is in the final year of his contract and due a base salary of $14 million.\n\nThe move serves as the first major personnel loss for the Buccaneers after the team re-signed Baker Mayfield and Mike Evans and franchise-tagged Antoine Winfield Jr.\n\nGardner Minshew on the move\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders have added another quarterback to the mix, agreeing to a two-year, $25 million deal, per multiple reports, with Pro Bowler Gardner Minshew II.\n\nMinshew went 7-6 in 13 starts last season for the Indianapolis Colts, passing for 3,305 yards and 15 TDs in an offense that skewed run-heavy.\n\nAt the moment, it appears he'll compete with Aidan O'Connell and Jimmy Garoppolo in Sin City, though it appears the latter is likely on his way out of town. The Silver and Black are also currently slotted 13th in the draft and could target a younger, longer-term passer.\n\nGeno Stone joins Ravens' AFC North rival\n\nGeno Stone's breakout season has led him to one of the Baltimore Ravens' rivals.\n\nThe safety agreed to a two-year, $15 million contract with the Cincinnati Bengals, according to multiple reports.\n\nA seventh-round pick in 2020, Stone seized on his opportunity this season by recording seven interceptions.\n\nEx-Ravens RB Gus Edwards teams up with Jim Harbaugh\n\nThe “Gus Bus” route evidently runs from Harbaugh to Harbaugh.\n\nFormer Baltimore Ravens running back Gus Edwards reached an agreement with the Los Angeles Chargers on a two-year deal, according to ESPN.\n\nWith the Chargers, Edwards will be reunited with offensive coordinator Greg Roman and will play for head coach Jim Harbaugh after playing for John Harbaugh in Baltimore from 2018-2023.\n\nEdwards, who will be 29 next month, saw the most action of his professional career last season as the Ravens did not have a primary back once J.K. Dobbins went down with a season-ending injury.\n\nEdwards missed the entire 2021 season with a torn ACL he suffered in practice.\n\nGiants fill running back void with a veteran\n\nThe New York Giants are moving on after Saquon Barkley's departure to the rival Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThe team agreed to a three-year, $16.5 million with Devin Singletary, according to multiple reports.\n\nSingletary, 26, had career highs in both rushing yards (898) and carries (216) after taking over the lead back role from Dameon Pierce.\n\nPackers get their big-name safety in Xavier McKinney\n\nThe Green Bay Packers have made another significant foray into free agency with a major name.\n\nSafety Xavier McKinney agreed to a four-year, $68 million contract with the team, according to multiple reports.\n\nMcKinney, 24, was viewed by many as the top free-agent safety available in a crowded market at the position. Despite the ample supply, McKinney was able to net a deal near the top of the market, as only Derwin James, Minkah Fitzpatrick and franchise-tagged Antoine Winfield Jr. are set to have higher annual average values at the position.\n\nMcKinney adds instant stability to the back end of a defense that is in transition under new coordinator Jeff Hafley. Darnell Savage Jr. agreed to a deal earlier Monday with the Jacksonville Jaguars, and Jonathan Owens and Rudy Ford are both free agents.\n\nPatriots to release WR DeVante Parker\n\nThe expected overhaul of the Patriots' receiving corps is underway.\n\nThe team will release veteran wideout DeVante Parker, according to multiple reports.\n\nParker, 31, agreed to a three-year extension with the team last June. But he recorded just 33 catches for 394 yards as he struggled to gain consistent separation.\n\nRobert Hunt reels in five-year, $100 million contract from Panthers\n\nRobert Hunt wasn't widely considered a candidate to land a nine-figure contract.\n\nBut amid a booming market for offensive guards, the former Miami Dolphins standout secured a five-year, $100 million contract from the Carolina Panthers, according to multiple reports.\n\nHis addition serves as a substantial investment by new general manager Dan Morgan in protecting No. 1 pick Bryce Young, whose 62 sacks trailed only the Washington Commanders' Sam Howell for most in the league.\n\nVikings keep adding to defense with LB homecoming\n\nThe Vikings continue to add to their defense on the first day of free agency, this time bringing aboard former Houston Texans linebacker Blake Cashman on a three-year, $25.5 million contract, according to multiple reports.\n\nCashman, who turns 28 in May, is a native of Eden Prairie, Minnesota. He recorded 106 tackles last season.\n\nHe stands as the latest defensive imports after the team also reached deals with Jonathan Greenard and Andrew Van Ginkel earlier in the day.\n\nVikings land another pass rusher in Andrew Van Ginkel\n\nEdge rusher Andrew Van Ginkel, one of the most productive late-round picks in recent memory for the Miami Dolphins, is finally cashing in, accepting a two-year deal Monday to join the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nESPN reported that Van Ginkel's deal is worth $20 million, with $14 million guaranteed.\n\nVan Ginkel was drafted in the fifth round in 2019, 151st overall, but is coming off a final season in Miami in which he graded as the NFL’s seventh-best edge defender, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nVan Ginkel proved to be a bargain for the Dolphins, not only in the low draft pick they spent on him, but in paying him $7.9 million over his five seasons. All the while, he earned respect as the personification of a lunchpail-type player.\n\nHe joins a new-look Vikings edge rush led by Jonathan Greenard, who agreed to terms with Minnesota earlier in the day.\n\n- Hal Habib, Palm Beach Post\n\nSaquon Barkley leaves Giants to link up with Eagles\n\nSince the New York Giants took him with the No. 2 overall pick of the 2018 NFL draft, Saquon Barkley maintained a public position that he wanted to spend his entire career with the team.\n\nHe'll see them on the opposing sideline twice a year now instead.\n\nBarkley and the Philadelphia Eagles agreed to a three-year, $37.75 million contract that could be worth up to $46.75M and includes $26M fully guaranteed, a person with knowledge of the deal told USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose terms of the deal.\n\nESPN was first to report the agreement.\n\nThe two-time Pro Bowl back will remain in the NFC East and will go closer to where he played collegiately at Penn State.\n\nBarkley joins Philadelphia as a rare big-money running back for a franchise that has typically avoided them under executive vice president and general manager Howie Roseman's watch.\n\nEarlier Monday, former Eagles running back D'Andre Swift signed a three-year deal with the Chicago Bears.\n\nJosh Jacobs in, Aaron Jones out for Packers\n\nJosh Jacobs' payday did not come in Sin City. Instead, he'll head to the Green Bay Packers to cash out.\n\nThe former Las Vegas Raiders running back agreed to an undisclosed deal with the team, according to multiple reports.\n\nAs a result of the move, lead back Aaron Jones will be released, according to multiple reports. His former backfield partner AJ Dillon became a free agent this offseason.\n\nJacobs led the league in rushing in 2022 and racked up 393 touches in the process while earning first-team All-Pro honors. After that season, the Raiders placed the franchise tag on Jacobs, who held out until close to the start of the season; the two sides eventually agreed on a one-year deal worth almost $12 million.\n\nKirk Cousins chooses Falcons over Vikings\n\nKirk Cousins is leaving the Minnesota Vikings for the Atlanta Falcons, bringing an end to his six-year run with the franchise and drastically altering the short-term outlook for two NFC playoff hopefuls.\n\nThe veteran quarterback agreed to terms on a four-year deal with the Falcons, his agent Mike McCartney confirmed Monday.\n\nWith Cousins not re-signing with the Vikings prior to the expiration of his contract on March 13, the Vikings will now incur a $28.5 million dead cap hit for 2024.\n\nThe four-time Pro Bowl selection steps in as the long-awaited answer for a franchise that has been dogged by poor play behind center ever since trading organizational mainstay Matt Ryan to the Indianapolis Colts two years ago. In 2022, Marcus Mariota was benched late in the season for rookie Desmond Ridder. Rather than pursue Lamar Jackson or another established veteran passer, the Falcons opted to stand behind Ridder as their starter for 2023. But his spate of turnovers and red zone woes led to a late-season benching, and coach Arthur Smith was fired after a third consecutive 7-10 season.\n\nSaid new coach Raheem Morris at the NFL scouting combine: \"If we had better quarterback play, I’m probably not standing here at this podium.\"\n\nEagles add intrigue to pass-rush group with Bryce Huff\n\nOne pass rusher in, another out?\n\nThat could be the eventual upshot for the Philadelphia Eagles after they agreed Monday on a three-year, $51.1 million contract with Bryce Huff.\n\nAn undrafted free agent out of Memphis in 2020, Huff latched on with the Jets and broke out last season as a designated pass rusher, tallying 10 sacks despite playing in just 42% of the team's defensive snaps. Huff proved to be a remarkably efficient threat, ranking eighth in pass-rush win rate among all edge rushers, according to ESPN. But he also benefited from being kept fresh with little work on run downs.\n\nHe joins a deep pass-rushing group that includes Haason Reddick, Josh Sweat, Brandon Graham and 2023 first-round pick Nolan Smith. His arrival could signal a possible trade for either Reddick or Sweat.\n\nRams bolster line with Jonah Jackson\n\nThe interior of the offensive line was clearly a priority for the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nAfter re-signing guard Kevin Dotson last week, the Rams signed guard Jonah Jackson to a three-year, $51 million deal with $34 million guaranteed.\n\nJackson, 27, was with the Detroit Lions for the first four seasons of his career. He made the Pro Bowl in 2021.\n\nDan Quinn brings over two former Cowboys player to Commanders\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys to Washington Commanders pipeline expanded during the first hours of free agency.\n\nIn addition to new head coach Dan Quinn, most recently the defensive coordinator for his former NFC East rival, the Commanders agreed to terms on deals with center Tyler Biadasz and defensive end Dorance Armstrong Jr.\n\nArmstrong enjoyed the most productive seasons of his career in 2022 and 2023 with a combined 16 sacks.\n\nBiadasz made the Pro Bowl in 2022 and was a three-year starter for Dallas.\n\nWashington entered free agency with by far the most cap space in the league at $96 million, giving first-year general manager Adam Peters the capacity to rebuild the roster.\n\nRaiders shake up NFL free agency with Christian Wilkins deal\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders announced themselves as a major player in free agency on Monday by agreeing to terms on a four-year, $110 million contract with former Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Christian Wilkins.\n\nThe deal also includes $84.75 million guaranteed.\n\nThat payout puts Wilkins behind only the Kansas City Chiefs' Chris Jones and the Los Angeles Rams' Aaron Donald in a booming defensive tackle market. Baltimore Ravens defensive tackle Justin Madubuike, for example, never hit free agency but last week agreed to a four-year, $98 million contract after receiving the franchise tag.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Wilkins will make for a formidable inside-outside tandem with three-time Pro Bowl defensive end Maxx Crosby. Tyree Wilson, the No. 7 overall pick in 2023, is also looking to make a leap after recorded 3 ½ sacks as a rookie.\n\nJaguars add a target in WR Gabe Davis\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars and wide receiver Gabe Davis have agreed to terms on a three-year deal worth $39 million, according to multiple reports.\n\nDavis spent the first four seasons of his career with the Buffalo Bills, the team that drafted him in the fourth round in 2020. He had 27 touchdowns in the regular season during that time and became the de facto No. 2 wide receiver behind Stefon Diggs for quarterback Josh Allen. While he delivered splash plays as a downfield target, averaging 16.7 yards per catch, he struggled with consistency and was held without a catch in five games last season.\n\nThe Jaguars still face an uncertain future with top wide receiver Calvin Ridley, who is set to become a free agent after leading the team with 1,016 receiving yards after his first season back from a one-year gambling ban. The Athletic's Jeff Howe reported Jacksonville still hopes to bring back Ridley, but there could be strong competition for the receiver, especially given the shortage of top-tier pass catchers on the open market.\n\nTitans continue to build up front with Lloyd Cushenberry\n\nTennessee Titans general manager Ran Carthon has made it known he wants to fortify his team's offensive line. In free agency, he took a significant step toward that goal.\n\nLloyd Cushenberry, widely considered the top center available, agreed to a deal with the team on Monday, according to multiple reports.\n\nCushenberry should step in alongside 2023 first-round pick Peter Skoronski to help stabilize the interior for second-year quarterback Will Levis. With the No. 7 pick in this year's draft, the Titans still could be in the market for their left tackle of the future.\n\nDavid Bakhtiari out in Green Bay\n\nIt was a move that appeared inevitable for some time, but David Bahktiari's time with the Packers finally appears to be over.\n\nThe 32-year-old left tackle posted his farewell on social media amid his expected release.\n\nA two-time All-Pro, Bakhtiari has played just 13 games in the last three seasons - including one last year - while dealing with lingering knee issues. His $40 million cap hit for 2024 was set to be the largest of any non-quarterback.\n\nNow, could a reunion with Aaron Rodgers be in the cards given the Jets' need for a blind-side protector?\n\nTony Pollard to Titans\n\nThe running back market is quickly coming into focus, Tony Pollard set to join the Tennessee Titans shortly after the Chicago Bears and D'Andre Swift struck a deal. Pollard's move to Nashville all but officially brings an end to Derrick Henry's momentous tenure – his 9,502 rushing yards the most ever by a Titan (though ex-Oiler/Titan Eddie George is the franchise's all-time leading rusher by 507 yards).\n\nPollard, whose move was first reported by KPRC2's Aaron Wilson, had more than 1,300 yards from scrimmage each of the past two seasons for the Dallas Cowboys. However his yards per touch dipped by 1.6 in 2023, when he played on the franchise tag as the lead back following the departure of Ezekiel Elliott. Pollard will now team with Tyjae Spears (838 yards in 2023) in Tennessee.\n\nJonathan Greenard links up with Vikings\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings faced a potential exodus from an already suspect pass rush. Now, they have wrapped up one of the top edge threats on the market.\n\nJonathan Greenard agreed to a four-year, $76 million deal with the team Monday, his agent told ESPN.\n\nGreenard, who turns 27 in May, had a breakout season last year for the Houston Texans, racking up 12 ½ sacks opposite Defensive Rookie of the Year Will Anderson Jr.\n\nIn Minnesota, he'll play a vital role in Brian Flores' blitz-happy defense, which looks set to lose standout edge rusher Danielle Hunter. Marcus Davenport and D.J. Wonnum are also on track to be free agents.\n\nD'Andre Swift bolts to Bears on three-year contract\n\nThe first big domino of NFL free agency has fallen.\n\nFormer Philadelphia Eagles running back D'Andre Swift agreed to a three-year, $24.5 million deal with the Chicago Bears, according to NFL Network.\n\nSwift, 25, should take on a leading role in a Bears backfield that also returns Khalil Herbert and Roschon Johnson. After being acquired by the Eagles via trade last offseason, Swift tallied career highs of 229 carries and 1,049 rushing yards.\n\nChicago could be in for a nearly full-scale skill-position overhaul outside of wide receiver DJ Moore, as the team is expected to select Caleb Williams No. 1 overall in the NFL draft and could be in the market for another wideout with the No. 9 pick.\n\nSwift's departure creates more uncertainty for the Eagles, who could be involved in the market for Saquon Barkley.\n\nMichael Pittman Jr. gets a long-term deal with Colts\n\nAdd Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. to the growing list of franchise-tagged players who won't be playing on the one-year tender in 2024 after getting a long-term deal completed.\n\nPittman and the Colts agreed to a three-year, $70 million contract, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe agreement keeps in place the top target for Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson. Pittman recorded 109 catches for 1,152 receiving yards last season.\n\nKickers not getting the boot\n\nA couple of specialists are staying home rather than test the free agent market.\n\nPer NFL Network, the New York Jets are re-signing K Greg Zuerlein, arguably their most valuable player in 2023, to a two-year contract worth $8.4 million. The veteran connected on 35 of 38 field-goal tries in 2023, one of the best seasons of his 12-year career.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers remain in run-it-back mode, reaching a three-year agreement to retain K Chase McLaughlin a day after keeping QB Baker Mayfield in the building. McLaughlin was 29-of-31 in the FG department for the 2023 NFC South champs and hit all 33 of his extra-point tries.\n\nEagles extend Landon Dickerson\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles’ offensive line will look different next season without Jason Kelce, but the organization is bringing back a key part of the interior.\n\nLeft guard Landon Dickerson agreed to a four-year extension, the Eagles announced Monday.\n\nAccording to NFL Media, the deal is worth $84 million in base salary with $50 million guaranteed and a $20 million signing bonus. The $21 million annual average value is the highest for a guard in NFL history. The Atlanta Falcons' Chris Lindstrom previously held the title.\n\nDickerson, 25, has been the Eagles’ starter at left guard since Week 3 of the 2021 season, his rookie year. He is a back-to-back Pro Bowl selection and one of the key pieces behind the efficiency and success of the Eagles’ patented “Tush Push” short-yardage run play.\n\nThe Eagles selected Dickerson, who started his college career at Florida State before transferring to Alabama, in the second round (37th overall) of the 2021 draft.\n\nJaguars add Pro Bowler to offensive line\n\nAfter a season in which QB Trevor Lawrence was consistently beaten up physically, the Jacksonville Jaguars have already made a move to upgrade their O-line. Per NFL Network, C Mitch Morse – another \"street free agent\" after getting released by the Buffalo Bills last week – has agreed to a two-year, $10.5 million deal ($7 million guaranteed). The 2022 Pro Bowler will likely displace Luke Fortner, the Jags' starting center the past two seasons.\n\nTee Higgins landing spots: Which teams could be interested in Bengals WR?\n\nMaybe the Bengals won't be running back their receiving corps after all.\n\nFranchise-tagged wide receiver Tee Higgins is requesting a trade amid frustration with the team regarding the lack of progress toward a long-term contract, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon. The person spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nESPN was first to report the news.\n\nHiggins, 25, would immediately become the best wide receiver that could be within teams' reach - although at a potentially significant cost. Beyond what a team would have to give up in compensation in order to sway the Bengals to part with arguably the league's top No. 2 receiver, a franchise would need to cough up a significant contract amid a booming receiver market.\n\nStill, several teams could be potential buyers. Among them:\n\nCarolina Panthers: Their interest in finding top-tier pass-catching help is well-established, and there's likely no bigger instant-impact contributor available than the Clemson product. Strong chance that the Panthers are looking for a receiver when they're first up with the initial pick of the second round.\n\nTheir interest in finding top-tier pass-catching help is well-established, and there's likely no bigger instant-impact contributor available than the Clemson product. Strong chance that the Panthers are looking for a receiver when they're first up with the initial pick of the second round. Tennessee Titans: Homecoming time for the Oak Ridge, Tennessee, native? Outside of 31-year-old DeAndre Hopkins, the receiving corps behind Will Levis is severely underwhelming. Higgins could form a dynamic downfield connection with Levis, and the Titans have ample cap space to swing such a move.\n\nHomecoming time for the Oak Ridge, Tennessee, native? Outside of 31-year-old DeAndre Hopkins, the receiving corps behind Will Levis is severely underwhelming. Higgins could form a dynamic downfield connection with Levis, and the Titans have ample cap space to swing such a move. New England Patriots: Eliot Wolf spoke of the need to \"weaponize the offense.\" Well, here you go. No better quick fix for a team that has been woefully lacking in support for its quarterback, and Higgins would be a major asset to any young passer who takes the reins behind center. And a big-money deal isn't a problem for a team that enters Monday with the second-most cap space (more than $82 million) at its disposal.\n\nWhy are some free agents already signing deals?\n\nThe tampering window doesn't open until noon ET, however some players have already switched teams. Why?\n\nIn the case of S Kevin Byard, who's already reportedly agreed to a two-year deal with the Chicago Bears, for example, the Philadelphia Eagles terminated his contract early. That made Byard a \"street free agent\" and thus eligible to sign elsewhere immediately as opposed to waiting for Wednesday. Former Denver Broncos Pro Bowl FS Justin Simmons is in a similar situation, already eligible to join another club.\n\nEarly termination of contracts not only kickstarts the process of clearing cap space, but it's often a sign of good faith as clubs give veterans a head start on the free agent process.\n\nIn the case of QB Russell Wilson, he can't officially sign with the Pittsburgh Steelers until later this week as the Broncos have only announced his impending release, but it's not yet official.\n\nColts bring back LB Zaire Franklin\n\nINDIANAPOLIS — The first move the Colts made in free agency this offseason was one they did not have to make.\n\nBut it was a chance to reward a player who has outplayed the last deal he signed by leaps and bounds.\n\nIndianapolis signed middle linebacker Zaire Franklin to a three-year extension, a person with knowledge of the situation told IndyStar and the USA TODAY Network on Monday morning. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to disclose the deal, which is worth up to $31.3 million.\n\nFranklin signed a three-year, $10 million deal in free agency two years ago, a deal that reflected his place at the time as a critical special teamer and rotational linebacker, and he was headed into the final year of that deal in 2024, a deal that would have paid him more than $3 million this season.\n\nHe has been a tackling machine the past two seasons, breaking the Indianapolis record with 167 tackles in his first season as a full-time starter, then setting a new bar again in 2023 by piling up 179 tackles. Franklin also has 4.5 sacks and 12 passes defended over the past two seasons.\n\n- Joel A. Erickson, Indianapolis Star\n\nLions solidify interior line with Graham Glasgow\n\nThe Detroit Lions will keep at least one of their starting guards in 2024.\n\nThe Lions and veteran offensive lineman Graham Glasgow agreed to a new three-year contract worth a maximum of $20 million before the start of the free agent negotiating period Monday. The deal, which is still being finalized, includes $9.5 million guaranteed.\n\nOriginally a third-round pick by the Lions in 2016, Glasgow returned to the team on a one-year deal last spring after spending the previous three seasons with the Denver Broncos. He started games at both guard spots and center last year and was one of the Lions’ most consistent linemen.\n\nGlasgow ranked second in the NFL in run block win rate among interior lineman in 2023, according to ESPN, and allowed four sacks last season according to the Free Press’ charting of plays.\n\n- Dave Birkett, Detroit Free Press\n\nRussell Wilson to sign with Steelers\n\nSix days proved to be enough for Russell Wilson to find his landing spot.\n\nAfter the Denver Broncos revealed last Monday their intention to cut Wilson after the start of the new league year on Wednesday, the nine-time Pro Bowl quarterback met with the Pittsburgh Steelers on Friday. By Sunday night, reports emerged that Wilson was planning to sign with the Steelers, with the signal-caller seemingly confirming the news on social media.\n\nWilson's addition adds immediate intrigue for a Steelers offense already undergoing changes with the arrival of new coordinator Arthur Smith. While both coach Mike Tomlin and general manager Omar Khan have backed incumbent starter Kenny Pickett, each stated their desire to bring in competition ahead of the former first-round draft pick's third season.\n\nThe move comes at little cost to the Steelers, as Wilson was due $39 million guaranteed from the Broncos.\n\nWhile starting is hardly a given for Wilson, the opportunity seemingly stands out as the 12-year veteran's best chance to push for playing time - and on a team that has never had a losing season in Tomlin's 17 years at the helm.\n\nArik Armstead set to hit NFL free agency as a cut\n\nIn an offseason in which the San Francisco 49ers look to be bringing back a sizable number of their key contributors from last year's Super Bowl team, at least one piece will be headed elsewhere.\n\nDefensive lineman Arik Armstead was unable to agree to a restructured contract with the team and is now expected to be released, according to multiple reports.\n\nArmstead, 30, played in 12 games last season, missing time after suffering a torn meniscus in December. He has spent all nine years of his career with the 49ers and signed a five-year, $85 million contract with the team in 2020 after a 10-sack season.\n\nThis season, Armstead was set to have a massive $28.3 million cap hit.

Before you get a team, tear this monster down and start over again,' '' Godbold remembers.\n\nThe message was simple for Jacksonville: No new stadium, no NFL team.\n\nRelated: Twenty years ago, how upstart Jacksonville won an NFL franchise\n\nRelated: Jaguars face new challenge after 20 years: Sustainability\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nCity leaders listened. While the stadium wasn't completely torn down - the upper deck of the old Gator Bowl was preserved - the deal to build what is now called EverBank Field for $121 million kept Jacksonville in the expansion race. Twenty years ago, and 14 years after Irsay's helicopter visit, Jacksonville was awarded an NFL franchise on Nov. 30, 1993.\n\nBy today's standards, in the era of billion-dollar price tags for new stadiums, rebuilding the Gator Bowl was a bargain.\n\nIn Cleveland, they are spending $120 million on improvements for a stadium that opened in 1999.\n\nAnd the Jacksonville City Council recently approved a deal to add $63 million in improvements to EverBank Field, including the world's largest scoreboards.\n\nIt's the second $63 million upgrade to the stadium since it was built. The first was for the Super Bowl in 1994 so by next year, the stadium that cost $121 million to build will have $126 million in upgrades. And that doesn't count the $10 million owner Shad Khan spent upgrading the interior of the stadium, including the locker, weight and training rooms. Khan is also kicking in $20 million for the current upgrade.\n\nStill, 20 years ago, spending $121 million on building the stadium - with the Jaguars picking up cost overruns - was not an easy sell.\n\nThe deal and Jacksonville's NFL dream almost died when team owner Wayne Weaver rejected the $112 million project and pulled out on July 21, 1993.\n\n\"The deal fell apart over the cost of the stadium,'' said Carl Cannon, the former Times-Union publisher who helped get the two sides together and also led the club seat ticket-selling campaign that helped put Jacksonville over the top.\n\nAbout a month later, the new deal was crafted and approved by the City Council by a 14-4 vote.\n\nIn retrospect, though, the stadium was a double-edged sword.\n\nThe 76,766 permanent seats were too many for an NFL team in a small market, especially after the novelty wore off and the Jaguars' playoff run of the early years ended.\n\nThe old Gator Bowl had more than 80,000 seats and a similar size stadium was necessary to keep the Florida-Georgia college football game in Jacksonville. The new stadium was built with temporary seating to boost capacity to about 82,000.\n\nThe large capacity helped the city host a Super Bowl and has allowed the city to bid for the national championship college football game in 2016 and 2017.\n\nIt also made the Jaguars a very lucrative franchise at the beginning because the stadium had 10,000 club seats, a premium concept that was just invented a decade earlier in Miami.\n\nWith most of the teams still playing in old stadiums that didn't have club seats, the Jaguars became the second-highest revenue team in the league.\n\nBut trying to sell that many tickets has been a challenge for the franchise over the years.\n\nWith so many tickets available, fans know they can give up their season tickets when the team is losing and then buy them again if the team starts winning. In the ticket-selling business, it's called churn.\n\nFormer owner Wayne Weaver tried all kinds of ways to sell tickets, including having Winn-Dixie buy unsold tickets and give them away, until he decided to cover up almost 10,000 seats to lower the capacity to 67,246.\n\nThat made it easier to avoid television blackouts, but it also hurt the image of the team and the city.\n\n\"The biggest negative of having too many seats is that the national media jumped all over us for covering up seats,'' said Gator Bowl president Rick Catlett, who played a key role in helping the city land an NFL franchise. \"It galvanized the national press to point at Jacksonville, even though three or four other teams were having a harder time selling tickets.''\n\nThe new stadium also has a no-frills look and a generic feel. Some of the newer stadiums feature such attractions as the lighthouse in New England and the pirate ship in Tampa Bay.\n\nJaguars president Mark Lamping said the stadium lacks a specific personality and adds, \"There's nothing in the stadium that tells you that you are a beautiful city with so much to offer.''\n\nThe newest upgrades, expected to be completed in time for the 2014 NFL season, will give the stadium a wow factor. The last round of upgrades included state-of-the-art scoreboards that are now obsolete and will be replaced by the two biggest scoreboards of their kind in the world.\n\nTo help give the stadium a Jacksonville feel, about 7,000 permanent seats will be taken out to make room for a 42,000-square-foot fan zone in the north end zone that will include water features.\n\nLamping said those water features, which could include fountains and palm trees, haven't been designed yet, but will emphasize that Jacksonville has the ocean, beaches and the St. Johns River. It's also likely to look good on television.\n\nTaking out the 7,000 seats - although the city will have to pay an estimated $376,000 to put in temporary seating each year for the Florida-Georgia game - will cut down on the number of tarps and may do away with them altogether.\n\nThese new features will give the stadium a different look, though maintaining a stadium never ends. Funds from a hotel bed tax are committed to the stadium, so future improvements are expected to be financed without dipping into the general fund.\n\n\"If you keep maintaining it, it will be in good shape for a long time,'' Catlett said.\n\nVito Stellino: (904) 359-4279", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/02/18/franchise-tag-preview-20-possibilities/1928067/", "title": "Franchise time: 20 NFL players who might be tagged", "text": "Nate Davis, USA TODAY Sports\n\nA record 21 players were tagged in 2012\n\nTeam have until March 4 to use franchise or transition tags\n\nJoe Flacco among stars who could be franchised%2C but don%27t expect him to get out of Baltimore\n\nBeginning today, NFL teams have until March 4 to place a franchise or transition tag on one of their prized free agents (the free agency signing period opens March 12). Players bearing the tags are guaranteed a predetermined one-year salary based on the position they play (and a formula which factors in the size of the salary cap) but can negotiate with other clubs; the original team has the right to match any offer sheet a tagged free agent signs. The club controlling a player's rights receives two first-round draft picks if it lets a franchise player go elsewhere but gets nothing in return if a transition player is allowed to walk. Players can also receive an exclusive franchise tag which affords them more money but prevents them from testing the market.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, it's worth noting little happens once a player is tagged. Only three franchised players have switched teams since the mechanism was first used in 1993, and it hasn't happened since 1998 becaise it's virtually impossible to find a veteran player who's worth two first rounders. The last transition tag player to move was all-pro guard Steve Hutchinson in 2006, though that was largely because the Minnesota Vikings constructed a \"poison pill\" contract the Seattle Seahawks couldn't match without wrecking their own salary cap. Transitioning Hutchinson was a bad miscalculation by the Seahawks, who would've only needed to front around $500,000 more to franchise him, and virtually no team uses that tag anymore given the lack of protection it provides.\n\nHere are 20 players who could be franchised (a record 21 were tagged in 2012) over the next two weeks:\n\nDanny Amendola, WR, St. Louis Rams: We wouldn't give this very good slot guy $10 million-plus given his injury issues and relative skill set.

Just because.\n\nHarris, head of the new ownership group of the Washington Commanders, is not Dan Snyder.\n\nThat is cause for so much celebration for a Commanders fan base that suffered too much for too long. Winner, winner, this Harris would be. Can a taxpayer-supported deal for a new stadium – maybe even in the city, if not suburban Virginia or Maryland, despite more pressing civic needs – be far behind? Will Democrats and Republicans join hands and dance in the aisles on Capitol Hill? Are the Hogs back in vogue? Sellouts, again, ticketed for FedEx Field?\n\nNFL owners unanimously approved the sale of the Commanders for a record $6.05 billion – with the attached condition of a $60 million fine for Snyder – during a special league meeting in Minneapolis on Thursday. And they were so eager to do it.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nSure, the price tag means that the franchise value of every other NFL franchise has instantly increased. And with new ownership, the Commanders conceivably can get the deals done, including sponsorships, that Snyder apparently couldn’t anymore because of his tattered reputation. With the team based in such a treasured market, that, too, raises the values of other NFL franchises.\n\nYet other owners were also motivated to usher Snyder – who bought the franchise in 1999 for a then-record $800 million – out of their powerful club because his shame was too much to be associated with.\n\nThink about it. NFL owners over the years have taken one hit after another for questionable business and personal matters of some of them. Yet until Snyder’s alleged misdeeds surfaced – the workplace culture and sexual harassment allegations, followed by charges that the team tried to hide revenues to be shared with other franchises – none of the alleged transgressions rose to the level where owners seriously considered voting Snyder out.\n\nRoughly 15 months ago, several owners, speaking on condition of anonymity, told me how they were contemplating measures for Snyder’s removal, which was possible under the NFL’s bylaws and constitution. As one owner put it, “We are counting votes.”\n\nNow it’s done without that battle. The league announced on Thursday that the hefty fine is tied to the findings by former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White from her lengthy investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and financial improprieties.\n\nExhale, Commanders fans. It’s done. Finally. The witch is dead. Snyder is officially out as the NFL’s worst owner, and he leaves with a legacy of futility.\n\nWhen he bought in, Snyder was so full of promise. He was just 34, and as a D.C.-area native, he was a lifelong fan of the Burgundy and Gold. There was no question that he was all-in for trying to field a winner; quickly proven by his willingness to overpay by the millions for free agent players – and for at least one coach, Steve Spurrier.\n\nThe team won a playoff game during Snyder’s first year of ownership. Woo hoo. Since then, Washington won just one more playoff game. And that was just one measure of Snyder’s journey into running one of the NFL’s signature franchises into the ground.\n\nAll told, Snyder’s legacy is a blueprint for what not to do when owning an NFL franchise.\n\nOf course, proof of the workplace culture allegations and charges of sexual harassment – at least 40 women have come forward with claims dating to the early 2000s – would be enough to close the book on Snyder’s pitiful mark on NFL history. One of the more disgusting cases, revealed in a New York Times story in 2018, alleged that team cheerleaders were essentially forced to pose topless for a photo shoot held in Costa Rica and attended by all-male sponsors and suite holders. There were also the alleged lewd videos with outtakes of cheerleaders ordered by team executives, first reported by The Washington Post. Although the league on Thursday released White’s 23-page report on the most recent allegations, details from a previous investigation, conducted by Beth Wilkinson, weren’t released publicly and no written report was ever produced. Wilkinson’s findings led to an agreement in 2021 between Snyder and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for Snyder to relinquish day-to-day control of the franchise to his wife, Tanya, in addition to a $10 million fine.\n\nYet even without the serious issues of harassment and a toxic workplace culture, Snyder served up so many items for the blueprint of what to avoid. Among them:\n\nEarly in his tenure, there was a reason that agents representing free agents wanted their clients to attract attention from the Washington owner. He blew up the market in overpaying for fading, aging players.\n\nHe lured Spurrier from the college ranks in 2002 with to a then-record five-year, $25 million contract. It was Spurrier’s first NFL head coaching gig. And his last. He lasted two years.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Snyder charged fans $10 to attend training camp practices – traditionally free, for decades and across the NFL – and $10 for parking. It was one of the first money-grab moves that sowed seeds of discontent with a loyal fan base.\n\nHe vehemently resisted pleas to change the team’s racist name. In 2013, he told USA TODAY’s Erik Brady that he would “NEVER” change the team’s name. He ultimately dropped the name in 2020, amid the racial reckoning in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death, as FedEx threatened to sever its sponsorship ties if the team name wasn’t changed.\n\nNo, Harris, owner of the NBA Philadelphia 76ers and NHL New Jersey Devils, certainly doesn’t need any advice from Snyder especially, about what not to do as he leads a new era for the Commanders.\n\nYet for all of the follies of his predecessor, Harris has quite the head start in the goodwill department with Commanders fans.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2022/02/02/washington-football-team-unveils-commanders-as-new-nfl-nickname/62932669007/", "title": "Washington Football Team unveils Commanders as new NFL ...", "text": "Football fans in the nation's capital, say hello to your Washington Commanders.\n\nThe NFL franchise established in 1932 as the Boston Braves, known later as the Boston and Washington Redskins, and known for the last two seasons as the Washington Football Team, will be known going forward as the Washington Commanders, team officials announced Wednesday.\n\nThe decision is the latest and most prominent step in a rebranding of the franchise, which announced in July of 2020 that it was \"retiring\" the Redskins previous nickname and logo after many years of protests that it constituted a racial slur against Native Americans.\n\nThe organization has also faced a series of accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct by team employees that resulted in an official NFL investigation.

The Commanders said Wednesday that Daniel Snyder hired an investment bank to “consider potential transactions” for his franchise, though the team did not specify whether the Snyder's are considering the sale of the whole franchise or a minority share.\n\nSnyder, who two weeks ago said he would never sell, has been engulfed in controversy, and is currently under investigation from Congress for the workplace culture created during his ownership, and by the NFL for a second time for a sexual misconduct allegation.

But in the context of NFL \"Moneyball,\" $10 million for an elite playmaker is relative chump change.\n\nJacobs, 25, only led the NFL with 1,653 rushing yards (4.9 per carry) and 2,053 yards from scrimmage last season while amassing a league-high 393 touches for the Las Vegas Raiders. Barkley, 26, accounted for nearly 30% of the New York Giants' offense in 2022 with his 1,650 yards from scrimmage. And Pollard, 26, is an emerging star who supplanted now out-of-work Ezekiel Elliott as the top threat in the Dallas Cowboys' backfield.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nNever mind their production. Their franchise tags – lowest for any position besides kickers and punters – would have them rank 201st in the league for average salaries, according to Spotrac.com.\n\nThey apparently play the wrong position for the best paydays, with the typically shortened career span of running backs fueling the devaluation of the position – for years now, as the NFL morphed into a passing circus – despite the still-obvious need for teams to bank on their production.\n\n“The issue is not the value of the running back to the team on Sundays,” agent Peter Schaffer told USA TODAY Sports. “Every team understands the football value.”\n\nNo, the issue is much deeper than that, with running backs – even the best of the best – disrespected by a business model that suggests they are a dime a dozen.\n\nOf course, there is nothing new under the sun. Some Hall of Famers – hello Emmitt Smith, Eric Dickerson and Edgerrin James – had some classic contract episodes on their way to Canton.\n\n“Everyone knows it’s tough to win without a top running back and yet they act like we are discardable widgets,” Los Angeles Chargers running back Austin Ekeler wrote Monday on Twitter. “I support any running back doing whatever it takes to get his bag.”\n\nThe outrage expressed on social media by several running backs was pretty much unanimous in its sense of victimization. Christian McCaffrey of the San Francisco 49ers, whose average salary of $16 million tops the running back market, called it “criminal” that the franchise-tagged ball carriers didn’t net long-term contracts. Pittsburgh Steelers running back Najee Harris maintained, “This notion that we deserve less is a joke.”\n\nDerrick Henry, who is undeniably the centerpiece of the Tennessee Titans offense at $12.5 million per year (while quarterback Ryan Tannehill averages $29.5 million), was drastic with his frustration.\n\n“At this point, just take the running back position out of the game then,” Henry tweeted. “The ones that want to be great & work as hard as they can to give their all to an organization, (it) just seems like it don’t even matter. I’m with every RB that’s fighting to get what they deserve.”\n\nRemember when it was cool to be a running back? That’s when the tykes playing Pop Warner football were typically the best athletes on the field and couldn’t tote the rock enough.\n\nNow it’s just one diss after another, with the players who arguably absorb the worst physical toll of any position respected so much more during the playoff drives in January than they are when contracts are negotiated from March to September.\n\nAccording to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero, Jacobs was sitting in a car at Raiders headquarters with defensive end Maxx Crosby, positioned to sign a contract on Monday as the deadline approached. No deal.\n\nDalvin Cook, meanwhile, is still without a team, released by the Minnesota Vikings in June despite rushing for more than 1,100 yards in each of the past four seasons. There’s a market for Cook, but at what price? He had three years left on his contract, averaging $12.6 million, before he was released.\n\nCincinnati Bengals running back Joe Mixon worked through a dilemma by reducing his salary from $9.4 million to less than $6 million, with incentives potentially allowing him to collect $8 million. Schaffer, who represents Mixon, reiterated what he expressed in a statement that emphasized the running back’s desire to remain with a Super Bowl contender. Yet it’s also true that hitting a depressed running back market was not an attractive alternative.\n\nEkeler can relate. Amid a stalemate in negotiations with one year left on his contract, the Chargers granted his request to seek a trade. Yet there were apparently no takers, despite Ekeler, 27, leading the NFL over the past two years with 38 touchdowns. In lieu of a long-term deal, the Chargers reworked his contract by adding $2 million in incentives for 2023. Yet Ekeler’s average of $6.125 million per year ranks 323rd in the league, per Spotrac.\n\nAnd while Barkley is expected to be a no-show when the Giants open training camp next week, once-maligned quarterback Daniel Jones operates with a fresh contract paying $40 million per year.\n\nYes, the system is skewed – or screwed, if you will, for running backs.\n\nJust six running backs carry average salaries above the franchise tag, while several wide receivers who might be considered average have deals topping $11 million per year.\n\nGetting to the open market is hardly the ticket. Miles Sanders received the top free agency deal for a running back this March, leaving the Philadelphia Eagles for the Carolina Panthers. His four-year, $25.4 million contract averages $6.4 million, which would make him the 40th highest-paid receiver.\n\nIt was quite the harbinger for the depressed market that has played out in ensuing months.\n\n“You want to franchise tag and create a certain market for running backs just because you have this way of thinking that they only last three or four years,” Sanders said in June, during an appearance on \"the Rich Eisen Show.\" “I think it’s B.S., honestly. Almost every running back is underpaid right now. I don’t know what it’s gonna take. That’s a topic that needs to be brought up a little more because it sucks to be a running back right now.”\n\nWhat’s the solution? Adjusting the franchise tag, a key baseline for negotiations, would be a starting point. Although the tags are based on a formula tied to the top five salaries over five years, the NFL Players Association can conceivably negotiate with the NFL for a higher tag for running backs in establishing the cap for each season.\n\nIf not, then why not group the running backs into a category with receivers and tight ends? The tag for receivers in 2023 is $19.743 million (third highest behind quarterbacks and linebackers), while the tight end figure is $11.345 million.\n\n“If they made that tag $16 million or $17 million,” Schaffer pondered, “people wouldn’t be tagging them and we’d find out what the market is.”\n\nSchaffer, though, floated his own idea: allow running backs to enter the NFL on three-year contracts, with the chance to renegotiate after two years. As it stands now, the rookie pool system mandates four-year deals (with negotiations opening after three years) for players who aren’t first-round picks. As Barkley can attest after being drafted second overall in 2018, the first-rounders have it even worse because teams can exercise fifth-year options.\n\n“The solution,” Schaffer said, “is that there has to be a recognition that when you have restraints, it’s not a true capitalistic market.”\n\nWhile Jacobs and Barkley aren’t expected to report for the opening of training camps – and perhaps won’t show until the start of the regular season because they haven’t signed their franchise tag tenders – Pollard is due in Cowboys camp next week. Pollard signed his tender in March while rehabbing from a broken leg. Yet there’s still the uncertainty of not having a long-term deal.\n\nPollard’s agent, Kennard McGuire, told USA TODAY Sports, “We’re not going to compromise on what we think his value is.”\n\nWhen it comes to running backs, though, that value is subject to much debate.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/18"}]}

One massive fire has “advanced up the slopes of Mount Parnitha, a national park north of Athens and one of the last substantial forests near the Greek capital”.\n\n“If some people still doubt if climate change is real, let them come and see the intensity of phenomena here,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said during a televised briefing on Friday. The ongoing heatwave has “turned the country into a powder keg”, he added.\n\nMitsotakis has pledged to make reforestation a priority once the fires are contained, telling reporters on Saturday that “when this nightmarish summer has passed, we will turn all our attention to repairing the damage as fast as possible, and in restoring our natural environment again”.\n\nBut for now, the blazes are still raging. Reporting from Greece, The Guardian’s Helena Smith says that “little had prepared any of us on the Athens-bound flight for the sight of the great fire-induced clouds that swept either side of the plane as it made its descent on Friday”.\n\nFirefighters battle the blaze in northern Athens (Image credit: Milos Bicanski/Getty Image)\n\n“Infernos seemingly redolent of Dante’s hell” have seen areas in Athens “transformed into ash-laden no-go zones”, she continues. Flying above the capital city, “it was frighteningly clear that the city was under siege” from the “apocalyptic” fires, with “a cycle of insufferable heat fuelling conflagrations on terrain so parched it was ready to ignite at any moment”.\n\nAs extreme heat engulfs much of southern Europe, wildfires are also raging in Albania and Bulgaria, while “North Macedonia has declared a state of emergency over its own blazes”, the BBC reports.\n\n“And in southwestern Turkey, the heatwave has made local wildfires the most intense on record,” with at least eight people confirmed to have been killed and hundreds injured, says the broadcaster.\n\n‘We have to adapt’\n\nA team of 21 experienced UK firefighters have been sent to Athens by Home Secretary Priti Patel “to assist Greek emergency services battling blazes that have engulfed the city in thick smog”, The Telegraph says.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson told the paper that Patel “was in Greece earlier this week and saw the devastating effect the fires are having”, adding: “That’s why she is deploying these firefighters to help our international partners in their time of need.”\n\nA man inspects his fire damaged home in northern Athens (Image credit: Milos Bicanski/Getty Images)\n\nThe British firefighters will team up with experts from France, Ukraine, Cyprus, Croatia, Sweden and Israel. Fire crews have also been dispatched from Romania and Switzerland, while Egypt has sent two helicopters, and 36 Czech firefighters are expected to arrive today.\n\nAmid “darkness wrought by nature gone awry, extraordinary stories of valour” have emerged from Greece over the past week, writes The Guardian’s Smith. She describes how one resident of the Athens suburb of Thrakomakedones stayed behind to “defend” his property from the encroaching fires.\n\n“I am very attached to this house,” said Alexandros Rizos, who told Smith how he got his family to safety before “hiding when the order arrived to evacuate”. Rizos, a business development consultant, then stood on the roof of his home and hosed down his garden - an action that helped to prevent the blaze from taking hold of both his own and neighbouring houses.\n\nBut while his home has survived the blaze, Rizos believes climate change will bring further fires.\n\n“We love nature in my family and we want to protect the environment, not install air conditioners that will destroy it,” he said. “But with temperatures of 45C, that’s going to be hard. We have to adapt. For sure, I’ll be replacing pine trees with other trees that don’t burn so easily.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Devika Rao", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Rafi Schwartz", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/07/23/rhodes-greece-wildfires-evacuation/70453581007/", "title": "Rhodes, Greece, wildfires: 19,000 people evacuate, tourists flee", "text": "Demetris Nellas\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nATHENS, Greece — About 19,000 people have been evacuated from the Greek island of Rhodes as wildfires burned for a sixth day on three fronts, Greek authorities said Sunday.\n\nThe Ministry of Climate Change and Civil Protection said it was “the largest evacuation from a wildfire in the country.”\n\nLocal police said 16,000 people were evacuated by land and 3,000 by sea from 12 villages and several hotels. Six people were briefly treated at a hospital for respiratory problems. A person who fell and broke a leg during a hotel evacuation and a pregnant woman remained hospitalized, the latter in good condition, authorities said.\n\nPackage holiday companies TUI and Jet2 canceled flights to Rhodes. Jet2 said it was canceling five regularly scheduled passenger flights to the island on Sunday but would fly the planes to Rhodes empty to retrieve customers. TUI said it was canceling all its flights to the island until at least Tuesday.\n\nTourists evacuated as fire rages nearby\n\nBritish tourist Kevin Evans was evacuated twice on Saturday with his wife and three young children — first from Kiotari to Gennadi, then as the fire approached to the island’s capital in the northeast, he told Britain’s PA news agency.\n\n“There were lots of people in Gennadi sent from the hotels — many in just swimsuits having been told to leave everything in the hotel,” he told PA. “As night fell, we could see the fire on the top of the hills in Kiotari. They said all the hotels were on fire.”\n\nRhodes travel agent Stelios Kotiadis confirmed to the Associated Press that the evacuation was hasty. “There was panic. ... The authorities were overwhelmed,” he said.\n\nBut, he said, the abandoned hotels “are in much better condition than reported in social media. ... They will be ready to reopen very soon if Civil Protection gives the go-ahead.”\n\nKotiadis said he and other travel agents sent buses to the island’s southeast to pick up evacuated tourists. They had to go the long way around, since the road running down Rhodes’ eastern side was blocked in places.\n\n“There were 80-90 people cramming into 50-seater buses,” he said. He added that 90% of the evacuated tourists are from European countries.\n\nThe British ambassador to Greece, Matthew Lodge, said the U.K. government was sending a rapid deployment team to support British nationals on Rhodes.\n\nThe Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs said personnel were on their way to Rhodes to set up a help desk at Rhodes International Airport for visitors who have lost their travel documents.\n\nMore than 250 firefighters on the ground\n\nFire Brigade spokesman Yannis Artopios said that as of early Sunday afternoon, 266 firefighters and 49 engines were operating on the ground, together with hundreds of volunteers. Ten firefighting planes, including two from France, two from Turkey and one from Croatia, are operating in the area, as well as eight helicopters.\n\nThere are substantial reinforcements from the European Union.\n\n“Over 450 firefighters and seven airplanes from the EU have been operating in Greece as fires sprout across the country,” EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Janez Lenarcic tweeted early Sunday afternoon.\n\nIn the mountainous part of Rhodes, an active front of the wildfire, firefighters have been trying to stop the blaze from spreading to nearby dense forests.\n\nSouthwest of the resort of Kiotari, the main focus of Saturday’s evacuations, a trench was being dug to keep the fire from crossing a creek and threatening the village of Gennadi.\n\nThe weather remained hot in the Mediterranean country on Sunday. Before midday, temperatures had already reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Winds were low but are notoriously variable in Rhodes, as in other Greek islands.\n\nPeople held in hotels, gyms, conference centers\n\nSome of the evacuated, including tourists, are being accommodated in other hotels, gyms and a conference center. A shipping company has offered one of its ships for accommodation. Kotiadis, the travel agent, told The Associated Press that three ships were being used.\n\nFires broke out in other parts of the country\n\nFires broke out elsewhere in the country Sunday. The most serious one was on Evia, Greece’s second-largest island, where authorities told residents of four southern villages to evacuate to the town of Karystos, west of where the fire was advancing.\n\nCentral Greece Vice Governor Giorgos Kelaiditis, who was near one of the villages, told state agency ANA-MPA that the situation is difficult:\n\n“The fire may be 2 kilometers (1 1/4 miles) away, but the wind is strong, the growth is low, the smoke thick and the air is hard to breathe,” he said.\n\nNorthern Evia was devastated by wildfires in August 2021.\n\nAuthorities designated an unprecedentedly large part of the Greek mainland − the whole eastern part of central and southern Greece − plus Rhodes and Evia as at the highest level of risk for fire outbreaks as of Sunday. A further chunk of Greece was designated as at a very high risk for fires.\n\nTemperatures reached110 F in the capital, Athens, Sunday afternoon and 113 in the interior plains of central Greece.

It was still unclear how many people might be missing.\n\nAs the fire raged, whipped by ferocious winds, hundreds of people sought refuge on nearby beaches. But the intensity of the heat and the dense smoke forced many to swim out to sea.

Fanned by gale-force winds that frequently changed direction, the flames spread rapidly into populated seaside towns – too fast for many who were in their cars or homes to flee, fire department spokeswoman Stavroula Malliri said.\n\n“The police tried to direct us away from the fire, but we couldn’t escape it,” said Aleka Papariga, a former Greek Communist Party leader who lives near Rafina. “We got stuck in traffic and the flames were on top of us.

The coast guard said 19 people were rescued at sea, some of whom had swum out to escape the flames.\n\nRafina’s dock became a makeshift hospital during the night as paramedics checked survivors, some of them clad in only their bathing suits, emerging from coast guard vessels and private boats. The fire department said 156 adults and 16 children were hospitalized with injuries. Eleven of the adults were in serious condition.\n\nIn all, 47 brush and forest fires broke out across Greece Monday and early Tuesday, with most of them quickly extinguished, the fire department said. Ten were still burning late Tuesday morning, including blazes in Corinth, Crete, and in central and northern Greece.\n\nMore than 400 firefighters and volunteer firefighters were battling the two fires near Athens, supported by seven water-dropping helicopters and three aircraft.\n\nGreece sought international help through the European Union. Spain was sending two firefighting aircraft while Cyprus was sending in 60 firefighters.

He said the IMF office had received threatening phone calls in recent days but they were not necessarily linked to Thursday's incident.\n\nIMF director Christine Lagarde, who is French, said she was told about the explosion while on a trip to Germany.\n\n\"I condemn this cowardly act of violence and reaffirm the IMF's resolve to continue our work in line with our mandate,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe secretary who opened the letter was injured by shrapnel in the face and hurt in the eardrum because of a \"rather violent noise,\" the police chief said.\n\nPolice searched all four floors of the building, which also houses the World Bank office in France, Cadot said.

One of the largest fires was on the outskirts of Athens. It covered the sky over the capital in grey smoke and sent firefighting helicopters and airplanes rushing to the scene.\n\nThe number and intensity of the blazes forced the cash-strapped Greek government to ask for help from nearby countries, including — notably — Germany, the country many in Greece blame for insisting on the hard-line terms of the bailout plan. Germany is a major creditor of Greece.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who was forced to accept those harsh terms, reshuffled his cabinet Friday after 38 of 149 members of his ruling Syriza party — including two cabinet ministers and two deputies — refused to vote for the bailout package Wednesday. His left-wing party was elected in January on a pledge to resist new austerity demands, but Tsipras changed course this week after it became clear that the only alternative was national bankruptcy and ouster from the 19-nation zone that uses the euro.\n\nThe German parliament on Friday approved the bailout, Greece's third in five years. It requires Greece to raise taxes, slash spending on pensions and other government programs and sell off state-owned assets.\n\nThe plan also provides a $7.7 billion temporary loan from the European Central Bank. It includes around $1 billion to Greek banks, which are on the verge of running out of money.\n\nDeputy Finance Minister Dimitris Mardas announced Thursday that banks, which have been closed for nearly three weeks, would reopen on Monday.\n\nProblems will remain even after the banks open, as it is not clear how long the infusion of cash will last. “The new money will allow the banks to run normally for at least a week,” said Kostas Melas, a former banking executive who is now an international finance professor at Padeio University in Athens. “After that, it’s unclear.”\n\nMelas said the risk banks face is not that Greeks will pull their money out to send it abroad but that they will keep it at home in cash. While the banks have been closed, ATM withdrawals have been limited to about $66 a day. Movement of funds abroad also has been restricted.\n\nMany Greeks who saw the crisis coming and withdrew their assets from banks before limits were imposed have survived better than those who left their funds untouched.\n\n“I could see what was going to happen and so I started to withdraw money from my accounts in March,” said Stelios Stylianou, 34, a military engineer. “It’s about 10 months’ salary, all told, and I keep it in different places and use it when I need it.”\n\nIn many high-profile cases, wealthy Greeks moved millions of dollars off shore before the worst of the crisis, dealing a crippling blow to an already struggling financial system. Reports on their withdrawals have been a staple of news coverage.\n\n“One of the groups I’m most angry with is the elite who were allied with the former governments,” said Eleni Papadopoulou, 57, a public health worker. “Greece’s creditors have declared war on us, and the rich just move their money abroad and act as if they own the country.”\n\nStelios Adoniou, 36, who works as a laborer during the day and a chef at night, said, “The rich get away with everything in this country.”\n\nAnalysts say convincing Greek individuals and companies to put money back in the banking system will be a major obstacle.\n\nLiving with capped ATM withdrawals, reduced government services, and stores that are closed or running out of merchandise have taken a toll on people here. Making the situation worse is what many Greeks see as humiliating negotiations for the bailout package, which sparked violent protests in Athens and has given rise to anti-German and anti-European Union sentiment. The prevailing view is that unfeeling European creditors refused to make any concessions knowing that Greece was on the brink of economic collapse.\n\n“I could fill 500 pages with my feelings from the day of the vote,” said Konstantina Katramadou, a 63-year-old housewife, who added that she and her husband survive on his meager $460 a month pension. “The measures are unbearable. I don’t know how I’ll survive another reduction in my husband’s pension. But a reduction will come.”\n\nMichalis Babis, 45, who works for a company making wine and cheese, added: “I’ve spent so many hours following the news these last three weeks that it’s been a nightmare.”\n\n“I feel dispirited, numb, and confused,” said Adoniou, the laborer and chef. He said part of him opposes the austerity measures because they would mean more hardship but part of him favors them because otherwise, \"we would be finished as a country.\"\n\n\"Either way,\" he said, \"we are bankrupt.”\n\nLyman reported from Rome.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2021/09/27/deadly-crete-greece-island-earthquake/5880945001/", "title": "Earthquake in Greece damage: 1 dead, 9 injured in Crete", "text": "Elena Becatoros\n\nAssociated Press\n\nATHENS, Greece — An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of at least 5.8 struck the Greek island of Crete on Monday, killing one person and injuring several others, while damaging homes and churches and causing rock slides near the country's fourth-largest city.\n\nThe quake sent people fleeing into the streets in the city of Heraklion, and schools were evacuated.

But some residential areas around London were left in ruins after fires broke out across parts of the capital, stretching the fire service to its limits.\n\n“Yesterday was the busiest day for the fire service in London since the Second World War,” London’s mayor Sadiq Khan told Sky News on Wednesday, as residents of the capital watched their homes destroyed in heat-triggered blazes they never thought possible.\n\nA resident of Wennington, a London suburb affected by Tuesday’s fires, told CNN that the gardens on his street were “like a tinder box” in the days leading up to the fire. Stock lost his home, eight chickens and two beehives when the fire broke out.\n\n“I didn’t sleep last night. I was in the hotel room thinking how bad it could have gone. I just thank god that everyone got out alive,” he said. “We’ve lost everything. But when we get back, we can clear the site, put some fences up, get a couple of mobile homes and we’ll start again.”\n\nLondon had no available fire engines at one point in the afternoon amid unprecedented demand, a senior fireman with the London Fire Brigade’s special rescue team told CNN.\n\nIn the United States, local leaders are urging caution and issuing health warnings as a heat wave that shows no sign of slowing before the weekend continues to bake the south-central regions of the country.\n\nAnd in China, millions of densely-populated cities are responding to extreme heat.

Politicians today often rely on popular hits, but because that can imply a musician supports the candidate, some have asked politicians to stop playing their songs.\n\nIn many cases, such as John F. Kennedy’s use of Frank Sinatra’s “High Hopes” in 1960, artists approve the use of their music as a means of endorsing or at least subtly signaling their approval of the candidate. Other times, politicians use pop songs without such approval, leading to anger and dismay – especially in cases where the songwriter holds opposing political views.\n\nThis has been happening with not uncommon frequency going back to Bruce Springsteen’s disapproval of President Ronald Reagan’s use of “Born in the U.S.A.” in 1984. And it has happened frequently since President Donald Trump began holding rallies some three years ago.\n\nMore:Green Day's 'American Idiot' hits top of British charts in time for Trump's visit\n\nAlso:Bill and Hillary Clinton honor Fleetwood Mac: 'I owe them more than anything'\n\nCampaigns can procure blanket licenses from performing rights organizations such as the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers and Broadcast Music Inc.

Some emerged victorious, while others had less success.\n\n1. Abba\n\nSong: \"Take a Chance on Me\"\n\nPolitician: John McCain\n\nOutcome: McCain's campaign dropped the song after the Swedish band sent them a cease-and-desist letter.\n\n2.

Elton John\n\nSong: \"Rocket Man,\" \"Tiny Dancer\"\n\nPolitician: Donald Trump\n\nOutcome: Trump admires Elton John. He even referenced one of the British singer's songs by disparagingly calling North Korean leader Kim Jong-un \"Rocket Man.\" John has known the president for decades, but he turned down Trump's invitation to perform at his inauguration. John also had asked that his songs not be used during the 2016 presidential campaign but Trump continues to use songs such as \"Tiny Dancer\" at political rallies.\n\n13.

Heart\n\nSong: \"Barracuda\"\n\nPolitician: Sarah Palin\n\nOutcome: \"Barracuda\" was one of Heart's biggest hits, and Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin – whose nickname was \"Sarah Barracuda\" in high school – used the song at campaign rallies in 2008.

John Mellencamp\n\nSong: \"Pink Houses,\" \"R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.\"\n\nPolitician: Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, John McCain\n\nOutcome: The heartland rocker rejected three Republican candidates. The 1984 Reagan presidential campaign wanted to use \"Pink Houses,\" and Mellencamp was opposed. He also asked Bush not to include \"R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.\" in 2000. McCain used the Mellencamp tunes \"Our Country\" and \"Pink Houses\" during the 2008 presidential race until the rocker requested that McCain stop.\n\n19. Journey\n\nSong: \"Don't Stop Believin' \"\n\nPolitician: Newt Gingrich\n\nOutcome: Gingrich used \"Don't Stop Believin' \" during political events in 2011.

K'naan\n\nSong: \"Wavin' Flag\"\n\nPolitician: Mitt Romney\n\nOutcome: The Romney campaign was threatened with legal action by representatives of the Somali-Canadian artist during the 2012 presidential race.

Katrina and the Waves\n\nSong: \"Walking on Sunshine\"\n\nPolitician: Michele Bachmann\n\nOutcome: Katrina Leskanich, lead singer of the British-American band, asked the Minnesota congresswoman in 2011 to refrain from using the group's biggest hit at campaign rallies and also threatened legal action. But Bachmann continued to use it.\n\n22. MGMT\n\nSong: \"Kids\"\n\nPolitician: Nicolas Sarkozy\n\nOutcome: It's not only American politicians who run afoul of artists when using their music without their permission.

Neil Young\n\nSong: \"Rockin' in the Free World\"\n\nPolitician: Donald Trump\n\nOutcome: Trump used \"Rockin' in the Free World\" when he announced he was running for president in 2015.

Orleans\n\nSong: \"Still the One\"\n\nPolitician: George W. Bush, John McCain\n\nOutcome: During his 2004 re-election campaign, Bush drew the ire of John Hall, who co-wrote the soft-rockers' 1976 hit.

McCain, who also used the song, ignored cease-and-desist letters in 2008.\n\n25. R.E.M.\n\nSong: \"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\"\n\nPolitician: Donald Trump\n\nOutcome: The Georgia rockers did not feel fine about Trump using their stream-of-consciousness take on the news on the campaign trail in 2015. Lead singer Michael Stipe launched an expletive-laced reaction when Trump walked out to the tune at a Tea Party event, and the band asked him to not use it. Apparently, R.E.M. never pursued legal recourse. In a Facebook post, the band said it did not \"authorize or condone the use of our music.\"\n\n26. The Rolling Stones\n\nSong: \"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\" \"Sympathy for the Devil,\" \"Brown Sugar\"\n\nPolitician: Donald Trump\n\nOutcome: While the Stones repeatedly asked Trump not to play their songs, they eventually accepted that at some point there was no way to stop him as he held the legal rights to do so.\n\n27. Rush\n\nSong: \"Tom Sawyer,\" \"The Spirit of Radio\"\n\nPolitician: Rand Paul\n\nOutcome: The Canadian rock band asked 2010 Senate nominee Paul to stop playing their music at rallies.

Sam & Dave\n\nSong: \"Hold On I'm Coming\"\n\nPolitician: Barack Obama\n\nOutcome: Democrats have been asked to stop playing music as well. In 2008, Sam Moore of Sam & Dave asked Obama to refrain from playing his \"Hold On I'm Coming\" for fear it would look like the singer had endorsed the candidate. The Obama campaign agreed to stop.\n\n29. Silversun Pickups\n\nSong: \"Panic Switch\"\n\nPolitician: Mitt Romney\n\nOutcome: The Silversun Pickups' song was reportedly played once as a Romney rally was being set up, yet this was enough to push the band to send a cease-and-desist letter. The Romney campaign maintained that they had the rights to play the song, but despite this they didn't play it again.\n\n30. Sting\n\nSong: \"Brand New Day\"\n\nPolitician: Al Gore, George W.

Bush, John McCain, Michele Bachmann\n\nOutcome: While Petty was able to prevent both Bush and McCain from using his songs, presidential candidate Bachmann was less willing to back down, playing \"American Girl\" even after receiving a cease-and-desist letter.\n\n34. Twisted Sister\n\nSong: \"We're Not Gonna Take It\"\n\nPolitician: Paul Ryan, Donald Trump\n\nOutcome: In response to a harsh statement from Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider over Ryan's one-time use of their 1984 hit, the campaign told Politico, \"We're Not Gonna Play It anymore.\"\n\nSnider achieved similar results by quietly asking Trump (the two are said to be friends) to abstain from playing the song at rallies.\n\n35. Van Halen\n\nSong: \"Right Now\"\n\nPolitician: John McCain\n\nOutcome: While singer Sammy Hagar said he was honored a presidential candidate used his words, bandmates Eddie and Alex Van Halen issued a statement clarifying that they had not given permission for McCain to use the song. McCain continued using the song regardless.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/05/10/donald-trump-trial-news-hush-money-case-live-updates/73635879007/", "title": "Trump trial recap: Judge wants Michael Cohen to stop comments on ...", "text": "Judge Juan Merchan told prosecutors to ask Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen to stop commenting publicly on Trump or the former president's criminal hush money trial on Friday afternoon. Trump's lawyers argued that it was unfair to Trump that he is under a gag order not to talk about the participation of potential witnesses such as Cohen, but Cohen is free to talk about him.\n\nEarlier in the day, Merchan ruled in favor of the defense team when he barred the prosecution from showing jurors a video of Trump boasting in 1999 about his knowledge about campaign finance laws. Prosecutors wanted to use the video to demonstrate that Trump knew Cohen's hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels was an illegal contribution to his 2016 campaign, but Merchan agreed with Trump's lawyer that the video was too old.\n\nOn Friday, jurors were shown a series of 2016 text messages between Daniels' former manager, Gina Rodriguez, and ex-editor of the National Enquirer, Dylan Howard. The messages included Rodriguez telling Howard that Daniels was Trump's mistress and Howard responding that he bet she was.\n\nKeep up with USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courtroom:\n\nTrump: lack of gag order on Michael Cohen a ‘disgrace’\n\nFormer President Donald Trump complained after leaving the courtroom for the week that Judge Juan Merchan hadn’t put a gag order on his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, who is expected to be a key witness next week.\n\nCohen has been harshly critical of Trump since being imprisoned for lying on his behalf and for paying $130,000 to porn actress Stormy Daniels to remain quiet before the 2016 election. She testified about allegedly having sex with Trump while he was married in 2006.\n\nTrump has bristled about Cohen and Daniels insulting him through social media while he was unable to respond. Trump’s lawyer, Todd Blanche, asked Merchan to gag Cohen.\n\n“There is no gag order to Michael Cohen,” Trump said. “Everybody can say whatever they want, they can say whatever they want, but I’m not allowed to say anything about anybody. It’s a disgrace.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMichael Cohen to be asked to stop talking about Trump case\n\nJust before the early end of proceedings today, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche asked Judge Juan Merchan to issue a gag order against former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who is expected to testify next week. Blanche argued Merchan has the ability to do that for witnesses as well as for a criminal defendant.\n\nBlanche said the order should instruct Cohen not to talk about Trump or the case until the case is over. He argued it's unfair that Cohen can attack Trump and Trump, because of the gag order he is under, isn't allowed to respond.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass said his team has repeatedly told all witnesses, not just Cohen, to refrain from making public statements. Because they aren't under a gag order, the prosecution has \"no remedy\" if the witnesses keep talking anyway, Steinglass said. \"We have already asked. We have no power to order,\" Steinglass added.\n\n\"I would direct the People to communicate to Mr. Cohen that the judge is asking him to refrain from making any more statements about this case\" or about Mr. Trump, Merchan told the prosecution team. He said to tell Cohen that message \"comes from the bench\" and that the prosecution is \"communicating that on behalf of the bench.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge wants prosecutors to try to call Allen Weisselberg to testify\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy said the prosecution is willing – if the defense agreed to it – to simply tell jurors former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg is in jail for perjury. That would be \"one way to solve the problem,\" Conroy added.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan smirked at that. The defense didn't indicate it would agree.\n\nMerchan didn't issue a ruling on whether prosecutors may introduce the agreement involving Weisselberg into evidence. But he said it would be helpful to his decision and \"a factor\" if he could see that some efforts were made to compel Weisselberg to testify.\n\nMerchan worried that there was a desire to \"jump the gun\" by explaining why Weisselberg is not at the trial without trying to get him here. He suggested prosecutors could put Weisselberg on the stand outside of the jury's presence to establish whether his testimony is or isn't available.\n\n\"Let me think about it,\" Merchan also said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecution and Trump team fight over Weisselberg evidence\n\nThe prosecution and defense have been arguing over whether the judge should allow jurors to learn about an agreement involving Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg. Weisselberg is currently serving a five-month jail term for committing perjury in Trump's New York civil fraud case.\n\nThe agreement wasn't shown to the audience in the courtroom, but prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said the agreement seems to put Weisselberg at risk of losing $750,000 in severance pay if he speaks to the prosecution.\n\nProsecutors want to introduce the agreement to explain why Weisselberg isn't testifying in this trial.\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove argued the agreement isn't relevant and creates undue prejudice for Trump. He said if either the prosecution or the defense called Weisselberg as a witness, Weisselberg \"would likely invoke.\" That may have been a reference to invoking the constitutional right against self-incrimination.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhen will Trump trial end?\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass said the prosecution expects to call potentially two witnesses, and that it's \"entirely possible\" the prosecution will rest its case by the end of next week.\n\nMerchan has already announced there won't be proceedings on Friday, May 17, to allow Trump to attend his youngest son Barron Trump's high school graduation.\n\nIt's the defense's choice whether to put on its own defense once the prosecution rests. There will still be closing arguments in the case and jury deliberations before a verdict.\n\nBefore the trial started, a court media advisory estimated the trial would last between six and eight weeks.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge invites lawyers to make jury instruction requests\n\nJurors have been dismissed for the day, but Judge Juan Merchan is continuing to discuss issues with the jurors. Merchan said he will hold a conference with the lawyers later to go over the instructions he will ultimately give to the jurors before they begin their deliberations. But Merchan invited the lawyers to start bringing to his attention any requests for special instructions.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJarmel-Schneider's testimony ends\n\nParalegal Jarmel-Schneider's testimony has concluded. Trump lawyer Emil Bove's cross-examination went into some records being excluded in the prosecution's presentation of evidence to jurors.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJurors and audience laugh at paralegal enjoying 'tedious work'\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove has begun cross-examining Jarmel-Schneider. He asked the paralegal if his preparation of summary documents for jurors was \"tedious work\"? Jarmel-Schneider said it \"could be,\" but \"honestly, I kind of enjoyed it.\" Many people chuckled or laughed in the courtroom, including several jurors.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nChart shows invoices, vouchers, and checks for each count in Trump indictment\n\nJarmel-Schneider testified about a chart that has been shown to show jurors. It contains the invoices, vouchers, and checks that the prosecution says are linked to each count in the 34-count indictment against Trump.\n\nThere are 11 invoices associated with the 34 counts as well as one voucher for every month in 2017, Jarmel-Schneider. There are also checks associated with 11 of the counts in the indictment, he said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecution providing summaries of phone calls to jurors\n\nJarmel-Schneider described summaries that have been prepared for jurors of calls between many people associated with this case, as well as calls involving the Trump Organization. Here's the full list of those involved in the calls:\n\nMichael Cohen\n\nKeith Davidson\n\nHope Hicks\n\nDylan Howard\n\nDavid Pecker\n\nKeith Schiller\n\nAllen Weisselberg\n\nGina Rodriguez\n\nTrump Organization\n\nDonald Trump\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWitness Jaden Jarmel-Schneider prepared documents on phone calls\n\nThe prosecution has called Jaden Jarmel-Schneider, another paralegal in its office. Jarmel-Schneider said he prepared documents designed to give the jury a sense of how the prosecution figured out which phone numbers are associated with which people when it comes to call records in the case.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJurors see texts between Stormy Daniels' manager and National Enquirer editor\n\nJurors were shown a series of 2016 text messages between Stormy Daniels' former manager, Gina Rodriguez, and ex-editor of the National Enquirer, Dylan Howard.\n\nThe messages included Rodriguez telling Howard that Stormy Daniels was Trump's mistress and Howard responding that he bet she was.\n\nRodriguez also said to Howard that Daniels didn't want to go on the record with her story – meaning put her name behind the story – but would tell the story through a separate source.\n\nRodriguez said Daniels had sex with Trump and wanted $100,000. Rodriguez said Trump had promised Daniels a condo and a spot on The Apprentice, but never did anything for her. She said Daniels met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJurors see Trump tweets on 'fine person' Michael Cohen\n\nLongstreet testified about a series of tweets Trump posted on April 21, 2018 about his former lawyer, Michael Cohen. Trump said The New York Times and its reporter, Maggie Haberman, were \"going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will 'flip.'\"Trump described Cohen as \"a fine person with a wonderful family,\" and someone \"who I have always liked & respected.\n\n\"Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble even if ... it means lying or making up stories. Sorry I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!\" Trump also posted.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nGeorgia Longstreet, Manhattan DA paralegal, testifying\n\nGeorgia Longstreet, a paralegal in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office, has taken the stand for the second time in this trial. She testified earlier about several Trump social media posts.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge sides with Trump on excluding 1999 campaign finance comments\n\nAfter a short morning break, Judge Merchan said he's siding with the defense team over whether the prosecution can show jurors a video of Trump commenting in 1999 on his knowledge about campaign finance laws. Merchan expressed concerns about how old the comments are, saying they ask a jury to draw an inference about Trump's knowledge many years later, and \"that's a lot of speculation.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump wants his old comments on campaign finance laws kept out of trial\n\nJust before a short morning break was taken, Trump lawyer Emil Bove asked Judge Merchan about excluding from evidence a 1999 video of Trump commenting on campaign finance laws.\n\n“I think nobody knows more about campaign finance than I do because I’m the biggest contributor,” Trump said at the time.\n\nBove argued that, whatever Trump said in 1999 about his knowledge of campaign finance laws doesn't prove something relevant about his knowledge in 2017, because there were extensive changes to those laws in the interim.\n\nProsecutor Rebecca Mangold responded that the corporate contribution ban, which she said is the relevant legal provision when it comes to the video, has been part of campaign finance law since 1907. She added that's close to 100 years before Trump's \"admission in that video.\"\n\nMerchan said he will rule later.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nAllen Weisselberg phone records introduced\n\nThe prosecution got phone records introduced into the evidence through their latest witness, Verizon employee Jennie Tomalin. The records state that they are associated with Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. Weisselberg is currently incarcerated for committing perjury during Trump's New York civil fraud trial.\n\nThe prosecution and defense only had brief questions for Tomalin, focused on how to read the records. She has now left the witness stand.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Jennie Tomalin?\n\nJennie Tomalin has been called to the witness stand. She is a Verizon employee who also appears to have been brought to testify so the prosecution can introduce phone records into evidence.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nRick Scott defends Donald Trump outside the courtroom\n\nRick Scott, a Republican senator up for reelection in Florida, attended the trial Thursday. While Trump remains under a gag order, his allies in the GOP do not face the same restrictions. Scott stood by Trump as he addressed reporters outside Manhattan criminal court, suggesting the lead prosecutor has political motivations.\n\n“I’m here because I’ve known Donald Trump a long time. I knew him before I was governor. I consider him a friend. And what he is going through is just despicable,” Scott said.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nDixon confirms phone records don't show who did the talking, if call was pocket dial\n\nAsked by Trump lawyer Emil Bove if the AT&T records show who was speaking during a phone call, Dixon confirmed they don't. Dixon also agreed they don't show if a call was an unintended \"pocket dial.\"\n\nBove ended his cross-examination soon after that, and the prosecution had no further questions for Dixon.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nStormy Daniels knocks Trump on X, saying real men take a stand in court\n\nPorn star Stormy Daniels, who gave riveting testimony this week about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump in his hush money trial, fired back at the former president on X, formerly Twitter, after his legal team’s request for a mistrial based on her testimony was denied twice.\n\n“Real men respond to testimony by being sworn in and taking the stand in court. Oh…wait. Nevermind,” Daniels wrote on X.\n\nThe tweet also comes after Trump lawyer Todd Blanche asked Judge Juan Merchan to modify Trump’s gag order so he could respond to Daniels’ testimony. Merchan also denied that request.\n\nTrump has previously attacked Daniels, calling her “horseface” and a “sleaze bag.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove questioning AT&T witness\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove is now asking Dixon questions on cross-examination.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nAT&T witness helps prosecutors introduce phone records\n\nThe prosecution quickly ended its questions for Dixon, which appear geared toward getting evidence of phone records admitted. The phone records involve former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who the prosecution indicated in opening statements will be testifying in the trial.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Daniel Dixon?\n\nA new witness, Daniel Dixon, has been called to the witness stand. He is a lead compliance analyst who helps with complying with legal demands at AT&T.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWesterhout talked with Trump's lawyer Wednesday night\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles ended her cross-examination and prosecutor Rebecca Mangold noted Necheles hadn't asked Westerhout if she had spoken with Necheles before. Mangold then posed that question to Westerhout, who said she spoke with Necheles once before, on Wednesday night.\n\nThat question may have been designed to plant the idea in the jury's mind that Westerhout is friendly with the defense team, including in the run-up to her testimony, even though she is a witness called by the prosecution.\n\nWhen Mangold finished her brief follow-up questions for Westerhout, Necheles asked Westerhout whether she had met with the prosecution previously. Westerhout said she has met with the prosecution three times, has met with them for hours, and the most recent meeting was Wednesday morning.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWesterhout statement about Stormy Daniels and Trump's concern for family stricken from court record\n\nWesterhout testified that her memory of Trump's reaction to a story that Stormy Daniels got a hush money deal concerning him is \"that he was very upset by it.\" Westerhout added: \"He knew it would be hurtful to his family.\"\n\nHowever, Westerhout also said: \"I don't believe he specifically said that, but I could just tell the whole situation was very unpleasant.\" Prosecutor Rebecca Mangold then objected to Westerhout's testimony, likely based on her not having a proper foundation to say Trump was upset because he knew the story was hurtful to his family. Judge Merchan sustained the objection and struck Westerhout's answer from the court record.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWesterhout says long-time Trump Organization assistant careful with Trump's money\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles asked Westerhout whether it was true that Rhona Graff, Trump's long-time assistant at the Trump Organization, was \"very careful about not wanting to spend the president's money without his approval.\" Westerhout agreed that was true, and that Trump would often times approve expenses for Graff simply by writing \"Pay.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWesterhout's lawyer showed her materials this morning that Trump lawyer is asking about\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles is asking Westerhout about some materials that haven't been shown to the jury. Prosecutor Rebecca Mangold interjected to ask about Westerhout's familiarity with them. Westerhout said she was familiar and, on further questioning, explained that her lawyer showed them to her this morning. Yesterday, Westerhout said she has counsel who is representing her for free in this trial.\n\nIt's unclear why Westerhout's lawyer reviewed materials with her this morning that Trump's defense is now asking her about.\n\nFollowing Westerhout's statement about the review this morning, Mangold objected to Trump's team introducing the evidence. After a private conversation between the lawyers and Judge Merchan at the bench, Merchan said he was denying Trump's motion to introduce the evidence.\n\nQuestioning has now moved on.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nLawyers in lengthy private conversation with judge\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles has begun cross-examining Madeleine Westerhout again today, but the lawyers just had a lengthy private conversation with the judge at his bench.\n\nThe conversation followed prosecutor Rebecca Mangold making an objection, after Necheles and Westerhout were talking about Trump sending a photo to Allen Weisselberg of Trump boarding Air Force One for the first time. Weisselberg is the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, and is currently incarcerated for committing perjury in Trump's New York civil fraud trial that began in the fall.\n\nThe Air Force One photo was discussed yesterday when the prosecution was asking questions.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump ignores questions about whether he will testify\n\nFormer President Donald Trump ignored shouted questions from reporters outside the courtroom about whether he would testify at his New York hush money trial.\n\nBut he promoted a Saturday political rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, where he said he would be able to campaign for president despite the “horrible gag order” that prevents him from commenting on witnesses or jurors participating in the case.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMerchan rejects Trump subpoena request for former prosecutor as ‘fishing expedition’\n\nJudge Juan Merchan rejected a request from Trump’s defense team to subpoena Mark Pomerantz, a former prosecutor who criticized District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s handling of the investigation, calling it an illegitimate “fishing expedition.”\n\nPomerantz complained that Bragg was reluctant to pursue charges, although a grand jury eventually indicted Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide a hush money payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump has argued that other investigators, including Bragg’s predecessor as district attorney and the Justice Department, declined to press charges after reviewing the same evidence.\n\nMerchan ruled that Trump’s request was too broad and sought evidence that he’s not allowed to have about how prosecutors prepared their case.\n\n“Defendant's Second and Third Requests are far too broad and amount to an improper fishing expedition into general discovery,” Merchan ruled.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWill Karen McDougal testify?\n\nThe prosecution said Thursday that Karen McDougal won't testify. McDougal is a former Playboy model who was paid $150,000 from the parent company of the National Enquirer, in a deal to stay quiet ahead of the 2016 election about an alleged Trump affair.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nAmericans views on sex work could affect Stormy Daniels’ credibility\n\nAmerican society’s strong puritanical roots have long kept sex and sex work taboo subjects, despite a widespread use of pornography. However, experts say Americans’ perceptions are beginning to change, which could make a difference in how credible they view Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe percentage of Americans who found pornography morally acceptable jumped from 36% in 2017 to 43% in 2018, according to a Gallup poll. That number remained relatively flat at 41% in 2022.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Trump’s lawyer Susan Necheles referenced Daniels’ occupation to challenge her credibility. “You have a lot of experience in making phony stories about sex appear to be real,” Necheles said.\n\n“That’s not how I would put it,” Daniels replied. “The sex in the films is very much real, just like what happened to me in that room.”\n\n– Charles Trepany and Rachel Barber\n\nWho is Susan Necheles?\n\nSusan Necheles is a seasoned New York criminal defense lawyer and former prosecutor. She cross-examined Stormy Daniels earlier this week, and she is also due to continue cross-examining former White House aide Madeleine Westerhout later today.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nIs Trump on trial today?\n\nYes. Proceedings in Trump's trial are scheduled to start at 9:30 a.m. EDT. Madeleine Westerhout, a former White House aide, is slated to re-take the witness stand for more cross-examination by Trump lawyer Susan Necheles.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat is Stormy Daniels' real name? Stephanie Clifford.\n\nStormy Daniels' real name is Stephanie Clifford. When she introduced herself in court earlier this week, as all witnesses do when they take the stand, she called herself Stormy Daniels. On questioning by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger, she acknowledged that her real name is Stephanie Clifford, but said she prefers to go by Stormy Daniels at the proceedings.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhy does Stormy Daniels owe Trump money?\n\nA California judge ordered Stormy Daniels to pay Trump's legal fees after she filed a defamation lawsuit against him. She testified that her former lawyer, Michael Avenatti, wanted to file the lawsuit. He is now in prison for embezzlement and other crimes.\n\nThe defamation claim Daniels made wasn't based on her and Trump's dispute over whether they had sex in 2006. It had to do with a Trump tweet about a sketch of a different man who Daniels said threatened her in a parking lot in 2011 to keep quiet about Trump.\n\nTrump has sued Daniels in Florida to get the money, but she still hasn't paid, she testified.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Madeleine Westerhout?\n\nMadeleine Westerhout served as an assistant to Donald Trump during the beginning of his presidency before becoming director of Oval Office operations.\n\nWesterhout broke down crying on the witness stand Thursday as she described being fired from her last role in the White House. Westerhout got in trouble for making off-the-record comments to reporters about Trump's children that the then-president described as \"hurtful.\"\n\nThe prosecution had Westerhout show jurors where she used to work on a map of the White House – she sat in a room adjacent to the Oval Office. She testified Thursday that she was involved in the process of receiving checks from the Trump Organization that required Trump's signature. Some of the allegedly falsified records in Trump's hush money case are checks prosecutors say Trump signed as he paid his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, while he allegedly misdescribed what the checks were for.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nStormy Daniels’ depiction in courtroom sketches captures attention\n\nStormy Daniels' testimony in Donald Trump’s hush money trial Tuesday included plenty of details but it was the court artist's sketch of the former adult film star that captured the internet's attention.\n\nMany agreed that she looked older in the drawing than she actually looked, while others poked fun at Daniels outright.\n\nThere seemed to be a difference between the way the sketch artist thought Daniels looked and how everyone else saw her, a difference noted by several people across multiple posts on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n– Amaris Encinas, Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhy did Trump ask for a mistrial and to change the gag order?\n\nOn Thursday, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche made zealous pleas for a mistrial and for a modified gag order based on Stormy Daniels' testimony. He said that some of her testimony was basically a \"dog whistle for rape\" – even though Daniels insisted she hadn't been physically threatened.\n\nBlanche pointed to portions of Daniels' testimony where she described feeling light-headed, being aware of a power imbalance, and knowing Trump's bodyguard was nearby.\n\nBlanche also characterized parts of Daniels' story as \"completely different in kind\" from earlier accounts – a claim the prosecution disputed.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan said he wouldn't modify the gag order because he's concerned not just about witnesses who have already testified, but also about potential witnesses who could see Trump's attacks on others and be impacted. He described Trump's comments about people tied to his legal cases as \"vitriol,\" adding: \"Your client's track record speaks for itself.\"\n\nMerchan also said Blanche made Daniels' credibility an issue when he called her claims about a sexual encounter false during his opening statement. The prosecution had the right to rehabilitate her credibility by going into her story after Blanche had \"immediately attacked it,\" Merchan said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat did Stormy Daniels say in court?\n\nStormy Daniels showed Thursday that she's no shrinking violet, even as she was hammered by an aggressive cross-examination. Trump lawyer Susan Necheles tried to portray Daniels' story as changing between iterations, and portray Daniels herself as money-grubbing.\n\nDaniels pushed back as Necheles raised possible inconsistencies in her story, such as Daniels saying Trump approached her about dinner in one telling, and that Trump's bodyguard approached her on Trump's behalf in another. Daniels replied that Trump and his bodyguard are a unit.\n\nWhen Daniels characterized her decision to participate in a hush money deal in 2016 as about staying safe, Necheles said it was really about Daniels' bottom line.\n\n\"You chose to make money, right?\" Necheles said.\n\n\"I chose to take the non-disclosure,\" Daniels responded.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/15/donald-trump-kamala-harris-nj/74815983007/", "title": "Trump says he's 'entitled' to knock Harris: Press conference takeaways", "text": "WASHINGTON – Former President Donald Trump acknowledged Thursday that he has launched personal attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris as they fight for control of the White House – and claimed they are justified.\n\n\"I think I'm entitled to personal attacks,\" Trump said during a news conference at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club that was slated to focus on the economy and the cost of living.\n\nFlanked by tables stacked with groceries, Trump did hit President Joe Biden and Harris' handling of the American economy. But he also leveled personal insults against his 2024 rival – and used demeaning language to address immigrants in the United States.\n\nHere are USA TODAY's top takeaways from the former president's news conference.\n\n'I'm very angry at her'\n\nTrump said he is \"angry\" at Harris over the Biden administration's handling of issues ranging from inflation to immigration. He also claimed – without evidence – that she is involved in the criminal cases pending against him, as well as his May conviction in his New York hush money case.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nWhile people \"tell me I should be nice,\" Trump said Harris, Biden and other Democrats \"want to put me in prison.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to face sentencing in his hush money case next month. The former president also faces criminal cases in Washington, D.C., and Atlanta over alleged efforts to steal the 2020 election from Biden, though the timing in both cases are uncertain. There is no evidence that Harris or Biden have been involved in his indictments.\n\n“I don’t have a lot of respect for her intelligence and I think she’ll be a terrible president,” Trump added on Thursday.\n\nFor days, fellow Republicans have urged Trump to focus on issues against Harris, not personalities; they said his slashing attacks are among the reasons Harris has pulled ahead of Trump in several polls since Biden's withdrawal from the race. Trump also faced sweeping backlash after questioning the vice president's racial identity during an appearance last month.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said on Fox News this week that the Trump campaign needs to stop \"whining.\"\n\n\"The campaign is not going to win talking about crowd sizes,\" Haley said. \"It's not going to win talking about what race Kamala Harris is. It's not going to win talking about whether she's dumb ... you can't win on those things. The American people are smart. Treat them like they're smart.\"\n\nResponding to the news conference, the Harris campaign didn't have kind words for the former president. It issued a written statement mocking \"whatever that was.\"\n\nTrump \"huffed and puffed\" while utilizing \"his usual lies and delusions,\" said Harris campaign spokesperson James Singer.\n\nTrue or false? Sign up for USA TODAY's Checking the Facts newsletter.\n\nEconomy, cost of living fights\n\nTrump did spend time criticizing the economic record of the Biden-Harris administration, including over inflation and supply chain issues.\n\nTrump conducted the news conference a day before Harris is scheduled to a give a major economic address, including a proposal for a first-ever federal ban on price-gouging from food and grocery industries.\n\nAsked about that proposal, Trump did not respond directly but instead knocked Harris for opposing fracking. He also accused Harris of wanting to put \"price controls all over the place, which will end up driving up your prices, not down your prices.\"\n\nTrump also referred to the rising prices of the groceries arrayed around him, from loaves of bread and Oreos to Fruit Loops and other breakfast cereals. Trump joked that be planned to take some Cheerios back to his cottage at Bedminster.\n\nAmericans have struggled with rising prices in recent years, but inflation rates have dropped. The Labor Department announced Wednesday that the 12-month inflation rate had fallen to 2.9%, its lowest level since 2021. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2%. Food prices were up 2.2% on the year. Energy prices were up 1.1%, and gasoline prices were down.\n\nImmigration\n\nTrump also spoke at length about another favored topic, illegal border crossings, although he used exaggeration and impossible math.\n\nAt one point, Trump claimed that \"virtually 100%\" of net job creation in the last year has gone to migrants – and \"actually beyond the number of 100%.\"\n\nHe also falsely said that Harris \"allowed at least 20 million people to invade our country, and she wants to give them all citizenship and free government health care and let them raid Medicare and Social Security.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security estimated that 11 million unauthorized immigrants live in the U.S. as of January 2022.

He accused Democrats of stealing the 2020 election, mocked the media and referred to COVID-19 as the \"China virus.\"\n\nThe beginning of the speech stood out for a candidate whose rhetoric has long been criticized as divisive or harsh, speaking of carnage. For days, his friends, family and colleagues have said the attempt on his life fundamentally changed him.\n\nRep. Jay Obernolte, R-Calif., said he believes the shooting has given Trump some perspective.\n\n\"He just had a near-death experience, and I think that will make anyone introspective about what the job of a leader is. I don't think it's inauthentic at all for him to say: This has gone too far. We need to put our country back together. And political violence is something that is an extreme that should never be resorted to,\" Obernolte told USA TODAY.\n\nThe final night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee was a mishmash of familial anecdotes, riffs off the prewritten speech and former pro wrester Hulk Hogan ripping his shirt off on stage.\n\nPerforming in front of screens displaying flames licking at the American flag, singer Kid Rock called Trump \"the most patriotic American badass on Earth.\"\n\nThe crowd was energized. Jubilant delegates waved signs with slogans including “Fire Joe Biden,” “America First Means Americans First,” \"Trump=success, Biden=failure\" and “Bring Back Common Sense.”\n\nThe Texas delegation waved cream cowboy hats in sync with the band. California's delegates wore special-edition gold Make America Great Again hats. Not to be outdone, the Wisconsin delegation wore cheesehead hats.\n\nRuth Streck, 73, of Wisconsin, had such a hat perched on her head as she waited for Trump's speech.\n\n\"I think he is a voice for regular people,\" she said. \"And we need more of that, not kowtowing to the lobbyists or the fat cats.\"\n\nSofter image for Trump?\n\nThe campaign's attempt to show a softer side of Trump after the shooting continued Thursday night as speaker after speaker told personal anecdotes.

Barron Trump did not appear Thursday.\n\nThey missed the official nomination of Trump and his first appearance in the convention hall Monday night, just two days after he was shot at a political rally in Pennsylvania, and they haven't spoken or appeared at any of the events around the convention.\n\nSpeaker calls for Biden to fire the secret service director\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he called the White House on Thursday morning to ask President Joe Biden to fire Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle after the assassination attempt on Trump.\n\nJohnson did not get to speak with the president, he said in an interview at an event hosted by CNN and Politico.\n\nSecurity was tight at the convention after Saturday's shooting. A group of U.S. senators confronted and then chased Cheatle on Wednesday at the convention, demanding answers.\n\nLawmakers will receive a classified briefing next week from the Secret Service and the FBI about the shooting, but Johnson called on the administration to declassify classified information for the American public to know.\n\n“If you let questions hover over this, it’s a dangerous thing,” Johnson said, noting that conspiracy theories can “flourish.”\n\nEyes on Biden/Harris despite RNC wrap-up\n\nDespite it being the last day the national spotlight is fixed on the Republicans' convention, attention already was shifting to the question of whether Biden would stay on the ticket or bow to mounting pressure from Democratic leaders to step aside and let a new candidate take on Trump.\n\nThe conversation is expected to continue behind closed doors as Biden is ensconced with family in Rehoboth Beach and recovering from COVID-19.\n\nMore:Brutal split screen: Biden holed up with COVID while Trump accepts nomination\n\nIn recent days, Democratic House and Senate leaders have been speaking directly with Biden about polling that shows decreasing odds of winning the House or holding control of the Senate if he stays in the race.\n\nOne of the first Democrats to call for Biden to drop out, Rep.

The performing arts center is in the heart of downtown Miami with a seating capacity of 2,400 people.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThe NBC News Republican Primary Debate with partners Salem Radio Network and the Republican Jewish Coalition streamed live on NBCNews.com and Rumble.\n\n\"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker, \"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Lester Holt and radio host Hugh Hewitt moderated.\n\nFact-checking the 3rd GOP debate:What Haley, DeSantis, others got right (and wrong)\n\nWho won the debate? The front-runners sound off after 3rd face-off\n\nAfter the debate, the Biden campaign excoriated the Republican field, nodding to Tuesday’s election night which saw sweeping losses for Republican candidates and issues in states across the country.\n\n“Normally, after you lose, you take a moment to reflect and course correct. But in Donald Trump’s MAGA Republican Party, apparently you double down on the same extreme agenda that was soundly rejected last night in elections across the country. That’s what we witnessed tonight,” reads a written statement attributed to Biden’s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez.\n\nThe Trump campaign took the opportunity to dismiss the former president’s GOP challengers.\n\n“Unless you’re a fan of cheap knockoffs or out-of-tune tribute bands, tonight’s GOP debate was a complete waste of time and money,” Chris LaCivita, a top campaign adviser, said in a written statement.\n\nThe statement also appeared to strike a threatening tone toward DeSantis and Haley, saying that the two “need to get serious about their rapidly eroding political futures.”\n\n“It’s up to DeSantis and Haley to determine if they want a political future … or not,” the statement said.\n\n— Laura Gersony\n\nCandidates try to outdo each other on border security, shrug off diplomatic concerns\n\nThough it has been a major campaign issue among Republicans, immigration was not discussed in depth until near the end of the third Republican debate, when the candidates were asked how they would curb the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nFentanyl is a leading source of American drug overdose deaths, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.\n\nScott and Christie, first to answer, laid out similar plans. Both called for modernizing the technology used to monitor ports of entry, a move that has garnered bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, and said that addressing Americans’ mental health issues is needed to curb demand for those drugs.\n\nChristie also said that he would sign an executive order that would send in the National Guard to partner with Customs and Border Patrol agents, who he said are “overwhelmed” by encounters at the border.\n\n“We simply do not have the man and woman power at the border to be able to deal with it,” Christie said.\n\nDeSantis was asked for specifics about his plan to shoot drug smugglers “stone-cold dead” as they cross the border, an oft-repeated line from the Florida governor’s stump speech. DeSantis ran through a laundry list of hard-line policies, including sending the U.S. military to the border, imposing fees on remittances that foreign workers send home, deporting undocumented migrants, and designating cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations “or something similar to that.”\n\nHaley, who served as ambassador to the U.N. under Trump, was asked what her U.N. colleagues would think of U.S. military action in Mexico without giving that government prior notice. Some Democratic lawmakers have argued the move would violate U.S. commitments under the U.N. charter.\n\n“I don’t care what my colleagues at the United Nations think,” Haley said, characterizing China’s role in the fentanyl supply chain as “murdering Americans” and saying she would send special operations forces in to “take out the cartels.”\n\nAsked for his thoughts on some of those hard-line measures, Ramaswamy said that the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. amounts to “poisoning” and is “closer to bioterrorism,” saying “that does warrant more aggressive means to deal with it.”\n\n— Laura Gersony\n\nWhat is fracking? How the GOP candidates think more oil will offset the cost of living\n\nWhen asked how they would address rising prices and international instability threatening oil supplies, the candidates called for more domestic fracking.\n\nFracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, is a technique that releases petroleum or natural gas from the ground. Injecting a high-pressure fluid creates fractures in rock formations, allowing oil and gas to flow more freely.\n\nThe practice has been an environmental concern for activists and policymakers pushing for a transition to renewable energy.\n\nWhen asked about how he would respond to the political situation in Venezuela as president, Ron DeSantis said he would not rely on Venezuela for American oil supplies. If elected, DeSantis said he would “unleash all of America’s energy potential on Day One.”\n\nNikki Haley accused DeSantis of banning drilling and fracking in Florida, reiterating a claim she made in the previous debate. She said DeSantis opposed oil production before Floridians voted on it.\n\n“We are absolutely going to frack,” DeSantis said. “But I disagree with Nikki Haley, I don’t think it’s a good idea to drill in the Florida Everglades, but I know most Floridians agree with me.”\n\nThe moderators then asked candidates how they would offset the rising cost of living in the short term, and energy independence was the candidates' solution.\n\nTim Scott believes by becoming energy-independent and energy-dominant, America can reduce the price of energy, food and electricity. He supports expanding oil production and approving the Keystone XL Pipeline, an extension that would transport fracked gas from Canada into Nebraska.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy doubled down on promises to increase drilling, fracking, coal burning and investments in nuclear energy.\n\nChris Christie agreed with Scott, saying bringing the cost of energy down would improve prices overall.\n\n“Energy is the key to bringing this down,” Christie said. “It’s what every American needs to turn on their lights, fill up their car, and go to the grocery store.”\n\n— Hayleigh Evans\n\nHaley hits DeSantis over Social Security\n\nThe federal debt and Social Security drew out another dispute between Haley and DeSantis.\n\nDeSantis said he can \"shore up\" Social Security by curbing inflation and growing the economy. He did not propose any changes to the popular program itself.\n\nHaley said the growing federal debt requires changes to Social Security and other entitlement programs, though they should be applied only to younger people who are years away from retirement.\n\nShe also chided DeSantis and other candidates for ignoring the problem.\n\n\"Any candidate that tells you they're not going to take on entitlements is not being serious,\" Haley said.\n\n— David Jackson/USA Today\n\nNikki Haley on abortion: 'We don’t need to divide America over this issue anymore'\n\nHaley said she considers herself pro-life, but that she believes abortion is “a personal issue for every woman and every man.”\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade corrected a wrong and returned the decision to the states, she said during Wednesday's debate.\n\nShe urged her competitors to “be honest” that passing a federal ban on abortions would require 60 votes in the Senate, which could not happen given the political makeup of the upper chamber.\n\nInstead, policymakers should focus on things they can agree on, she said, such as banning late-term abortions, making birth control accessible, and ensuring women don’t go to jail for getting an abortion.\n\n\"We don’t need to divide America over this issue anymore,\" she said.\n\nLater asked whether she would sign a 15-week ban on abortions, she said: “I would support anything that would pass.”\n\n— Riley Beggin/USA Today\n\nRepublican candidates answer 1st economy question\n\nThe first question on the state of the economy came over an hour into the debate. Tim Scott said as president, he would lead the country to use its own resources first before turning to other countries, like China.\n\nHe pointed to the important role of energy in the economy, with Christie agreeing.\n\n“Energy is the key to bringing this down. ... We need to do that first and foremost. That’s the short-term answer,” Christie said.\n\nDeSantis said on Day One as president, he would rip up any regulations or executive orders related to Bidenomics, a slogan the president uses for his economic agenda.\n\n“I’ve heard from multiple people the same story,” DeSantis said. “When they go grocery shopping, what they now do is figure out what they have to take out of the cart once it’s ringing up because it rings up so much faster and so much higher at the cash register that they can’t afford the full cart of groceries anymore,” he said.\n\nRamaswamy had a simple answer on the economy: Increase the supply of everything — from energy to labor.\n\n— Rachel Looker/USA Today\n\nGOP presidential candidates broadly support Israel\n\nAbout 10 minutes into the debate, the candidates were asked about the war between Israel and Hamas, and what they would be telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were they president.\n\n\"Finish the job once and for all,” DeSantis said, adding that Israel cannot exist with such a severe security threat next door. Then he referenced his plan which spent millions of dollars to send aircraft to help evacuate Americans out of Israel after the Oct. 7 attacks.Haley was similarly blunt.\n\n\"Finish them\" would be her message to Netanyahu.\n\nScott similarly said Israel has the right “to wipe Hamas off the map.”\n\nChristie said the U.S. needs to continue to isolate Iran.\n\nRamaswamy made a quip about encouraging Israel to “smoke terrorists” on its southern border and he would be “smoking the terrorists on our southern border.”\n\nThen he spun his answer into a critique of Haley profiting from connections she made as U.N. ambassador.\n\n\"Do you want a leader from a different generation who is going to put this country first, or do you want Dick Cheney in 3-inch heels?\"\n\nHaley shot back the next time she was given a question.\n\n“They are 5-inch heels and I don’t wear them unless you can run in them,” Haley said to applause.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\nKari Lake makes an appearance at Trump’s rally in Florida\n\nKari Lake, the former gubernatorial candidate who is now running for U.S. Senate in Arizona, posted a video of herself greeting and taking photos with fans at Trump’s event in Hialeah, Florida.\n\nLake ran for governor in 2022, promising to reform election systems in Arizona and to secure the southern border. She lost to Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, and has unsuccessfully challenged the results of the gubernatorial race in court.\n\nLake, a former Fox 10 news anchor turned anti-media firebrand, often campaigns for Trump, and has received his endorsement in the ongoing Senate race.\n\n— Laura Gersony\n\nTrump arrives late to rally, promises largest deportation operation in American history\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was scheduled to begin speaking at the Ted Hendricks Stadium in Hialeah at 7 p.m. but arrived on stage an hour and a half late.\n\nThe former president's lateness did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm that greeted him when he finally walked on stage. He fell quickly into his usual approach, deriding “Crooked Joe Biden” and “Ron DeSanctimonious.”\n\nHis description of the state of affairs was a troubling one, punctuated frequently with insults. He spoke of insane asylums emptying out and terrorists flocking to unsecured borders.\n\n\"We have never been closer to World War III,\" he said.\n\n— Palm Beach Post\n\nTrump reminisces on his 2016 victory in debate counterprogramming\n\nSpeaking on the 7th anniversary of his 2016 election victory, former President Donald Trump held a rally in Hialeah, Florida, just miles away from the debate stage. He began speaking about 20 minutes after the debate began.\n\n“The American people delivered the greatest election victory, probably, that the world has ever seen,” Trump said. “The only one that’s going to be more important is the one that’s coming up in one year from now.”\n\n“We are not the ones endangering American democracy, we are the ones saving American democracy,” he said.\n\nBefore Trump took the stage, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump’s former White House press secretary who is now Arkansas governor, touted her recent endorsement of the former president in the ongoing Republican presidential primary.\n\nDespite being one of Trump’s fiercest defenders while in office, Sanders has taken several months to officially back Trump, reportedly causing angst among his associates.\n\n“President Trump made us great and I know that he will do it again,” she told the crowd.\n\nSanders was periodically interrupted by chants of “We want Trump.”\n\n— Laura Gersony\n\nRamaswamy refuses to criticize Trump\n\nThe first question from Lester Holt at Wednesday’s debate was what the candidates would say to voters about former President Donald Trump, who again chose not to debate his primary rivals.\n\nRamaswamy continued to show reluctance to criticize the former president even when asked directly to do so.\n\nRamaswamy answered by saying he was upset by the Republican losses in Tuesday’s elections.\n\n“We’ve become a party of losers,” Ramaswamy said. But rather than blame Trump, he blamed Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel.\n\nThen, without mentioning Trump, Ramawsamy tried to ask the moderators why the media spent so much time reporting on Trump’s Russia ties in the 2016 election cycle.\n\nRamaswamy’s reluctance to say anything negative about Trump has led to speculation he is running in hopes of being tapped as a vice presidential candidate for Trump.\n\nOther candidates were not so easy on Trump.\n\nHaley said Trump was “the right president at the right time. I don’t think he’s the right president now.”\n\n“We can’t live in the past. … We’ve got to start focusing on what is going to make America strong and proud,” Haley said.\n\nChris Christie, as usual, gave the harshest rebuke of Trump, saying that anyone who will spend the next year and a half trying to avoid prison doesn’t deserve to run the country.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\nGOP candidates: We would be better candidates than Trump\n\nThe first question is to all the candidates about Trump: Why are you a better candidate than him?\n\nDeSantis said he has done the things Trump talks about — and is insulting voters by refusing to debate.\n\nHaley said Trump spent too much money when he was president and added that he was good for his time, but \"I don't think he's the right president now.\"\n\nRamaswamy also said that time has passed Trump by, and the Republicans have become \"a party of losers.\" He also complained about the NBC moderators, saying they should not be doing a Republican debate.\n\nChristie, as he often does, said Trump's legal issues make him ineligible to be president again, and the former president is too busy trying to \"stay out of jail.\"\n\nScott questioned whether Trump can win a general election.\n\n— David Jackson/USA TODAY\n\nFormer UFC fighter speaks at Trump rally\n\nOpting to skip the third Republican presidential debate, former President Donald Trump is instead hosting a rally in Hialeah, Florida, which was scheduled to begin an hour before the debate. Among the speakers was Jorge Masvidal, a former professional martial artist and an outspoken admirer of Trump.\n\n“We see in just three years how crazy this horror movie has gotten,” said Masvidal, referring to President Joe Biden’s time in office.\n\nMasvidal helped to campaign for Trump during his 2020 bid for the White House, and the two have praised each other on social media.\n\n“There is just one guy we know can do the job,” Masvidal said of Trump at the rally, before leading the crowd in a chant of “let’s go Brandon,” a phrase used to mock President Joe Biden.\n\n— Laura Gersony and Ryan Randazzo\n\nChristina Bobb, Arizona ‘audit’ fundraiser, hosts Trump event\n\nChristina Bobb, a conservative personality who raised money for the so-called “audit” of Arizona’s 2020 election, was hosting the live Wednesday event for former President Donald Trump for Right Side Broadcasting Network.\n\nTrump for the third time decided to skip the formal GOP debate. Instead of sharing the stage in Miami with his primary rivals, he planned an outdoor rally about 11 miles away.\n\nBobb bantered with Brian Glenn of RSBN ahead of the former president’s planned remarks. They talked about Trump’s polling figures, the COVID-19 pandemic and other topics in between ads for a Trump bobblehead themed after the Terminator movies and plugs for MyPillow.\n\nBobb worked in the Trump administration as an appointee in the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nShe left in early 2020 to join One America News Network.\n\nAfter Trump lost the 2020 election, Bobb volunteered to help his legal team challenge the results and was with his team until the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, according to her testimony to the congressional committee that investigated the attack.\n\nShortly after Trump's loss, she helped coordinate a meeting in Arizona at which Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani suggested the election was compromised.\n\nBobb continued to work as a personality for OAN and began covering the Arizona audit once it launched in 2021. She also helped raise money for the audit through her connections to Trump and his organization.\n\nBobb also is the lawyer for Trump who last year signed a letter stating that a “diligent search” for classified records had been conducted and that all such documents had been given back to the government.\n\nThe Justice Department said the letter was untrue. During a subsequent visit to Mar-a-Lago, agents seized about 100 additional documents, according to the Associated Press.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\nWill GOP candidates discuss the environment? Here’s what they said in previous debates\n\nModerators included questions on climate change and energy prices during the first two GOP debates. As the candidates face off Wednesday evening in Florida, a state impacted by hurricanes, rising sea levels and heat waves, moderators could bring up more environmental topics.\n\nThe candidates have had varying stances, reflecting a divide within the party on how to address climate change and America’s energy supply.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, 42% of Republicans and right-leaning moderates support exploring alternative energy sources, while 58% believe America needs to increase exploration and production for coal, oil and natural gas.\n\nNikki Haley has acknowledged climate change exists but believes top polluters like India and China should act before America does. She advocated for American energy independence in the second debate.\n\n“Energy security is national security. We need a president that understands we have to partner with our producers and make sure that we have their backs,” she said. “Ron DeSantis is against fracking, he’s against drilling.”\n\nHaley claimed DeSantis banned oil drilling and fracking in Florida, an accusation he denied. DeSantis said he is committed to American energy dominance in west Texas, pushing oil and gas production instead of policies that favor renewable energy.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy has staunchly denied climate change, calling the climate change agenda a “hoax” during the first debate and demanding more drilling and fracking on American soil.\n\n“I think that we do have to run through the courts and get through that administrative state to make sure we’re using the natural resources here at home,” Ramaswamy said.\n\n— Hayleigh Evans\n\nConservative groups host debate watch party in Phoenix\n\nAt least two conservative groups in the Valley are planning a watch party for the third Republican presidential debate on Wednesday.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity’s Arizona chapter and the Libre Initiative are gathering at their shared Phoenix offices with free dinner and drinks for activists and undecided voters who register to attend.\n\nAFP is an organization with ties to the conservative industrialist Charles Koch and his late brother, David Koch. LIBRE is a sister organization started with the Charles Koch Institute that focuses on the Hispanic community.\n\nThe event, running from 5 to 8 p.m., will be held at 4745 N. Seventh St. in Phoenix and will include appetizers, bingo and political analysis from those on hand.\n\nAFP’s Arizona director, Stephen Shadegg, and LIBRE’s strategic director, Monet Bacs, are scheduled to attend.\n\nThose interested in registering for the event can do so at https://americansforprosperity.actcentr.com/Events/afp-az-primary-debate-watch-party-3\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\nRecent poll deflates candidates’ claims Trump can’t beat Biden\n\nA recent poll by the New York Times and Siena College found former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican front-runner, leading President Joe Biden in several swing states, including Arizona, that are expected to decide the next presidential election.\n\nThe poll found Trump leading Biden 49% to 44% in a hypothetical Arizona matchup.\n\nThe poll represents only one statistic in a sea of data that is sure to evolve with more than a year until the election. But it calls into question some of his challengers’ arguments that Trump can’t beat Biden in a general election.\n\nThat argument has been particularly foundational to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ campaign, which from the start billed DeSantis as a younger, more electable alternative to Trump. Other candidates on the debate stage have also questioned Trump’s viability in a general election, with businessman Vivek Ramaswamy saying in an interview that he is more likely to win in a “landslide” than the former president.\n\n— Laura Gersony\n\n1st debate since Biden revived Trump-era border wall construction effort\n\nThis GOP debate will be the first since President Joe Biden announced he would build a new section of the U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\nThat move revives a Trump-era policy and breaks Biden’s campaign trail promise that “not one more foot” of wall would be built on his watch.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidates have made border security a pillar of their campaigns and attacks against Biden. Their proposals include trying to end or limit birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented migrants, killing drug smugglers as they cross the border, and even sending the military to Mexico to target drug cartels.\n\nBiden administration officials say the border wall construction is needed to respond to an uptick in illegal immigration, which reached record levels over the summer.\n\nBiden has blamed Congress for not reappropriating the border wall money approved in a Trump-era 2019 law.\n\n— Laura Gersony\n\nOhio voters backed pro-choice amendment a day before debate\n\nWednesday’s Republican debate will come just one day after Ohio voters resoundingly backed a constitutional amendment protecting the right to abortion and other forms of reproductive health care.\n\nSince the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that had created a national right to abortion, statewide votes have opted to preserve abortion access, even in Republican-leaning states such as Kentucky and Kansas.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ohio voters backed the pro-choice amendment 56.6% to 43.4%.\n\nArizona abortion rights advocates are trying to get a similar measure on next year’s ballot.\n\nThe state was mentioned by name during the previous GOP debate in September, when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was asked how he would appeal to voters in Arizona while they consider an abortion rights measure, which likely will be supported by Democrats and bring many to the polls.\n\nDeSantis said he had success in Florida even in places typically thought of as liberal, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie added that he was the only Republican on the stage who was elected in a Democratic or blue state, “where the fight is really tough for Republicans.”\n\n— Laura Gersony and Ryan Randazzo\n\nGOP debate is 1st to partner with Jewish organization\n\nThe partnership with the Republican Jewish Coalition marks the first time such a group has cohosted a primary debate, making it all but certain candidates will spend time talking about the war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\nThe coalition’s CEO, Matt Brooks, will be asking questions of the candidates, according to the group.\n\n“The Republican National Committee's decision to invite the RJC to be its partner for this debate demonstrates the value and importance that the Republican Party places on the Jewish community and its growing support for the GOP, and the impact that the Republican Jewish Coalition has as an organization,” the group said on social media ahead of the event.\n\nThe ongoing war between Israel and Hamas has mostly drawn support for Israel from Arizona’s congressional delegation. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., is the only one of Arizona’s nine representatives and two senators who publicly has called for an end to Israel’s siege of Gaza.\n\nBut the conflict in the Democratic Party has flared in Arizona in another way, when the Sheraton Mesa Hotel at Wrigleyville West told the Council for American-Islamic Relations’ Arizona chapter that it would not host an event featuring Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.\n\nCAIR, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, has long been critical of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. The group's Arizona chapter had invited Tlaib to be the keynote speaker Nov. 18 at their annual banquet.\n\nTlaib has been one of the fiercest critics of U.S. foreign policy toward Israel in recent weeks, as that country bombs, invades and cuts off most humanitarian supplies from the Gaza Strip in response to the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. Her views generated criticism from her House colleagues, who voted Tuesday to censure her.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo and Laura Gersony\n\nHow big is Trump’s lead in the polls?\n\nHeading into Wednesday’s debate, former President Donald Trump continues to hold a substantial lead in polls against the other Republican candidates.\n\nAnalysis site FiveThirtyEight.com tracks polls nationwide and uses a compilation to calculate the candidates’ current standing. FiveThirtyEight estimates Trump’s support among Republicans at greater than 56% as of Tuesday, having only increased since April.\n\nMeanwhile, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has seen his support drop to about 14% when it was as high as 35% in polling in the spring.\n\nFormer U.N. Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was averaging about 9% on Tuesday, having overtaken businessman Vivek Ramaswamy in recent months following her performances during the first two debates.\n\nRamaswamy’s support was about 5.2% on Tuesday, according to the site.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\nRamaswamy considered skipping 3rd GOP debate\n\nGOP candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said a month ago that he may opt out of the Republican presidential primary debate in Miami after the political newcomer played the role of punching bag in the first two debates.\n\nRamaswamy spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the campaign had internal discussions about whether he should participate in future debates.\n\nHis campaign cited the inability of moderators to control the candidates and offer everyone a chance to respond to criticism, and the declining viewership on television.\n\n— USA Today", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2023/12/20/trump-ballot-colorado-supreme-court-ruling-democracy/71983147007/", "title": "Colorado ban of Trump from 2024 ballot is bad. Backlash will be swift", "text": "Many people in America believe that former President Donald Trump should not be allowed to run for the presidency again. These Americans have now been joined by a slim majority of justices sitting on the Colorado Supreme Court who, in a historic 4-3 decision, declared that Trump is ineligible for office based on the 14th Amendment’s ban against would be officeholders who have “engaged in insurrection.”\n\nI doubt that the U.S. Supreme Court will uphold the Colorado court's decision. Yet, even if it does, Trump's critics should be wary of the consequences of disqualifying the man with the most powerful political following in America.\n\nThere was a time when it might have been less of a risk to our country and the unity of its people to have legally disqualified Trump from seeking reelection. The twice-impeached former president could have been legally barred from the White House if impeachment by the House had led to conviction in the Senate for Trump's role in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nTrump’s popularity, at that time, had hit a low point, and in the passion of the moment, it seemed clear to most Americans that the president was substantially to blame for that episode of national disgrace.\n\nKentucky's Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, agreed that Trump was responsible for instigating the riot, but he and 42 other Republican senators voted to acquit the former president. It was enough to kill the congressional effort to hold Trump accountable for Jan. 6.\n\nAt the time, many Americans believed that Trump had little chance of ever returning to the presidency. But now, Trump may very well win back the Oval Office in 2024.\n\nTrump does face obstacles, of course. But the most powerful obstacles he faces to a White House return are legal, not political.\n\nAs things stand today, neither President Joe Biden nor Trump’s Republican primary opponents are positioned to defeat him. A suite of recent polls shows Biden trailing Trump by several points nationally, but more significantly Biden is trailing Trump across the key battleground states that either candidate would likely need to win next year.\n\nBiden's job approval rating stands at only 37%, according to a recent CNN survey. Meanwhile, Trump is prevailing over the other Republican candidates by massive double digit margins in every primary state, with national Republican support for Trump standing at 69% and rising, according to Fox News.\n\nWhile these things could all change, Trump could hardly ask to be in a stronger position with American voters.\n\nWe don't yet know either the political or legal implications if Trump is convicted of any of the 91 felony counts he faces in four cases. But we do know that the Constitution doesn't prohibit Trump from running for the presidency because of those charges.\n\nAnother view:Ban Trump from 2024 ballot? Why courts should rule he can't serve as president again.\n\nTrump could still run – even from prison\n\nThe great legal peril that Trump faces, should he be convicted of a felony, is actual imprisonment. Were Trump to be jailed he could still appear on the ballot. He would not be able to actively campaign, however, a circumstance that one would normally expect to be the death of any political candidacy. But not in Trump's case.\n\nSo far, what we have seen is that Trump's legal problems have not eroded his support. In fact, the opposite is true. His poll numbers have risen as his legal jeopardy has increased.\n\nIf the Supreme Court were to uphold states' decisions to ban Trump from the ballot, then he truly would find himself unable to return to the White House. But he would still command the most passionate and perhaps largest political following in the United States.\n\nBacklash from banning Trump would be swift\n\nPeople hoping that the courts will do what voters appear unwilling to do should consider what that would mean for our democracy and for America's future.\n\nIs Trump right about World War III?Here's why we should be worried.\n\nAlthough Republicans like myself reject the claim, a majority of Trump’s supporters continue to believe that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Many of them also believe that the Department of Justice has been weaponized by Biden and the Democratic Party to destroy their leading political opponent.\n\nTrust in our civic and legal institutions among Republicans, already at perilous lows, would burn through the Earth’s crust if the judicial system blocks the most popular GOP candidate from the ballot.\n\nTrump, for tens of millions of Americans, would become a political martyr, one who would almost certainly foster rage among his most loyal supporters. And the dangers of civil unrest may rise dramatically.\n\nFor those who fear it, the return of a Trump presidency could seem like the worst of all possible outcomes. But it might not be.\n\nBarring Trump from the ballot would not spare the American people from the consequences of our divisions. It could well make them worse.\n\nJohn Wood Jr. is a columnist for USA TODAY Opinion.

And Christmas \"looks wet rather than white for most areas.\"\n\nThe end of January gets a red flag for much of the nation due to the potential of \"a very active storm track\" expected to bring strong and gusty winds, along with heavy precipitation – \"copious amounts of snow, rain, sleet, and ice (depending on where you live) could fall,\" the Almanac says.\n\nThe winter chill is expected to \"hang on\" longer than usual in the North, Northeast and middle of the U.S. \"So it looks like it's going to feel like a longer winter, even if it's a little warmer in certain areas that usually get snowier conditions,\" she said.\n\nWant climate news from experts? Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter.\n\nLa Niña:Hurricane season could be 'extremely active' with arrival of climate pattern\n\nDid the Farmers' Almanac get its winter weather prediction right last year?\n\nNot if you consider the Almanac's overall forecast of a cold 2023-2024 winter because it was the warmest on record. However, the Almanac notes it hit on some of its predictions including heavy show and blizzard conditions from Colorado to the Plains that threatened Christmas holiday travel.\n\nThe Almanac's forecast paralleled a weather pattern described by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as \"a swatch of cooler-than-average temperatures across the central part of the country in January.\"\n\nThe Farmers' Almanac, which originated in 1818, says its longtime fans claim the publication's weather predictions are accurate approximately 80%-85% of the time. It uses \"a top-secret mathematical and astronomical formula, taking sunspot activity, tidal action, the position of the planet, and many other factors into consideration,\" the Almanac states.\n\nShould you base your plans on the Farmers' Almanac – or the Old Farmer's Almanac, due out later this month? Russ Schumacher, a professor and climatologist at Colorado State University, was skeptical he told the Coloradoan in 2022\n\n\"They attract attention and get people talking about it.

Is that we get a few days of really cold weather and some snow? That happens pretty much every winter,'' he said.\n\nThe Farmers' Almanac still makes for an interesting read. Here's a closer look at its regional winter forecasts (click on a link to go directly to that region's forecast).\n\nNortheast, New York | Midwest, Ohio and Michigan| Pacific Northwest| North Central | Southeast, Florida | Texas, South Central | California, Southwest\n\nWinter in the New England and the Northeast region (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont) will be stormy with above-normal amounts of precipitation and near- to above-normal temperatures, according to the Almanac. \"Obviously, in the mountainous areas, we do see some good opportunities for that winter precipitation to turn white,\" Duncan said.\n\nAn early start to winter is expected with a coastal storm along the Atlantic Seaboard in the first week of December bringing mixed precipitation, then very cold temperatures. Much of New England and New York can expect a few inches of snow from a \"fast-moving clipper system\" in mid-January; the rest of the region gets rains and a wintry mix.\n\nThe end of January will be \"a very active time,\" for the region with a big storm dropping six or more inches of snow to Delaware, Maryland and parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, \"with some lighter amounts in southern New York and New England,\" Duncan said.\n\nSnow storms are predicted into March with one dropping up to 5 inches in mid-March in upstate New York and central and northern New England.\n\nThe Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and Midwest region (Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin) can expect periods of wet snow and rain to begin in early November, with \"frigidly cold\" temperatures through Nov. 11. Rain and wet snow continues to Thanksgiving, with a drier forecast toward the end of the year.\n\n\"January looks like when the Big Freeze may be on for that area,\" Duncan said. With \"very, very cold\" conditions expected, \"If you can plan your trip to the Caribbean, I would go then.\"\n\nIn mid-March, a \"rapidly moving storm\" is expected to bring two to five inches of wet snow to Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and the lower peninsula of Michigan and a wintry mix to Kentucky. The first of April is also predicted to bring cold rain, sleet and wet snow to Kentucky, southern Indiana and southern Ohio.\n\nThe Northwest region (Idaho, Oregon and Washington) will get plenty of showers, with wet snow beginning in early November. A stormy December may yield a possible fair, dry and cold Christmas holiday, then a fair January.\n\nBut in early February, a major storm is expected to bring heavy snow to the Bitterroot Range in eastern Idaho \"with 12 inches possible.\"\n\n\"So I think it's going to be very wet conditions,\" Duncan said. \"It obviously may not be so bad in the other states in that region.\"\n\nThe North Central states (Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming) will get a gusty Halloween and then snow in the Rockies at the start of November. An early November storm is predicted to bring heavy snow and, after it clears very cold temperatures. After a rainy, snowy Thanksgiving more storms kick off December. But a \"generally fair, dry, very cold\" Christmas is forecast; unseasonably cold temperatures are predicted to arrive in late January.\n\n\"This is where we are saying winter feels a little bit more like winter, with the coldest temperatures of the season and average snowfall,\" Duncan said. Expect a lot of snow in February, with some generated by that storm forecast for Idaho. A mid-February snowstorm predicted in the Plains could dump heaviest in Kansas.\n\nSoutheast states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia) overall are expected to be \"mild and wet,\" Duncan said. \"But that doesn't mean they will escape Old Man Winter.\"\n\nA \"sharp cold front\" in mid-November could bring violent thunderstorms to Tennessee and areas south, followed by a deep freeze. Conditions return to fair and dry before a wet Thanksgiving. An early December coastal storm could bring rain, winds and \"very cold air\" plus freezing conditions into Florida. A wet Christmas follows.\n\n\"We do see some colder conditions and very cold and bitterly cold conditions ending the month (of January) in the Southeast states,\" Duncan said.\n\nCold conditions are predicted to continue into February, with a midmonth storm possibly bringing sleet and wet snow to most of the region.\n\nSouth Central states (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico) and Texas are forecast to have \"mild with near to below normal precipitation,\" Duncan said.\n\nThe region is expected to get plenty of rain and wet snow in December, followed by a mostly fair January.\n\nBut the beginning of February will be \"very unsettled, with some snow, possibly … up to 6 inches\" in Texas, she said.\n\nA wet Mardi Gras could be upcoming, too, according to the Almanac.\n\nSouthwest states (Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah) are forecast to have average temperatures and precipitation, a possible break from last winter's atmospheric rivers. A dry Thanksgiving is followed by rain and snow showers and a \"fair, dry, very chilly\" Christmas season is forecast.\n\nHeavy snow in the mountains in late January could lead to storms to the east.\n\nWith colder conditions also forecast in the Southeast, and Midwest and a major storm in the Northwest at the beginning of February, \"the end of January (and) beginning of February, for most of the country, looks like something you just may want to put on the calendar,\" Duncan said.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

In January, the second week \"will be stormy, snowy, and wet for both the Pacific Coast and the Eastern States,\" it forecasts. Then, during the second week of February, \"an East Coast storm affecting the Northeast and New England states will bring snowfall, cold rain and then frigid temperatures.\" The first week of March, the Almanac forecasts, \"another East Coast storm will bring a wintry mess to this area.\" Come spring, during the third week of April, a \"possible late-season snowfall\" is expected \"over the high terrain of New England.\"\n\nGreat Lakes, Ohio Valley and Midwest\n\nForecast for Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin: January and February should bring lower than average temperatures and lots of \"snowstorms, sleet, ice (and) rain\" around the Great Lakes and Midwest, the Almanac forecasts.\n\nSoutheast\n\nForecast for Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia: Florida and the rest of the Southeast \"will see a wetter-than-normal winter, with average winter temperatures overall, but a few frosts may send many shivers to snowbirds trying to avoid the cold and snow back home,\" the Almanac forecasts. In mid-February, the Southeast will experience \"unseasonably cold temperatures,\" and during the first week of March \"another East Coast storm will bring a wintry mess to this area.\"\n\nNorth Central\n\nForecast for Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming: This winter, the Great Plains and Rockies can expect \"plenty of cold temperatures and occasional bouts of storminess, bringing widespread rains and snows,\" the Almanac forecasts.

To celebrate his birthday last month, he said, \"I took about a 10-mile bike ride, took my dog hiking, had a nice dinner my wife made and relaxed the rest of the day.\"\n\nTo this day he is active in both competition and education. In July he's set to travel to Kauai to make a presentation on water safety and may also make it to the National Lifeguard Championships in Virginia Beach, Va.\n\nHis most recent rescue was last year, while swimming on the lake he and wife Annette live near for most of the year in Eden, Utah. He spotted a young man swimming in from an anchored fishing boat. \"I could spot immediately his skills were just, he was not going to make it. He was almost ready to go down.\n\n\"The point being, once you've been a lifeguard you're watching, wherever you go, you're looking.\"\n\nWaterworks\n\nHe started as a seasonal lifeguard on the county's pools and beaches in 1945, and six years later the young husband and father was offered a permanent $303-a-month beach job which came with a beachside house in Malibu.\n\nSo he became the security for untold numbers of swimmers along the beach — he estimates he did 100 rescues a year before he moved into management, becoming chief of the Los Angeles County Lifeguards for 16 years until retiring in 1983.\n\nBesides helping start the Surf Life Saving Association of America, which later became the USLA, his claim to fame is inventing the Burnside rescue can or rescue buoy — the orange floatation device David Hasselhoff, Pamela Anderson and other \"Baywatch\" stars carried as they sprinted and dived through the opening credits of the long-running TV show.\n\nBurnside said that idea came to him in 1967 when \"rescue cans\" were made out of metal and could slam lifeguards in the face if victims let go of them at the wrong time. \"I was filling out industrial injury forms to send them down to get their teeth checked after the incidents. On my desk I had a polyurethane cartoon of a scuba diver, and I thought to myself, why can't we make one of these cans out of something other than metal to make them a little more pliable?\"\n\nHe teamed up with a UCLA industrial arts professor to design the new lifesaving tool and for many years handled the sales side of the business they started.\n\nThe buoy is the physical evidence of his career, but the professional group's reach may be even wider. Formed so American lifeguards could compete with their Australian counterparts in a meet, it currently has about 10,000 members and claims 2.5 million rescues, 1.5 million in California.\n\nWhen it got going it made a huge difference, Burnside said. \"When that had been formed, agencies were able to communicate with each other about what worked and what didn't work, new procedures, they started junior lifeguard (programs). Once they consolidated, those lifeguards realized 'Hey, there's a junior lifeguard program,' so they started one. Equipment changes, procedures, methods, everything imaginable.\n\n\"Many cities didn't have lifeguard programs. But once national got started the executive board had people who would go to each city that had beach activity and go before the City Council and say, 'You know, the fatality rate you people are having here, this can be directed but you've got to protect these people.' \"\n\nBurnside said he rarely heard back from those he saved after the incident. \"I would say in my career I might have had a dozen people make contact with me after something like that happened, a week or a day or sometimes a month after that happened. They will somehow run me down, find out who I am.\"\n\nOne of that dozen wasn't a swimmer, but a Catholic nun who was thrown through the windshield in an automobile crash he drove by. \"It was very bad, I could hardly tell she had a face,\" Burnside said. Trained as a paramedic, he used sterile bandages and towels he had with him to cover her wounds until someone could get her to a hospital.\n\n\"A year and a half later, or maybe it was two years, all of a sudden this nun walks up to my lifeguard station,\" he said.\n\nBurnside recalled her saying, \" 'The doctor told me if you hadn't put those wet towels and sterile bandages on me, he wouldn't have been able to do the reconstructive surgery on my face as well has he did.' And I looked at her and it looked like nothing had happened to her.\"\n\nBurnside continues to advocate for water safety programs nationwide and led the USLA's effort to build a permanent lifeguard station in Puerto Escondido, Mexico, in 1997, which at the time saw 30 to 40 drownings a year.\n\n\"It's dropped down to where if they have two, they feel like they've had a bad year,\" Burnside said.\n\nBefore the supervision of lifeguards, the father of two, grandfather of eight and great-grandfather of eight said the best prevention for drowning is for everyone to obtain their swimming skills early.\n\nAny place with water has the potential of creating tragedy. And the responsibility of every parent with their little ones is to them to swim as soon as that they can walk.\n\nBurnside, who first moved to Palm Desert years ago to be close to his mother, said valley residents should take advantage of the opportunities they have to maintain their swimming form and skills.\n\n\"Prevention is very important,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/06/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/14/russian-athletes-cheaters/75679536/", "title": "Russian athletes aren't the only cheaters", "text": "Kavitha A. Davidson\n\nA highly anticipated report on doping and corruption in international athletics accused the Russian government of being complicit in a widespread and coordinated doping program, recommending that the Russian team be banned from next year's Olympics in Brazil.\n\nThat would be a harsh, if merited, punishment. But let's not get so indignant over Russian nefariousness that we forget there's enough blame to go around the world.\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency's independent commission released its report Monday, holding that Russian players, coaches, doctors, law-enforcement agencies and anti-doping officials colluded in \"a state-sponsored regime.\" Among the offenses: Official security services were present in testing labs during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, creating an \"atmosphere of intimidation\" and \"interference by the Russian state.\" The commission also says athletes were notified when they would be tested, violating the goal of random and spontaneous testing.\n\nData compiled in 2013 pegged Russia with the most doping violations of the 115 countries examined: 225 total, accounting for 11.5 percent of all violations. The most violations in a single sport, 42, came in track and field. The commission recommended lifetime bans for one doctor, four track coaches and five athletes, including Mariya Savinova-Farnosova and Ekaterina Poistogova, who won the gold and bronze medals in the women's 800-meter in London in 2012. The commission also urged that Moscow's anti-doping lab be stripped of its accreditation. According to the report, the lab's director \"admitted to intentionally destroying\" 1,417 samples to hamper the investigation.\n\nThe report also implicated officials in both the Russian Athletics Federation and the International Association of Athletics Federations, the world governing body of track and field. The IAAF president, former British track star and member of Parliament Sebastian Coe, said he would give the Russians until Friday to respond before considering sanctions. That's more time than they needed: Vladimir Uiba, the head of Russia's medical agency, dismissed the report as \"politically motivated.\" Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko, whose office is accused of influencing the country's anti-doping efforts through bribery and cover-up, threatened to cut government funding for anti-doping efforts.\n\nAs bad as all this is, it's important that the report's full implications don't get lost in the rush to condemn Russia. Russia's insistence that this is all about politics sounds like excuse-making, a tone-deaf denial. And it is. But it also reminds one of Lance Armstrong and his defenders insisting that he was a high-profile scapegoat meant to distract from the more widespread epidemic of doping in cycling. And despite his obvious guilt, there was some truth to that. The evidence against Russia is plentiful and damning and signals systemic cheating -- but that doesn't absolve the rest of the sport from guilt. (Turkey, for instance, had the second-highest number of doping transgressions with 188, a much higher rate of violations per capita.)\n\nSince his election in August, Coe has repeatedly denied that the IAAF doesn't take doping seriously, piling any blame on his predecessor, Lamine Diack, who is accused of accepting bribes. \"We are not complacent,\" Coe said Sunday. But Monday's report \"noted a cumulative lapse of action from the IAAF\" in investigating doping suspicions and a \"collective and inexplicable laissez-faire policy.\" Coe, who had been vice chairman of the organization since 2007, shouldn't escape blame.\n\nRussia is an easy villain in global sports rivalries and James Bond films alike, with a cartoon-villain of a president who sank more than $50 billion into the Sochi Olympics for the sole purpose of projecting an image of Russian pride. \"It's residue of the old Soviet Union system,\" WADA chief and the report's co-author Dick Pound said at a news conference Monday.\n\nThe legacy of the sort of state-sponsored doping we saw decades ago in East Germany remains, a reminder of the dark side of conferring political meaning on sports. National sports programs are supposedly a sign of luxury, the idea that a country has figured out things like jobs and public health so that it can now turn its attention to leisure. The U.S. in particular touts its success in sports as a marker of its civilization. But if we've learned anything from East Germany to Lance Armstrong to FIFA to Russia, it's that no society is exceptional when it comes to combating corruption in sports.\n\nCleaning up athletics can't stop with sanctioning Russia. The sport's governing body needs to take a serious, introspective look at how it got to this point, and would do well to heed the commission's recommendations that it adopt independent compliance officers.\n\nThere are at least two other lessons to be learned. Coe, like so many other powerful sports officials, has accused the media of making \"a declaration of war on my sport.\" But yet again, journalists were needed to force real change. It was a report by the Sunday Times of London and a documentary by the German broadcaster ARD/WDR, publishing the blood-test results of 5,000 athletes over a decade, that sparked the commission's investigation.\n\nThe second lesson is that the victims of state-sponsored doping are sometimes the intended beneficiaries. East German athletes during the Cold War were predominantly fed performance enhancers without their consent, told they were vitamins and supplements instead of hormones that carried life-long effects. The athletes named in Monday's report aren't innocent victims by any means; many admitted to taking drugs while being aware of the time frame between tests for when they were detectable. But in reading the report, you also get the sense that individual doping resulted from systemic pressure, pushed by coaches and officials who saw these athletes as political pawns. \"They poured so much into her,\" one coach told a whistle-blower of Savinova-Farnosova.\n\nLet's also not overlook that the vast majority of athletes named in the report are women, whose naturally lower levels of testosterone make them better beneficiaries of the effects of doping with androgenic hormones. Valentin Balakhnichev, president of Russia's athletic federation, is accused of extorting money from female athletes to cover up their positive tests. Given that the IAAF is already dealing with a bevy of issues surrounding assumptions of natural hormone levels, I'd be interested to see how systemic doping breaks down along gender lines. Conducting science experiments on female athletes just because they're women is more than a doping infringement -- it's a human-rights violation.\n\nKavitha A.

The decision stirred debate in Delaware and elsewhere over the court's authority to sell a private business. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani weighed in, calling the decision an intrusion on the free market.\n\nHolland and other TransPerfect employees banded together, creating Citizens for a Pro-Business Delaware. The group has been at the center of a lobbying effort to change the Delaware law permitting the Chancery Court to sell a private business. It has taken out full-page ads in The News Journal and other publications, sponsored radio ads and hired a lobbyist to meet with legislators and influential members of the state's corporate bar.\n\nIn documents filed with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Holland contends after Citizens for a Pro-Business Delaware issued a May 23 press release, all TransPerfect employees received an email asking them to stop their efforts.\n\nHolland alleges attorney Joel Mostrom, who was hired by Pincus to assist with the sale process, sent the email. The lawsuit also claims Mostrom called Holland demanding he identify other employees involved in Citizens for a Pro-Business Delaware and implied his employment could be at risk.\n\n\"Plaintiff reasonably believed and reasonably believes that his TransPerfect employment is at risk as a result of his participation in speaking out against the order compelling the involuntary sale of TransPerfect and in petitioning the Delaware State Legislature for legislative relief,\" Goodman wrote.\n\nAs Citizens for a Pro-Business Delaware's efforts continued, Holland claimed, Bouchard approved a proposal granting Pincus the authority to demand employees deliver private communication devices such as cell phones for inspection. Holland alleges the order is a violation of his Fourth Amendment right against unlawful search and seizure.\n\n\n\nChris Coffey, campaign manager for Citizens for a Pro-Business Delaware said he hopes the lawsuit will end the court's attempts to silence the group's members.\n\n\"Our members have the right to march, to speak up and to fight what they believe in,\" Coffey said. \"We hope to have that right affirmed in federal court.\"\n\nContact Jeff Mordock at (302) 324-2786, on Twitter @JeffMordockTNJ or jmordock@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/firststatepolitics/2014/09/04/markell-photo/15067903/", "title": "#oops!

Jack Markell caused a stir Thursday on Twitter when a tweet posted on his account promoting an education event instead linked to a suggestive photo of an Estonian model.\n\nA member of Markell's staff sent out the tweet during an event at Warner Elementary in Wilmington about 10:30 a.m., distracting from the governor's announcement to direct $5 million to low-performing schools.\n\nIt included a link to the photo and was deleted 17 minutes later, according to the website Politwoops, which archives tweets posted then deleted by politicians.\n\nThe photo, showing a woman photographed from mid-torso wearing a revealing top with leather straps around the neck and chest, was posted in 2010 on the Twitter account of a woman who identifies herself as a hair and makeup artist.\n\nMarkell quickly apologized, sending a message on Twitter that his staff was attempting to determine how the photo of the scantily clad adult female was included in a tweet promoting an education initiative.\n\n\"An inappropriate photo was inadvertantly sent out earlier,\" the tweet on Markell's account states. \"We are looking into how this occurred but apologize to anyone who was offended.\"\n\nThe tweet and the photo was quickly circulated, along with comments from those who saw it before it was deleted from Markell's account.\n\n\"Nice photo, Jack,\" Elizabeth Page wrote. \"Ummm.

Here's some Easter Basket inspiration.\n\nHere's the news to know Monday.\n\nSelection Sunday makes for a mad Monday\n\nCollege basketball launched fully into March Madness 2024 as the field for the NCAA Tournaments were announced on Selection Sunday. Now fans are racing on Monday to select their very-best bracket ahead of tip-off this week.\n\nWhile some men's teams are prepping for the dance, others are grousing about being left out as a chaotic championship weekend left once top-10 teams on the outside looking in. Meanwhile, there’s more parity in women’s college hoops than ever before — and more eyeballs on the game, too — which means we’re in for some major madness this month.\n\nUndefeated South Carolina earned the top overall women's seed . Iowa and Caitlin Clark are poised for another Final Four run, with LSU's Angel Reese, Stanford's Cameron Brink, Connecticut's Paige Bueckers and South Carolina’s Te-Hina Paopao hoping to stand in the way of Clark's first national title.\n\n.

The talks would mark the first time both Israeli officials and Hamas leaders join the indirect negotiations since the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. International mediators had hoped to secure a six-week truce before Ramadan started last week, but Hamas refused any deal that wouldn’t lead to a permanent cease-fire in Gaza, a demand Israel rejected.

Despite several opposition protests across Russia, Putin easily claimed another six-year term by getting 87% of the vote. Putin has been in power since 1999 and the predetermined victory will allow him to surpass Josef Stalin's 29-year tenure, making the former KGB agent the longest-serving Russian leader in more than 200 years.

Pence told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that his divide with Trump stretches beyond the events of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, when Pence refused to intervene in Congress' certification of the 2020 election. Pence said Trump was abandoning \"a commitment to fiscal responsibility, a commitment to the sanctity of life, a commitment to American leadership in the world,\" while adding what he'd like to see from Trump on abortion rights and the debate over TikTok's future.

The Supreme Court takes up the issue on Monday, and if the justices place too many restrictions on how the government can work with private social media companies in areas such as public health, election integrity and foreign interference, it could impede efforts to stop harmful misinformation, experts say. But if there aren’t enough guardrails, the government – whether a Democratic or Republican administration – could have too much power to influence public debate.

He went to dinner with his mother, who made the nearly 10-hour trek from the family’s home in Douglassville, Pennsylvania. He watched Game Two of the NBA Finals. He watched Game Two of the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nEvery night also brought another competitive/cutthroat round of Mario Kart (favorite character Shy Guy, favorite course Peach Garden) with teammates.\n\nHe got in the pool. He got on the weights. He did anything to keep moving so he didn’t have to think of the proverbial elephant in the room, until he had to sit and talk of the elephant in the room.\n\nAs he spoke Monday afternoon, you could sense it there in the corner, right next to the blue and gold Swim Like a Champion Today sign.\n\nOnly after there was nothing left in the day, only when he hit the point of absolute exhaustion, did the wheels in Guiliano’s mind spin toward this weekend and the United States Olympic team swim trials.\n\nBy now, he’ll have made the nearly straight-line drive from campus to Indianapolis, where he aims to earn a spot on the U.S. team for the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\n“I try to keep my mind off it as much as I can, aside from when I actually put my head on the pillow at night and I start thinking about it,” said Guiliano, who turns 21 on June 25, two days after the trials end. “I try to put the perfect visualization together.”\n\nHe visualized standing there on the block while ignoring the mass of everything ahead of him. Lucas Oil Stadium, which towers over a southwest section of the city, is home to the trials. It’s a football venue. It’s a basketball Final Four venue. It's a concert venue.\n\nThis month, it’s a swimming venue, maybe the largest ever. Anywhere. Capacity will push toward 30,000. Two pools — one for competition, one for warm–ups — were specially constructed for the event. When Guiliano steps inside Lucas Oil for practice this weekend, it will be the first time he’s set foot in the place.\n\nNoie:Remembering Bill Walton's final visit to a basketball place that didn't hold happy memories\n\nIn early March, while back on campus and helping the men to a 10th place national finish, Guiliano flipped on the NFL combine, also held at Lucas Oil, to maybe get a sense of what the trials might look like and feel like and be like.\n\nIt didn’t work. That place is just so ... big.\n\n“I can’t imagine it,” he said. “It’s going to be beautiful. You can’t really put it into words.”\n\nSame goes for Guiliano’s journey in this sport from someone who went from kind of/sort of liking to swim to being on the brink of being the fastest in the country to do it for the ultimate amateur honor.\n\nThere was just something about swimming\n\nWhat if...\n\nIt’s a question Guiliano occasionally asks when asked how he got his start in swimming. He was eight years old. He went to a swim workout with his brother, Joseph, four years his senior, back in Berks County, which sits on the banks of the Schuylkill River. It was a hot day. It was a find-a-pool kind of a day.\n\nWhat if that day was like Monday in South Bend when it was cool and breezy and decidedly fall-like? Would Guiliano jump in the pool, as he did that day? Would he have stuck with his sports of his choice of baseball, football and soccer?\n\nWhat if he had decided to just sit and watch?\n\n“I don’t know if I’d even be doing sports or where I’d be right now,” he said. “I probably wouldn’t be sitting here today. I owe it all to swimming.”\n\nFootball was Guiliano’s game until seventh grade. Then he was headed for the end zone before being caught from behind at the 1-yard-line. The tackle caused a hairline hip fracture that forced Guiliano to miss six weeks. That was the beginning of the end of football. Basketball permanently went on the shelf the following year. Soccer soon followed.\n\nThere was something about swimming that did it for him.\n\n“I just love it,” he said. “I knew that I had to love it. I wouldn’t say that I forced myself to love it, but I do.\n\n“It’s just given me a drive and a purpose.”\n\nAnd success. So much success. Guiliano was a three-time team most valuable swimmer and an All-American in high school. He set five school records. He earned first team all-state honors in 2020. He dreamed of going to Notre Dame, a school that wasn’t nationally known for its swim programs.\n\nGuiliano would help change that narrative. His name is splashed all over the record book. He holds the top school mark in five events — the 50, 100 and 200-yard freestyle and the 50 and 100-meter freestyle. In February, he won four Atlantic Coast Conference championships — 50, 100, 200 freestyle and the 400 free relay — and was the conference swimmer of the year. He earned All-American honors in six events this past season, five first team and one honorable mention.\n\n“This is just what I was meant to do in my eyes,” he said. “This is my purpose. I feel like I was born to do this and do this here. It’s special to do it at Notre Dame.”\n\nNotre Dame coach Chris Lindauer saw something in Guiliano that he likely didn’t see in himself. During Guiliano’s freshman year, Lindauer was the coach at conference rival Louisville when he noticed Guiliano at a meet. He was good that day and that year while setting school records in the 50 and the 100.\n\nHe had untapped potential to be great.\n\n“I watched him and was like, ‘That guy’s got it,’” Lindauer said. “He was as raw as raw could be. He was that diamond in the rough. As soon as I had the opportunity to coach him, it was like, ‘OK, this could be good.’”\n\nHow good? As a freshman, Guiliano’s top time in the 100 freestyle long course was 51 seconds. By the end of his sophomore season – his first with Lindauer – he was at 47.9 seconds. He made the world championship team and was second in the entire U.S.\n\nHe was good. World-class good. Olympic hopeful good.\n\n“A lot of that was learning specifics on training and technique and all of that,” Lindauer said. “A lot of that, too, wad the mental game — why not Notre Dame? Why not you, Chris? Why can’t we do it here?\n\n“We can.”\n\nThey have.\n\nIs Paris a realistic option? Why not\n\nStay away. Don’t talk to him. Don’t go near him. Go away. Twenty minutes before Guiliano takes the block in Indianapolis in his three events — the 50, 100 and 200 freestyles — coaches, teammates, family and friends will know to give him space. Plenty of space.\n\nAffable and easy-going, Guiliano throws a switch before he races. He locks in on the task ahead. He becomes someone else. He shuts out everything and everyone and just focuses. He hears and sees nothing. Only his task.\n\nEven at the trials, he insists that he doesn’t know who is ranked above or below or near him for his three events. Don’t know. Don’t want to know. He doesn’t look at this guy or that guy or those guys as his rabbits or his rivals. It’s him. It’s the pool. It’s the clock. Then it’s, let’s see where it all leads.\n\nTo victory? To Paris?\n\n“With this sport, you can’t really have any expectations,” Guiliano said. “You can have them, but just knowing that you go out there and did your best, that’s as much as you can ask for.\n\n“I trust my training. I’m prepared.”\n\nGuiliano has worked to not make this week bigger than it is, but it is big. Huge. He knows it. Lindauer knows it. Guiliano is one of 900 swimmers with the same dream. Wear red, white and blue. See Paris. Bring home some hardware.\n\nThis is a stage that Guiliano has never been on. He has raced all over the world — Fukuoka, Japan in 2023, for instance — which has helped him understand that it’s just him and the water and the stopwatch.\n\nGuiliano’s first race Sunday is the 200 freestyle semifinals. His last would be the 50-freestyle final on Friday, June 21. To get to Paris, he’ll need to advance from the prelims to the semifinals to the finals, where a top two finish with an Olympic qualifying time guarantees one of the team’s 52 spots (26 men, 26 women).\n\n“He’s been fortunate to have some experiences like the world championships to help set him up,” Lindauer said. “It’s certainly a new environment, but it’s also an exciting environment where we want him to own it and embrace it and take it in and ultimately enjoy it.\n\n“It’s the best of everything.”\n\nEverything that Guiliano has done in his two years with Lindauer has been done with one purpose. Every workout, every stroke, every training session is another piece to the puzzle of getting Guiliano to the podium in Paris. To be great. To win gold.\n\n“He knows it; he believes in it,” Lindauer said. “The buy-in is there.”\n\nAs is pressure. But is it? When Guiliano mentioned the trials, he talked of staying composed and having fun and winning. But the pressure?\n\n“Pressure is a privilege as we say around here,” Guiliano said. “I like being able to have this opportunity to go and be great.”\n\nIt awaits. All of it.\n\nJump in and go. The water’s fine.\n\nFollow South Bend Tribune and NDInsider columnist Tom Noie on Twitter: @tnoieNDI.

A pre-trials test event is planned, as are a spectator \"Aqua Zone\" and youth swimming meets.\n\nUSA Swimming and the Indiana Sports Corp. are committing $400,000 to legacy projects for increased access to water for children in under-served areas around Indianapolis.\n\n“It’s not just what happens in the arena,” Hinchey said. “It’s also what we can do outside the arena.”\n\nKing, 25, an Evansville native, won eight NCAA titles, all in breaststroke, at IU. She famously won two gold medals at the 2016 Rio Olympics, earned three more medals at the Tokyo Olympics, and has held the world record in the 100-meter breaststroke since 2017.\n\nShe has not committed to continuing through the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, so 2024 could be her last trials.\n\nKing has been part of the Indianapolis bid, filming a promotional video. She said swimmers like the city because they have been here so often and are familiar with downtown.\n\nKing said her mother swam in the first high school state meet held at the Natatorium at IUPUI, and her first age-group meet was there.\n\n\"I was dead last in all of my events,\" she said.\n\nShe has been here so often, she said, Indianapolis feels like home.\n\n\"My whole life, every time I drove in on West Street, saw Lucas Oil Stadium, I get butterflies in my stomach. And I did today,\" she said. \"Because that meant I was going to swim at a fast meet, usually at the Nat. Or just stopping early here.\n\n\"I get to swim here next time.\"\n\nIndianapolis last held the trials at the Natatorium in 2000. Since then, the trials have been in temporary pools accommodating more spectators. The trials were outdoors at Long Beach, Calif., in 2004, and in an Omaha arena in 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2021.\n\nThis will be a record seventh trials f Indianapolis. The city previously held the event at Broad Ripple in 1924 and 1952 (women only), and 1984, 1992, 1996 and 2000 at the Nat.\n\nMore:Why Indiana produces so many Olympic swimmers. 'This is just the beginning.'\n\nElkhart’s Lindsay (Benko) Mintenko made her first Olympic team at Indy in 2000, and she ended her career at Indy by winning three medals in the 2004 short course worlds inside then-Conseco Fieldhouse. The city is a “special place for me,” said Mintenko, the first female executive to lead USA Swimming’s national team division.\n\n“It’s a great way to showcase our sport and our athletes,” she said.\n\nFive Indiana high school graduates made the U.S. team last year, second only to California’s seven. Two others, Bloomington-based pros Zach Apple and Annie Lazor, won medals at Tokyo. The state features other rising young swimmers in the mix to make it to Paris in 2024.\n\nAlthough the Natatorium is only 40 years old, it is to this sport what Wrigley Field is to baseball or Lambeau Field to football. The tradition extends to names on the wall drawn by a calligrapher of those making Olympic teams.\n\nFor instance, Michael Phelps, at age 15, made the first of his five Olympic teams at the Natatorium in 2000. Organizers’ intention is to continue such a tradition, adding names from those making it at Lucas Oil.\n\nHinchey said the Natatorium is a possible site for the 2023 world team trials, an event that could thus create momentum for 2024.\n\nThere will be a World Championships in June 2022 at Budapest, Hungary, and in July 2023 at Fukuoka, Japan. The 2022 world team trials are April 26-30 at Greensboro, N.C.\n\nContact IndyStar reporter David Woods at david.woods@indystar.com.

The News Journal is publishing a series of articles this week by DSU leaders, alumni, students and supporters about the school's past, present and future. This op-ed was written by Wilma Mishoe, the 11th president of Delaware State University and the first woman to serve in that role.\n\n\"Enter to learn, go forth to serve.\"\n\nThe motto that stood at the entrance of Delaware State University for decades is etched on the heart of every student, faculty and staff member who has spent some of the most important moments in their life at 1200 North DuPont Highway. The simplicity of that concept is a powerful testament to the notion that access to quality education is fundamental to a healthy citizenry — “service above self.”\n\nThese notions have fueled our existence for 127 years, but that history pales in comparison to our ambitions.\n\nFor many years, separate but equal Delaware would not give students of color a chance to get a high school education, and only Howard High School and Delaware State College afforded us that opportunity.\n\nBefore the University of Delaware would accept a single African-American into its family, only Delaware State College would provide a comprehensive college degree, which made us the leading producers of black educators, nurses and social workers in the state.\n\nBefore anybody paid attention to the quality of our students or our faculty, we grew into a university with historic enrollment, a full complement of undergraduate and graduate options, a $22 million research portfolio, the most racially and ethnically diverse campus in the state, and one of the leading Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the country.\n\nStill, many call us the hidden gem, the school behind that brick wall on Route 13.\n\nMore op-eds\n\nDelaware progressives didn't get their revolution. What happens now?\n\nThis young entrepreneur is what Delaware's economy needs\n\nThe people of Ellendale deserve clean water\n\nI remember when Delaware State College became Delaware State University almost as if it were yesterday. I was about halfway through my career as a dean at Delaware Technical and Community College, and thinking about running for a seat on the Capital School Board of Education.\n\nWhen I saw Gov. Tom Carper and Delaware State University President William B. DeLauder sitting at the table to sign the document conferring university status, my mind went back to the 1960s, when I spent my teenage years growing up on the Dover campus.\n\nIn 1960 my father, Dr. Luna Mishoe, began what turned out to be a 27-year-long career as the college president. I would grow up on campus before I left to attend Howard University in 1967.\n\nAs I wander around the university’s main campus today, I am constantly struck by the similarities and differences I see. So many of our traditions and so many of the buildings (like Loockerman, Delaware and Grossley Halls) are still standing. But today they exist side by side with a new Martin Luther King Jr. Student Center, the glass-walled OSCAR Building and the Claibourne D. Smith Administration Building.\n\nGrossley Hall, which used to be my father’s office and held the registrar’s office, is today the new on-campus home of the Early College High School, International Programs, and a number of labs for Computer and Information Sciences.\n\nI take comfort in seeing some of the same trees that stood on campus 50 years ago throwing off shade like old friends.\n\nWatching the students hurrying to class and laughing with their friends, I am constantly struck with how different, yet unchanged, they are from the students who have always come to us. The clothes and hairstyles have changed, of course, and today’s students can’t be separated from their smartphones, but in essence they remain the same bright-eyed, curious and intent young people who have always sat in our classrooms.\n\nDelaware State College began its existence 127 years ago as the Delaware College for Colored Students, to subsequently be changed by the General Assembly in 1893 to the State College for Colored Students to avoid confusion with then-Delaware College (now the University of Delaware). If you were a Delaware citizen of African-American (or even Native American) descent and you wanted to work toward a college degree, Delaware State College was pretty much the only game in town.\n\nThe original allocation of funds from the General Assembly awarded Delaware State College just $1,000 in the 1893 budget (the University of Delaware received the princely sum of $6,000). There has always been disparity of funding for institutions that serve students like ours — promising young souls who have either been overlooked, underserved or underprepared. Our professional lives at Delaware State are spent balancing resources against revenue to ensure that they get the quality education they deserve.\n\nWe choose to focus on the opportunities we have, not the resources we have to scramble to assemble. And that focus shows up in our students every single day.\n\nBy 1987, when my father retired as president, it was clear that because of his leadership, the status and importance of Delaware State College was rising.\n\nHis successor, Dr. William B. DeLauder, took the next logical step. He instituted a major building program, boldly envisioned the elimination of internal streets to make Delaware State the tree-filled walking campus we see today, and pushed hard to obtain increased state funding, develop graduate programs and expand the campus’ physical infrastructure.\n\nDr. DeLauder knocked on every door in the state and became quickly convinced that, without growing the institution to university status, Delaware State College would never be recognized as the sole public land-grant institution in the state and the only one that could truly say that access to higher education did not depend on what you looked like, where you came from or how much money your parents had. He found a ready ally in then-Gov. Carper, who eagerly helped lobby the General Assembly to authorize the change.\n\nIt was not an easy sell in many quarters — even among the institution’s own faculty and staff. People worried about whether the institution was ready to take its rightful place. But neither Dr. DeLauder nor Gov. Carper would be deterred.\n\nTwenty-five years have more than proven the vision of these two men and the foundation of men and women upon whose shoulders they stand.\n\nToday, Delaware State University is approaching a historic enrollment of 5,000 — one of the only HBCUs in the nation to consistently increase the size of its student body over the past 10 years. The university awards multiple doctorates, conducts big-league research and is home to nationally recognized aviation, nursing and education programs, as well as internationally accredited business programs, among many others.\n\nYet our campus also retains that sense of family and community that has always made it special. Here is where you find the advisers, the professors, the financial aid staff and all the other people who are determined to support each and every student.\n\nHere is where you find students supporting each other in late-night study sessions. Here is where you find Inspire Scholars giving back thousands of hours in community service around Delaware.\n\nHere is where you find the young men and women who will help change our world.\n\nI have been away, but now I have come home. As the 11th president of Delaware State University, I have the charge of shepherding this great institution forward into the age of fully realized digital learning, online courses, and new fields of research and service.\n\nI am guided by the principle advanced by the great Christian writer, G.K. Chesterton, who considered education “the soul of a society as it passes from one generation to another.” Heart and soul, we anticipate even more than another 127 years of educating young people to “go forth and serve.”\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/ud/2017/05/21/towson-maryland-win-ncaa-lacrosse-quarterfinals-delaware-retiring-shillinglaw-honored/332698001/", "title": "Towson, Maryland win NCAA lacrosse quarterfinals at Delaware ...", "text": "NEWARK – Towson had just unleashed a six-goal first-quarter lacrosse barrage at Delaware Stadium on Sunday afternoon and led 8-2 at halftime.\n\nBut Delaware coach Bob Shillinglaw had every reason to smile.\n\nThe victim of the Tigers’ scoring frenzy was Syracuse in the first game of an NCAA Men’s Lacrosse Tournament quarterfinal double-header, not their rival Blue Hens.\n\nWhen Shillinglaw stepped onto the turf at halftime, it was to be honored by UD and the NCAA for “tireless commitment and long-time contributions” in his 39 years as Delaware coach, which followed three at Massachusetts Maritime.\n\nShillinglaw is retiring after having coached more games – 653 – than anyone in college lacrosse history. Delaware is in the process of searching for Shillinglaw’s successor.\n\nA videotape was shown on the scoreboard with highlights from Shillinglaw’s UD career, including messages from former players and staff members lauding Shillinglaw and expressing their love and appreciation.\n\nWhat it couldn’t capture was the contrast.\n\nBASEBALL: Ex-Hen Chad Kuhl quiets Phillies\n\nHIGH SCHOOLS: Stars shine at state track meet\n\nWhen Shillinglaw was hired as Delaware coach before the 1979 season, he suggested to wife Tina “We’ll be here for three years” before moving on to something bigger and better.\n\nBut he sensed he was landing in fertile ground, even though the state then had just two high school boys teams – at Cape Henlopen and now-closed Broadmeadow in Middletown.\n\nBack then lacrosse was still primarily rooted in the Baltimore area, with other strong pockets in Long Island and upstate New York, and some teams in suburban Philadelphia.\n\n“I really felt like lacrosse could make it here,” said Shillinglaw, who was named USILA national coach of the year after his first Blue Hen team went 13-2. “Through the course of the years you see it not only with our team but in 1984 they had the NCAA championship game here [at Delaware Stadium], it was packed. Two years later they had the first Final Four, it was here. Fortunately, the university began reaching out and began realizing lacrosse could be a big-time sport here.’’\n\nShillinglaw’s Delaware teams made six NCAA tournaments, most recently in 2010 and 2011 but highlighted by that Final Four appearance 10 years ago this month, and captured 16 conference titles.\n\n“I felt that it could grow and it’s a sport that you fall in love with,” said Shillinglaw, a Severna Park, Maryland, native and former University of North Carolina lacrosse defenseman and captain. “It’s exciting. Most importantly it’s fun to play. No wonder it’s grown nationwide.’’\n\nUnseeded Towson (12-4) went on to down No. 2 Syracuse 10-7 to advance to next weekend’s Final Four at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts. Towson will play Ohio State, which actually has a player from Delaware – Salesianum graduate Fred Freibott, a defender.\n\nDelaware had seen the Tigers’ firepower late in their 10-6 win here April 15 in a game that had been tied 5-5 before a late five-goal Towson outburst.\n\nIn the second game of the double-header, top-seeded Maryland downed No. 8 Albany 18-9 and moves on to meet Denver.\n\nAlbany 17th-year coach Scott Marr, a former Johns Hopkins attackman, began his coaching career on Shillinglaw’s UD staff from 1992-94. During that time he met his future wife, Traci Tomashek, a former Newark High and University of Delaware volleyball standout.\n\n“What I got out of Bob was how much he cared about his players and his alumni, and how he treated people,” Marr said.\n\nHe added that Shillinglaw’s humor and perspective kept the atmosphere fun and “let me enjoy life as an assistant and really grow.”\n\n“He’s done so many things for the game, being on [NCAA] committees and for youth in the state of Delaware, which really had no lacrosse other than the university,” Marr said of Shillinglaw. “When I was here we had started a youth program and did a lot of camps and clinics. Now you see kids from Delaware all over the place playing in college. He really brought lacrosse to the state of Delaware. You can’t even measure the number of people he impacted.”\n\nDelaware now has 45 high school boys teams and numerous youth programs to help feed them skilled players. Shillinglaw has also long been one of the Delaware Lacrosse Foundation’s primary leaders.\n\n“I’m just proud of the fact the state has embraced it, the administration has embraced it,” Shillinglaw said. “It’s grown, still growing, still have to get more going.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

The launch ended an era for Delaware's historical chemical giant and a change in the largest tenant of the 13-story DuPont Building at 1007 N. Market St., the headquarters of DuPont since 1908. With the spinoff, the DuPont headquarters moved to suburban Chestnut Run and Chemours moved into the former space.\n\nThe question now is: Can Chemours – which has 9,100 employees, including 1000 in Delaware – survive the transition as an independent operation? The company takes over some of the products that helped DuPont become a global chemical leader, including Teflon, the lubricant Krytox, synthetic rubber Viton and refrigerant Opteon.\n\nThe spinoff, DuPont officials have said, was needed so they could restructure and focus on faster-growing and better-performing parts of the company that have stable earnings. The challenge is that Chemours, with 37 sites and more than 5,000 customers, has inherited a score of the tricky problems that dogged DuPont, including up to $1 billion in environmental liabilities accrued from 200 years of manufacturing.\n\nChemours assumes the legal and remediation costs for 190 contaminated sites across the country. Environmental costs have sapped nearly $300 million from DuPont's budget, and the company acknowledged in a regulatory filing that cleanup and other expenses could surpass $1 billion.\n\nJim B. Shein, a professor of business strategy at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Illinois, said only a handful companies have transferred liabilities to a spinoff. It could become something of a model if DuPont revenue improves, he said. But there are risks.\n\n\"From the standpoint of DuPont, this is a smart move,\" Shein said. \"From the standpoint of Chemours, I'm not so sure. It's an interesting way to get rid of the liabilities.\"\n\nChemours Chief Executive Officer Mark Vergnano in an interview with The News Journal said he's confident the company's legal team will be able to minimize additional lawsuits. Many attorneys were brought on from DuPont and are credited with tamping down litigation threats, he said.\n\n\"There has been a lot of noise in the press about this, but I'm not worried,\" he said. \"The liabilities have been managed extremely well for years and years.\"\n\nOverall, the company faces a $4 billion debt load, or about 4.5 times its pretax earnings. Bank covenants typically stipulate that a corporation's debt-to-earnings ratio does not exceed five times.\n\nDavid Wessels, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said that may be indicate Chemours will be making changes.\n\n\"When you have a highly leveraged company, there will be a focus on the short-term and pushing to meet its debt obligation,\" Wessels said. \"That could cause some painful changes over the short term. When you have that much debt, you need to think carefully about how you spend your money.\"\n\nThe debt issue came up earlier this year when activist investor Nelson Peltz, who was trying to land four seats on the DuPont board, said the chemical company was saddling Chemours with too much debt. Historically, DuPont avoided a high debt-to-earnings ratio, arguing heavy debt could reduce growth by requiring a large amount of cash to pay it down.\n\nVergnano said he's developed an 18-month plan to increase revenue and cut costs, slicing the debt-to-earnings ratio to three. He said DuPont assigned the debt by estimating Chemours' earnings based on income projections.\n\n\"Right now we are a BB-rated company,\" he said, citing the rating awarded by Standard & Poor's \"We want to be a strong BB-rated company and with the plans we have, I think we are going to be there.\"\n\nMarket fluctuations also a factor\n\nAnalysts have raised concerns about the fluctuating market for its lead product, titanium dioxide, or Ti02, a pigment used in cosmetics, coatings, plastics, toothpaste and sunscreen. Demand had dropped, and competition from foreign markets have increased. In response, Chemours is building a $600 million plant in Altamira, Mexico. A UBS Global Research analyst report estimates the plant could reduce production costs by as much as $70 million by using a lower quality ore to make Ti02.\n\nQuestions also remain about whether Chemours can generate enough cash to pay a $100 million dividend its shareholders were told to expect in September. Both UBS and Credit Suisse Securities & Research Analytics issued reports predicting Chemours will cut the dividend.\n\nVergnano said the $100 million dividend will be paid this fall, and the Chemours board will determine the amount of future dividends at the first board meeting.\n\nWessels said the concern is whether Chemours can pay the dividend without resorting to cuts.\n\n\"This is about making sure the revenue is in place to support to the company,\" he said.\n\nJohn Roberts, an analyst at UBS, said Chemours may not be able to pay the dividend without reducing it, borrowing from the debt revolver or slashing costs.\n\n\"Our models show, initially, Chemours doesn't generate enough cashflow to generate the level of dividend that DuPont has set,\" Roberts said.\n\nVergnano expects to cut $40 million in overhead costs by the end of 2015 and $80 million of overhead by the end of 2016. Among the areas where Vergnano sees cuts is less money spent on attorneys to protect intellectual property and fewer information technology servers.\n\n\"Our costs have to be in line with a commodity chemical company,\" he said.\n\nDuPont reduced Chemours' costs before the spinoff by slashing between 5 and 7 percent of the unit's worldwide workforce. Vergnano declined to say if more employee cuts are coming.\n\n\"We haven't made any decisions if there will be more people cut because we are concentrating on our other costs associated with reduction,\" he said. \"That is part of this 18-month plan.\"\n\nThe plan also calls for Chemours to reinvest profits into research and expand into new product markets. For example, Chemours is only one of two manufacturers to produce a chemical to meet the European Union's Mobile Air Condition Directive that automobile air conditioning units generate fewer emissions. All vehicles sold in Europe starting in 2017 will be required to use this chemical in the units.\n\n\"Think of production starting now and peaking in 2018,\" Vergnano said. \"That is a strong revenue upside for us.\"\n\nThe CEO added that Chemours' chemical solutions unit is strong. Vergnano noted the company's sodium cyanide product, used in the extraction of gold, has been sold out over the last three years.\n\n\"We feel, unlike DuPont, our chemicals solutions portfolio is a very investable business,\" he added.\n\nIs Chemours better off remaining independent?\n\nVergnano rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange Monday morning, two days before company shares began being traded. DuPont Chair and CEO Ellen Kullman rang the closing bell the same day.\n\n\"Starting July 1, we become a significantly different company that is more growth-driven, more science intensive and less cyclical – with a strong focus on the areas of major need where our science and engineering can uniquely make a difference,\" she said.\n\nThe new signage on the DuPont Building was installed Tuesday.\n\nVergnano said he's confident the company will be successful.\n\n\"We are a very strong cash-generating company that is in very good shape,\" he said. \"We are the market leaders in our business sectors, and we will continue to be the leaders in those markets.\"\n\nAlan Levin, who headed the Delaware Economic Development Office, said Chemours has a good plan and solid leaders. The business is so important, Levin said, that he's spent time ensuring the company remains in Delaware, after word began circulating other areas were being considered for its permanent headquarters.\n\n\"You can't assume what the professors and analysts say is going to be fact,\" said Levin, who ended his time as economic director Tuesday. \"I think Chemours has a good game plan for operation. Their business plan and management team is very solid.\"\n\nIf Chemours opts to stay in the short term, it could depart in the long term if it is acquired by another company. Some analysts have mentioned Tronox, a DuPont competitor and the world's largest producer of titanium dioxide, as a potential acquirer.\n\nDuPont structured Chemours as a tax-free spinoff. That means if Chemours is acquired within two years after the separation, DuPont will have to pay a high-tax penalty. Vergnano said the company is committed to remaining independent regardless of the potential tax burden.\n\nWessels remains concerned because \"Chemours is in a global market and has to fight for its survival.\"\n\n\"Every day the board must ask, is Chemours better being independent or it better being part of another organization?\" he said, adding later, \"Can Chemours compete? Yes, but the competition will be intense and brutal.\"\n\nContact Jeff Mordock at (302) 324-2786, on Twitter @JeffMordockTNJ or jmordock@delawareonline.com.\n\nABOUT CHEMOURS CO.\n\nWhat: Performance chemical division spun off from the DuPont Co.\n\nHeadquarters: DuPont Building in Wilmington\n\nEmployees: 9,100, including 1000 in Delaware\n\nSome of its products: Teflon; the lubricant Krytox; synthetic rubber Viton; refrigerant Opteon; titanium dioxide, or Ti02, a pigment used in cosmetics, coatings, plastics, toothpaste and sunscreen\n\nLocations: 37 sites\n\nCustomers: More than 5,000 customers", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/high-school/2018/03/09/25-years-after-baffones-3-pointer-first-game-there/398698002/", "title": "25 years after Baffone's 3-pointer in first game, 'The Bob' still high ...", "text": "Twenty-five years ago, on March 11, 1993, Brandon Baffone launched a winning 3-pointer at the buzzer, baptizing the Bob Carpenter Center in Newark in unforgettable fashion.\n\nThe shot lifted Salesianum over Sanford in the state semifinals and was the first high school basketball game played in the new University of Delaware arena, with its gleaming hardwood floor, bright lights and cozy folding seats.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/small-business/2016/11/20/carvertise-looks-shift-gears-2017/94068626/", "title": "Carvertise looks to shift gears in 2017", "text": "Scott Goss\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThe past year has been a wild ride for Carvertise.\n\nThe Wilmington startup that turns private vehicles into rolling billboards opened a new headquarters, doubled the size of its small staff, quadrupled the drivers it has on the road and expanded its market reach from four states to 10.\n\nBut all CEO Mac Nagaswami wants to talk about is his new printer.\n\n“We had to move it out of the office because some of the girls were complaining about the fumes,” the 25-year-old entrepreneur said with a chuckle as he turned on the lights in a back office at Hercules Plaza on North Market Street.\n\n“I love coming back here,” he said. “This printer changes everything for us.”\n\nSTORY: Delaware inventors aim to reduce police-involved shootings\n\nSTORY: STAR campus attracts 12 promising startups\n\nSimilar in appearance to a synthesizer without any keys, the device doesn’t look like a game changer.

Carvertise also landed financial backing from principals with Leading Edge Ventures, one of the few venture capital firms in Delaware.\n\nWith nearly 60 ad campaigns under its belt, the company is now beginning to plot its move from a lean startup with a dozen employees to a major player in the industry.\n\nThat’s exactly the type of business development that governor-elect John Carney and the Delaware Business Roundtable, a collection of 50 local CEOs, have promoted as the future of the state’s economy.\n\n“I think Carvertise is a great case study of the potential that exists when all the pieces are aligned and working together,” said Dan Freeman, who heads UD’s Horn Program. “I couldn’t be prouder to be associated with those guys.”\n\nFor all its promise, Carvertise’s business model is deceptively simple.\n\nThe company recruits private drivers online and then pays them a flat rate of about $100 a month to wrap what are essentially large vinyl stickers around their personal vehicles. Using GPS tracking devices and available traffic reports, Carvertise is then able to provide clients with detailed analytics about how many miles those ads traveled with estimates on the total number of people who viewed the campaign.\n\nThe advantage over billboards, Nagaswami says, is that advertisers are able to more specifically target certain areas at specific times. The rolling ads also are harder to ignore when they’re passing potential customers, rather than the other way around.\n\nSome of Carvertise’s first clients were Shop-Rite, Wilmington University and various state agencies. A handful of customers in Philadelphia, northeast Maryland and South Jersey soon followed.\n\nThen last spring, the company got a cold call from Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota.\n\n“They had a concert series they wanted to advertise and just found us online,” Nagaswami said.\n\nCarvertise recruited and screened 45 drivers through online job postings and social media. Wrapping was handled by a shop halfway across the country – all without anyone from Carvertise leaving Delaware.\n\nThe same remote model has since been used to promote a luxury apartment complex in Pittsburgh and a financial tech company in Houston. Integrity Staffing Solutions, a $600 million temp agency based in Newark, recently hired Carvertise to conduct ad campaigns in Indiana, Minnesota, Kentucky and Ohio.\n\nThe wider market reach has translated into a much deeper pool of drivers. Nearly 60,000 people have signed up to drive for Carvertise – a number that’s growing by nearly 300 a day.\n\nWhile less than 5 percent will be invited to participate, the sheer volume means Carvertise is now able to tailor its campaigns in new ways.\n\n“We always knew our clients would use us to get exposure in a certain geographic space,” Nagaswami said. “But now they want us to go a step deeper by using a certain type of driver.”\n\nColleges, for instance, are choosing to use student drivers commuting to campus. A pharmaceutical company might select health care professionals who work at hospitals. And a retailer can target soccer moms running errands or attending youth sporting events.\n\n“It makes perfect sense,” Nagaswami said. “These are people who are already going to places that are thick with the exact target demo our clients are looking to reach.”\n\nMajor corporations, venture capital firms and other budding entrepreneurs are beginning to take notice of Carvertise’s success.\n\nNagaswami said he’s received about 30 inquiries in the last year from entrepreneurs around the world who are looking to franchise Carvertise in their own countries, ranging from Pakistan and the Czech Republic to Mongolia and Mozambique.\n\n“That’s just one of many options that are on the table for us,” he said. “We’re just beginning to have those conversations now.”\n\nOne choice would be to stay the course and continue growing at a steady, organic pace. The company also is weighing whether to undertake a major expansion financed through venture capital. And a partnership with a Fortune 500 media company willing to add rolling billboards to their marketing mix is not out of the question.\n\n“The only thing that’s holding us back right now are constrained resources,” Nagaswami said. “We’ve added six employees in the last year, but we still need a bigger team.”\n\nGrowing an advertising company outside the industry's poles in New York or Los Angeles might seem counter-intuitive. But Nagaswami said Carvertise owes its success to growing up outside those markets.\n\n“In those places, we would have been just another startup fighting to get noticed,” he said.\n\n“Delaware is a market that values hard work, personal connections and generating an actual cash flow,” Nagaswami said. “That forced us to focus on business fundamentals from the very beginning, and I firmly believe that’s been the key to getting us where we are today.”\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/eagles/2023/10/31/eagles-howie-roseman-outfoxed-nfl-trade-deadline-frenzy-kevin-byard-julio-jones-kentavius-street/71299166007/", "title": "How Eagles Howie Roseman outfoxed foes during NFL trade ...", "text": "PHILADELPHIA − The final hours before the trade deadline were frenetic for the NFL, but anti-climactic for the Eagles.\n\nThat's because their work was already done in the days and weeks before.\n\nThey had accomplished their main goals − adding a significant piece to their secondary in the trade for safety Kevin Byard last Tuesday, and getting another draft pick by trading little-used defensive tackle Kentavius Street on Monday.\n\nThey also signed veteran free agents in Julio Jones, one of the most prolific wide receivers in NFL history, and nickel corner Bradley Roby, who missed the last two games with a shoulder injury.\n\nThat, in a way, is Eagles general manager Howie Roseman at his finest as he continues to play chess while the rest of the NFL is playing checkers.\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nDEADLINE FLURRY?Eagles trade a defensive tackle as NFL deadline nears. 6 more players to target, 4 to sell\n\nAJ BROWN'S DAY:How Eagles showed benefits from NFL trade deadline in AJ Brown’s record-setting game\n\nOh, there were a flurry of deals on Tuesday. The mediocre Minnesota Vikings traded for essentially a backup quarterback after Kirk Cousins' season-ending injury. They also traded away one of their best offensive linemen.\n\nThe Eagles' NFC East foe Washington Commanders essentially waved the white flag by trading both of their defensive ends in Montez Sweat to Chicago and Chase Young to San Francisco.\n\nToo bad the Eagles already played the Commanders twice. And now they'll have to face Young for a third time this season when they face the 49ers on Dec. 3.\n\nThat came one day after the Giants sent defensive lineman Leonard Williams to Seattle, taking away two games that the Eagles don't have to deal with him chasing after Jalen Hurts, although they will face Williams in Seattle on Dec. 17.\n\nCertainly, those trades benefitted two of the Eagles' main competitors in the NFC as the Seahawks are 5-2 and the 49ers are 5-3.\n\nBut at what cost? And you can argue the Eagles helped themselves just as much, if not more, by getting Byard and Jones without giving up nearly as much.\n\nSeattle gave up a second-round pick in 2024 and a fifth-round pick in 2025 for Williams, while the 49ers gave up a third-rounder for Young.\n\nThe Eagles gave up a fifth- and sixth-round pick for Byard, in addition to veteran safety Terrell Edmunds.\n\nBut this is where Roseman's mastery helped the Eagles in the future.\n\nThe Eagles traded Street, who had no future in Philadelphia, and got a sixth-round pick in return. The Eagles also sent a 2025 seventh-round pick to Atlanta in the deal.\n\nStreet’s departure also provides an opportunity for seventh-round pick Moro Ojomo to play. No doubt, Roseman would have traded defensive end Derek Barnett to give Nolan Smith more playing time, too.\n\nThe Eagles traded Edmunds, who also had no future in Philadelphia, to help get Byard.\n\nAs former 76ers TV announcer Marc Zumoff used to say, the Eagles \"turned garbage into gold.\"\n\nThat's not a knock on Street nor Edmunds. But the Eagles could have easily cut both at the end of training camp and gotten nothing in return.\n\nInstead, they kept both as depth during the season, then used them as needed during the season. Then they moved on from them, given younger players a chance to play while also getting something in return.\n\nAll of the maneuvering helped the Eagles finally become whole at safety now that Byard is paired with Reed Blankenship, who returned after missing a game with a ribs injury. Blankenship also missed a game earlier in the season for the same reason.\n\nByard and Blankenship started and played every defensive snap against the Commanders, a 38-31 Eagles win. So he has one game under his belt as the Eagles face the Dallas Cowboys this Sunday, followed by a bye week before facing Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs on Nov. 20.\n\nByard's impact has been noticeable in just one week, both on and off the field.\n\n\"He's been such a great leader,\" Eagles defensive coordinator Sean Desai said Tuesday. \"He's really stepping in and taking ownership of a lot of things, really putting the time in to work and learn the defense, and do all the stuff that you would expect a pro to do.\n\n\"He's been a consummate pro. ... He'll continue to get better, and that's the great part about this. We're into Week 9 here, and we're still growing. We're still not a final product. I think that's an exciting part that we'll keep climbing each week.\"\n\nConsider that the week before, against the Miami Dolphins, the Eagles started Edmunds and rookie Sydney Brown at safety, with Mekhi Garner, an undrafted free agent at cornerback, who is still on the practice squad, as the third safety.\n\nThe addition of Jones at wide receiver has had a similar impact.\n\nJones scored a critical touchdown with 7:17 left in the fourth quarter. But Jones' impact goes well beyond that. He's in his 13th season and is the NFL's active leader in receiving yards with 13,640, ranking 16th all-time.\n\nBut the Eagles also needed a roster spots for Jones, who only had one practice-squad elevation left. The Eagles promoted Jones on Wednesday.\n\nIn addition, the Eagles will also need spots for right guard Cam Jurgens’ return from injured reserve (the Eagles opened his 21-day practice window Wednesday), and the eventual returns of safety Justin Evans and wide receiver Quez Watkins, both eligible to come off IR soon.\n\nEagles offensive coordinator Brian Johnson saw Jones' impact on the wide receivers when practically the entire offense rushed into the end zone to celebrate with him.\n\n\"He's been great to be around,\" Johnson said. \"An unbelievable person, he works extremely hard. He fits in the room ... You saw the reaction of our team once he scored, and everybody kind of ran out and celebrated. It was awesome to see. It just showed the amount of respect, the amount of connection that we have as a team.\"\n\nAs for the draft capital, the Eagles were expected to have 10 draft picks in 2024. They were down to eight after the trade for Byard, including none in the sixth or seventh rounds.\n\nBy trading Street, the Eagles got a sixth-rounder back.\n\nIt's not like the Eagles are expected to strike gold with that pick. But it's an asset that Roseman can either use on a pick, or to trade for either another player or draft pick next spring.\n\nAfter all, it's that type of pick that got the Eagles the safety they desperately needed to enhance their Super Bowl run in the first place.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

I’d been through a lot to get here.\n\n“But I’m glad this year I’m going to be healthy at the end of the season, whereas the previous few years I started to die out.”\n\nRanked ninth in the National Field Hockey Coaches Association Top 20 poll, the Blue Hens (10-2) have grand ambitions. After making three straight NCAA tournaments, they hope to get past the round-of-16 for the first time in that span, after nearly doing so last year.\n\nTwo tests loom less than 24 hours apart this weekend when No. 10-ranked Michigan (7-4) visits Rullo Stadium at 4 p.m. Saturday. The Hens then host CAA rival Hofstra at 1:30 Sunday.\n\n“It’s great to have her back,” Delaware coach Rolf van de Kerkhof said. “We know there’s still another cycle that she has to get back into the swing of things – fine tuning, connecting, synching with her teammates, which she was able to do so well last year. In the games she’s been back you start to see moments where it’s clicking. We just want her to be close to 100 percent when we get to conference tournament play and, hopefully, NCAA play. That was the whole plan from day one.’’\n\nWinesett had been feeling dull pain when, after her freshman season in February of 2014, she injured her back shoveling snow.\n\n“I knew right away something was wrong,” she said, “but also a lot of the pain was in my leg, so never having a back injury before I didn’t think that’s what it was necessarily.’’\n\nTurned out she had a herniated disc.\n\nPhysical therapy and cortisone injections provide relief and got Winesett through her sophomore season. The following winter, in early 2015, she had surgery.\n\n“I felt really good after that,” she said. “I played my junior season after my surgery. I didn’t feel 100 percent but I definitely felt better than my sophomore year, before the surgery.”\n\nBut when the pain increased last spring, an MRI revealed a re-herniation, which doctors told Winesett is not unusual.\n\n“That was when the question of playing again came in,” said Winesett. “When I went in Doc [Andrew Reisman from UD sports medicine], he asked me ‘Is it worth it?’, chasing a ball around. So that was tough. This whole season, I was unsure how it was going to go. It was another round of PT, cortisone and right now is the best I’ve felt in a really long time.”\n\nAmong the therapies Winesett has used is “cupping,” which became widely known during the Summer Olympics because of the purple bruises on swimmer Michael Phelps’ skin.\n\n“It doesn’t feel good when you’re getting it, you’re kind of cringing the whole time,” she said, “but it feels really nice afterward.”\n\nThe Chinese technique, in which suction cups are placed against the skin to draw blood from capillaries there, is believed to soothe soreness, speed healing and provide more flexibility by aiding circulation.\n\n“Postgame, I’ve been feeling really, really good,” she said. “I’m more worried about being tired the next day because I’m still trying to get in shape.”\n\nEntering this season, Winesett had scored 26 goals and dealt 17 assists in her UD career, including a school freshman record nine assists in 2013. She had a career-high 10 goals last season.\n\n“She’s a great team player and she keeps it simple,” van de Kerkhof said.\n\nIn Sunday’s 3-2 overtime win at William & Mary, Winesett scored her first goal since returning to action this season on Sept. 23 against Albany.\n\n“It was nice to be back on the field and those CAA games are awesome enough without scoring,” Winesett said. “For me, it wasn’t actually getting a goal, it was that’s one thing less to worry about. You can play without that in the back of your head.”\n\nA human services major with a public policy minor, Winesett has also been a National College Honor Society selection. She hopes to work for a non-governmental organization non-profit after she graduates.\n\nWinesett took a unique route to being a scholarship field hockey player. She actually never played on a field hockey team until ninth grade at Westfield High near her Centerville, Virginia, home. She had played roller, in-line and ice hockey, often with her brothers and male cousins, making her quite adept at stick-handling and other relatable skills.\n\n“I got to the point where I wasn’t going to play hockey with all the boys, how can I channel this into something else,” she said, “and I picked up field hockey so easily.”\n\nWhen recruiting Winesett, van de Kerkhof observed a player who would do “whatever she has to do to put the ball in the goal cage,” he said.\n\nShe chose Delaware because van de Kerkhof pitched his vision of Delaware being a national power. Winesett ended up playing a key role in that and is thankful, despite her injury, she should be able to complete her career that way.\n\n“It’s really weird actually seeing it happen,” she said. “You get recruited by all these schools and they tell you what’s going to happen in the future. We were ranked in the 30s as a freshman when I got here and now to see us No. 9, it’s pretty neat to be a part of it. I was more excited to be a part of a growing program rather than one that was already established.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

Those commitments were still considered valid by UD and each player had the chance to speak with successor Ryan Carty, the former Blue Hens quarterback whose hiring was announced Dec. 10.\n\nNine players had originally verbally committed.\n\n“I’d say what impressed me was his responsiveness, attention to detail, wanting to learn about who I am and his commitment to winning and the passion for the university being an alumni,” said Dominic Brogna, the defensive lineman out of Bergen Catholic in northern New Jersey.\n\nA second Signing Day looms Feb. 2 when Delaware could add more recruits. But that isn’t the only avenue to replenish the roster.\n\nDelaware has already lost two players through the transfer portal – linebacker Colby Reeder to Iowa State and kicker Ryan Coe to Cincinnati – with more departures possible. But it’s also a potential place for replacements.\n\n“We will be able to attract whatever needs we have, however we need to do it, in the near future,” Carty told Delawareonline/The News Journal, referring to both the next Signing Day and the transfer portal.\n\nBrogna was joined by Dover High tight end Elijah Sessoms; Thomas Chernasky, another tight end from Western Wayne High in Moscow, Pennsylvania; Isaiah Cherry, a wide receiver/defensive back from John F. Kennedy in Iselin, New Jersey; Steve Dembowksi, an offensive lineman at Pascack Valley in Montvale, New Jersey; and defensive back Gary Seigler from Benedictine in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nWide receiver/defensive back Shoes Brinkley, the Philadelphian who played this fall at Mater Dei in Santa Ana, California, and had more than a dozen FBS offers, gave Delaware a seventh signee several days l.\n\n“Each member embodies both the quality of player and person that we want to represent Delaware football,” Carty said in a UD press release. “I've been able to connect with each of them and can't wait to get a chance to meet them in person on campus. They are going to be joining at such an exciting and important time in our team’s journey. I'm certain that they will add to our talent and buy into our mentality and vision of this storied program.”\n\nSeigler came away from his discussions with Carty “very pleased at what he had to say,” he said. “We spoke about myself and he got to know me. He seemed like a great person and the type of coach I would trust and play for. He told me that he was ready to get straight to work and I have no doubt that he is the guy for the job.”\n\nDembowski appreciated Carty’s “high expectations for winning on and off of the field,” he said.\n\n“Knowing that he was a winning Blue Hen,” he added, “wants the same for our current team and values family is also key for me. As an offensive lineman, I am so excited to learn more about the high-energy offense he runs, too.”\n\nCarty came to Delaware after stints as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at New Hampshire and Sam Houston, where his teams often piled up yards and points. UNH reached the FCS semifinals in 2013 and 2014 and Sam Houston was spring 2021 FCS champ.\n\nIn discussing his recruiting philosophy during his introductory press conference Monday, Carty said keeping Delaware’s best players at home will be a priority.\n\n“First and foremost, if there is a scholarship level athlete in the state of Delaware, he can’t leave,” Carty said.\n\nDelaware’s recruiting focus will remain in the Mid-Atlantic area, long viewed as a deep reservoir of football talent. It's where his UD coaching predecessors, naturally, drew their rosters from almost entirely.\n\n“I know the national championship team that we had here [in 2003], the teams I had that were successful at New Hampshire and the teams in the CAA that are successful are made up of mostly the guys in this area,” said Carty, a former record-setting quarterback at Somerville High in New Jersey.\n\nBut K.C. Keeler, Delaware’s coach from 2002-12, whom Carty played for and served under at Sam Houston, did make Florida and Georgia key recruiting areas as well for Delaware during his stint. And Carty, having also now spent his last four years in Texas, another football hotbed, promised to not limit his scope.\n\n“There are some opportunities in other places for sure,” Carty said. “The beauty of college football now and the beauty of Twitter, social media, is you don’t really have to spend three weeks in a state to go recruit somebody. There’s recruiting services. There’s ways to find people and it’s something you can kind of pick and choose and can still be very, very diligent and detailed in your evaluation process.”\n\nTwo Delaware commits who re-opened their recruiting after Rocco’s dismissal ended up at FBS schools. Wide receiver Justin Joly of Iona Prep (New Rochelle, New York) landed at Connecticut and Monroe College linebacker Jalen Stewart, out of Freedom High in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is bound for Massachusetts.\n\nUConn and UMass are former league rivals of Delaware that moved up to the FBS level but now operate as independents without league affiliation.

The top-seeded Bearkats (11-0) host Montana State on Saturday in the FCS quarterfinals after rolling up 556 total yards in a 49-42 second-round win over Incarnate Word.\n\nCarty will remain with Sam Houston through the playoffs. While it was initially expected Carty may retain UD offensive coordinator Jared Ambrose and defensive coordinator Manny Rojas, that is now uncertain.\n\nNOT GOOD ENOUGH: Hens couldn’t meet UD standard under Rocco\n\nPreviously, Carty spent 11 seasons at New Hampshire, Delaware’s Colonial Athletic Association rival. Hired by then-Wildcats offensive coordinator Chip Kelly, Carty helped orchestrate what was annually one of the nation’s more imaginative, explosive and diverse offenses. Carty was offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach his last six seasons there. UNH made the NCAA playoffs each season of Carty’s Durham tenure, including the 2013 and 2014 semifinals.\n\nCarty threw for 3,504 yards and a New Jersey record 43 touchdowns as a Somerville High senior and was in Raymond’s final recruiting class before his February 2002, retirement. That spring, while still in high school, Carty would often attend UD practices trying to get an early education on new coach K.C. Keeler’s no-huddle spread offense.\n\nHis Somerville coach was dad Kevin Carty Sr., a well-known New Jersey college and high school coach. Older brothers Kevin Jr., who played quarterback at North Carolina and William & Mary, and Sean, a Rutgers wide receiver, previously starred at Sommerville and are now New Jersey high school coaches.\n\nCarty red-shirted as a UD freshman in 2002 and then was No. 2 behind Andy Hall, Sonny Riccio and Joe Flacco the next four seasons. He received most of his playing time in 2003 backing up Hall for Delaware’s NCAA champions, including throwing his lone career touchdown pass to Joey Bleymaier to close the first-round playoff win over Southern Illinois.\n\nFor his career, Carty played in 14 games and rushed for 119 yards and two touchdowns and threw for 192 yards. He was a co-captain as a senior in 2006, when he backed up junior first-year starter Joe Flacco.\n\n\"Ryan is clearly an incredible coach,\" Rawak wrote in a letter to UD fans, \" known for his high-octane offense and explosive plays which are only matched by his energy and love for football.\n\n\"He has been to two national championship games and won them both. He is incredibly smart, driven and humble. But what separates Ryan as the absolute best choice amongst a terrific group of applicants - was that he is one of us.''\n\nThe six seasons Carty directed the New Hampshire attack, it finished every year in the CAA's top five in total offense. Delaware has finished in the top five in CAA total offense just once since 2010, and that was in the 2021 spring season.\n\n“Ryan is as good as an offensive football coach that I’ve been around in my 40 years,” said Sean McDonnell, who recently retired after serving as UNH head coach since 1999, in UD’s announcement. “He’s smart, creative, hardworking and great with the players. He brings an exciting element to the long, storied history of Delaware football.”\n\nAt Sam Houston the last four years, Carty's offenses averaged 419.8, 428.0, 440.3 and 490.1 yards per game. Delaware averaged 299.8 this season.\n\nNow he'll be front and center trying to bring the Blue Hens back into the national limelight, but that job will go well beyond X's and O's.\n\nWith the indoor Delaware Field House practice facility and recent opening of the Whitney Athletic Center, which has state-of-the-art medical, conditioning and academic support apparatus, the Blue Hens have the proper foundation. Delaware is also annually among the best-funded FCS programs.\n\nYet, its fortunes have waned.\n\nROCCO FIRED: Delaware football coach gone 5-6 fall\n\nDelaware reached the NCAA playoffs 20 times in the 38 seasons from 1973-2010, including a Division II title under Raymond in 1979 and the 2003 I-AA (now FCS) championship in 2003 under Keeler, who has been Sam Houston coach since 2014. Delaware also lost NCAA title games in 1974, 1978, 1982, 2007 and 2010 and has had 10 semifinal appearances.\n\nBefore that, the Blue Hens won wire-service national titles in 1946 under coach Bill Murray, in 1963 when Dave Nelson was coach and in 1971 and 1972 under Raymond. A back-up quarterback at Michigan during his playing days, Raymond had been Nelson's top offensive assistant for a dozen years before being elevated to the top job.\n\nMurray, Nelson and Raymond are College Football Hall of Famers. Also, the Delaware Wing-T offense, conceived by Nelson and honed by Raymond, became an iconic feature of the Hens’ success that spread to all levels of football.\n\nBut Delaware has reached the postseason just twice since 2010, in 2018 and the spring of 2021. Delaware went 7-1 and made the FCS semifinals in the spring.\n\nHowever, a 5-6 finish this fall, the second losing record in three years, led to Rocco’s dismissal after five seasons. Under Rocco, Delaware was 31-23 overall and 20-16 in CAA games.\n\nDelaware has also seen its attendance plummet. Home crowds averaged 12,844 in the fall of 2021, Delaware’s lowest since 1968 (10,810) and nearly 10,000 below the record 22,280 in 2004. Rawak has said winning regularly is the first step toward changing that.\n\nSigning day for high school Class of 2022 recruits is Dec. 15, adding to the urgency in getting a new coach in place. Rocco and his staff received verbal commitments from nine prospects but one has already chosen a different school and another has de-committed.\n\n\"I feel like he’s going to be a good fit for the program and I feel like he will get the program back to being a winning program,\" said incoming tight end Elijah Sessoms of Dover High on Friday.\n\nThere has also been a parade to the transfer portal, where Blue Hens such as linebacker Colby Reeder, quarterback Nolan Henderson, wide receiver Thyrick Pitts, safety Noah Plack and linebacker Johnny Buchanan put their names to see what other opportunities exist. Carty actually recruited and offered Henderson a scholarship when he was coaching at UNH.\n\nAll have quickly received a succession of notable offers. Delaware has already lost kicker Ryan Coe to Cincinnati. Reeder, the Salesianum School graduate, is reportedly closely eyeing Rutgers, Iowa State and Kansas State.\n\nRawak had said the new coach needed to be “someone that really understands the traditions of football [at Delaware] and understands what we have here, the talent we have here and is able to really maximize that talent.” Rawak had also suggested that coaches with proven offensive backgrounds may be particularly suitable.\n\nAll that made Carty a leading candidate, despite his lack of head coaching experience. There was considerable fanfare to bring back Keeler, who was fired as Delaware coach in January 2013, and remains a popular figure, especially with Delaware's lack of success since. Any effort to do that, however, was nixed by influential UD leadership, Delawareonline/The News Journal learned.\n\nOddly, neither the letter to UD fans nor the press announcement said Carty served under former UD coach Keeler at Sam Houston.\n\nNonetheless, Carty's selection will appeal to many UD fans and former players.\n\n\"Ryan is a tireless worker, tremendous teacher and dedicated student of the game,\" Bleymaier, now the Kansas City Chiefs wide receivers coach, said in the UD press release. \"He’s demonstrated unparalleled X’s and O’s acumen, yet also combines a rare ability to see the big picture without missing a single detail.''\n\nRecent Delaware football coaches\n\n*William D.

UD made his intentions official on Wednesday, the second national letter of intent signing day for incoming recruits.\n\nDelaware also announced incoming transfer wide receiver Jalyn Witcher, an FCS All-American as a freshman in 2021 at Presbyterian, and the addition of graduate punter Ben Dinkel from South Dakota State, where he had a 61-yard boot in the Jackrabbits’ 33-3 win over Delaware in the spring FCS semifinals.\n\nPROMISING TRANSFER: Witcher excelled as freshman wide receiver\n\n“These guys came around, came on campus, and our guys got around them and our guys were fired up about them,” said recently hired Delaware coach Ryan Carty.\n\n“ … They’re guys that for sure had success at this level already, at a pretty high level, and hopefully that translates to what we want to do as a defense, offense and special teams unit. We’re excited about it. We can’t wait to see what they can do for us.”\n\nDelaware still has scholarship offers out to other potential transfers, including several offensive linemen, and high school recruits who have not yet settled on a destination.\n\n“We are actively trying to add value and talent to this roster at all times, all season long,” Carty said. “ … We are not gonna stop recruiting.”\n\nThe only Class of 2022 high school recruit who’d committed to Delaware in the past month, Santino Correa, a wide receiver/defensive back out of New Jersey powerhouse Bergen Catholic, is an invited walk-on and, therefore, didn’t sign a letter of intent, he said.\n\nDelaware had inked six high school recruits on Dec. 15 during the early signing period and added a seventh two days later. All had verbally committed to the Blue Hens when they were coached by Danny Rocco, who was fired on Nov. 29. Carty’s hiring as Delaware’s new head coach was announced on Dec. 10.\n\nCAA EXPANDS: Stony Brook, Monmouth, Hampton join conference\n\nThat December group of recruits is made up of cornerback Shuyab “Shoes” Brinkley, a Philadelphian who attended Mater Dei in Santa Ana, California, as a senior; defensive lineman Dominick Brogna from Bergen Catholic and Bayville, New Jersey; tight end Thomas Chernasky of Western Wayne in Moscow, Pennsylvania; wide receiver Isaiah Cherry from John F. Kennedy and Woodbridge, New Jersey; offensive lineman Steve Dembowksi from Pascack Valley and Montvale, New Jersey; defensive back Gary Seigler from Benedictine College Prep in Richmond, Virginia; and tight end Elijah Sessoms out of Dover High.\n\nNone of those seven are graduating from high school early so they’ll arrive at Delaware in the summer.\n\nJackson caught 102 passes for 1,210 yards and nine touchdowns in four seasons for the Keydets, who were spring 2021 Southern Conference champions. This past fall he had 695 yards on 51 receptions with six touchdowns. His 211 receiving yards in a comeback win over Samford were fifth most in VMI single-game history.\n\n“The season we had in the spring, we knew we had a good team,” Jackson said, “so that just motivated everybody and I just tried to do my part. We had a couple injuries that led to me getting some more targets but I was just trying to perform every Saturday.\n\nBLUE HENS REUNION: Haynes, Pierce and Worrilow join Carty’s UD staff\n\n“I believe in my ability every time I touch the field, so … I was a starter the two previous years as well and I just try to help the team any way I can.”\n\nAmong the other schools that pursued Jackson after he decided to play as a graduate transfer were FBS Georgia Southern, 2021 FCS champ Sam Houston, Delaware’s 2021 FCS quarterfinal victim Jacksonville State and CAA rivals William & Mary and Rhode Island.\n\nDelaware’s new coaches, potential offensive firepower, facilities and proximity to Jackson’s Henrico, Virginia, home, near Richmond, played a role in his decision.\n\n“After meeting the coaching staff and some of the players, it just felt like somewhere I could fit in well,” he said. “I know they have great academics and a history of having a good football program.”\n\nThe 5-10, 240-pound Dinkel, from Kearney, Nebraska, averaged 42.0 yards on 86 career punts at South Dakota State, including 44.6 in the fall of 2021. He averaged 45.8 yards on four punts in the NCAA title game loss to Sam Houston, where Carty was offensive coordinator. He’ll also finish his school year at South Dakota State before coming to Delaware this summer.\n\nDelaware’s fall 2021 first-team All-CAA punter Tyler Pastula entered the transfer portal in early December after averaging a league-best 42.5 yards per punt but has not yet landed elsewhere. He was also Delaware’s punter as a true freshman in the 2021 spring season.\n\n“Everybody on this roster is going to be competing for a job,” Carty said.\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

He says the vibe will be laid back, casual, family-friendly and affordable.\n\n\"I want it to be like the feel of the tavern area at Buckley's,\" says Weir who for 22 years ran the Centreville institution at 5812 Kennett Pike, which many consider one of the best loved bars in Delaware.\n\nHe also was involved in the partnership that ran Four Dogs Tavern, Chadds Ford Inn and the Marshalton Inn, all in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn December 2011, Weir told The News Journal the owners of Buckley's Tavern decided not to renew his lease. Weir held his last pajama Sunday brunch on Jan. 15, 2012 - he founded the popular discounted meal - and a line snaked around the parking lot.\n\nThe Centreville restaurant, now with new operators, has been completely renovated. It reopened in October 2013.\n\nAfter departing Buckley's, Weir wasn't sure where his career was headed. Warren T. Scott, his friend and the restaurant partner he worked with at Four Dogs Tavern and its adjoining Marshalton Inn, died in October 2012.\n\nWeir decided to try his hand at restaurant consulting, but found it wasn't profitable. He took a job at Georgetown, Maryland's Kitty Knight House, and then stayed at home for six months with his 3 1/2 year-old twins.\n\nBut, the 53-year-old always knew he wanted to come back to Delaware and own his own business. The Delaware restaurant industry is one that Weir knows well having worked in businesses as far back as his days of bartending and managing the old Oscar's in downtown Wilmington (it's now Cavanaugh's Restaurant).\n\nA bartender absorbs much more than customers might imagine and Weir jokes that he still sees former patrons and remembers their orders - and actions.\n\n\"I'll be like, there's 'Gin-and-tonic,' there's 'Beer Guy,' there's 'the one who could never get anywhere with the redhead.'\"\n\nWeir, who has an investor, began searching for locations in 2014. He passed on a building in Wilmington's Trolley Square neighborhood and rejected a Hockessin site because of its lack of parking.\n\nIn August, he found what he was looking for in north Wilmington. His daughter had worked at The Comic Book Shop in the Plaza III Center owned by Capano Management Company, and mentioned the vacant China Royal site was available.\n\nThe Chinese restaurant, which opened in 1989, had been popular for more than two decades, but began losing its luster in its waning years. It closed in 2013 when the owner retired.\n\nSince September, Weir has been working on the interior. For years, he has been scribbling down design ideas in a notebook and had a vision for what he wanted.\n\nHe stripped away the outdated and shabby decor and ripped up the former rug. The cement floor has since been stained black and sealed with a glossy polyurethane. The kitchen was renovated as well as the restrooms.\n\nThe bar is the same one China Royal used, but Weir added a new top and wood reclaimed from a 1997 fire at the Marshalton Inn.\n\nRustic, \"shabby chic\" reclaimed doors from a Reading, Pennsylvania, salvage shop decorate one of the dining room's walls. Doors to the restrooms come from old hotel rooms - and still have numbers on them. A former church pew rests against a wall. \"Being a Catholic altar boy, I still feel the guilt,\" Weir jokes.\n\nAnd while Weir left Buckley's behind three years ago, Buckley's apparently hasn't left him.\n\nGoat's menu has Thai chicken noodle soup - just like Buckley's - but Weir says it's not the same recipe. He also has plans to offer pizzas and burgers as he did at Buckley's.\n\nBut there are new offerings. Noshes include nachos with crab salsa; lemon and Parmesan potato chips; and thyme-baked honey feta with flatbread.\n\nA roasted pork meatball bánh mi and a spiced lamb wrap with Brie and curried mustard are among the sandwiches. The short list of changing entrees includes porter braised short ribs and shrimp, tasso ham and grits.\n\nWeir says since his wife and daughter both follow a plant-based diet, he will have more vegetarian offerings. Seitan or tofu can replace any meat.\n\nAt the 14-seat bar, Weir will offer eight craft beers on tap and plans to charge $8 for all glasses of wine.\n\nSurprisingly, for a restaurant named Goat there is little of it on the menu save for goat cheese toasts.\n\nWeir says the name doesn't have much meaning other than it's one he liked. He hopes to follow Goat with other places such as Pig, a takeout shop focusing on pork, and Rabbit, which would be mostly vegetarian.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com.

So, while I’m certainly no quitter, you really do have to 'know when to fold.'”\n\nTo celebrate the venue's role as a clubhouse for the local music community, Real said in a statement there will be a final show – free of charge – on May 25 featuring \"performances by many of the Brandywine Valley’s most cherished groups and performers.\"\n\nThrough a representative, Real declined to be interviewed.\n\nBill Dougherty, the Queen's food and beverage manager, learned of World Cafe Live's departure in a manager's meeting on Monday at 5 p.m.\n\nReal had gathered about 10 members of his top staff and broke the news to them.\n\n\"We were stunned,\" Dougherty said. \"[Real] is heartbroken. This was his baby. I'm sure he would much rather have had a different meeting. There were tears.\"\n\nNews Journal Archive: The Queen prepares to open\n\nSteve Szymanski, a 53-year-old Queen patron, said he has relatives in their 90s who attended silent movie screenings at the Queen years ago. The banking professional said he will miss its latest incarnation with its cheap nearby parking, beer selection, variety of music and friendly staff.\n\n\"It'll be a big loss,\" he said, but added that he will continue to visit under new management. \"If they have the money to support [live music] in Wilmington, which is crucial to the survival of the city … I would support them.\"\n\nDougherty estimates World Cafe Live at the Queen has about 100 full- and part-time employees. They were informed via email Tuesday morning, he said.\n\nReal told The News Journal in 2011 that he was determined to make the project work. \"Failure for us would be a really sad state of affairs for Market Street,\" he said.\n\nThe Queen Theater was originally built in the 1800s, converted to a vaudeville theater in the 1920s and was a movie house before closing in 1959.\n\nIt had been left for dead for nearly 50 years before Buccini/Pollin Group renovated the theater at Fifth and Market streets. A ribbon-cutting ceremony and the first concert were held there on April 1, 2011.\n\nJoe Trainor performed on the World Cafe Live stage on May 30 of that year for a soft opening. That first show would be one of many for the pianist and singer, who has performed with his namesake band Joe Trainor Trio, the tribute band In the Light and as an act for the venue's annual fundraiser, Shine a Light. A main draw for Trainor was the staff's attitude toward local artists.\n\n\"When you're a musician, part of the reason you get into it is because you want that kind of atmosphere. And when they treat you like a rock star, you're going to want to go back,\" he said.\n\nTrainor said the idea of corporate management makes him \"apprehensive.\"\n\n\"I love this city. If a vendor can come in and make the venue more successful, then it's good for the city,\" he said. \"As a musician, if it's not open to our art scene, it could be a detriment. I’m on both sides of the fence.\"\n\nTina Betz, executive director of the Light Up the Queen Foundation, echoed Buccini and said the foundation's work to promote arts awareness and arts programs will continue.\n\n\"Within all of the discussions about the new management coming in, what the Light Up the Queen Foundation does has been an important part of it,\" she said. \"And it needed to be guaranteed that we would still have our comfortable fit in our home.\"\n\nIn Real's email, he thanked staff and performers for \"being part of such an ambitious and exhilarating effort.\"\n\nWith two stages and capacity to host 950 people, the public/private $25 million rehabilitation of the long-forgotten Queen ushered in a new era of music for Wilmington, pumping more national and local acts onto Market Street than ever before.\n\nFrom high school bands playing some of their first gigs to well-known acts like Dr. John, Lake Street Dive, Chris Stapleton, Neutral Milk Hotel, The xx and Ingrid Michaelson, World Cafe Live at the Queen became what Real dreamed, telling The News Journal in 2009 that Delawareans could \"expect we will use all our resources to create a new Wilmington clubhouse for the music and arts community.\"\n\nGayle Dillman, whose Gable Music Ventures has booked more than 200 shows there since 2012, lamented the loss of one of the only music rooms in the state where underage acts could perform and grow.\n\n\"This is how Gable started – as a platform for underage bands – original music for all ages,\" said Dillman, who is now hunting for a new venue for her weekly \"Wilmo Wednesday\" variety show, which drew 50 to 100 people each week. \"And while [Wilmington rock clubs] Oddity Bar and 1984 are great, the kids can't go in there. This means there's a new challenge for us, and we'll figure it out.\"\n\nAndrea Sikora and her husband, Bryan, own and run three city restaurants – La Fia Market Bistro, Merchant Bar and Cocina Lolo Mexican Restaurant – all within one block of the Queen. She said the couple hasn’t seen much business from the concert venue, before or after a show, in recent years, particularly in the last year and a half.\n\n“We got the sense the energy was lower [at The Queen],\" she said. \"In 2014, we were observing large crowds, the corner was bopping and La Fia was busy on show nights. But we haven’t felt that energy in a long while.”\n\nShe said she believes the last big spillover crowd at their restaurants was when local musician Ben LeRoy and his band The Snap played a reunion show at the venue in November.\n\n“He brought the crowds,” Sikora said. “I can’t think of any other show like that since then.”\n\nSikora said she’s hoping a new operator at the Queen will bring “a new vision.”\n\n“We’re optimistic. We would be happy to see a new operator bring back the energy of 2014,” Sikora said. “We’re supportive of any new ownership coming in and we can all work together.”\n\nBesides concerts, the Queen has also hosted other events like weddings, TEDx Wilmington events and the MidAtlantic Wine + Food Festival. Buccini/Pollin hosted the premiere of a local music video there in November. And Hillary Clinton held a rally there in April ahead of Delaware's primary election.\n\nEven before construction began at the Queen, it had an uphill climb. The deal for the new venue was made with a handshake in 2007, just before the global economic meltdown.\n\n\"Wilmington is just now, economically and renaissance-wise, about where we hoped it would be when we opened five years ago,\" Real told The News Journal ahead of the Queen's fifth anniversary last year. \"I think we're real close to the tipping point now.\"\n\nThe cash to fund the venue's $25 million renovation came from public and private sources. Tax credits yielded about $11 million, and the city gave $3 million, The News Journal reported in 2011. The other half came from a combination of foundation grants, state funds, corporate donations and individual contributions.\n\nMark Fields, executive director of the Grand, only three blocks from the Queen, said the city and its residents have invested too much money into the Queen to let it fail.\n\n\"I trust our leadership and community to do what's in the best interest of the community to make sure this doesn't become a setback,\" he said.\n\nFaced with increased competition and a changing music industry, Fields said running a concert venue has become a \"brutal business.\" He said World Cafe Live's ambition to be open every day likely made things difficult.\n\nWorld Cafe Live in Philadelphia will continue to operate, Real wrote, and the company also plans to launch an initiative called \"World Cafe Live Presents\" which hopes to present World Cafe Live concerts and events at other venues in and outside the region.\n\nThe Market Street location will host events through the end of May including singer-songwriter KT Tunstall and the annual Shine a Light concert fundraiser, which benefits the Light Up the Queen Foundation.\n\nBuccini praised Real for his role in resurrecting the theater in the heart of Wilmington's downtown, which came just after the worldwide economic downturn of 2008.\n\n\n\n\"If it wasn't for Hal Real, the Queen would not exist today,\" he said. \"He wasn't from here. It had been vacant for half a century. And he really was the catalyst. Things didn't work out exactly as we would have hoped, but I think he really left his mark on our community.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

The partners had worked a year on the project to create the 114-seat casual eatery, formerly a shoe store specializing in running.

He also oversaw the district budget and supervised administrative staff.\n\nPreviously, he served as principal of Penncrest High School in Media, Pennsylvania, and as director of instruction for New Castle County Vocational Technical School District in Delaware. He has also served as principal of Brandywine High School, and principal and assistant principal of Concord High School in the Brandywine School District. In the Christina School District, he once served as assistant principal at Christiana High School.\n\nGregg's teaching experience includes a total of nine years’ experience as a high school social studies teacher. He holds a bachelor’s degree in history from the University of Delaware and a master’s degree in school leadership and instruction from Wilmington University. He is a graduate of Glasgow High School.\n\nHaving studied the district’s strategic plan, Gregg during his interview said the goals he’s most interested in achieving by June are dealing with school safety through setting clear expectations for their culture; continuing to pursue honors and dual enrollment programs; and improving retention of students, especially as they enter high school.\n\nThe board vote was 5-2 in Gregg’s favor thanks to Fredrick Polaski’s last-second switch from supporting Golder. Golder already had lost the vote after Board President Elizabeth Campbell Paige cast her tie-breaking final vote, and Polaski said his switch was meant to show solidarity.\n\nChristina’s previous superintendent, Freeman Williams, left the district in 2015 for medical reasons and Robert Andrzejewski served as acting superintendent until Dec. 31, when Noreen LaSorsa took his place as interim administrator.\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

In comparison, enrollment at Red Clay and Brandywine is higher today than it was in 2010. Both of those districts have seen fluctuations over the years, but not nearly as dramatic as Christina.\n\nGregg wants to focus attention on improving the education of its Wilmington students. And he's ready to undertake a massive overhaul of how the district educates and operates to do it.\n\nThe plan will also put a major emphasis on keeping students from leaving the district for charter and magnet schools and improving the district's reputation.\n\nAs it stands today, parents are choosing to send their students to other schools and voting against referendums that could help Christina offer more competitive programming and support to students.\n\n\"I think that people have been waiting for this for a long time,\" Gregg said. \"And I don't think we have time to wait.\n\n\"I don't think it's a creative direction, necessarily. I think it's a direction born out of need.\"\n\nChristina is home to three of the state's priority schools, those with the lowest test scores in Delaware. They have been singled out by the state for needing immediate improvement. At Bayard Middle, only 3 percent of students are proficient in math and a mere 8 percent are proficient in English.\n\nThe Wilmington Education Improvement Commission, a state advisory committee formed to come up with ideas to improve education in the city, has suggested that Christina's Wilmington-based schools be taken away from the district and given to Red Clay. They feel the district is incapable of meeting the needs of both suburban and urban students.\n\nIt also recommended extra resources for schools with a high percentage of students who live in poverty.\n\nBut two years in a row, the state legislature was not able to implement any of the recommendations.\n\nSTORY:Joe Biden, business leaders talk future U.S. labor force during panel discussion\n\nSTORY:Carrie Downie boys learn to run, talk about their feelings\n\nGregg, who has been superintendent since April 18, is not waiting. He wants to begin implementing new programming and reworking the district's city schools by next September.\n\nAt Bayard, for instance, the district has already introduced an alternative-to-suspension program that keeps kids in school instead of sending them home. Repetitive out-of-school suspensions are known to have a negative impact on student learning and growth.\n\nGregg's timeline is aggressive and calls for not only reviewing the school district's curriculum but coming up with a new strategic plan by January. In the immediate month, the district plans on convening a committee of stakeholders to talk about new programming at the district's high schools to help retain students.\n\nThe district will also look at its facility use and determine if it has any wasted space. During the most recent legislative session, lawmakers said Christina had too much underutilized space and the state and district were spending too much on maintenance and other costs because of that.\n\nThere is a sense of urgency to the plan rarely seen in Christina, school board members and staff said last week.\n\n\"Some of this is coming fast and furious and actually, I like that,\" said Elizabeth Paige, a Board of Education member. \"I like that (Gregg is) being aggressive.\"\n\n\"This is the most excited I've been as a school board member and as a parent.\"\n\nDarren Tyson, president of the Christina Education Association and a dean at Newark High School, said not only has Gregg put together a plan, but there's an air of excitement permeating the district this fall unlike anything he's felt.\n\nTyson has been with the district since 1996 and said he knows Christina is capable of doing more for its students.\n\n\"I was here when Christina was one of the top school districts in the country,\" Tyson said. \"And I've seen the demise of Christina, as well. It's refreshing to see someone come forward with clear goals and a new direction for the district.\"k\n\nGiving back to the community\n\nTyson isn't the only one who remembers Christina's glory days. Gregg attended McVey Elementary School, Gauger-Cobbs Middle School and graduated from Glasgow High School.\n\nHe says that's why he came back to Christina, leaving a job as the assistant superintendent of Penn-Delco School District in Delaware County, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"I want to be here,\" Gregg said, adding that \"I guess in life, you want to give back to the community you got so much success from.\"\n\nA superintendent with some staying power could be a good thing for Christina, which has seen several recent changes in leadership.\n\nChristina’s previous superintendent, Freeman Williams, left the district in 2015 for medical reasons, and Robert Andrzejewski served as acting superintendent until Dec. 31, when Noreen LaSorsa took his place as interim administrator.\n\nBefore Williams was Marcia Lyles, who worked at Christina for three years before taking a job at a much larger city in New Jersey.\n\nThough the school district has put together plans for increasing student achievement in the past, for the most part, they've fallen flat, said Gregg. The district's last strategic plan was released in 2014 and expires this year, and of the goals outlined, \"none of them were met,\" Gregg said.\n\n\"For whatever reason, those things just didn't happen.\"\n\nChristina's Board of Education, which has been criticized for failing to take responsibility for downward trends, claims to have been overwhelmed.\n\nConversations about priority schools, state takeovers and redistricting have distracted from the real issues, the school board's vice president Fred Polaski said, leaving little energy or appetite to focus on anything else.\n\nThe district's most recent strategic plan, which took an entire school year to put together, was basically \"put on a shelf,\" he said.\n\n\"There was so much in it, you couldn't get it all done in the timeframes we hoped for,\" he said. \"We never sat down and said 'OK, we can't do all of it. What can we do?'\"\n\nGeorge Evans, who was recently elected school board president, hinted that the makeup of the school board itself has impeded progress. He talked about missed opportunities and failing to meet achievable goals, but didn't go into specifics.\n\nHe did say, however, that with the recent election of two new school board members, Meredith Griffin Jr. and Angela Mitchell, \"I think there's more support than we've had in the past to get these initiatives done.\"\n\nGriffin replaced Shirley Sutton-Saffer, who had been accused of making racial slurs but withstood several calls for her resignation before deciding not to run for a third term. Mitchell replaced Meg Mason, who in April abruptly resigned less than a year into her five-year term. She was previously a principal at Maclary Elementary School.\n\nOne vision, one voice\n\nThat's not to say that there aren't reservations about Gregg's plans.\n\nJohn Young, another school board member, said he wants to make sure things don't move so quickly that the board isn't informed of all the changes.\n\nHe is worried new programs could be implemented unevenly or unfairly, pointing to the district's Middle School Honors Academy as an example. The program pulls top-performing students from the district's middle schools and sends them to Christina High School, leaving the rest of the students behind without anything to aspire to, he said.\n\n\"To me, we should have a Christina Middle School Honors Academy at each (middle school), contributing to the environment at those schools,\" he said adamantly. \"All the other kids are leaving, and they have to stay.\"\n\nNew high school programs should avoid taking kids from their feeder schools, he said, positing that instead of forcing kids to choice into another school just for one class or program, they could be bused back and forth.\n\n\"Frankly, I think our geography is in our favor here,\" he said. \"We're fairly compact.\"\n\nMary Schorse, president of Christina's PTA Council, said the district needs to begin acting as a single entity, not a collection of individual schools or programs where students don't all have access to the same opportunities.\n\n\"In this district, until I see otherwise, things just operate on a school-by-school basis,\" she said. \"Things don't seem to come down from the district at all.\"\n\nAs a result, successful programs aren't always duplicated district-wide, she said. Though there are great things happening at some schools, those stories aren't always told and the community isn't aware of what's taking place at schools like Newark High School, where she has a student.\n\n\"Everyone thinks Christina is a horrible district, and it's not,\" she said. \"They just don't know what's going on.\"\n\nTo that point, the district's new motto is \"One District, One Vision, One Voice,\" Gregg said. He said turning Christina around will be a group effort, involving parents, principals, teachers, local businesses and more.\n\nHe envisions creating a variety of comprehensive programs across Christina's three high schools, though the same offerings may not be available at each one.\n\nFor example, Christina's music and theater programs may be consolidated in one building so the district can offer a higher-quality arts program and stem the tide of students that leave to go to Cab Calloway School of the Arts, Gregg said\n\n\"We have no options for our students along those lines,\" he said. \"And I don't know why we couldn't.\"\n\nRebuilding community trust\n\nOne of the biggest challenges Christina may face when it comes to restoring the district to a place of prominence has little to do with academics.\n\nGregg said the district will have to work to regain the community's trust and overcome the perception that Christina hasn't been doing all it can to serve its Wilmington students.\n\n\"These students are our students no matter where they live,\" Gregg said, admitting \"that may not be other people's perception.\"\n\nTo better connect with the community, the district will do everything it can to engage parents and other members of the public, he said. Christina will hold meet-and-greets and town halls, as well as form a parent advisory committee to meet with the superintendent on a regular basis.\n\nGregg said district administrators have been working with Gov. John Carney's office and the Delaware Department of Education's new Wilmington-based Innovation and Improvement Office, which is headed by Dorrell Green.\n\n\"Governor Carney has made clear that we must do better by our students in Wilmington, and we know that Christina's leaders share that goal,\" Green said in a statement. \"We look forward to talking more about this issue in the coming weeks and months, and making real change to help kids in Wilmington succeed.\"\n\nThough Green is a longtime Wilmington educator, a spokesperson for the Department of Education said he didn't have time in his schedule to talk about the new office's role or how it could assist Christina.\n\nCarney, who toured Bancroft Elementary in Wilmington last week, said the Innovation office was formed specifically to help schools that weren't meeting state proficiency goals.\n\nHe also hinted at offering more support to low-income parents in the city of Wilmington.\n\nGregg was reluctant to detail conversations he's had with the governor's office but did mention the proposed creation of a consolidated early education center.\n\nRight now, Christina's preschool program is spread out across multiple city sites, he said. There's interest from the governor's office in consolidating those locations into one, offering services to all children younger than 4 and offering training to parents.\n\n\"If we can get students on track for kindergarten, we can get them on track for third grade,\" Gregg said.\n\nGregg went on to say that, so far, there's been a lot of hope in Christina's new plan and district staff seems eager to turn things around.\n\n\"That's daunting,\" he said of the plan. \"I don't want to lie about that. It's daunting because I don't want to dash anybody's hopes.\"\n\nOn the other side of the coin, \"that's what I wanted the district to feel,\" he said, \"that this is a new day. This is a new place for us. I think people can feel it.\"\n\n\"We just have to get it all done now.\"\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

The board released a statement Thursday announcing the resignations. The statement said the board is in the process of recruiting new administrators and that the board and administration had no additional comments at this time.\n\n“The School Board thanks them for their service to the school district,” the statement read.\n\nPhillips Exeter Academy:Private school plans to build faculty neighborhood. Here's what it looks like.\n\nBoard Chairman Gary Swanson was reached by email Friday but declined to answer further questions, including what date the resignations were effective.\n\nSchool Board member Amy Tilton was reached by phone Friday and declined to speak beyond the press release, although she said that Givens’ resignation was effective 120 days after she tendered it.\n\nShe said it was her understanding that David Dalton, who also resigned in March, is expected to be in his position as principal through the end of the school year.\n\nGivens did not return a call seeking comment.\n\nAt Thursday’s School Board meeting, she told board members it was district protocol to release written press releases when media outlets seek comment rather than speak on the phone. Board members then voted 4-1 to release the written statement, board member Phil Nazzaro voting against.\n\n“I don’t think there’s anything dramatic going on here, but I think language is powerful,” Givens said. She also advised the board to respond “in a way that’s positive and puts all of us in a positive light.”\n\nThe board considered discussing the press release in a nonpublic session, though Nazzaro said doing so “creates the appearance that there’s something potentially here that is not.”\n\nMore:Pamela Carr named Seacoast School of Technology principal\n\nThe board also met Thursday with the executive director of the New Hampshire School Boards Association, Barrett Christina, to discuss the coming search for an interim superintendent, then a permanent superintendent. He said it was too late in the year to find a permanent superintendent and recommended a small committee to find an interim in time for August.\n\n“We’re looking for somebody to sort of keep the lights on and pay the bills and just steady the ship for the next year,” Christina said. He said the NHSBA recommends 14 to 16 weeks for a search for a permanent superintendent.\n\nBoard members discussed in the April 15 meeting whether to conduct exit interviews with Givens and Black, who were not present at that meeting due to prior commitments according to Swanson.\n\nGivens normally conducts exit interviews and serves as the SAU’s HR person, Swanson said. The board was advised by their legal counsel that boards are not normally involved in exit interviews. Tilton said she was unsure the board was entitled to exit interviews, but Nazzaro said, “This is an abnormal situation.”\n\n“There’s reasons behind this that I’m not even entirely (indiscernible) to,” Nazzaro said. Tilton agreed the information would be valuable.\n\n“How do we get that feedback? I feel like that feedback is lost between us and the superintendent, like why people are leaving,” Tilton said. “I just would always like to know, so things can be worked on.”\n\nSAU 16:Drew Bairstow named new Cooperative Middle School principal\n\nGivens was under fire in 2019 when a group of parents circulated a petition calling for a vote of no-confidence due to “lack of communication” in placing then Junior-Senior High School Principal Chris Mazzone on leave. Mazzone was later reassigned from his job to school facilities director in 2020, replaced by Dalton. The SAU 31 School Board defended Givens with a 5-0 vote rejecting the request for a vote of no-confidence, Chairman Mike Kenison saying he did not “see any merit” in the petition.\n\nThe resignations have raised concern with community members. Resident Anne Ellis of 8 Wiggin Drive said she had 17 years’ experience as a school administrator, and said she was concerned about the effect the resignations will have on the school district. She said her own child was struggling in fourth grade when, the next year, they found success with Thorell, then as his fifth-grade teacher.\n\n“I just can’t imagine this district moving forward with this loss,” Ellis said. She also said the community of public-school administrators is “a tight one.” She said while she had not spoken with any of the people resigning, resignation is often a last resort.\n\n“Sometimes the only way you have to stand up for something that you’re being asked to do, that is morally, ethically wrong, or out of your compass in terms of what is right for your community and position, is to resign,” she said.\n\n“These are extremely dedicated people,” Ellis said. “I cannot believe that they are leaving for any other reason than that is the only action they can take to stand up for themselves in that position.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/06/14/ohio-search-new-education-leader-after-surprise-resignation/7620333001/", "title": "Ohio will search for new education leader after surprise resignation", "text": "The search for a new head of Ohio's public education system is underway. Again.\n\nAnd questions remain about why Steve Dackin, the man hired to be the new state superintendent, resigned about two weeks into his tenure.\n\n\"I will say that it does seem bizarre,\" Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said. \"Maybe that’s too strong of a word, but whatever the problem was, if it was an ethics problem, that wasn't made clear.\"\n\nHere's what we know:\n\n'Revolving door' questions\n\nOn May 10 the Ohio State Board of Education selected Dackin as the new head of public instruction for K-12 children.\n\nEducation groups and state lawmakers praised the pick, citing Dackin's 40-year record in public education as a teacher, district superintendent and state school board member.\n\nBut that final credential appears to have led to his resignation.\n\nDackin led the search for the state superintendent job for months. He even resigned from Columbus State Community College to focus on the search.\n\nThen, a few days before the application window closed, Dackin resigned from the board and submitted his own application. This raised some eyebrows at the time because Dackin had attended closed-door meetings about the job and potentially seen his competitors' applications.\n\nBut his supporters, including Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, dismissed the idea that anything untoward occurred.\n\n\"He resigned when he realized he wanted to go for the appointment, which was prior to the selection process,\" Brenner said in May.\n\nThe board picked Dackin and two other men as finalists, Springboro Community City School District Superintendent Larry Hook and Perrysburg Exempted Village Schools Superintendent Thomas Hosler.\n\nA final vote by the full state board was set for May 10.\n\nEight days before that meeting, the Ohio Ethics Commission emailed a letter to the interim state superintendent, Stephanie Siddens, saying Dackin \"may have participated in the selection process\" and \"it is likely the commission may open an inquiry into this matter.\"\n\nThat email was forwarded to the state board on May 3, according to the Ohio Department of Education.\n\nDespite that, the board voted 14-4 for Dackin, and he started his new job on May 23.\n\nDackin jumped right in, taking meetings with lawmakers such as Huffman and education groups.\n\nAt no point did Huffman or others get the impression Dackin would resign. But that's what happened on June 3.\n\n“Concerns have been raised about my recent acceptance of the position of Superintendent of Public Instruction,\" Dackin wrote. \"I don’t want ‘revolving door’ questions to distract from the important work ahead for schools, educators and especially the children.”\n\nHe also said he wouldn't accept payment for the days he worked – a loss of about $8,200.\n\nBoard Member Christina Collins said she couldn't discuss Dackin's resignation but was disappointed to see him go.\n\n\"Steve was the best candidate with a proven record of closing achievement gaps,\" she said. \"His resignation is a loss for education in Ohio.\"\n\nCollins and her fellow board members voted to re-appoint Siddens as interim superintendent on June 14.\n\nHow clear were the concerns?\n\nThe four board of education members who voted against Dackin's appointment cited ideological preferences for a more conservative candidate. They didn't raise ethical questions during that May 10th meeting.\n\nAnd Huffman wondered whether the ethics commission clearly conveyed its concerns.\n\n\"It couldn’t have been too clear if a bunch of smart people on the state school board said we were going ahead with this,\" Huffman said. \"I think there needs to be some sort of explanation publicly by the ethics commission as to how you could say this and a group of fair-minded, intelligent people who then said we can still go ahead with our choice.\"\n\nThe Executive Director of the Ethics Commission, Paul Nick, told the USA Today Gannett Ohio Bureau that the commission doesn't \"rush to judgment and therefore requested further information to assess the facts.\n\nHe said in an email that his office \"acted proactively to inform the State Board of Education through its interim superintendent\" when they learned of the potential conflict.\n\nDuring the board's Tuesday meeting, however, Board Member Paul LaRue appeared to express some remorse.\n\n\"We rushed it,\" he said. \"We shouldn't have.\"\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nSiddens will act as interim state superintendent as the board begins another search over the objections of several members.\n\nBoard Member John Hagan proposed skipping that process and going with Hook, the runner-up. Hook received four votes (which included Hagan) for state superintendent on May 10.\n\nHagan asked why they should start over when Hook had already been vetted.\n\nThe board rejected his emergency resolution 10-7.\n\n\"We really look stupid,\" Board Member Kristen Hill said. \"We couldn’t get this done in a year, and we’re still going to go at it some more.\"\n\nAnna Staver is a reporter with the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau.

The Dispatch was told Chapman wasn't doing interviews as the board went into executive session.\n\nNew bus routes began Wednesday\n\nColumbus City Schools' new bus routes began Wednesday as school resumes following winter break. In response to hundreds of complaints about bus transportation since the start of the school year, the district announced in mid-November that every student who receives school bus transportation from Columbus City Schools — including charter and nonpublic private school students — is getting a new bus driver, new times for pickup and drop-off and potentially a new bus stop location on Wednesday.\n\nThe district's transportation department started the school year using routes and stops set by a new software system called AlphaRoute, which uses algorithm technology to route school buses and decrease the number of buses needed to transport students. To redo all the bus routes, the district used the new bus routing software in conjunction with the old software.\n\n“This is a huge undertaking to change routing software and systems mid-year,\" Chapman said. \"It’s almost unprecedented.”\n\nThe district has 512 drivers and 466 routes, as of Tuesday, said Rodney Stufflebean, interim director of transportation. Sixty-five additional routes are outsourced to contractors.\n\nA total of 36,000 students from Columbus City Schools as well as students attending charter and other schools rely on the district's bus transportation, which had been plagued at times by more than 100 drivers calling off daily.\n\nMore:Columbus City Schools busing changes coming, but not everyone is happy about it\n\n“We have increased the routes just a little bit due to some safety concerns that we found and making sure that we had safe stops for the students and avenues to the stops,” Stufflebean said.\n\nThe district is also working with Project Connect to assign buses to students who used to live at Latitude Five25, an apartment complex in the Near East Side that was deemed unsafe by officials last week.\n\nThe district has identified as least 17 students connected to the Latitude Five25 building as of Tuesday morning, district spokesperson Jacqueline Bryant said.\n\n“We have been able to identify those students, where they are being temporarily housed and (Tuesday) they finalized those routes so they will be transported in the displacement process,” Stufflebean said.\n\nSchool board member Tina Pierce asked what families should do if they haven’t received the new busing information and don’t see it in the district’s Infinite Campus portal.\n\n“I’m going to have to defer on that,” Stufflebean said. “We are going to have to figure it out. Everybody that we’ve contacted and everybody that we know about has a route in that system. If we don’t know that, they are not in that system. I don’t know the answer to that question.”\n\nSchool Board President Jennifer Adair thanked everyone who was been involved in working to implement the new bus changes.\n\n“This is almost like another first day, so (Wednesday) will be a little bumpy and it’s going to be OK,” she said. “We are going to work through the bumps. Not all the routes are going to go perfectly, but everyone is there to support our students.”\n\nThe district’s transportation call center normally has 12 staff members, but the district will have another dozen staff helping out this week, Stufflebean said. The call center's hours are 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and the number is 614-365-5074.\n\n“We will make sure that we are responsive to the needs of our students and make sure they have the right information so they can catch their bus,\" Chapman said. \"We do not want them to miss their bus.”\n\nA district spokesperson told The Dispatch that the soonest it could provide information about the number of calls it received Wednesday about problems or issues with the new bus routing would be Thursday.\n\nChronic absenteeism\n\nChapman reported that Columbus City Schools, the state's largest district with some 47,000 students, has seen a “modest” reduction in chronic absenteeism this school year.\n\n“But our numbers are still high in more than 60% of our students having missed 10 or more days of school,” she said. “That is a lot of instruction time.

DeLisa and Lance Larson have been managing the Ocean Avenue watering hole for nearly 25 years, and they’ve solidified the Wonder Bar's position as a city landmark. When music is not playing, customers sit at the big circular bar, built that way in the '60s so folks can get to know each other across the room. The popular drink is the Debbie D, named after DeLisa. It has Ketel One Botanicals Cucumber and Mint with club soda and fresh muddled mint. “It's really refreshing in the summer,” DeLisa said. One of the regulars is Bruce Springsteen, who has performed several times at the club but mostly he blends in as well as he can.

At one point, “The Sopranos” filmed an episode in the nostalgic space, and at another time, William H. Macy and Emma Roberts enjoyed a drink among its twinkling green lights and hanging sports jerseys. The intrigue of the Hollywood elite, despite the tavern’s unassuming digs, comes as no surprise, though, in a place that has established itself as North Jersey’s “Cheers,” but with better food. — Kara VanDooijeweert, The Record and northjersey.com\n\nRead a full review of Tierney's Tavern.\n\nRadio Social | Rochester, New York\n\nDetails: 20 Carlson Road; 585-244-1484, radio-social.com\n\nIn a city that has a strong craft cocktail scene, the most weirdly wonderful place to drink is Radio Social. It’s a 42,000-square-foot mashup of two bars, an upscale Middle Eastern restaurant, a pizza/burger joint and a 34-lane bowling alley. You can play classic games like cornhole and shuffleboard both indoors and on a spacious back lawn. One cocktail bar features flavors that complement the Middle Eastern fare, while the other leans toward playful concoctions served in vessels compatible with swinging a ping pong paddle. You can also get a Genesee Light, the easy drinking local lager. The colorful, retro vibe is a nod to the building’s history of making radios during World War II. It has one of the best brunches in town. — Tracy Schuhmacher, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\n\nRead a full review of Radio Social.\n\nSaints and Scholars | Yonkers, New York\n\nDetails: 790 McLean Ave.; 914-457-5550, instagram.com/saintsandscholars\n\nThere aren't many bars in Westchester County with floral wallpaper, disco balls and chandeliers, including one in the ladies' room. But Saints and Scholars, which opened in 2018, defies expectations. What looks like your typical Irish bar on the outside is full of surprises, starting with a black and white checkered floor, a red and purple backlit bar, a coffered ceiling and a vibrant atmosphere that changes from sedate to sultry as the night goes on. The cocktails are similarly unique (try the Porn Star Martini!) and can be served in a jumbo glass (which easily serves four) or in a miniature bathtub complete with a rubber ducky. Irish-born owner Aidan Loughran, who loves chatting with his customers, has also made elevated food a priority. Cash only. — Jeanne Muchnick, The Journal News\n\nRead a full review of Saints and Scholars.\n\nThe Crow & Quill ∣ Asheville, North Carolina\n\nDetails: 106 N. Lexington Ave.; thecrowandquill.com\n\nVictorian meets gothic at the speakeasy-style bar and local haunt The Crow & Quill. The craft cocktail bar has an air of mystery with a door with no signage; guests must be in the know to know where to go. The eclectic array of antique decor and furniture, dark-wood fixtures and a flag emblazoned with the emblem of a fictitious secret society set the ambiance. Founder Casey Campfield opened the downtown bar in 2014 as a local hangout, and tourists who've stumbled upon its door have made it a favorite, too. The Crow & Quill offers intimate corners, rousing nights of live music with jazzy swing bands, and classic and signature cocktails made from a library of more than 800 whiskeys and 1,000 spirits. ― Tiana Kennell, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nRead a full review of The Crow & Quill.\n\nOcean Grill and Tiki Bar | Carolina Beach, North Carolina\n\nDetails: 1211 S. Lake Park Blvd.; 910-707-0049, oceangrilltiki.com\n\nOcean views, salt air and tiki drinks? Yes, this spot has the laid-back, surf-inspired vibe you want in a beach bar. The restaurant side at the Golden Sands Motel has an upstairs dining room with panoramic views. But a mini vacation is a few steps away on the remnants of Center Pier, damaged by a hurricane in 1996. When it’s time for tiki business, bartenders open the hut’s plywood flaps to serve cold beer and cocktails such as a mojito, Dark ‘n’ Stormy or the house-favorite Noserider. And the staff will even bring you fish tacos or a sandwich from the restaurant. In the summer, the magical tiki shows bring both touring artists and local bands to the rock out on the end of the pier. — Allison Ballard, Wilmington StarNews\n\nRead a full review of Ocean Grill and Tiki Bar.\n\nLaw Bird | Columbus, Ohio\n\nDetails: 740 S. High St.; 614-636-1053, lawbirdbar.com\n\nEven as Law Bird introduces cocktails with pickled-carrot brine or seaweed-infused mezcal, curates Wednesday night hot dogs with the same finesse as its mixology and turns into a tiki bar in the middle of December, one thing stays constant. There’s a pink neon sign that says, “Not Governed by Reason.” Law Bird, a cocktail bar just outside downtown Columbus, remakes itself regularly through changes in drink menus, bar snacks and decor. In the past year alone, it has gone through five evolutions that include 1990s vintage, Japanese city pop and galactic disco. Customer favorites reappear, and classics such as $5 mini-martinis endure. It’s a small, never-crowded space that takes reservations but leaves half its seating open for walk-ins. — Bob Vitale, The Columbus Dispatch\n\nRead a full review of Law Bird.\n\nLongfellow | Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nDetails: 1233 Clay St.; 513-307-4379, longfellowbar.com\n\nOrder a classic cocktail, an amaro or a pilsner at Longfellow, and it won’t take long to realize why this place is special. Your epiphany might come as your mind goes deep into an old song by Ralph Stanley or New Order playing on the well-curated playlist, when you strike up a conversation with a stranger (it’s rare to come here without making a new friend) or when you look outside the bar’s double-hung windows and fall in love with the Italianate townhomes and cathedrals that surround you. As the night wears on, the bar becomes a beacon for restaurant workers finishing up their shifts and looking for a shot and a beer, or couples out for a nightcap after dinner. You can eat here, too. A rotating menu features modern takes on old-school bar snacks, including radishes with salt and butter, German-style meat platters and tomato soup. All of them are wonderful. — Keith Pandolfi, The Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nRead a full review of Longfellow.\n\nEdna's | Oklahoma City, Oklahoma\n\nDetails: 5137 Classen Circle; 405-840-3339, ednasokc.com\n\nFor 35 years, patrons have adorned the walls and ceilings of Edna's with dollar bills. At this point, there are few spots remaining without colorfully decorated bills stapled to them. But when namesake Edna Scott opened her bar in 1989, there was no indication it would become so beloved or the origin point of a cocktail combining Coors Light, orange juice and amaretto – The Lunchbox – that many have tried to mimic. The bar was once the location of a Keith Urban music video, and Jimmy Fallon and Questlove were even served Lunchboxes by an Oklahoma chef on “The Tonight Show.” Still owned by Scott's family, offering up a tasty bar menu and having served more than 2 million Lunchboxes, Edna's remains a cornerstone of Oklahoma City's bar scene. — JaNae Williams, The Oklahoman\n\nRead a full review of Edna's.\n\nHey Love | Portland, Oregon\n\nDetails: 920 E. Burnside St.; 503-206-6223, heylovepdx.com\n\nIn a city of perpetual rain, Hey Love is Portland's sunny escape. Fenced in by tropical plants creating a cabana-like ambiance, the bar inside the Jupiter Hotel encapsulates the city's eclectic spirit. A funky, fresh playlist enlivens the space. The team of owners brings decades of experience in the industry and has crafted an experience that all can enjoy, including an ADA-accommodating bar top. There are food options for most dietary restrictions for happy hour, dinner and weekend brunch, plus an almost unending list of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. The bar continuously participates in fundraisers and causes, making it the community's bar. — Em Chan, Salem Statesman Journal\n\nRead a full review of Hey Love.\n\nBloomsday Cafe | Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nDetails: 414 S. Second St.; 267-319-8018, bloomsdaycafe.com\n\nOn a cobblestone street lined with old trees, this charming pub dresses like the hottest wine bar in town, but the staff will remember your name, your seating preference and your drink. Bloomsday has a long list of natural wines, ciders, orange wines and bubbly from the United States and abroad. If you’re not an oenophile, bartenders will be happy to offer their favorite vermouth from the marble and crystal bar, or make you the Bloomsday Citywide cocktail, a fun spin on the Philly classic that combines a different beer and vermouth each month. Wine clubs, book clubs, tea parties and a menu of brunch classics keep this wine pub filled with locals year-round. — Annemarie Dooling, USA TODAY\n\nRead a full review of Bloomsday.\n\nPreservation Pub | Knoxville, Tennessee\n\nDetails: 28 Market Square; 865-524-2224, scruffycity.com/preservation-pub\n\nThere are two kinds of “Pubby Buddies.” There’s the signature $5 menu item at Preservation Pub – a shot of whiskey and a PBR – and then there are the friends you make while dancing to jam band music in the smoke-filled first floor and while sharing drinks from the rooftop “shot shack” trailer (or the magic beer tree). Owner Scott West, whose career is back on track after a money laundering conviction, considers the divey Preservation Pub and its nightly live music to be the “heart of the heart” – that is, the pulse that makes Knoxville’s Market Square pedestrian plaza come alive as one of the most-visited parts of the Scruffy City. — Ryan Wilusz, Knox News\n\nRead a full review of Preservation Pub.\n\nThe Lipstick Lounge | Nashville, Tennessee\n\nDetails: 1400 Woodland St.; 615-226-6343, thelipsticklounge.com\n\nLipstick Lounge is an icon of once-gritty East Nashville. Now pricey homes surround it. But the bar, which opened in 2002, serves as a reminder of when the neighborhood was less polished. When it was a haven for artists and musicians who hadn't yet struck it big. When it was proudly home to a come-as-you-are attitude. Lipstick Lounge is still that. It's a colorful, raucous good time, with thumping music and costumes everywhere, even on a Sunday afternoon. Customers come for a huge menu of hangover drinks like the peach schnapps-based Flying Phyllis Diller, an ode to the queen of one-liners whose gay fan base is immense. Yes, Lipstick Lounge is a gay bar, but foremost it's \"a bar for humans,\" its owners are fond of saying. It's a bar for anyone who likes to have fun in a welcoming but wild atmosphere. — Mackensy Lunsford, The Tennessean\n\nRead a full review of The Lipstick Lounge.\n\nSahara Lounge | Austin, Texas\n\nDetails: 1413 Webberville Road; 512-927-0700, saharalounge.com\n\nSahara Lounge sits at the eastern edge of Austin and at the heart of a community that still represents Austin at its best: funky, soulful, eclectic and diverse. The ramshackle bar owned by musicians Eileen Bristol and her son, Topaz McGarrigle, sometimes feels like it might fall down when regular Africa Night or Body Rock ATX parties pump at full throttle. Bartenders quench the thirst of clubgoers with cold Sahara Slants, the house’s namesake cocktail made with the Ghanaian spirit akpeteshie. Looking for a beer without the bass drop? Before the show, you can soak in the space’s musical history, documented with old concert posters, or head to a table out back, where the conversation flows like the Quan Yin fountain honoring the Bodhisattva of Compassion. — Matthew Odam, Austin American-Statesman\n\nRead a full review of Sahara Lounge.\n\nBryant's Cocktail Lounge | Milwaukee, Wisconsin\n\nDetails: 1579 S. Ninth St.; 414-383-2620, bryantscocktaillounge.com\n\nAt Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge, owner John Dye is most proud when customers liken his bar to a museum. It first opened in 1937 and serves drinks from every decade it has been open: Depression-era cocktails like rail splitters and sidecars, hurricanes made popular during World War II and colorful cosmopolitans popular in the 1990s. The bar’s bestsellers are ice cream drinks like pink squirrels (rumored to have been invented at Bryant’s) and grasshoppers, along with the Wisconsin old-fashioned. The bar’s interior was well preserved until a fire destroyed it in 1971. The owner at that time rebuilt it as a dimly lit, vintage 1950s cocktail lounge sparing no expense, according to Dye. The lounge has been preserved since, giving Bryant’s its historic charm today. — Jordyn Noennig, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nRead a full review of Bryant's Cocktail Lounge.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2015/05/17/newakrs-del-pez-offers-inviting-flavors-excellent-cocktails/27483787/", "title": "Newark's Del Pez offers inviting flavors, excellent cocktails", "text": "Patricia Talorico\n\nThe News Journal\n\nCheery plates, bright flavors, cold drinks.\n\nDel Pez Sea Mex on Newark's Main Street has all the ingredients that promise a good dining experience.\n\nYet, a meal out isn't always about food. And while some promises weren't fulfilled, the Mexican seafood restaurant eatery's excellent cocktails and outdoor people-watching tend to make up for a few of its correctable shortcomings.\n\nBut, first thing's first. Del Pez is owned by Javier Acuna, whose Hakuna Hospitality Group restaurants include Santa Fe Mexican Grills in Wilmington and Newark. He opened the Del Pez restaurant, specializing in Latin cuisine, in August 2014.\n\nIn November 2014, Acuna received the Delaware Restaurant Association's Restaurateur of the Year. The award honors a restaurant owner who shows originality, quality and service to customers. Acuna also operates La Bodega catering company, Mi Ranchito marketplace in Newark and the relatively new La Taqueria Santa Fe in the Wilmington Riverfront Market.\n\nOn one of the first sunny, warm, flip-flop wearing, inviting days of the spring, the dining room of Del Pez quickly filled with patrons and so did the outdoor tables.\n\nNewark's Main Street, especially when it's packed with strolling bands of locals and University of Delaware students, is arguably one of the best places in the state to don a pair of sunglasses and drink in the scene.\n\nDel Pez's dining room has a relaxed atmosphere, but the layout is a little awkward. Just like the days of its former occupant Cucina di Napoli, and later Tarantella di Napoli, the open kitchen is plunked along the left wall. If you're seated at one of the tables near the front, be prepared to be staring at servers' backs, and posteriors, as they gather plates coming from the kitchen.\n\nBeer always makes a fine pairing with Latin cuisine, but a margarita is even better and the bartenders here know how to mix a drink.\n\nThe Oro margarita ($11), a tart, bracing blend of freshly-squeezed lime juice, sugar, Grand Marnier and Tequila Cazadores Reposado, is one of the finest I've tasted in Delaware, outside of Agave in Lewes.\n\nEqual time might want to be paid to the Pisco sour ($11). The bite of the Peruvian pisco (grape brandy) and fresh squeezed lime juice is tamped by a hint of sugar. A frothy egg white topping is sprinkled with fragrant \"Burlesque Bitters,\" made of aromatic hibiscus flowers and sour berries along with a hint of peppery spice.\n\nA tasty cocktail with a hint of sour tends to marry very well with anything flecked with salt. At Del Pez, rather than sturdy tortilla chips, complimentary bowls of yuca chips come to the table along with bowls of fresh, bright pico de gallo.\n\nGet a side of the traditional guacamole ($6.50 for small, $9.50 for large) for more dipping while you savor the cocktails. The flavors of garlic, tomatoes, onions and pickled jalapenos are very good, though we were hoping for a chunkier blend of avocados. The mingling colors of green and red from guacamole that's festively garnished with bright red, pickled cabbage make it feel like the party is just getting started.\n\nMore red cabbage accompanies the crab quesadilla ($13), a straight-forward combination of crab meat, pepper jack cheese and roasted jalapeno enveloped in tortillas. Chipotle remoulade is served on the side of this shareable snack that easily feeds three.\n\nThe menu seems to have changed since my first Del Pez visit last fall. At that time, I asked for a suggestion and the staff said to try the blackened swordfish nestled in pickled red cabbage leaves.\n\nIt was an awesome recommendation – and a good choice if you want to skip carbs. Alas, during a recent visit, the item, topped with avocado, mango, peppers and white beech mushrooms, has been 86'ed.\n\nNot in the mood for seafood? The menu also includes pork belly, grilled flank steak, chorizo empanadas and blackened chicken quesadilla. All fine choices, for sure, but we were here for fish.\n\nOur server suggested the blackened mahi mahi tacos ($11). Tacos arrive in orders of three, but this is no simple garnish of cilantro, onions and lime wedge. The fish, folded in corn tortillas, is topped with a satisfying vegetarian delight of mango, wild mushrooms, carrots, peppers and avocado along with a zippy agave-chile sauce. This was the vivid dish to beat, and, if truth be told, I won dinner that night.\n\nMuch less successful were \"Voodoo\" shrimp fajitas ($17). While our server promised the cast-iron platter would be the superstar of the evening – a steamy, sizzling celebration weaving its way to our table – it turned out to be a disappointing dud.\n\nWhere were the wisps of smoke and steam? Instead, we got a less-spicy-than-suggested, no sizzle, plate of overcooked scallops, shrimp and mahi mahi, and limp bell peppers. Talk about a meh moment.\n\nWhat happened? Confusion reigned until we realized, perhaps due to an order mix-up, we accidentally received another dish, the Los Cabos Fajitas ($21). It apparently sat on the counter a little too long and lost its mojo.\n\nBy the time we realized the mistake, however, the restaurant was so busy, we couldn't flag down our server for a replacement and picked through the dish. The accompanying sides – warm corn tortillas, shredded cheese, chopped tomatoes, a pile of greens and more of that pickled red cabbage – helped, somewhat. Our server returned after napkins were folded and plates pushed aside. It was too late for a do-over. His sincere, crestfallen look and apologies after we told him about the fajitas flop made up for the mistake.\n\nA better option is salmon, ($18), a substantial portion of fish topped with sneaky-spicy habanero mango barbecue sauce, and served with a side of roasted fingerling potatoes, tobacco onions and mango-tomatillo vinaigrette salad.\n\nOur server, still feeling bad about the fajitas, tried to entice us into dessert. Tres leches cake? Another margarita, perhaps? Pisco sour?\n\nAlcohol to end the meal is certainly tempting, especially when you're dining in a college town and the drinks are this good. Ah, those fuzzy, tipsy memories of youth.\n\nBut, our older and, now hopefully, much wiser selves had been down that path many times before. Being a full-fledged grown-up sometimes means knowing when the party is over. It was time to ask for the bill and bid a goodnight.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com.

Now she's an innocent bystander in the comments section of her Instagram page, which has become a battleground for angry basketball fans taking shots at Team USA for not adding Clark to the squad.\n\n\"Be so for real, Women’s basketball is having a moment because of Clark,\" one fan declared.\n\n\"Why is everyone talking about the WNBA lately??? Oh, its that one player THAT THEY DIDNT PUT ON THE TEAM!!!,\" fumed another person.\n\n\"No CC, I guess me and millions are not going to watch,\" a third person chimed.\n\nWho is Caitlin Clark?\n\nAfter gaining millions of fans from her record-setting college career at Iowa, Clark brought her fan base to the Indiana Fever where she was selected as the No. 1 pick in the WNBA Draft in April.\n\nIn college, Clark became a household name and was known for her incredible scoring ability, dynamic passing and competitive spirit. Her star power became known as the \"Caitlin Clark Effect.\" The effect includes bringing an unprecedented amount of attention to women's basketball and women's sports in general.\n\nClark helped the WNBA set a record this spring with 2.45 million viewers tuning in to ESPN to see her get drafted. That's nearly five times the viewership from the 2023 draft (512,000) and up 307% versus the previous record in 2004 when Diana Taurasi was drafted No. 1 overall (601,000 viewers), according to Sportico.\n\nThe \"Caitin Clark Effect\" didn't end at the draft.\n\nThe WNBA began its 28th season in May and the league finished the month with its highest-attended opening month in 26 years. It also saw the most-watched start of season across each network: ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, CBS, ION and NBA TV, the WNBA said in press release on June 10.\n\nWith the Fever, Clark averages 16.3 points per game, ranking 15th in the league for PPG. She's by far the most popular player in the WNBA, but she's not the best. The rookie is going through growing pains on a struggling team with a record of 3-10.\n\nWhy was Caitlin Clark left off Olympic team?\n\nJen Rizzotti, chairperson for the Team USA selection committee, gave an explanation for why Clark was left off the Olympic squad.\n\n\"Here’s the basketball criteria that we were given as a committee and how do we evaluate our players based on that?” Rizzotti told the Associated Press in an interview. “And when you base your decision on criteria, there were other players that were harder to cut because they checked a lot more boxes. Then sometimes it comes down to position, style of play for Cheryl (Reeve) and then sometimes a vote.”\n\nCaitlin Clark responds to not making Team USA\n\nWhen it comes to not making Team USA, Clark shared her reaction to media on Sunday, June 9, which included IndyStar.com, a sister publication to Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\n\"I'm excited for the girls that are on the team. I know it's the most competitive team in the world and I know it could've gone either way,\" Clark said. \"I'm going to be rooting them on to win gold.\"\n\nWhich players made Olympic team over Clark?\n\nThe 12 women who made Team USA are Napheesa Collier, Kahleah Copper, Chelsea Gray, Brittney Griner, Sabrina Ionescu, Jewell Loyd, Kelsey Plum, Breanna Stewart, Diana Taurasi, Alyssa Thomas, A'ja Wilson and Jackie Young.\n\nTeam USA will play Japan at 3 p.m. EDT on July 29, which will be broadcasted on NBC.\n\nFan wants Aubrey Plaza on Olympic team\n\nNot everyone on Plaza's IG page was upset about Clark being left off Team USA. Some people thought it was a good decision. Others were indifferent.\n\n\"If y’all don’t want to watch THE OLYMPICS, that’s on you. I’ll be seated on my couch in my USA gear,\" an IG user explained.\n\n\"Everyone complaining about CC the bust, need to be greatful that she was left out.

Burning, bitter, sweet. The cocktail requires a love of browns, history and a little heat.\n\nDrinking it is a rite of passage for newcomers. But you don't just go drink a Picon punch by yourself and suddenly become a Nevadan. You drink it with friends who dared you to try a new experience that everyone else seems to hate.\n\nAt first, you grimace from the burn, but by the end, you order another and force others to do the same.\n\n“If you’re a Nevada bartender you should know how to make a Winnemucca Coffee and a Picon punch,\" said Duncan Mitchell, owner of Chapel Tavern. “I grew up on them — that was part of my childhood — dipping my finger into my grandpa’s glass when I was a kid.”\n\nFor the uninitiated, the Picon punch is a Basque-American cocktail made of grenadine, a strong bitter orange liqueur and club soda stirred together with cheap brandy and a lemon peel added to the top.\n\nMany people seem to know of the concoction at least in passing. They hear that at first you hate it, then two drinks later, you're hooked or on the floor.\n\n\"The first two are the Picon, the third one is the punch,\" Louis Erreguible used to say about the cocktail. Erreguible opened Louis' Basque Corner in the 1960s.\n\nObituary:Louis Erreguible of Louis' Basque Corner dies at 90\n\nLike living in the desert, it's a love-hate experience.\n\nThe Picon punch lives a legend steeped in Western expansion, immigration and reinvention. It appears in newspapers, books, plays and hundreds of travel guides throughout the last century.\n\nFor three legislative sessions, legislators (namely Reno City Councilman David Bobzien) tried and failed to make it the official state drink.\n\n“Around the country there’s not a lot of state drinks,\" Bobzien said.\n\nHe's right, about half of the United States picked a state beverage and most of them are milk.\n\n\"But the Sazerac is the cocktail picked by New Orleans and recognized by Louisiana,\" he added. \"Washington D.C. recognized the Rickey. I think it’s high time we do this. Especially when we’re in this spirit of growth with new people coming here. What better way to share the spirit of Nevada.”\n\nBut here's the rub: It was invented in California.\n\nAn Italian man, Gaétan (pronounced Geh-tonn) Picon, visited Algeria, Africa in 1837 while serving in the French Army. There, he discovered local herbs and made a 78-proof liqueur named Amer Picon.\n\nAmer is French for \"bitters.\" So, think of the bitters in a Manhattan or the dark, herbal Fernet Branca (also French and made around the same time) and other digestifs and aperitifs.\n\nAmer Picon is the main ingredient in Picon punch, though in 1837, the cocktail had not been invented.\n\nNo one cared about Amer Picon for 40 years until it won a contest the French government held to find a replacement for absinthe (presumably because everyone needed to stop freaking out all the time).\n\n“Yes the French government offered a prize of 100,000 francs for a substitute for absinthe which would quiet the nerves, induce a healthful slumber and do no harm. Amer Picon earned the money,\" according to a 1906 article in the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.\n\nAmer Picon pushed out absinthe as the top drink.\n\n\"The reign of absinthe is drawing to a close. He has been a most malevolent king, eating out the brain of his subjects,\" according an 1883 article dispatched from the Boston Advertiser about Amer Picon.\n\nThe author suspected Amer Picon would eventually turn evil, too.\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Picon sold more than 3 million liters in France in 1871. It spread across Europe and eventually to the New World, selling 25 million bottles by 1885.\n\nAt the same time, the Basque people — wedged between France and Spain — immigrated to California looking for gold.\n\nBy the time they arrived, the gold rush was over. So, they turned to sheepherding and opened boardinghouses and family-style restaurants for their fellow immigrants.\n\nIn America, Amer Picon was marketed as a patent medicine. Patent medicines purportedly calmed fevers, prevented Malaria and made everyone look good to the opposite sex.\n\nBut Amer Picon at least helped with the Malaria because it included cinchona bark.\n\nA front-page advertorial appeared in The New York Times Sunday Edition in 1889 pushing Amer Picon as the newest medicinal tonic. The United Grower's Co. told people to dilute the bitter with water, drink it by the spoonful or take a shot when sick.\n\nBut. But! They also said it could be enjoyed with soda water as a refreshment. Similar articles in other newspapers also recommended adding grenadine to make the herbal liqueur easier to drink.\n\nThe groundwork was laid for a cocktail. The British Army similarly convinced infantrymen to drink quinine-enriched tonic to stave off Malaria — with gin.\n\nBy 1893, Amer Picon shipped West.\n\nSomewhere in North Beach, San Francisco in the late 19th century, the Picon punch cocktail was created.\n\n\"In San Francisco, North Beach was the hub of cocktail culture,\" Shanna Farrell, an oral historian and cocktail expert at University of California, Berkley, told the RGJ. \"There was a block on Columbus Avenue called 'Devil’s Acre' ... That was where everybody was coming through the port, lots of immigrants, especially from Italy.\"\n\nThe first newspaper reference points to the Picon punch's creation about 1899. But it might've started a little earlier.\n\nA play called \"The Heart Line: A Drama of San Francisco\" takes place in 1877, though it was published in 1907. One of the characters compares his pain of losing a woman to the pain of drinking a Picon punch. It's difficult to tell if the reference is contemporary or in keeping with the period of the play.\n\nIn either case, it's believed the cocktail was created in the Basque-American boardinghouses that no longer exists.\n\nSometimes the Noriega Hotel in Bakersfield, California gets credit for the creation. But separate accounts point to people finding the cocktail in San Francisco and taking it to other large Basque communities in Nevada and California.\n\nBasque people set up boardinghouses in San Francisco as early as 1870. Hotel Vasco and The Basque Hotel were among the first.\n\n“(Hotel bartenders) were the social concierge of town, so they would be the one to lock up the hotel, point people to the right place and were the tourist centers,\" Farrell said.\n\nIt would make sense that immigrants would've come together over a familiar drink and a hotel bartended might've created a cocktail somewhere in the mess of it all, she said.\n\nIf bartenders knew bitters aided digestion and staved off Malaria and some Basque patrons just ate a giant family-style meal, they probably would've served Amer Picon.\n\nBut what if someone didn't like the bitter flavor? We already know people suggested adding club soda and grenadine to make Amer Picon more palatable. Simply tossing a lemon or lime peel on top would've completed the cocktail.\n\nThe whole thing just needed a catchy name to go viral.\n\nThough strictly speaking, the Picon punch does not qualify as a punch at all because punches are made with fruit juices and tend to come in bowls for parties. The lemon is more of a garnish, really. It clearly wasn't a lengthy brainstorming session.\n\nIn 1899, Louis Vetter, a socialite and councilman in Los Angeles constantly mentioned in the newspaper, brought the drink to town after a visit to San Francisco, according to Los Angeles Herald archives.\n\n\"When you feel like a wad of dry cotton, a Picon punch will make you as contented and salubrious as if you had been elected mayor,\" Vetter said.\n\nHe was never elected mayor, despite several attempts.\n\nAt the same time, a man named Herman Thyes expanded a popular saloon in downtown Reno, which eventually settled with the name, Thyes and Co.\n\nHe moved from San Francisco and frequently visited home to see family, friends and business partners, according to train manifests.\n\nHe opened three saloons during the course of 20 years. He also served as fire commissioner.\n\nEvery few weeks, he introduced a new drink to town — an imported beer, a fancy cocktail, a soda machine — and was considered the most cutting edge saloon owner in Reno.\n\nIn 1900, he brought the \"Picon lemonade\" to town. One week later, the drink name was corrected to Picon punch, according to Nevada State Journal archives.\n\nSoon thereafter, the recipe appears in motel bartender guides, cookbooks and newspapers.\n\nBy 1906, the Picon punch made it to Hawaii. In a summer home-cocktail guide the Honolulu Star-Advertiser wrote:\n\n“Lately the Picon punch has been around Honolulu getting acquainted. If there is any liquor in this fine drink it is not discernible to the taste nor do you find it in your head after a long draught. Amer Picon, an Algerian bitters, procurable in town, is at the bottom of the beverage. Take a goblet with a few lumps of ice in it, pour in one-half an inch of grenadine syrup, one inch of Amer Picon, squeeze in six drops of lime juice and then sizz in mineral water from a syphon until the goblet is nearly full. Stir with a spoon and if the mixture has the rich, dark brown color of Hire’s root beer, it is well made. If not, put in more Amer Picon. Then drink and drink and thank the French government for providing you with the summer beverage par excellance.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Herald called the Picon punch a \"temperance\" drink, which sounds like a bad joke. Most people today consider the 80-proof cocktail pretty strong. But before prohibition people drank cask-strength bourbon or rum by the pint or half pint every day with breakfast.\n\nBrandy was sometimes added to the Picon punch recipe in bars, presumably to amp up the original recipe. But like today, the addition didn't seem to improve the flavor for many.\n\nIn the fiction book, \"Three Rich Men\" written in 1932, the brandy float is addressed thusly:\n\n\"D'you care for a picon punch, Will? It isn't made in a bowl. And there won't be a damnable brandy float on the top...\"\n\nThe character recalls a bad time in Chicago:\n\n\"I said to her, 'A Picon punch,' and when it was brought it was undrinkable. I dressed...went down to the bar. Showed the bartender how to mix one. We sipped it. He tried his hand; wasn't right. We drank it anyhow. Then I...anyhow, I don't believe I ever did go back to my room.\"\n\nCue prohibition. All references to the Picon punch disappear until after Amendment 21 passed.\n\nThen it comes back with a vengeance.\n\nThe Picon punch makes numerous appearances throughout casual articles listing the food and drink served at soirees and events. It also shows up in a hilarious series of court reports wherein people started fights after consuming three or more.\n\nTorani, the Italian syrup company that makes all the flavors squirtable into morning coffee, opened a grocer and drink mix maker in San Jose, California in 1925. It started making Picon-style amer to fulfill demand for the original Amer Picon, which was difficult to find after prohibition.\n\nIn the 1930s, advertisements for Amer Picon appeared again, pushing the \"famous Picon punch\" recipe. But it wasn't the same and Torani Amer dominated the competition.\n\n\"From what I understand, Amer Picon went through a lot of changes,\" Andrea Ramirez, a Torani spokesperson, told the RGJ. \"The French one was initially changed to lower and lower proof. Ours has always been closer to the original 80 proof.\"\n\nAmer Picon is now 18 proof while Torani Amer is 78 proof.\n\nAbout 2000, Amer Picon stopped shipping to the United States all together, though versions of the amer still exists, and it can be purchased in France or online.\n\nOriginal antique bottles of Amer Picon sell for thousands of dollars online and don't last long in a drink that demands 2.5 ounces per serving. Some people also tried their hand at homemade replicas.\n\nBriefly, the Whitney Peak Hotel's Heritage restaurant — now Roundabout Grill — served Picon Punches with the lower alcohol French Amer Picon in 2014. Whitney Peak staff discovered the bitter in the store room after taking it over from Comm Row and Fitzgerald's Casino before that.\n\nThe bottle survived two life cycles and made it into grand opening drinks.\n\nOnce Whitney Peak ran out, they discovered Amer Picon was no longer available and switched to Torani's version.\n\nThat brings us to today.\n\nTorani carried the Picon punch torch in America for almost 80 years.\n\n\"It’s the lone alcohol product we currently make,\" Ramirez said. \"It’s been about the same size of our portfolio ever since (1925). There’s one distributor buying it in Boston. But it’s mostly sold near large Basque communities.\"\n\nTorani doesn't even advertise the alcoholic product.\n\nShe said Torani's strongest markets are Elko and Bakersfield, California. In each city, the Picon punch is made differently. In Ely, it's made with gin instead of brandy. Some bars serve it in a high ball glass, most use the Louie Punch glass. Some garnish with lemon and others use lime or oranges.\n\nPatrons swear by their favorite minor variation whether it's from The Martin Hotel in Winnemucca or The Star in Elko.\n\nChris Shanks, owner of Louis' Basque Corner, said his bartenders probably serve nine variations depending who orders it. More grenadine for the ladies, more amer for the Bascos, for example.\n\nAnd yet, two new distillers won't let the 180-year-old bitter die. They offer new competition to a market that probably didn't need it. In many ways, the whole revival is reminiscent of America's 19th century cocktail obsession.\n\nIn Golden, Colorado, Golden Moon Distillery makes Amer dit Picon using the original 1837 recipe.\n\nOwner and distiller Steven Gould found a step-by-step guide from an original Amer Picon distillery. He also realized he owned two antique bottles of the stuff.\n\n\"Before I went down the rabbit hole, I drank a lot of pre-1880 Amer Picon,\" Gould said. \"It was not an easy thing to make.\"\n\nGould, who is from Reno, spent two years researching how to make Mr. Picon's 1837 Algerian, anti-Malaria bitter with all the original ingredients and processes.\n\nHe said no one will find a more authentic representation of the first recipe.\n\nAnd over on Fourth Street in Reno, sharing a parking lot with a 1960s Basque boardinghouse, another distillery started making a similar amer.\n\nAfter Shanks bought Louis' Basque Corner in 2011, he said he considered reviving the original Amer Picon recipe. Opening The Depot Craft Brewery Distillery next door gave him that opportunity.\n\nThe Depot quietly released Amer Depot two months ago. It's also made with cinchona, elderberries, lemon peel, quinine, various herbs, roots and orange peels soaked in The Depot's gin made from Nevada corn and barley.\n\nCompared to The Depot and Golden Moon, modern Amer Picon and Torani Amer use neutral spirits, natural flavors, caramel coloring and juice concentrate. A taste test reveals significant differences between them all.\n\nShanks worries that Amer Depot's color is too light and people will turn their noses up at it in a traditional Picon punch. So instead, the Depot created a pinkish-colored drink that tastes more like a Picon lemonade and is made with Amer Depot, club soda, pomegranate syrup, lemon and a Depot Rye Whiskey float.\n\nIt's blasphemous and delicious.\n\nBut what if Shanks is wrong? A traditional Picon punch made with Amer Depot and Churchill Vineyards brandy loses the harsh burn and gains flavors not found in any Picon punch for 100 years.\n\nMore importantly, the main ingredients come from Nevada.\n\nMaybe now Bobzien can convince the Nevada legislators to commit to a state drink even though Las Vegas residents and bartenders have no idea what Northern Nevadans are going on about.\n\nOr maybe no one really owns the drink?\n\nAfter all, the main ingredient was invented in Africa by a French soldier who inspired Bascos to craft a cocktail in San Francisco that was enhanced by Italians and enjoyed by Nevadans.\n\nMike Higdon is the city life reporter at the RGJ and can be found on Instagram @MillennialMike, on Facebook at Mike Higdon, Reno Life and on Twitter@MikeHigdon.

Restaurants were allowed to set up tables on sidewalks and in parking spots in front of their establishments.\n\nAnother popular city event last summer was Dining on Delaware. Last August, the city closed parts of Delaware Avenue in Wilmington's Trolley Square/Forty Acres neighborhood Fridays evenings through Sunday.\n\nHollywood-style:Philly-style cheesesteak wit Wiz on HBO is a vegan jawn made in Delaware\n\nNeighborhood restaurants like Catherine Rooney, Crow Bar and Trolley Oyster House were allowed to set tables in the roadway and on sidewalks. Live music usually was part of the entertainment.\n\nGot an itch to dine outside? Here's what we know so far:\n\nWilmington's West Side\n\nOutdoor dining throughout the city last year was a salve for many struggling restaurants.\n\nWest Side Wednesdays, a recurring weekly promotional event intended to highlight the diversity of the Wilmington neighborhood and businesses around and near Union, Lincoln and Fourth streets and Lancaster Avenue, has returned and will run through Sept. 29.\n\nRestaurants are offering specials deals along with outdoor seating on sidewalks and are setting up tables in some parking spaces on Wednesdays while retail businesses will have a variety of promotions.\n\nParticipants include longtime establishments like Mrs. Robino's, Eclipse Bistro, Papa's Food Market, Dominican Cafe, Ristorante Attilio, Comegy's Pub, Dead President's Pub and Kozy Korner, along with Lopez La Espiga Bakery and Dino’s Ice Cream and Italian Water Ice, as well as neighborhood newcomers including Go Vegan Philly and House of Laffs.\n\nVisitors can expect such extras as the opportunity to win a private cooking lesson with Luigi Vitrone, chef/owner of Pastabilities.

Parking is available in Newark municipal lots 1, 4, 6 and 7 as well as at privately managed lots.\n\nRehoboth Beach\n\nThe orangey-red barriers are back.\n\nFor the upcoming summer season in the Sussex County beach town, restaurants were again allowed to apply for an outdoor seating permit for sidewalks and public areas.\n\nCity officials advised restaurants that if they wanted to offer outdoor seating that encroached upon public spaces, as they were allowed to do last year under the Governor’s State of Emergency Order, they would have to make an application no later than March 1 and outdoor dining could begin in April.\n\nLast season, when indoor dining was severely limited, barriers were set up in front of restaurants, allowing the businesses to use public outdoor space.\n\nRehoboth received 50 applications for outdoor dining permits; 47 were approved, according to Communications Specialist Lynne Coan.\n\nOutdoor seating is available on Rehoboth Avenue and throughout the city.\n\n\"Barriers are up again, but there are fewer than last year; we had fewer requests for barriers,\" Coan said.\n\n\"We don't know exactly when the barriers will be removed (it may depend on the fall event schedule), but it likely will be around Nov. 1,\" she said.\n\nEleutherian Mills at Hagley Museum and Library\n\nThe museum is hosting several upcoming family-friendly events with food and live music on Thursday evenings in May from 5 to 7:30 p.m. on the grounds behind the barn.\n\nOn May 13, Caffe Gelato in Newark will host a pop-up dinner with music from the Acoustic Jam Band.

What to know about recreational marijuana", "text": "Delaware became the 22nd state to legalize recreational marijuana Sunday after Gov. John Carney allowed two bills to become law without his signature.\n\nIt marks an end to a lengthy fight by Democrats to legalize the drug and create an industry with the potential to bring in tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue.\n\nBut what does that mean for Delawareans looking to purchase legal weed or get a license to sell it? We've answered some of the big questions about the future of recreational marijuana in the First State.\n\nBACKGROUND:Carney allows Delaware weed bills to become law without signature. 'It’s time to move on'\n\nWhen can I buy weed in Delaware?\n\nDelawareans will not be able to purchase recreational weed in the First State for at least 16 months.\n\nWhat are the rules?\n\nBuying recreational marijuana will be similar to buying alcohol. You must be at least 21 years old and have a government ID.\n\nAnyone who meets these requirements can get a predetermined \"personal use\" amount of weed: 1 ounce or less of leaf marijuana, 12 grams or less of concentrated cannabis, or cannabis products containing 750 milligrams or less of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.\n\nIt will still be illegal to consume marijuana in public, and employers can continue to enforce their own zero-tolerance drug policies.\n\nWhat if I'm currently facing charges?\n\nIt's unclear from the two bills passed what will happen to people facing charges related to marijuana.\n\nPossessing less than an ounce of marijuana has been decriminalized in Delaware since 2015. However, anyone under 21 caught with weed or with a large amount still faced charges.\n\nWhat happens to medical marijuana centers?\n\nThere will be no changes to any laws about medical marijuana, and there will not be any new taxes on it.\n\nIt is unclear whether medical marijuana centers can also apply to sell recreational marijuana or what that process would look like.\n\nHow will licenses be handed out?\n\nDelawareans can begin applying for licenses to sell, test or cultivate marijuana in 13 months, with the first licenses handed out in 14 months. Licenses will cost $10,000 every two years, and they can be taken away at any time.\n\nThe new laws also include special provisions to ensure equity in licenses. This means that people from communities disproportionately impacted by drug possession arrests or who have been arrested for lower-level drug crimes themselves will have state assistance in applying for licenses, lower fees and dedicated licenses set aside for them.\n\nWhat are the rules for transporting marijuana?\n\nYou can now drive with marijuana within Delaware, as long as it's in a sealed container and out of reach from everyone in the car. Just don't take it out of the state — that's illegal at the federal level and can bring hefty charges.\n\nIt's also illegal to drive after consuming marijuana and runs the same penalties as drunken driving.\n\nCan I now bring marijuana in from states that already legalized it?\n\nNo. Transporting marijuana across state lines is illegal at the federal level, even between two states that have legalized it.\n\nSend story tips or ideas to Hannah Edelman at hedelman@delawareonline.com.

The result is that patients often pay exorbitant prices, must drive hours every week to buy the drug legally, sometimes have to buy it off drug dealers and often can't use the drug when they need it most.\n\n\"There are thousands of people that need this as medicine, and there is too much greed and back-door politics going on here,\" said Todd Boone, a medical marijuana cardholder.\n\nHere is what they face:\n\n• Boone, of Milton, travels 190 miles round trip every week to the state's only dispensary, in Wilmington. He arrives to find not enough of the particular strain of marijuana he said he needs to combat pain he’s had since crashing his motorcycle in 2008. That frustration led him to sue the state to open dispensaries in Kent and Sussex counties, closer to his home.\n\n• Derek, an Iraq War veteran who asked that his last name not be used, couldn’t find a psychiatrist to sign off on his application for a medical marijuana card. He began using marijuana anyway to help him cope with nightmares brought on by post-traumatic stress, but lost his job because of it. Now he turns to alcohol to help him sleep. If that doesn’t work, he keeps a bottle of NyQuil by the bed.\n\n• Victor Zapata, a 15-year-old with uncontrollable seizures, was approved for a medical marijuana card two weeks ago, but his mother is hesitant to start the medication because she fears a hospital stay could derail his progress. Hospitals in Delaware don't administer marijuana products to patients like Victor for fear that the federal government, which still classifies marijuana as an illegal drug, will slap them with hefty fines or take away licenses and federal funding.\n\nSTORY: 10 new health laws that could impact you\n\nSTORY: How to get on Delaware's medical marijuana list\n\nDelaware’s medical marijuana program continues to evolve since it began in December 2011.\n\nEven though the state planned to open dispensaries in each county years ago, the process moved slowly amid threats from the federal government. The first dispensing site, First State Compassion Center, opened as a pilot in Wilmington in 2015.\n\nNow the state is nearing the end of contract negotiations that could open two more dispensaries in Kent and Sussex counties by 2017.\n\nLawmakers have also expanded the list of conditions adults and children need to have in order to be eligible for medical marijuana to include cancer, specific types of autism and seizures. Gov. Jack Markell signed a law Wednesday that adds terminal illness to the list.\n\nThe number of participating physicians has grown at the same pace. Over 300 have recommended patients for cards, with 1,752 patients being approved to date. The majority live in New Castle County, are over the age of 50 and suffer from chronic pain.\n\nDelaware decriminalized possession of small amounts of the drug for recreational use and legalized it for medical purposes, but the federal government has not budged, even amid changing public opinion and interest in research. The Drug Enforcement Administration in August announced it will keep marijuana illegal for any purpose.\n\nStaunch opponents of marijuana legalization — for both medicinal and recreational use — say the loosening stance on the drug is misguided and dangerous.\n\n“This is not a medicine, and it never has been,” said Carla Lowe, founder of Citizens Against Legalizing Marijuana in California. “People are buying into that message. It is all part of the plan [for legalization], and the dopers are pulling the strings.”\n\nDr. Matthew Roman, one of Delaware’s only doctors specializing in medical marijuana, sees the issue differently.\n\n“Delaware has a problem with narcotics,” he said while sitting in his Wilmington office behind a picture of a marijuana plant. “The public is coming to me asking for a way out, and when other doctors just throw more medication at them, this is an alternative.”\n\nBuying an ounce on the street\n\nMedical marijuana patients in Delaware find themselves navigating the tricky web of state and federal laws every day.\n\nIn 2008, Boone was in a crash in which he flew over the handlebars of his motorcycle, shattering his collarbone and back. The 45-year-old underwent multiple surgeries, but still suffers from unbearable pain, nerve spasms and a brain lesion.\n\nHe said he is allergic to opiates that are traditionally used to treat chronic pain, leaving him with little relief on the excruciating days when his body is so stiff he can barely move.\n\nBoone was accepted into the state’s medical marijuana program and now finds himself on weekly trips to New Castle County for his one comfort from the pain.\n\nHe purchases 3 ounces — the maximum allowed by law — every 14 days from the Compassion Center. He then purchases an additional ounce on the street for about $120, or about a third of the price.\n\nFour ounces gives him enough to create a tincture, or a a marijuana oil created by dissolving the drug in alcohol. He takes drops of the solution mixed with grapeseed or avocado oil as a pain reliever.\n\n“This is a natural pain killer,” he said. “The pain is still there, but your body doesn’t respond to it.”\n\nSTORY: Delaware takes cautious approach to marijuana rules\n\nBetween buying the raw marijuana and traveling, he estimates he has spent upwards of $25,000. A dispensary near his home would significantly cut down on that cost.\n\nEven though the state says a dispensary in his home county of Sussex is imminent, he and Trevor Wiberg, who suffers from a rare genetic disease, renewed a lawsuit in August against the state Department of Health and Social Services to force the agency to comply with the Delaware Medical Marijuana Act.\n\nThe act said that all three counties must have a Compassion Center by Jan. 1, 2013.\n\n“If the state tomorrow, next week, next month follows the law, the case will be dismissed, happily,” Boone’s attorney, Edward Gill, said.\n\nPaul Hyland, director of Delaware’s medical marijuana program, said that even though negotiations are private, the state is moving along and expects new dispensaries to begin growing product soon.\n\n“These things take time,” Hyland said.\n\nHospitals remain strict\n\nThe path forward for medical marijuana patients who have to grapple with frequent hospitalizations or admittance into long-term care facilities is not so clear.\n\nHospitals in Delaware do not allow patients to be given or prescribed marijuana on their grounds. If they did so, they say they would face repercussions from the federal government\n\nWhile at Nemours/A.I. duPont Hospital for Children, Olga Zapata described that struggle. Her son cannot express his pain even as doctors poke and prod him to figure out the source of a lingering gastrointestinal issue on top of his regular seizures.\n\nZapata is convinced cannabis oil could reduce the number of Victor’s anti-epileptic medications and keep him out of the hospital, but she fears starting and stopping his treatment for a stint in the hospital would be worse.\n\nSo she hasn’t used the medical marijuana card her son was approved for two weeks ago.\n\n“What would be our choices then? The only choice is to go back to those drugs that we are desperately trying to avoid,” Zapata said. “We have permission to do so, so why would the federal government interfere in a state business? I want the hospital to maintain quality of care and the patient comes first.”\n\nDr. Karyl Rattay, director of Delaware’s Division of Public Health, which oversees the state’s medical marijuana program, empathized with her problem.\n\n\n\n“We know that this is a concern for individuals and it’s a concern for us as well,” Rattay said. “That really needs to be addressed at the federal level.”\n\nSeveral measures have been proposed in Congress to address this matter, but there still is the looming federal mandate. Some states have made changes to increase accessibility.\n\n\n\nConnecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy signed a measure into law that includes a provision that allows nurses to administer medical marijuana in licensed centers, while Gov. Paul LePage, of Maine, signed a bill that offers legal protection to hospitals that dispense marijuana that cannot be smoked or vaporized.\n\nEven with the strict federal law, Dr. Jason Silversteen, director of Christiana Care Health System’s Comprehensive Multiple Sclerosis Center, said he would not rule out medical cannabis for a patient based on the possibility he or she might be hospitalized.\n\nSilversteen certifies patients for medical marijuana and currently is treating about 250 multiple sclerosis patients who use the treatment to combat symptoms of nerve pain.\n\n“You have to be federally compliant, but we do our best to bridge people,” he said.\n\n“It’s a current gap in the system simply because this whole process is still evolving,” Silversteen said. “Hopefully one day this gap closes and it’s made more accessible to all.”\n\nNancy Lemus tried to stave off a hospital visit as long as she could for her son Christopher, but after about a month she broke down.\n\nThe 10-year-old lives with cerebral palsy and dystonia, a disorder that causes debilitating spasms and affects the way the body moves.\n\n“It does him no justice to keep him at home and keep patching something that needs to be fixed,” Lemus, of New Castle, said.\n\nOnce admitted to A.I. duPont Hosptial for Children he swapped his cannabis oil for narcotics to manage the pain. Heartbroken, Lemus met with Nemours’ ethics board to try and find a solution, but officials insisted that changes needed to occur at the federal level, she said.\n\nJanie Maedler, a medical marijuana advocate who pushed for pediatric patients to be able to use cannabis oil in Delaware, said she is fortunate her daughter Rylie, 10, didn’t have to be hospitalized overnight for a procedure last year.\n\nRylie started experiencing seizures in 2013 after a surgery to remove a benign tumor in the left side of her face. The oil was found to calm her seizures.\n\nLast September, Rylie had to go in for an electroencephalogram to catch abnormalities related to the brain’s electrical activity. But she couldn't use her cannabis oil.\n\n“It was torture. As soon as they unhooked her wires they told me you absolutely cannot (give her the oils) until your car is off the property,” Maedler, of Rehoboth Beach, said.\n\nBut she said the hospital is willing to work with parents on a solution.\n\nChris Manning, a spokesman for Nemours, said that physicians who are affiliated with the hospital can certify patients have a particular condition that makes them eligible for medical marijuana cards, but the hospital will not administer, prescribe or dispense medical marijuana on-site unless a patient is enrolled in a federally approved research study.\n\n“The legalization of marijuana for medical purposes at the state level has proved challenging for hospitals and providers around the country,” Manning said. The hospital system “continues to monitor developments at the state and federal level to ensure compliance with the laws.”\n\n‘On the edge’\n\nMore physicians are willing to certify patients for medical marijuana, Rattay said, adding that she personally has conducted presentations with the medical community to educate them on the program.\n\n“When I talk to physicians about medical marijuana, I almost always talk about the opioid crisis we are dealing with,” she said, pointing to limited research that demonstrated a decrease in opiate dependence in states with medical marijuana programs.\n\nRoman, a doctor whom patients often turn to when their primary physician is unwilling to approve them for the program, said he hopes other doctors will also become comfortable with the process.\n\nPsychiatrist Dr. Marc Turgeon recently joined Roman’s office on North King Street in Wilmington, which is marked out front by a green door and a sign for Nature’s Way Medicine that is covered in marijuana-themed stickers.\n\nMore psychiatrists getting on board would help people like Derek, who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and want to use medical marijuana.\n\nPTSD is the only qualifying condition that requires a psychiatrist's sign-off, and there is a shortage of the specialists in Delaware. This, coupled with the fact that the VA falls under federal law, leaves many veterans stuck.\n\n“The veterans are a huge source of patients that we have to turn away,” said Maggie Fauver, Mid-Atlantic Regional director of Canna Care Docs, which helps patients prepare to apply for medical marijuana cards. “We don’t have a psychiatrist on staff.”\n\nSTORY: Grappling with PTSD in a civilian world\n\nSTORY: PTSD proves trial for DE warriors\n\nDerek’s nightmares began before he left the U.S. Army six years ago.\n\nThe Dover resident, who didn’t want his last name to be used because he is applying for jobs, said he made an appointment with the Wilmington VA as soon as he was discharged.\n\n“The very first thing the VA did was hand me a bottle of antipsychotics. The volume of pills and the varieties of pills continued to change,” Derek recalled. “It got rid of the nightmares, but I would wake up in the morning soaked in piss.”\n\nSo, instead, he drank. He said he had recreationally smoked marijuana, but a friend eventually suggested he try it to help with his nightmares.\n\n“I started to notice that I felt happier. I felt like a different person,” Derek said.\n\nBut he couldn’t find a psychiatrist to certify him for a medical marijuana card so he continued to use illegally, costing him his job.\n\nHe almost took his life on three occasions and credits his miniature dachshund Chewy with keeping him alive.\n\n“I’m just like on the edge here,” he said.\n\nContact Jessica Masulli Reyes at (302) 324-2777, jmreyes@delawareonline.com or Twitter @jessicamasulli.

He makes the nearly 180-mile round trip to the state's lone dispensary near Wilmington once a month to purchase the only medication he says relieves his nausea without causing further organ damage.\n\n\"I'm so happy because now I'll be able to afford more medicine,\" he said. \"And I'll tell you that trip can be a five-hour pain ... during the summer time.\"\n\nTouhey expects to save close to $500 a year now that he'll be able to drive a mile up the street to First State Compassion Center South under construction in the Vineyards at Nassau Valley, a mixed-use development off U.S. 9.\n\nRELATED STORY: Rally for marijuana legalization held in Newark\n\nRELATED STORY: Bill would legalize marijuana in Delaware\n\nThe new facility is owned by the same company that runs First State Compassion Center North near Wilmington, which became Delaware's first medical marijuana dispensary in 2015. The center, which is operated by retired state trooper Mark Lally, was selected by state officials to open a downstate operation last fall.\n\n\"We're excited to offer this opportunity to our patients in Sussex County,\" Lally said during a recent media tour of the Lewes facility. \"I'm very proud to say we are able to offer safe, affordable access to the patients' medicine in close proximity to their home.\"\n\nNot all Sussex County patients are thrilled by FSCC's new center, however.\n\nTodd Boone and Trevor Wiberg unsuccessfully sued the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services to comply with a state law that required all three counties to have dispensaries by Jan. 1, 2013.\n\nAlthough the new Lewes-area dispensary comes closer to meeting that goal, both men say Lally's state-approved monopoly on medical marijuana is failing patients whose lives could be improved by greater access to the controversial medication.\n\nThey contend First State has a history of nickle-and-diming patients by limiting the size of its prepackaged products, frequently running out of strains they rely on and selling medication of varying quality. Those issues, they say, are likely to carry over to the Lewes-area dispensary.\n\n“It’s going to be the same headaches ... and the same unreliability – only closer,” said Boone, who lives in Milton. “They didn’t improve the program, and that’s what patients really need.”\n\nFirst State spokeswoman Pamela Johnston said patients like Boone are not necessarily wrong in their criticism.\n\nDelaware limits the amount patients can purchase to 3 ounces in 14 days. But when enough people arrive early to purchase the maximum allowed, the dispensary can run out of packaged supply, forcing other customers to go without their preferred product.\n\nMultiple measures have been undertaken to address supply issues, including limiting packaging of popular strains in smaller amounts to extend the inventory, Johnston said.\n\n\"You have to keep in mind that this is a new business in a nascent industry,\" she said. \"There are going to be growing pains.\"\n\nA long, strange trip\n\nDelaware's foray into medical marijuana has been marked by slow progress and patient frustration from the start.\n\nThe General Assembly approved the Delaware Medical Marijuana Act in 2011, but former Gov. Jack Markell delayed its implementation for years under the perceived threat of prosecution by the U.S. Department of Justice. Marijuana is still illegal under federal law, even for medicinal use.\n\nThe state began issuing the $125 per year identification cards required to purchase cannabis in 2012, although there were no dispensaries to sell the medication. At that time, the card protected patients only from being prosecuted for possession of up to 6 ounces of marijuana, so long as they were not caught purchasing it from what was then the only source: drug dealers.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department issued guidelines for state medicinal marijuana programs in 2013, but it took another year before DHSS approved a bid from Lally to open a pilot growing operation and dispensary in the Germay Industrial Park off Maryland Avenue.\n\nBecause of his background, Lally made an ideal candidate to spearhead the state's first dispensary. During his nearly 25-year career as a state trooper, he served as a narcotics officer and ran the unit that provided personal protection to former Gov. Tom Carper. After Carper was elected a U.S. senator, Lally ran his Sussex County office.\n\n\"For someone like myself from law enforcement to get into this, I think it probably brought some credibility to the process,\" the 61-year-old New Castle County native said. \"We don’t fit the stereotypes that a lot of people have about marijuana.\"\n\nYet legal issues and construction delays pushed First State's opening back until mid-2015 – around the same time lawmakers voted to decriminalize marijuana, downgrading possession of an ounce from a criminal offense to a civil violation, like a parking ticket.\n\nBy then, more than 300 Delawareans were certified to use medical marijuana as a treatment for a variety of conditions, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, HIV and ailments that cause severe pain and nausea.\n\nWhen Lally beat out four other bidders to open Sussex County's first dispensary last fall, the number of medical marijuana cardholders had exploded to nearly 1,900.\n\nThe new center initially was slated to open in January, then March and now possibly April when close to 3,000 patients statewide are expected to be authorized to purchase cannabis.\n\n\"I imagine we’ll start out with about 500 patients,\" Lally said of the Lewes-area facility. \"And I would expect that number to double in six months.\"\n\nCustomer-service changes\n\nThe incredible growth in demand combined with a limited supply – both in terms of dispensaries and the amount of medical marijuana they can produce – has resulted in long lines of patients waiting for the Wilmington-area center to open and select inventory being sold out.\n\nTo help combat runs on popular strains, the dispensary recently added a new inventory management system to better anticipate spikes in demand. Patients from Sussex County can place orders by phone to ensure the dispensary does not run out before they arrive. First State North also now sells certain types of cannabis only in single gram packages to ensure enough supply is available for as many patients as possible, Johnston said.\n\n\"FSCC is doing everything it can to track purchases and adjust production,\" she said. \"Patients have every right to voice their concerns, and we want to hear from them to ensure we're providing the best service possible.\"\n\nTo help First State meet demand, the state upped production limits from 150 plants to an amount \"sufficient to meet the qualifying patient population demands\" as determined by the Division of Public Health. Dispensaries also can now maintain an onsite inventory of 2,000 ounces, up from the 1,500 previously allowed.\n\nNo marijuana will be grown at the new 4,500-square-foot Lewes-area facility. Instead, the New Castle County dispensary will nearly double its crop production to accommodate the Sussex County operation and growing demand near Wilmington.\n\nThat's a small comfort to Boone, who suffers from pain, nerve spasms and a brain lesion stemming from a 2008 motorcycle crash. Allergic to the opiates that are frequently prescribed to treat chronic pain, he purchases 3 ounces every two weeks, enough to create a marijuana oil he mixes with grapeseed or avocado oil.\n\n\"If I have to buy an ounce worth in gram packages, that can end up costing me an extra $150 on top of what I have to spend to get there,\" he said. \"Chopping it up like that is something a street dealer would do to make more money.\"\n\nKent facility is next\n\nBoone and other disgruntled patients say they are hopeful real change will come once a planned dispensary in Kent County opens. State officials awarded that bid to New York-based Columbia Care, a leading national medical marijuana provider that operates 20 dispensaries in six states and Puerto Rico. The facility is slated to open this fall, although an exact location has not yet been disclosed.\n\n\"We'll see if that actually happens anytime soon,\" said Wiberg, a 31-year-old Rehoboth Beach resident. \"It seems like the state makes up the rules as it goes along and is not required to stick to any timetable whatsoever.\"\n\nOfficials with patient advocacy groups such as Delaware NORML and the Delaware Cannabis Advocacy Network say they have heard similar complaints. They are also hopeful the arrival of competition helps force First State to lower prices, adjust its packaging and address lingering supply issues.\n\nIn the meantime, both organizations are lobbying the General Assembly to make Delaware the ninth state to legalizes recreational marijuana use. Such a measure, they argue, would help the state fill its current $386 million budget hole, address consumer concerns through the free market and create hundreds of new jobs. State legislators are expected to introduce a bill Thursday that seeks to legalize recreational marijuana.\n\n\"We're the only industry that is actually asking to be taxed and regulated,\" said Zoe Patchell, executive director of the 65-member cannabis network. \"And in the process, you replace what is now a completely illicit market with one that is safe, encourages competition and promotes shared prosperity.\"\n\nFirst State has not taken a position on the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, but Lally agreed that it could benefit his customers.\n\n\"There is no insurance that provides them with financial assistance to purchase their medicine and many of our patients don’t have the ability to work,\" he said. \"To me, I would welcome recreational as part of my business to help supplement the medical part and make it more affordable for the patients who can’t afford it.\"\n\nGov. John Carney is not in favor of legalization for recreational use. He has said the state should first get its medical marijuana program fully operational and allow more time to study legalization in other states. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has indicated it may be willing to allow medical marijuana programs to continue unfettered while signaling a potential crackdown on states that have legalized cannabis for recreational use.\n\nTouhey said he does not get involved in marijuana politics. He also could care less about criticisms of First State or Delaware's medical marijuana program.\n\n\"All I know is First State has a strain that helps my medical condition immensely,\" he said. \"I'm tickled to death that the medicine I rely on is going to be available closer to my home. I don't see any reason to complain about that.\"\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.\n\nWho can get medical marijuana in Delaware\n\nDelawareans must apply for a medical marijuana card in order to purchase at a dispensary.

But there are limits on what you can buy in one transaction. Initially, recreational customers can purchase no more than:\n\nOne ounce of dried plant material, called flower.\n\nTen units of oil to vape, each containing 590mg of THC.\n\nTen packages of edibles totaling no more than 1,100mg of THC.\n\nThe caps are combined across all types of products. That means you can't purchase the maximum amount of flower, vape cartridges, and edibles in one sitting.\n\nDivision of Cannabis Control spokesman Jamie Crawford said the limits aim to ensure there's enough in stock for medical marijuana patients. The rules are only in place for now until the division finalizes standards for the program.\n\nWeed:How long does marijuana stay in your system? What weed-users should know\n\nWhat kind of products are available?\n\nOhio dispensaries sell a range of products, including flowers, vape cartridges, edibles, beverages, and topical creams. The state requires businesses to package flower in 2.83 g amounts, known in the industry as the \"Ohio tenth.\"\n\nInitially, only products allowed under the medical marijuana program will be available to adult-use consumers. That means there won't be pre-rolled joints or concentrates with more than 70% THC on the shelves. Those could become available starting around September.\n\nWhat should I bring to an Ohio marijuana dispensary?\n\nDon't forget your ID. It's illegal for dispensaries to sell to people under 21, and they will card you.\n\nMany dispensaries only accept cash and have an ATM on-site for customers who don't have any. Some stores accept debit cards or automated clearing house payments.\n\nCustomers can place online orders at dispensaries, but they must pay in-store.\n\nThe Division of Cannabis Control proposed rules allowing for online payments down the road. Regulators will also craft rules for home delivery, which is not currently available.\n\nHow much does marijuana cost in Ohio?\n\nFlower typically costs anywhere from $30 to over $100, depending on the strain and amount per container. Vape pens and cartridges can range from $25 to $75. Edibles are usually a little cheaper − about $15 to $30 per package − but high-potency products get more expensive.\n\nThese prices don't account for sales or deals that dispensaries may offer.\n\nHow is recreational marijuana taxed in Ohio?\n\nRecreational marijuana consumers must pay a 10% excise tax on products in addition to state and local sales taxes. The tax revenue goes into four pots of money:\n\nA social equity and jobs program geared toward people who were disproportionately affected by marijuana prohibition.

Or, you know, just have a good time,\" she elaborated. \"I mean, people have been doing it with alcohol for years and it's time for marijuana to be a part of the picture too.\"\n\nLast November, Ohio voters moved to approve Issue 2, which authorizes adults 21 or older to buy and sell marijuana.

Others may have been convicted of felonies after being hired, as was the case with an Uber driver recently charged in the beating of a University of Delaware student.\n\nThe same is also true of traditional taxi cabs and limousines, but those drivers are at least licensed by the state, a process that uses fingerprints to conduct a thorough background check using the FBI’s criminal database.\n\nDrivers for app-based car services in Delaware are not subject to any permitting requirement beyond a basic driver’s license.\n\nInstead, Delaware relies on Uber and Lyft to conduct background checks on their own drivers – screenings that are supposed to weed out anyone convicted of major traffic violations, along with felonies and other crimes related to violence, sexual offenses or child abuse.\n\nState regulators have almost no idea who those drivers are and little ability to verify whether they have clean driving records and criminal histories.\n\nSTORY: Police - Ride-hailing driver choked Delaware student\n\nSTORY: Uber to pay up to $25 million fine\n\nMore and more people – predominately young adults – are now opting to hail an Uber or Lyft car rather than a taxi cab because of their lower cost and ease of use.\n\n“These services are big with millennials who are plugged into the smartphone technology those companies use,” said Marcia Scott, a policy scientist with University of Delaware’s Institute for Public Administration.\n\nNeither company will disclose how many riders they have in Delaware. Uber, by far the larger of the two, says it provides more than 5 million rides a day globally and has signed up \"thousands\" of drivers in Delaware.\n\nCabbies complain that ride-share drivers get more latitude, noting the state allows them to abide by fewer rules and regulations. That gives Uber and Lyft an unfair advantage and puts riders at risk, cabbies said.\n\n“These companies are allowed to do whatever they want,” said Hamid Messari, owner of Blue Hans UD Taxi in Newark. “All we want is a level playing field, but right now the whole thing is a big mess.”\n\nCritics argue the San Francisco-based businesses are nearly identical to their taxi counterparts. Uber and Lyft, they say, are simply using a new kind of dispatch system, while relying on loopholes and legal gray areas to avoid regulations that apply to their competitors.\n\n“Taxi companies in Delaware are mostly mom-and-pop operations, while Uber and Lyft are huge companies,” Scott said. “It’s not hard to understand why the taxi companies might rail against those giants not being held to the same regulations.”\n\nFalling through the cracks\n\nAt least one Delaware Uber driver with a history of violence already has slipped through a crack in the state's regulatory system.\n\nYolande Mcallister, a 32-year-old Uber driver from Christiana, picked up an intoxicated University of Delaware student sometime before 10 p.m. on May 17, according to court records. He then drove the 19-year-old man to George Read Hall, a dormitory off New London Road in Newark where police say Mcallister beat and strangled the student.\n\nBoth men got out of Mcallister's car at the dorm. Witnesses told police the Uber driver punched the student, knocking his head against the car's bumper. Mcallister choked the student before going back to his car to get his cell phone, witnesses said in court documents. The driver allegedly used his phone to make a video of himself kicking the student as the man lay on the ground.\n\nMcallister fled the scene. According to court documents, the officer who arrested Mcallister at his home said the driver can be heard boasting in the cell phone video, \"I just had to knock this white boy out.\"\n\nPolice said Mcallister told them he had planned to post the video to Instagram.\n\nMcallister claimed the \"extremely intoxicated\" student had punched him in the back of the head during the trip, court records say. After arriving at his destination, the student – whose name is redacted from court records – got out of the car and fell to the ground, Mcallister told police. The driver says he laughed at the teen, prompting the student to punch Mcallister in the face through the open driver's side window.\n\nNone of the witnesses quoted in court documents said they saw the teen punch Mcallister.\n\nMcallister admitted to punching the student but denied choking or kicking him. The student was too intoxicated and disoriented to be interviewed, police said in court documents.\n\nMcallister is charged with third-degree assault, strangulation and disorderly conduct. He was released a day after his arrest on a $2,600 secured bond, according to the state Department of Correction.\n\nHe won't be picking up any more fares for Uber.\n\n\"He has been suspended from being able to access the Uber platform while we conduct our investigation and work with the authorities,\" Uber spokesman Craig Ewer said.\n\nWhile Mcallister's Uber career began in February and lasted only a few months, court records show his troubles with the law in Delaware go back years.\n\nHe entered a first-offenders program in 2007 after being charged with offensive touching and terroristic threatening. However, that conviction was too old to show up on Uber's background checks, which only look back seven years.\n\nSince then, Mcallister has twice been charged with offensive touching after allegedly strangling and pushing a family member. Those charges, which were later dismissed, also would not have shown up on Uber's background check, which only flags convictions.\n\nIn March – just weeks before the alleged assault at UD – Mcallister pleaded guilty to a felony conspiracy charge in connection to his role in the theft of nearly $8,000 worth of electronics and video games from Target in the Christiana Mall, his employer at the time. According to police, Mcallister and another employee operated a scheme in which one would bring merchandise the other's register where they would under-charge the items or simply waive them through.\n\nThat conviction should have excluded Mcallister from driving for Uber under rules set by both Uber and the Delaware Department of Transportation, which bars anyone found guilty of a felony from driving for a ride-sharing service.\n\nBut, Ewer said, that guilty plea came a month after Mcallister cleared Uber's background check –– and would not have been discovered by the company for at least another year.\n\nDelDOT requires Uber to recheck its drivers' motor vehicle histories annually, but imposes no rule that forces the company to re-check drivers' criminal history after the initial approval. Even without that requirement, Ewer said Uber does re-check the criminal backgrounds of all its Delaware drivers once a year.\n\nThe follow-up background check might have caught Mcallister's felony conviction, but it would have come months too late for the UD student.\n\nIn defense of Uber, Ewer noted the felony would have been caught eventually. He also pointed out that Delaware law does not require taxi companies to conduct routine background checks after their drivers have been cleared for initial hire. A license to operate a cab is good for up to eight years.\n\n\"What happened in Newark is a regrettable incident and we stand ready to assist the authorities in any way we can,\" he said. \"While no means of transportation will ever be 100 percent safe, Uber's technology creates accountability that improves safety before, during and after every single ride.\"\n\nDelDOT officials declined repeated requests to comment on the lapse that allowed Mcallister to continue driving for Uber after he was found guilty of a felony. They also declined to say whether the incident would lead to any consequences for the company, or policy changes for the state.\n\n\"It is a police matter at this point,\" Delaware Secretary of Transportation Jennifer Cohan said via text message.\n\nLeft in the dust\n\nUber, the nation’s pre-eminent ride-sharing service currently valued at $62.5 billion, arrived in Delaware in 2014 and operates in most of New Castle County, Dover and Sussex County’s beach towns. Lyft says it has been offering rides in New Castle County since early 2015.\n\nYet, so far, the state has asserted only limited regulatory authority over those and other so-called “transportation network companies.”\n\nLast summer, DelDOT signed a memorandum of understanding with Uber that set out the very first guidelines for it to legally operate in Delaware.\n\nGov. Jack Markell said at the time the deal \"shows Delaware’s continued commitment to embracing the innovations of our new economy.\" Wilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams went even further, spending $8,000 in taxpayer funds to rent four billboards welcoming Uber to the city.\n\nRules set out in DelDOT's deal with Uber included background check requirements, minimum insurance standards and prohibitions on drivers taking fares in taxi zones outside train stations and airports.\n\nThose rules do not include requirements placed on the tax industry. Cab companies must get a business license, and drivers must complete a defensive driving course, obtain a special \"Z\" license –– enabling them to drive either a taxi, limo or bus –– get vehicles inspected twice a year and acquire a medallion.\n\nCab companies say those requirements can cost them up to $5,000 a year per vehicle, whereas Uber can utilize its entire fleet statewide for $5,000.\n\nDelDOT set the minimum age for cab drivers and Uber drivers at 18, and eliminated anyone convicted of felony homicide, sexual offenses or crimes against a child.\n\nSTORY: Uber, Lyft halt Austin service after losing vote\n\nSTORY: Uber drivers in Dewey, other towns told to get license\n\nAnyone convicted of driving under the influence, a hit-and-run offense, driving on a suspended license, attempting to flee a police officer, driving faster than 100 mph, reckless driving or bribing a public official also is barred from driving for a period of three to seven years, depending on the offense.\n\nIf Uber violates the Memorandum of Understanding it signed with the state, it could be fined or lose its permit to operate in Delaware.\n\nBut oversight and enforcement has been left largely to Uber.\n\nUnder its deal with DelDOT, Uber only has to turn over a list of up to 50 drivers once every three months to show that background checks and other requirements are being met for its staff. That’s a fraction of the thousands of Uber drivers the company says have given rides in Delaware.\n\nDelDOT must ask for the list each quarter – something the agency has done only once in the last year.\n\n“We’re about 30 or 45 days behind on that,” said Cohan, who took over as state transportation secretary in early 2015. “The letter to them either has gone out or is in the process of going out.”\n\nAfter The News Journal asked about the status of those reports, DelDOT officials said last week they requested a second list of drivers from Uber.\n\nLyft has no deal in place with the state, which means that San Francisco-based company, valued at $5.5 billion, is not subject to any state regulatory oversight.\n\n“We’ve been trying for the last month to reach to them,” Cohan said. “If they are operating in Delaware right now, they are doing it without legal authority.”\n\nLyft's website clearly shows the company's drivers are operating in New Castle County and a company spokeswoman confirmed its drivers have been working in the state since January 2015.\n\nIf DelDOT receives a complaint and can validate that a driver for Lyft is operating in Delaware, the department will issue a cease-and-desist order to the company and put the driver out of service, Cohan said.\n\nLyft declined repeated requests to comment on why it has not responded to DelDOT's communications.\n\nIn December, DelDOT proposed formal regulations for all ride-sharing services. One rule would have made all drivers get a business license. Another would have suspended any driver when a rider complains, pending a review.\n\nBut the agency put the brakes on that proposal two months later when Cohan shifted responsibility for overseeing those companies from the Division of Motor Vehicles to the Delaware Transit Corp. – better known as DART First State.\n\nThe move created a steep learning curve that DART officials are still climbing.\n\n“We’re getting up to speed with it,” said John Sisson, who heads DART, an agency primarily responsible for managing the state’s bus and paratransit services.\n\n“I don’t think there’s a perfect place for it, but it’s not a bad place,” he said. “It can make some sense.”\n\nYet questions about regulatory enforcement and whether drivers should be required to get business licenses, undergo a defensive driving course or abstain from smoking in their vehicles still remain unanswered.\n\nStruggling to keep up\n\nEven before the arrival of Uber and Lyft, DelDOT’s Office of Public Carrier Regulation – a two-person operation with additional responsibilities in the Division of Motor Vehicles – was struggling to keep up with the state’s taxi industry.\n\nA 2013 report commissioned by the Delaware Center for Transportation found that a litany of flaws in the state’s regulatory oversight was directly responsible for creating “both service and safety issues” in Delaware’s taxi industry.\n\nCohan said she hoped to address some of those issues – along with the new challenges posed by Uber and Lyft – by moving the Office of Public Carrier Regulation to DART, and increasing its staffing to four employees.\n\n“It’s something that was under consideration for at least two years,” she said. “DART is more directly involved with transit than DMV and we felt it was a more intelligent use of our resources.”\n\nThat combination of limited oversight and lack of organization may have created a perfect opportunity for Uber and Lyft to take root here and set their own rules of operation.\n\n“Regulations have not caught up to these new companies, which cities and states across the country are just now grappling with,” UD's Scott said. “It’s a difficult and complicated topic, and I’m not sure there are any easy answers.”\n\nTwo sets of rules have been put forward by DelDOT and the General Assembly.\n\nNeither would impose rules on Uber and Lyft that are currently in place to ensure passenger safety in taxis and limos, such as fingerprint background checks or two mandatory vehicle inspections per year.\n\nBoth proposals would require Uber, Lyft and other ride-sharing services to put a sticker in the vehicles' windows. DelDOT's proposal would require drivers obtain a business licenses, like cab companies do. The legislative measure would not require a business license.\n\nBut neither would address background checks.\n\nChanging lanes\n\nDelaware is not alone in scrambling to keep up with Uber and Lyft.\n\nIn just the last two years, roughly 30 states and cities have adopted new rules to govern the burgeoning ride-sharing industry – laws that consistently recognize those businesses as distinct from taxis.\n\nUnlike traditional taxi and limo companies, Uber and Lyft do not employ drivers.\n\nInstead, they simply offer a smartphone app that allows ride-seekers to connect with “independent contractors.”\n\nThe lack of overhead means those companies can undercut traditional taxis with much lower fares. Riders also get billed automatically through the app, eliminating the need for cash.\n\n“There’s just no comparison,” said Don Sandusky, a 49-year-old self-described “technophile” from Landenberg, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe co-owner of a California-based sporting goods company, Sandusky said he has used Uber in Los Angeles, Nashville and New York City.\n\n“Uber is cheaper than a cab and it’s like an instant pickup so you don’t have to hail a cab or wait around for one to show up,” he said. “And you’re riding in an Infiniti instead of some crappy cab.”\n\nThe apps also include rating systems in which riders can grade a driver’s performance, allowing the highest-rated drivers to qualify for the most fares.\n\n“Some Uber drivers will have water or beverages for you to drink,” said Jon Klair, a 31-year-old waiter who uses Uber to get to work at Grain Craft Bar + Kitchen in Newark.\n\n“They want their ratings to go up, while a cab driver probably doesn’t care,” he said. “Plus a cab might cost $60 while an Uber ride is, like $15.”\n\nUber and Lyft, which each get a cut of their drivers’ fares, argue the rules governing taxis should not apply to them because they offer a different business model based on new technology.\n\nIn addition to raising the ire of cabbies, the business practices of Uber and Lyft also have attracted more than 100 lawsuits in recent years, many centered on their classification of drivers as independent contractors, meaning they are not entitled to health care or other benefits that typically come with employment.\n\nLyft, for example, agreed to pay $12.5 million in January to settle a lawsuit brought by California drivers who sought to be recognized as employees. In April, Uber agreed to pay up to $100 million to settle a class-action suit brought by California and Massachusetts drivers who sought the same.\n\nMuch of the recent public and legal attention on those companies, however, has focused on background checks.\n\nEyes on the road\n\nBoth Uber and Lyft insist they conduct thorough background checks, even though no one from those companies actually meets with a driver in person before allowing them to accept rides.\n\nThe companies use third-party services that check names and Social Security numbers against criminal databases and department of motor vehicles files dating back seven years.\n\nUber agreed to pay at least $10 million in April to settle a suit brought by San Francisco and Los Angeles prosecutors. They alleged the company had misled passengers by advertising “industry-leading” driver screening practices.\n\nThe prosecutors claimed Uber failed to uncover the criminal records of 25 California drivers, including registered sex offenders and a convicted murder.\n\nThe company also agreed to pay $28.5 million in February to settle a separate case brought by riders, resulting in Uber renaming its “safe ride fee” to a “booking fee.”\n\nDespite those lawsuits, Uber and Lyft have consistently resisted efforts by cities and states to require enhanced background checks.\n\nBoth companies, for instance, halted operations in Austin, Texas, this month after voters there defeated a ballot measure that would have overturned city regulations requiring them to conduct fingerprint-based background checks.\n\nThe companies spent at least $8.6 million to fight the Austin regulations, claiming fingerprint background checks are less effective than their current systems, biased against minorities and would ultimately hamper their ability to attract drivers by slowing the on-boarding process.\n\nMore jurisdictions are pushing the companies to impose stricter background checks in the wake of several high-profile incidents.\n\nMost notably, Michigan Uber driver Jason Dalton is accused of killing six people during an all-night shooting spree in February. Dalton had no prior criminal history that would have excluded him from driving for the company.\n\nNew York City and Houston are the only cities that require ride-sharing companies to use fingerprinting. New York City may be too big of a market for the companies to risk losing, but Lyft opted to pull out of Houston in 2014 and Uber has threatened to follow.\n\nIt’s a fight Uber has won before by holding out from various cities in Florida, Ohio and Texas before those municipalities relented.\n\nJohn Barrow, an occasional Uber user working to complete his doctorate in electrical engineering at the University of Delaware, said he’s not concerned about background checks.\n\nBut he does believe that Uber and Lyft are skirting rules in place for cabbies.\n\n“The original intent of making a little cash by picking people up if you’re driving somewhere has gone by the wayside,” he said. “Now they’re just being cabs, essentially. I definitely think they’re getting away with something and should be a little more regulated.”\n\nKlair, the Newark waiter and frequent Uber user, said he sees no point in changing the background check rules.\n\n“The way [Uber] tracks the ride, the drop-off and destination, you’d have to be the dumbest criminal to kill or rape someone,” he said.\n\nForcing the issue and risk chasing Uber from Delaware, he said, isn’t worth it.\n\n“It wouldn’t be cost efficient for me to take a taxi,” he added. “I’d have to restructure my entire day and routine because sometimes the bus only runs every hour and they don’t run late at night. Who would I get to take me home?”\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.\n\nSTORY: Uber, Lyft, Google, Volvo, Ford form self-driving car lobby\n\nSTORY: More buiness travelers are ditching rental cars and turning to Uber and Lyft\n\nNew rules down the road\n\nA bill scheduled for a committee hearing Wednesday, sponsored by state Sen. Bryan Townsend, D-Newark, who is running for the U.S. House, would require company stickers in the windows of ride-share vehicles, but would not require them to obtain a business license.\n\nIf that bill fails to pass, DelDOT says it will move forward with its proposed regulations that would include business licenses.\n\nDelDOT believes that all ride-share drivers, each an independent contractor, are required to obtain a state business license, and municipal licenses for each town in which they operate. But Uber is now only required to tell drivers they \"may\" have to get business licenses.\n\nAnd the state has no enforcement mechanism for ensuring they do get those licenses. The Department of Revenue does not track which licenses go to Uber drivers and few drivers have acquired business licenses in the six towns that require them.\n\nOnly one Uber driver, for instance, has purchased a business license in Rehoboth Beach, which charges a $325 annual fee.\n\n“I think it would be naïve of us to think no other Uber drivers are operating here,” Rehoboth Beach police Chief Keith Banks said. “Right now, if we catch one without a license, they will be cited.”\n\nNeither proposal, however, would force Uber and Lyft to provide any more information about their drivers’ criminal history or require them to follow other longstanding regulations on taxis and limousines.\n\n“There are still some big questions that need to be answered about whether these businesses should be part of the free market or come under strict government control,\" said Marcia Scott, a policy scientist with University of Delaware’s Institute for Public Administration. \"I think a lot more research needs to be done, quite frankly.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/new-jersey/marijuana/2021/04/12/nj-medical-marijuana-legalization-legal-weed-cannabis-regulatory-commission/7153616002/", "title": "NJ legal weed: Medical marijuana commission to hold first meeting", "text": "TRENTON - The New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission is finally holding its first meeting, nearly two years after it was established.\n\nThe CRC is set to meet at 2 p.m. Monday, where its five members will begin the process of overseeing legal weed, medical marijuana and the industries expected to grow around them.\n\nThe agenda for the meeting, held virtually, is light. CRC chairwoman Dianna Houneou and executive director Jeff Brown will make remarks. The panel will elect a vice chair. They will adopt an official logo and set a meeting schedule.\n\nThe five members of the CRC are:\n\nHouneou, chair: Senior policy adviser to Gov. Phil Murphy, and a former policy director with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, where she helped craft the 2019 proposed marijuana legalization bills that laid the groundwork for the laws now enacted.\n\nCharles Barker: Projects specialist on U.S. Sen.

Phil Murphy, who appointed three of the five CRC members — as well as its executive director, Jeff Brown, a deputy health commissioner who headed up the New Jersey Medical Marijuana Program.\n\n\"I think there's a chance that you're six months from being able to buy it in one of our med dispensaries that are already up and running,\" Murphy said in a Vice interview last week. \"My guess is it's longer than that for stand-up retail — maybe end of year, maybe early next year.\"\n\nBut in order for New Jersey medical marijuana dispensaries to begin selling to recreational customers, the CRC will have to accomplish another major task:\n\nFix the medical marijuana program\n\nThere are only 15 medical marijuana dispensaries across the state, tasked with serving over 100,000 registered patients. The New Jersey ratio of 7,400 patients per dispensary is among the highest of the 34 states with active medical marijuana programs.\n\nThe crunch has led to a supply-and-demand issue that has left patients empty-handed for years. While state law allows patients to purchase up to 3 ounces of medical marijuana, some dispensaries have placed strict limits on the most popular strains — limiting patients to as little as 1 half-ounce.\n\nThat's why it's vital the CRC devotes resources to making the New Jersey Medical Marijuana Program more affordable and accessible, said Amanda Hoffman, a medical marijuana patient and board member for the Coalition for Medical Marijuana New Jersey.\n\n\"We’ve been dealing with high prices and low inventory for the life of the program,\" Hoffman said. \"Patients are not a priority for big business. They are here to make profits, not provide medicine. Patients and advocates laid the groundwork when no one cared about our difficult to treat, unprofitable medical conditions. Cannabis should be accessible and empowering for patients — not another burden for us.\"\n\nSince 2018, it’s become far easier to get involved in the New Jersey Medical Marijuana Program — as a patent or a doctor — than in the eight years prior as new qualifying conditions were approved and registration fees were lowered.\n\nThe resulting boon — the patient population has increased more than eight-fold since Murphy took office in January 2018 — was supposed to coincide with a 2019 law to massively expand the program, with the Department of Health approving nearly two dozen new dispensaries.\n\nBut the DOH only issued six licenses before a lawsuit by applicants whose pitches were rejected derailed the process, after an injunction prevented the DOH from issuing any more licenses, a 15-month hiatus that only worsened the supply issues.\n\nThat court case has since been resolved, with an appellate court judge dismissing the majority of the complaints in the dispensary applicants’ lawsuit and removing the injunction. Now, the CRC is set to formally take over the New Jersey Medical Marijuana Program — it’s agenda item no. 4 for Monday’s meeting — and finally bring the wave of expansion patients have clamored for years.\n\nAnd by making it easier to get medical marijuana, the CRC will be making it all the easier — and faster — for recreational customers to get their hands on New Jersey legal weed.\n\nMORE: New Jersey legalized weed but forgot about its pot dealers. Now they want in.\n\nRestore trust\n\nThis may be the most important task facing the CRC, though it’s not one regularly talked about.\n\nIf the CRC exclusively listens to cannabis industry leaders or political power brokers involved in the legal weed push, they'll only hear glowing reviews of what's to come: Thousands of jobs. Millions in tax revenue. Thousands of arrests slowed to a grinding halt.\n\nBut outside that inner circle, there’s a layer of skepticism that permeates any conversation about what legal weed will actually look like.\n\nLog onto any social media discussion within the marijuana community, and you’ll see defeated posts from would-be entrepreneurs ruing the hundreds of thousands — if not millions — required to break into the business, even for a “microbusiness” license.\n\nAnd there are hundreds of low-income medical marijuana patients, furious that growing one single cannabis plant in their backyard — the most cost-effective way to get medicine that otherwise costs over $400 per ounce — is still punishable by a five-year prison term.\n\nHouenou, chair of the CRC, acknowledged this skepticism in a February interview with the USA TODAY NETWORK.\n\n\"People expect to be held back because of their prior entanglement in the criminal justice system,\" she said. \"That's why we have to keep pushing reforms, not just in the cannabis context or even in criminal justice.\n\n\"We just have to look at people in a different way.\"\n\nIf the CRC is truly going to \"ensure a fair and equitable adult-use and medical cannabis marketplace,\" as Murphy's office described the mission in a press release, the work needs to start at that first meeting.\n\nMike Davis has spent the last decade covering New Jersey local news, marijuana legalization, transportation and basically whatever else is going on at any given moment.

And after planting in the spring and summer, the farmers are in the midst of harvesting their first crop.\n\nMore:Michigan looking for people to try growing, processing hemp\n\nMore:Vaping illnesses: The difference between black market and medical marijuana dispensaries\n\nThe Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development doesn't know yet how many of those acres were actually planted, said Gina Allessandri, the state's industrial hemp program director, but should have a better idea by the end of the year what kind of yield the first crop will produce.\n\nDavid Connor switched from farming blueberries in Paw Paw, in southwest Michigan, to 26 acres of industrial hemp. This year, he has gotten about 20,000 pounds of hemp that will be split between the hemp flower, which will be used for CBD products, and the hemp stalks that will be used in everything from building materials, textiles and paper materials.\n\n\"We're making some great headway in Michigan,\" he said. \"And in 2020, we think it's going to be a huge year for Michigan.\"\n\nThe return on investment is promising, Connor said. An acre of corn in Michigan during 2018, for example, yielded about 153 bushels at $3.55 a bushel, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, for a value of $543 per acre. Connor said the market value of the products from the CBD plant could be as high as $10,000 to $12,000 per acre.\n\n\"But this is an extremely labor-intensive process,\" he said, noting that since he's just finishing up his harvest, the market value is still an open question. \"But we're very optimistic.\"\n\nHemp and marijuana are both cannabis plants, but hemp has much lower concentrations of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the psychoactive component in cannabis that provides the high for users, than marijuana plants. Since 1970, all cannabis has been categorized as a controlled substance and, as such, considered illegal by the federal government.\n\nThe 2018 farm bill, however, legalized hemp and provides for regulating the growth of the plant. The fibers and stalks are used for a variety of purposes, including clothing, construction materials, paper, and plastic composites, while the seeds and flowers are used in health food and body care products containing cannabidiol, better known as CBD. The bill also allows for the transportation of hemp-based products across state lines as long as the THC level is below 0.3% level.\n\nThe risk involved for hemp farmers in Michigan is that any plant that tests above the 0.3% level has to be destroyed.\n\nCBD-infused products derived from hemp range from tinctures, cream, candy and dog treats to water. CBD is touted, mostly anecdotally, as an ingredient that will do everything from provide relief from chronic pain and anxiety, make your skin smooth and silky, and calm skittish pets. The market for CBD products is expected to grow to $22 billion by 2022.\n\nCasey Yosin, founder and CEO of Total Health Co., a CBD processing facility in Auburn Hills,, transitioned from the building industry to CBD production after a sports injury left him bedridden for six months. He researched the benefits of CBD and started using the plant.\n\n\"From my personal experience, I used CBD to heal,\" he said. \"I figured it's something I can do to get out and help people.\"\n\nAn additional benefit for the hemp farmer, said Gary Schuler, founder and CEO of GTF LLC in Grand Rapids, is the ability to use the entire plant. His company dries and processes the hemp waste, which is then used in food products, animal feed, biodegradable plastic and building products.\n\n\"We're really helping decrease the carbon footprint,\" he said, because some of the petroleum-based plastics can be replaced by the biodegradable plastic made from hemp waste.\n\nWhile waiting for final rules from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which will regulate CBD-infused food products, the state plans to continue the hemp program next year and will still register and license anyone who wants to get involved in the program.

Yet he is in a fight to stave off Republican challenger Daniel Cameron, Kentucky's attorney general.– Joey Garrison\n\nActivists eye Black voter turnout in Mississippi after repeal of Jim Crow-era law\n\nMississippi is holding its first gubernatorial election since the overturning of a Jim Crow-era measure in Mississippi’s 1890 state constitution that targeted the power of Black voters.\n\nThe measure required any individual running for state office to win the majority of the popular vote and a majority of the state’s 122 House districts to be elected. If no candidate was able to do both, then the Mississippi House decided on the election outcome.\n\nIn 2020, voters repealed the system, instead requiring candidates to receive only a majority of the popular vote to get elected in the state.\n\n\"Now that it's just a popular vote, then the influence of the Black vote means more,\" said Charles V.

Officials aim to earn your trust in 2024\n\nWASHINGTON − Ahead of another election cycle that is already shaping up to be contentious, federal and state election officials are in the midst of campaigns of their own to reassure wary voters about the integrity of casting their ballots.\n\nThey are recruiting poll workers, certifying voting machines and hosting lessons on how election systems work in community centers, classrooms and libraries.\n\nThe steps are needed, experts say, to restore voters' confidence in a system that, despite some flaws and outspoken election deniers, was mostly trustworthy and secure in the first place.\n\nThose fraud claims, in part, gave rise to calls for major overhauls of election systems in some states led mostly by Republican lawmakers. Some, particularly voters of color, were already skeptical of a system with a history of discrimination that hasn't always been open to them. New laws to restrict access has fueled that mistrust, experts said.\n\nMuch of the work of assuring voters will fall to local elections officials, experts said. Americans have more trust in their local election systems, which they’re more familiar with, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.\n\n\"People know their local election officials. They know when they go to city or town hall that they trust the people that work there,'' said Rob Rock, Rhode Island's deputy secretary of state. \"It's really important to make sure that people understand the process.''\n\n–Deborah Barfield Berry and Terry Collins\n\nRead the story:Fearful of voter fraud?
