She has performed four abortions on women aged 23 to 48 – all in secret.\n\nAbortion is illegal in the Philippines – a majority Catholic country and former American colony – and has been for over a century. Under the law, women found to have aborted their fetuses face prison terms of between two to six years.\n\nDoctors and nurses caught performing abortions or providing assistance are also subject to harsh punishment by the state. “We risk losing our medical licenses and would also face charges in court,” Miriam said.\n\nManila, the sprawling capital of the Philippines where millions live in slums against the backdrop of modern skyscrapers Alexpunker/iStockphoto/Getty Images/FILE\n\nProsecution for abortion is now a risk for millions of women across the United States after the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that made seeking a termination a constitutional right. Now, states have control over laws governing abortion – and some have banned the procedure outright.\n\nIn the Philippines, many women seek other solutions to unwanted or unviable pregnancies, regardless of risks.\n\nLawyer Clara Rita Padilla, a spokeswoman for the Philippine Safe Abortion Advocacy Network (PINSAN), said that while there are “progressive interpretations” of the abortion law in the Philippines, thereare no clear exemptions allowing for terminating pregnancies even in severe cases like rape and incest – or to save the life of the pregnant woman.\n\nA study conducted by PINSAN in 2020 found 1.26 million abortions were carried out in the country, “placing the lives and health of Filipina women at risk.” And that figure is expected to grow. Another study by the University of the Philippines estimated that 1.1 million abortions occur every year in the country.\n\nPadilla said most women who had abortions came from poorer financial backgrounds, and many were below the age of 25. In the absence of legal services, women often turned to dangerous underground abortions performed by midwives, healers, and untrained doctors in makeshift clinics, she said.\n\n“The Philippines is a product of very conservative religious beliefs. For us, abortion bans are already a reality – and it’s women from poor families and minority groups who suffer the most.”\n\nAbortion rights activists outside the US Supreme Court on June 30, 2022 Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nPower of the church\n\nAbortion rights activists in the US met the Supreme Court’s decision with outrage. But for those grounded in conservative Catholic beliefs or evangelical principles, the end of Roe wasn’t just a political victory – it was a spiritual one.\n\nThis sense of jubilation was also felt in the Philippines, where the Catholic Church wields a great deal of power and influence. Local church leaders and groups who publicly condemn abortion, divorce and the use of modern contraceptives, welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision.\n\n“The US Supreme Court’s decision to ban abortion is good news,” Crispin Varquez, a local bishop and prelate of the Catholic Church in the Philippines, said in an interview on Radio Veritas Asia, a church-run station based out of Quezon City.\n\nVarquez said the move was “timely” as it coincided with holy celebrations for the Feast of the Sacred Heart.\n\n“(It’s) a decision enlightened by the Holy Spirit,” he said.\n\nPope Francis described abortion as akin to “hiring a hitman” and said he respected the Supreme Court’s decision.\n\n“It’s a human life – that’s science,” he told Reuters. “The moral question is whether it is right to take a human life to solve a problem.”\n\nThe shame that many Filipina women feel for seeking abortions is often reinforced by their Catholic culture.\n\n“The Catholic Church propagates the narrative that abortion is murder,” said Marevic Parcon, another founding member of PINSAN. Like most Filipino women, Parcon was raised Catholic. She said that religion had shaped her views about abortion very early on. “Attending church, you were always taught to fear abortions,” she said.\n\n“Nuns would show us videos of late stage abortions – it was that horrible control they had over your psyche and emotions.”\n\nThe Filipino Catholic Church and the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) did not respond to CNN requests for comment.\n\nPope Francis has supported the US Supreme Court's decision Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSuffering in secret\n\nStill, however great the stigma, some women – like Kristy, who is also using an alias for fear of prosecution – conclude they have little choice but to seek out so-called backstreet, or illegal abortions.\n\nThe mother of four kept her abortion a secret from her husband and family because she knew “they would never allow it.”\n\n“They would only force me to keep the baby and we are already struggling to feed our four children,” she said. “How can we afford to raise a fifth?”\n\nShe has not been on any form of birth control and her husband does not use condoms. Access to other forms of contraception like birth control pills and IUD devices was also out of the question. “I can’t imagine how much that would cost,” she said.“I wouldn’t know how to (go about) getting them or using them.”\n\nSo when she became pregnant, she sought the services of a midwife and paid her 550 pesos ($10) for a “healing massage.”\n\nShe described being held down by the midwife’s assistant while she went to work, kneading and pounding her lower abdomen that eventually triggered a miscarriage. “It was messy and so awful,” Kristy said. “The pain was so excruciating and I could only scream. I still have trouble sleeping.”\n\n“I feel so much guilt but I know that my family is better for this,” she added.\n\nAn anti-abortion poster on the sides of a building in Manila. Thierry Falise/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nTime for a change?\n\nOpponents say it’s time for the Philippines to get rid of “inhumane provisions” in its abortion law and finally decriminalize abortion to save women’s lives.\n\n“These regulations have only led to a silent epidemic of unsafe abortions which have cost the lives of so many Filipina women,” said senator Risa Hontiveros, the country’snew opposition leader. “We should also not be sending women to jail after such difficult and painful experiences.”\n\nThe practice of unsafe underground abortions had to stop, Hontiveros said. She also reiterated the importance of destigmatizing abortion as a national step for the country.\n\n“Women must vigilantly protect our rights and freedoms especially amid the rise of authoritarianism and religious fundamentalism in many countries across the globe,” Hontiveros said. “I fully support the push to decriminalize abortion under Philippine laws.”\n\nFerdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. delivers a speech at the National Museum of Fine Arts in Manila. Ezra Acayan/Getty Images\n\nIn an interview conducted earlier in January, then-presidential hopeful Ferdinand Marcos Jr. shared his views on abortion and said he would legalize it for “severe cases.”\n\n“I think that if it can be shown that (victims) were raped and it was not consensual sex that got them pregnant then they should have the choice to abort or not. The other is incest perhaps,” said Marcos Jr. – who has since been elected President.\n\nHe also said he was “more concerned about deaths caused by unsafe abortions” than opposition from church leaders. “It is a woman’s decision because it is her body.”\n\nAdvocates and lawmakers welcomed his liberal attitude towards abortion. “Restricting abortion does not stop it, it actually makes it more dangerous and we have seen this play out across the world,” said Parcon of PINSAN.\n\n“Marcos raised it during his election campaign and to us, this was the furthest we have reached so far, and if he says he will make it a priority, then we must call him to account.”\n\nSenator Hontiveros said she welcomed the new President’s “openness” in supporting changes to Philippine abortion laws.\n\n“This gives hope that we can soon decriminalize abortion and reform our laws in consideration of the realities faced by Filipina women and families alike,” she said.\n\n“However, I (am) waiting to see if his words reflect a genuine commitment to uphold women’s rights. For the sake of Filipina women everywhere, I hope that they do.”", "authors": ["Heather Chen"], "publish_date": "2022/07/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/04/europe/pope-francis-interview-ukraine-abuse-intl/index.html", "title": "Pope Francis declares 'zero tolerance' for Catholic Church abuse ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPope Francis says he has taken it on himself to rid the Catholic Church of sexual abuse, telling CNN’s partner channel CNN Portugal that he was “responsible that it doesn’t happen anymore.”\n\nIn an exclusive, wide-ranging interview in Rome last month, the Pontiff said the church had “zero tolerance” for abuse and said that “a priest cannot remain a priest if he is an abuser.”\n\nThe church’s response to sex abuse scandals has become one of the defining themes of Francis’ time as Pope, and he told CNN Portugal that every case of abuse within the church “hurts” him.\n\nMultiple reports detailing decades of sexual abuse, systemic failures and cover-ups across multiple countries have been released since Francis became the leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics in 2013. While he was criticized for some of his actions – such as when he defended a Chilean bishop accused of covering up a sex scandal in 2018, a decision he later described as a “grave error” – he has since taken a firm stance on the issues and introduced some reforms.\n\nIn 2019, he abolished Vatican secrecy rules for cases of sexual abuse and put in place new rules that made it mandatory for the first time for all dioceses to set up systems for reporting abuse and cover-ups.\n\nTwo years later, he issued the most extensive revision to Catholic Church law in four decades, insisting that bishops take action against clerics who abuse minors and vulnerable adults. The rules also demanded action against priests who commit fraud or attempt to ordain women.\n\nAddressing the topic, Francis said he didn’t believe celibacy played a role in causing the abuse.\n\n“I don’t deny the abuse. Even if it was only one [case], it is monstrous. Because you, priest, you, nun, have to take that boy, that girl to God and with this you destroy their lives. It’s monstrous. It is destroying lives. And then they come to you with questions. Could it be that celibacy [is to blame]? It’s not about celibacy,” he said.\n\n“This is one thing about abuse, it is a destructive thing, humanly diabolical,” he said. “In families there is no celibacy and all that and, sometimes, it happens. So, it is simply the monstrosity of a man or woman of the church who is psychologically ill or evil and uses their position for their personal satisfaction,” he added.\n\nThe Pope also revealed that he has been in contact with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking to him on the phone.\n\nHe said he has in the past met both Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin when they visited him in Rome. But when asked what he could tell the two, the Pope said: “I don’t know.\n\n“I had a dialogue with both [of them]. They both visited me here before the war. And I always believe that in dialogue we always move forward,” the Pope said. “You know who doesn’t know how to talk? Animals. They are pure instinct.”\n\nFrancis has been criticized for some of his comments about Russia’s war on Ukraine. In a June interview with Italian newspaper La Stampa, Francis said the war “was perhaps in some way either provoked or not prevented.” He said that before Russia invaded Ukraine he met with “a head of state” who “was very worried about how NATO was moving.”\n\nLast month, the Pope angered Kyiv by referring to Russian political commentator Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultra-nationalist philosopher, as being among the “innocent” victims of the war after she was killed by a car bomb on the outskirts of Moscow.\n\nThe Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Apostolic Nuncio to Ukraine, Archbishop Visvaldas Kulbokas, to discuss Francis’ statement, saying that it “unjustly” equates “the aggressor and the victim.”\n\nThe Pope, who has previously indicated he would be willing to travel to Kyiv and Moscow, told CNN Portugal such a visit was “up in the air.”\n\nNo Pope has ever traveled to Moscow before. Pope John Paul II traveled to Ukraine in 2001.\n\nHe said he was unable to travel at the moment because of issues with his knee, but said that his presence in Ukraine was “strong” because he sent several cardinals to Kyiv to represent him.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/world/gallery/pope-francis/index.html", "title": "Pope Francis, in pictures | CNN", "text": "1.

Others wore colorful papal T-shirts. \"The pope gives me hope,\" read one. \"Mercy and Compassion,\" read another, referring to the visit's official theme.

Choosing to have few or no children is ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Alistair Currie is the head of campaigns and communications at Population Matters, a UK-based charity campaigning for a sustainable human population through ethical means, to protect nature and improve people’s lives. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nPope Francis’ comments that couples opting for pets instead of children were acting selfishly, has reinvigorated an important and timely debate about the future of our species. The pontiff’s comments, however, are wholly wrong.\n\n“Today we see a form of selfishness. We see that people do not want to have children, or just one and no more. And many, many couples do not have children because they do not want to, or they have just one – but they have two dogs, two cats … Yes, dogs and cats take the place of children,” the Pope told an audience at the Vatican Wednesday.\n\n“This denial of fatherhood or motherhood diminishes us, it takes away our humanity,” he added.\n\nThe Pope’s suggestion that failing to have children is selfish is far from the truth. Especially for those of us living in countries with a large environmental footprint, the choice to have a small family, or no human family at all, is one that helps everyone – particularly children, whose future depends on a more sustainable planet.\n\nAdditionally, a person’s value, moral standing and character is not defined by parenthood. And showing love for animals is surely something that enhances and demonstrates our humanity – rather than diminishing it.\n\nThe Pope has been a strong advocate for the environment and deserves praise for speaking out on inequality, consumerism and social justice. He recognizes the profound threat posed by climate change and biodiversity loss. And in raising his voice and challenging the complacency of politicians, he has done much good.\n\nWhat the pontiff hasn’t done is connect the dots between environmental collapse and the Catholic Church’s position on family size and contraception. Indeed, his comments this week echo the church’s teachings about the importance of couples either bearing or raising children – while making unjustified claims about the potential demographic consequences of not doing so.\n\nBut population growth is one of the key drivers of both climate change and biodiversity loss, according to authoritative sources. A 2017 study published by Global Environmental Change suggested that if global population growth meets or exceeds the United Nation’s medium projection (most likely 10.9 billion people by 2100), it would be impossible to stay under the critical threshold of 2 degrees Celsius warming above pre-industrial levels.\n\nProject Drawdown, a major analysis of all available climate policy solutions, found that achieving the medium projection instead of the higher projection by 2050 (a difference of 1 billion people) would result in emissions savings of 85.42 Gigatonnes of CO2 – making it one of the most powerful actions we can take in limiting global warming.\n\nIt’s not just population, of course. There is an urgent need across multiple fronts, not least addressing grotesque inequalities in consumption and the disproportionate contribution to environmental destruction among those of us who are wealthy by global standards – inequalities Pope Francis has done much to highlight.\n\nThe hundreds of millions of people living in poverty worldwide deserve far more land, food, water, energy and infrastructure than they currently have. And the more people there are squeezing nature and generating emissions, the harder it is to dig ourselves out of this hole.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pope calls for more children. The pontiff has been part of a baby bust panic – touted by Elon Musk, among others – decrying a “demographic winter,” in reference to falling birth rates. Let’s put this in perspective. Half the world’s population is under 30. Ageing societies are a challenge, but effective, affordable policy solutions already exist. What doesn’t exist are solutions to melted glaciers or extinct species. The fundamental prerequisite of a decent future for young and old is a healthy planet.\n\nDoes it matter what the Pope thinks? After all, Catholic Italy has one of the lowest fertility rates in Europe, something unlikely to have been achieved by the contraceptive methods the Vatican endorses. But not everywhere is Italy. While Europe and the Americas are still home to a majority of the world’s Christians, according to the Pew Research Center, that share is much lower than it was a century ago. At the same time, the Catholic population has grown enormously in sub-Saharan Africa and the Asian Pacific region.\n\nDespite this, provision of contraception worldwide is grossly underfunded. It needs all the support it can get – and the Pope and his church could do immeasurable good in supporting, rather than opposing it.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWorldwide, 270 million women have an unmet need for modern contraception. Investing in global family planning is also extraordinarily good value for money. A 2014 assessment by the Copenhagen Consensus Center found that every US dollar spent on achieving universal access to sexual and reproductive health services yields a $120 benefit in improving health and reducing pressure on other services.\n\nOur humanity is enhanced by making careful decisions about the size of our families and by giving others the right and opportunity to make those choices too. The “winter” we face if we don’t make wiser decisions about how we live – including about how many children we have – is not demographic but planetary. The Pope understands that threat.

There could be more scheduled doubleheaders than ever before, prolonged stretches with no days off, and for the first time since World War II, no All-Star Game.\n\nNo one has the answers yet, but players union chief Tony Clark said Friday that no matter what the conditions – provided it’s safe – the players want to play baseball as soon and for as long as possible.\n\nYes, even up until Thanksgiving.\n\n“Players want to play,’’ Clark said, “That’s what we do.

That meant that individuals with little income tax liability would have gotten a minimum of $600 ($1,200 for joint filers).\n\nBut a subsequent version of the bill – approved by the Senate on Wednesday and the House on Friday – dropped the minimum income threshold so that all low-income individuals will now be eligible for the full $1,200 ($2,400 for joint returns).\n\nA caveat: To qualify, they must have filed tax returns in either 2018 or 2019 or receive Social Security or veterans’ benefits so the Internal Revenue Service can calculate their rebate, said Garrett Watson of the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based think tank.

But rural counties in Georgia, Colorado, Utah and Idaho are also experiencing some of the highest rates of coronavirus cases per capita in the nation, threatening to overwhelm local hospitals and challenging perceptions of the virus’ reach.\n\nIn Dougherty County, Georgia,, the rate of confirmed cases was the nation’s 12th highest at 179.7 per 100,000 people, higher than many metro areas, with 164 testing positive for the illness and six deaths. The county is about three hours south of Atlanta and has a population of about 90,000.\n\nIts local hospital, Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, is maxed out of intensive care beds and on Thursday only had four remaining hospital beds, said Chief Medical Officer Dr. Steven Kitchen. Patients who come into the emergency room and require an ICU bed are being directed to other facilities in the state.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers Dougherty County “extremely vulnerable” on the Social Vulnerability Index.

It's also a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhile Bono was touring the US following the release of U2’s fifth studio album, he stopped by the Nashville home of country music icon Johnny Cash, who along with his wife June had invited him for lunch.\n\nCash was a popular performer in Bono’s native Ireland, and the two singers had already formed a friendship, bonding over music and their shared faith. Cash, who had struggled with addiction to alcohol and barbiturates, was a devout Christian.\n\nAs Bono sat at the kitchen table, he listened as Cash delivered “the most poetic grace I’ve ever heard.” Then Cash, “smiling under his breath, as if June couldn’t hear or see,” ended his grace with, “Sure miss the drugs, though.”\n\n“For all his deep faith and conviction, he could never be the pious type, and maybe that’s why so many are drawn to him,” Bono writes about the lunch in his new memoir, “Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story.” “Johnny didn’t sing to the damned; he sang with the damned, and sometimes you sensed he might prefer their company.”\n\nSome of this description could apply to Bono as well. Born Paul David Hewson in Dublin, Ireland, Bono is a global rock star, an activist and an entrepreneur who is currently touring the US to promote his memoir. All those facets are covered in an entertaining and occasionally hilarious 500-page book that vividly recounts passages from Bono’s life that he only hints at in his songs.\n\nBono’s book, though, is more than a rock star’s memoir. It’s a refreshing contrast to the way many Americans today view faith and politics.\n\nA growing number of Americans have joined what one commentator called the Fractured States of America: They only befriend people who share their political and religious beliefs. But Bono forges close friendships and alliances with world leaders and politicians with whom he has fundamental disagreements.\n\nBono, far left, meets with Pope Francis and other leaders at an event on May 19, 2022, in Vatican City. Franco Origlia/Getty Images\n\nEven his faith connects religious elements that don’t normally intersect. In some book passages he sounds like an evangelical Christian, displaying a deep familiarity with scripture and a reverence for Christ. And yet he also says that he’s never found a church he could call home, and “that what the human spirit longs for may not be corralled by any sect or denomination.”\n\n“It’s not just that some of the finest people I’ve known don’t subscribe to any particular faith tradition; it’s more that people who openly profess faith can be — how shall I put this? — such a pain in the arse,” he writes. “In a world where it’s impossible to avoid advertising, I don’t want the person next to me hard selling their take on the Big Questions. Live your love is the right answer.”\n\nBut Bono does express faith in another source. It’s what he describes as “the idea” of America.\n\nA belief in America as an idea, not a religion\n\nAs any casual fan of U2 knows, U2 has long had a close relationship with the US.\n\nThe group formed in Dublin in 1978 when Bono teamed with three high school classmates: Adam Clayton, Larry Mullen Jr., and Richard “The Edge” Evans. They broke through in the early ’80s with their third studio album, “War,” and became what Rolling Stone magazine once called a “live act simply without peer.”\n\nDecades later, a band that Bono often says began with only “three chords and the truth” has gone on to win 22 Grammys, more than any other duo or group.\n\nThe members of U2 in an undated photo, from left: The Edge, Adam Clayton, Larry Mullen Jr. and Bono. Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection/Getty Images\n\nPart of the band’s success comes from their familiarity with the American songbook. Many of their most popular songs reflect a deep knowledge of American rock music, gospel and blues. It was U2, not an American artist, who wrote a stirring tribute to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., with their song, “Pride (In The Name of Love).”\n\nIn “Surrender,” Bono pays tribute to America itself. Some European bands dreaded touring the South and the Midwest, dismissing the regions as dull and unsophisticated. But Bono says U2 grew to love those parts of the US, “feeling the common decency of people who placed a high value on conservative themes like good manners and self-reliance, even though many held political views very different from our own.”\n\nHe quotes from the Declaration of Independence, from Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s famous 1933 inaugural address (“the only thing we have to fear is fear itself”) and cites the poem inscribed on the Statue of Liberty: “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.”\n\nBono expresses a belief and optimism in America that many Americans no longer share.\n\nHe says America is built on “an idea.” It’s a place that “offers grace for every welcome that is sought” from around the globe. He’s amplified this notion on his current book tour, saying at one stop, “America is a song still being written.”\n\nBono speaks at the 2012 Global Social Enterprise Initiative Event at Georgetown University on November 12, 2012, in Washington. Riccardo S. Savi/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nIn a 2012 speech at Georgetown University, Bono gave perhaps his most detailed description of what America means to him. He said:\n\n“Ireland’s a great country, but it’s not an idea. Great Britain’s a great country, it’s not an idea. That’s how we see you around the world, as one of the greatest ideas in human history – right up there with the Renaissance, right up there with crop rotations and the Beatles’ White album. The idea, the American idea … that you and me are created equal. And God love you for it, because these aren’t just American ideas anymore. There’s no copyright on them. You brought them into the world…These truths, your truths, they’re self-evident in us.”\n\nBono reminds readers that America has long had a mythical hold on the Irish. He says many Irish people glowed with pride when John Fitzgerald Kennedy became the country’s first Irish Catholic President and were astonished when the US became the first nation to put a man on the moon.\n\n“Before transatlantic flights, when Irish people left their homes to go to America, it was like a death,” Bono writes. “They would never be seen again. And yet they would be reborn in this land of promise.”\n\nThe cost of not compromising\n\nPolitics is now viewed by many Americans as a winner-take-all contest. There is no middle ground. No reason to compromise.\n\nSome of this is fueled by a dangerous distortion of Christian faith. A growing number of Americans —almost half the country, according to one recent survey — now say the US was founded as a Christian nation and that there should be no separation between church and state. Some even say that violence is justified in defending this vision of America.\n\nBono and U2 perform in Belfast, Ireland, in 1982. Steve Rapport/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nBut Bono offers another model for how many Americans can practice politics and faith.\n\nHe comes from a country where thousands of people died because they could not find compromise on religion and politics.\n\nHe grew up in Ireland during a time when the northern part of the country split over whether it should remain in the United Kingdom or become independent. This disagreement, fanned by tensions between Protestants and Catholics, led to an explosion of violence between 1968 and 1998 that left more than 3,500 people dead. Many victims were civilians, maimed or killed by car bombs and other forms of violence in what became known as “the Troubles.”\n\nThis fractious history inspired him to adopt a personal mantra: “Compromise is a costly word. No compromise even more so.”\n\nBono testifies about AIDS programs before the US Senate Appropriations Committee in May 2004 in Washington. Stephen Jaffe/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen Bono describes the “religious apartheid” that divided his country, it’s the only place in the book where he displays anger. He tears into paramilitary groups in Ireland that used violence and religious grievances to harm civilians in the name of freedom. He also recounts how he narrowly avoided becoming the victim of such a bombing one day.\n\nHe was raised by his father, Brendan Robert, a Catholic, and his mother, Iris, a Protestant, in an environment that disdained religious intolerance. He attended one of Ireland’s first nondenominational secondary schools, where students were taught to value religious diversity. It’s also where he met his wife, Alison, with whom he shares four children.\n\nBono and wife Ali Hewson attend a Special Olympics party at the Clarence Hotel on June 21, 2003, in Dublin, Ireland. Getty Images/Getty Images\n\nThe lessons Bono learned in school about religious intolerance have carried into his career. In July 2005, during a concert in Berlin, Bono denounced Islamic extremists who had recently detonated bombs across London, killing 52 people and wounding hundreds.\n\nHe donned a headband bearing the word “Coexist,” which incorporated a Christian cross, a Star of David, and an Islamic crescent.\n\n“Jesus, Jew, Mohammad, it’s true. All sons of Abraham,” he chanted from the stage, pointing to the symbols to plead for religious tolerance during a time of war – a gesture he repeated throughout the tour.\n\nThe secret to Bono’s success as an activist\n\nBono has also had a dramatic impact offstage, through his activism. He was a leader in Jubilee 2000, a successful campaign that led to the cancellation of more than $100 billion in debt owed by poor countries. He co-founded sister organizations ONE and (RED) to fight against extreme poverty and the spread of HIV/AIDS in developing countries.\n\nMany rock star memoirs recount going from sold-out arenas to trashed hotel rooms. Bono describes meeting politicians and philanthropists in a “world of suits and sandwiches and fluorescent lamps.” He flourished in that new arena because of his ability to reach agreement with all manner of leaders.\n\nIrish rocker Bono, lead singer of U2, poses with schoolchildren in the Soweto township outside Johannesburg, South Africa, in May 2002. Stringer/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFor example, Bono persuaded Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative US senator who opposed making King’s birthday a national holiday and had called AIDS “the gay disease,” to provide funding to combat the AIDS crisis in Africa.\n\nHow’d he do it? Bono says he found common ground with Helms by invoking stories about how lepers were treated in the Bible. He says the analogy reduced to Helms to tears.\n\n“The search for common ground starts with a search for higher ground,” Bono writes in the memoir. “Even with your opponents. Especially with your opponents. A lightbulb moment for me and a conviction that’s informed my life as a campaigner ever since. The simple but profound idea that you don’t have to agree on everything if the one thing you do agree on is important enough.”\n\nBono in 2022: \"The search for common ground starts with a search for higher ground,\" he writes. Franco Origlia/Getty Images\n\nU2 fans have long speculated about Bono’s spiritual beliefs. Near the end of his memoir, he defines himself as a flawed but genuine “follower of Christ who can’t keep up.”\n\n“I hold to the line attributed to Francis of Assisi, who told his followers, ‘Go into the world to preach the Gospel and, if necessary, use words,’ ” he says.\n\nThat sentiment might sound like a platitude from a rich rock star.

He is scheduled to be the first president to visit the Alaskan Arctic region.\n\nIn the final days of August, Obama will also be planning a variety of major events in September. They include:\n\n• The Iran nuclear agreement. The Republican-run Congress is considering an agreement in which the United States and its allies will reduce economic sanctions on Iran as it gives up the means to make nuclear weapons.\n\nRepublican criticssay the deal leaves too much room for Iran to cheat and develop nuclear weapons that could threaten Israel and the United States. The GOP has the numbers to approve a resolution of disapproval of the agreement, though Obama would veto it.\n\nObama, who says the agreement will avoid military confrontation by blocking Iran's paths to nuclear weapons, has been lobbying congressional Democrats. He is close to having enough support to sustain a veto.\n\n• The visit of Pope Francis. Climate change will also be a major topic when Obama hosts Francis at the White House on Sept. 23, part of the pope's first trip to the United States.\n\nAmong other presidential-papal topics, the White House said: \"Caring for the marginalized and the poor; advancing economic opportunity for all,\" as well as \"protecting religious minorities and promoting religious freedom around the world; and welcoming and integrating immigrants and refugees into our communities.\"\n\n• The visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping. The U.S. and Chinese leaders have much to discuss when Xi visits the White House in late September. (The precise date has not yet been announced.)\n\nThings may get tense. The agenda is likely to include U.S. complaints about Chinese currency valuation, the nation's mutual economic troubles, allegations by each country of spying and cyber attacks on each other, a proposed free trade agreement involving Asian nations and territorial disputes between China and some of its Asian neighbors.\n\nClimate change will also be a topic for the China meeting, the White House said.\n\n• The United Nations General Assembly. This is another opportunity for Obama to discuss climate change as he makes his annual U.N. speech in late September. The president is likely to address an array of other global challenges, from economic recovery to the rise of the Islamic State.\n\nA crowded month could end with another budget fight leading to a government shutdown.\n\nIf Congress cannot agree on a new spending plan by the time the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, some government operations will be suspended.\n\nThese are the known events. Unexpected events could alter the president's schedule, making it even busier.\n\nIn his Saturday radio address, Obama also called on Congress to re-authorize the Export-Import Bank, saying that otherwise U.S. companies will be at a disadvantage to foreign competitors.\n\n\"Congress also hasn't passed a budget,\" Obama said. \"And when they return from vacation, they'll only have a few weeks to do so, or shut down the government for the second time in two years.\"\n\nRepublicans said they have a budget, but Obama and the Democrats have blocked their efforts to scale back government.\n\n\"We've accomplished a lot over the past eight months, but we know we have a lot more work to do,\" said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., in the Republican radio address. \"And we have a president who is fighting us every step of the way.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/03/03/coronavirus-global-developments/4936938002/", "title": "Coronavirus: China sees 'coming victory' as global alarm spreads", "text": "In Iran, a close adviser to adviser Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei died after contracting coronavirus.

Now she's facing her ...", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nHarvey Weinstein accuser Asia Argento accused of paying off her sexual assault accuser\n\nAsia Argento was one of the first women to accuse disgraced movie moguel Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault. Now the #MeToo advocate is facing her own sexual misconduct accusations. The actress paid off an ex-child actor who accused her of misconduct, according to legal documents obtained by The New York Times. Jimmy Bennett, who was 17 at the time of the encounter, alleges that he was assaulted by Argento in a California hotel in 2013, when the actress was 37. (The age of consent in California is 18.) Bennett, who played the Italian actress's son in a 2004 film, says Argento gave him alcohol and pulled his pants off for oral sex and intercourse in 2013, according to court documents. Bennett’s lawyer notified Argento last November of his intention to sue for $3.5 million for emotional distress, lost wages, assault and battery – a month after she went public with her allegations against Weinstein. The Italian actress agreed to pay him $380,000. Many are wondering: What does this mean for the #MeToo movement?\n\nTrump to ex-CIA chief: Go ahead and sue me\n\nThe gloves are officially off. President Trump essentially dared former CIA director John Brennan to sue him for revoking his national security clearance. Calling him \"the worst CIA Director in our country’s history,\" Trump tweeted Monday that he hopes Brennan files a lawsuit so that lawyers can \"get all of his records, texts, emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did, but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt. He won’t sue!\" Trump announced that he revoked Brennan's clearance last week, saying Brennan, who accused Trump of seeking to shut up critics about the Russia investigation, used his status \"to make a series of unfounded and outrageous allegations\" about the administration. And the president said he's not stopping with Brennan. On Friday, Trump said he is ready to revoke security clearances for other current and past law enforcement officials over the Russia investigation. Who's next?\n\nPope speaks up on sexual abuse: 'We abandoned them'\n\nPope Francis condemned sexual abuse by priests as “atrocities” in a letter Monday to the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics, acknowledging that church leaders “showed no care for the little ones.” The pope’s apology comes less than a week after news that 301 “predator priests” in Pennsylvania were shielded by church leaders for decades, according to a grand jury report. “We abandoned them,” the pope said of victims. His response drew mixed reviews; some critics claim the Vatican has yet to fully own up to complicity in the abuse.\n\nHere’s what to know on the scandal:\n\nCalls to a clergy abuse hotline in Pennsylvania are surging since the report, bolstering the investigation.\n\nThe Vatican took two days to initially respond to the report. Here’s what it said.\n\nWhy does the Catholic church still struggle with such abuse? The church has resisted letting victims seek compensation as adults, which may stifle further exposure of abuse.\n\nHeading to Yellowstone? Seriously knock it off with the animal selfies\n\nNational park officials from across the country are employing a variety of campaigns to issue the warning: Stop taking selfies with the animals. Officials say the recent trend of “living in the moment” or as Drake would say “YOLO” (you only live once) is putting people and animals in danger. Park visitors testing their fate are especially apparent in Yellowstone National Park. With 4 million visitors sharing a space with thousands of bison, elk and grizzly bears — accidents are happening. Bison injure the most people. There is at least one injury every year, and there were five injuries in 2015 alone, though park officials say many run-ins go unreported. Along with physical costs, getting too close to a wild animal on purpose can result in six months jail time and a fine up to $5,000, depending on the park.\n\nSerial sex abuser Larry Nassar is back in the headlines\n\nFormer USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar was removed from a federal prison in Arizona to a transfer facility in Oklahoma City. The move comes weeks after Nassar's lawyers said in court filings he was assaulted within a few hours of being placed in the general population. Nassar was transferred to the southern Arizona facility after being sentenced on sexual-assault charges in Michigan. It is the only high-security federal facility that also offers a sex-offender-management program. How did he get there? The Indianapolis Star first detailed the sexual-assault allegations against Nassar in September 2016. Since then, more than 260 women and girls told law enforcement he sexually abused them.

Among the victims, who range in age from 20 to 86, were people grocery shopping, a heroic former police officer who tried to stop the gunman, a long-term substitute teacher and a taxi driver who “took pride in helping people.”\n\n“This was pure evil,” Erie County Sheriff John Garcia said, calling the shooting a “straight-up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community.”\n\nThe US Department of Justice is investigating the shooting “as a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism,” according to Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nPayton S. Gendron of Conklin, New York, has been charged with first-degree murder, Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said in a May 14 news release. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nOn June 1, a grand jury returned a 25-count indictment against Gendron. He is facing 10 counts of first-degree murder, 10 counts of second-degree murder as a hate crime and three counts of attempted murder as a hate crime, according to court documents. Gendron is also facing a charge of domestic terror and a weapons charge, according to court documents.\n\nGendron pleaded not guilty to the 25-count indictment, his attorney said in court Thursday afternoon.\n\nGendron’s defense attorney told CNN on May 17 he would not issue a statement now.\n\nHere’s what we know about the suspect.\n\nHe planned to ‘continue his rampage,’ police say\n\nWhen the suspect arrived at the store around 2:30 p.m., he was heavily armed, wearing tactical gear – including a tactical helmet along with plated armor, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said – and had a camera that was livestreaming his actions.\n\nHe used an assault weapon, Flynn said during a news conference.\n\nThe suspect shot four people outside of the grocery store, three fatally, Flynn said in his news release. When he entered the store, he exchanged fire with an armed security guard, who authorities said was a retired Buffalo police officer. The security guard died of his injuries. The suspect shot eight more people in the store, six of whom died, the release said.\n\nConfronted by police, the suspected shooter took off some of his tactical gear and surrendered, per Buffalo police.\n\nThe suspect planned to continue his shooting rampage beyond the Tops supermarket, Gramaglia told CNN on Monday, saying there was “some documentation” he allegedly planned to target “another large superstore.”\n\n“There was evidence that was uncovered that he had plans, had he gotten out of here, to continue his rampage and continue shooting people,” he said.\n\nThe suspect made very disturbing statements describing his motive and state of mind following his arrest, an official familiar with the investigation told CNN. Those statements were clear and filled with hate toward the Black community, with the alleged shooter making it known he was targeting Black people, the official said.\n\nThe alleged shooter was “studying” previous hate attacks and shootings, investigators have learned via search warrants and other methods.\n\nThe suspect was in Buffalo on Friday, the day before the shooting, per Gramaglia, who said he was doing reconnaissance at the store.\n\nShonnell Harris Teague, an operations manager at the store, saw him Friday afternoon at the store and told him to leave because it appeared he was bothering customers, she told ABC News.\n\nHarris Teague saw the suspect sitting on a bench outside with a camper bag on his back, wearing the same camouflage clothing he wore Saturday, she told ABC. After being asked to leave, he did so without argument, she said.\n\nHer brother, the Rev. Tim Newkirk, backed up the account, noting the suspect “was in there posing as a beggar and was looking for change,” he told The Buffalo News.\n\n“She had to politely escort him out. They have a no peddling policy in the Tops, no panhandling,” Newkirk said, “so she was just letting him know that this was not the place where you do that.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Buffalo pastor on shooting: We have to resist the impulse to forget 02:59 - Source: CNN\n\nHe spent months plotting his attack, social media posts show\n\nGendron is believed to have visited Buffalo in early March, Gramaglia said Monday, citing the suspect’s “digital footprint.” Social media posts analyzed by CNN reveal the suspect visited the Tops store in March and had been extensively planning his attack for several months up until the day of the shooting.\n\nAccording to the posts – which Gendron originally shared on Discord, then on the hate-filled online forum 4Chan – the suspect drove March 8 to the supermarket in Buffalo.\n\nThe posts were made visible to a small group of people about 30 minutes before the shooting began, according to a statement from Discord.\n\nGendron wrote in the posts that he went into Tops Market three times during his visit: at 12 p.m., 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. He wrote about activity inside the store each time he went in – noting how many Black and White people were in the market and also drawing a map of the inside of the store.\n\nDuring his 4 p.m. visit, Gendron was approached by a “Black armed security guard” who asked the suspect what he was doing going in and out of the store, he wrote. The shooter told the security guard he was collecting “consensus data,” according to the posts.\n\n“In hindsight that was a close call,” Gendron wrote.\n\nIn a post on March 10, Gendron wrote, “I’m going to have to kill that security guard at Tops I hope he doesn’t kill me or even hurt me instantly.”\n\nThe shooter wrote about how he planned his attack for March 15 but then delayed it several times.\n\nIn the posts, Gendron cites online research in choosing Buffalo as his site of attack – saying the 14208 ZIP code in Buffalo has a higher Black population than the other locations he was considering.\n\nThe shooter considered attacking a church or an elementary school but ultimately chose the supermarket because of the number of people that go to grocery stores, he wrote.\n\nHe referred to Google’s “popular times” graph for the Tops Friendly Market in determining the time he would plan his attack – so the grocery store would be busiest.\n\nDiscord said that a “private, invite-only server” was created by the suspect and that “approximately 30 minutes prior to the attack,” a small group of people was invited to and joined the server.\n\n“Before that, our records indicate no other people saw the diary chat log in this private server,” it said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Our deepest sympathies are with the victims and their families,” the company said. “Hate has no place on Discord and we are committed to combating violence and extremism. We are continuing to do everything we can to assist law enforcement and the investigation remains ongoing.”\n\nCNN asked the Discord spokesperson when the company became aware of Gendron’s posts and if any of the individuals who were invited to view his private server alerted moderators to the content but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nCNN also reached out to 4Chan asking about Gendron’s posts being shared on the platform but has not heard back.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'It is White supremacy': CNN speaks to son of Buffalo massacre victim 03:06 - Source: CNN\n\nDocument talks about ‘dwindling size’ of White population\n\nInvestigators are sifting for clues in a 180-page document attributed to Gendron and posted online, Flynn said. The purported “manifesto” allegedly was written by the suspect, officials have said.\n\n“We are obviously going through that with a fine-toothed comb and reviewing that for all evidence that may lead us to besides the manifesto itself,” prosecutor Flynn told CNN.\n\n“All the evidence that we ascertain from that manifesto, from wherever that manifesto leads us, other pieces of evidence we already had, we can then use that and develop more charges potentially,” he added.\n\nThe document, independently obtained by CNN shortly after the attack and before authorities released the suspect’s name, is allegedly written by a person claiming to be Payton Gendron confessing to the attack.\n\nThe author attributes the internet for most of his beliefs and describes himself as a fascist, a White supremacist and an anti-Semite.\n\nThe author bought ammo for some time but didn’t get serious about planning the attack until January, per the document. The author also writes about his perceptions of the dwindling size of the White population and claims of ethnic and cultural replacement of Whites.\n\nThe suspect allegedly chose to attack the Tops store in Buffalo because it was in a majority-Black ZIP code within driving distance of where he lived, and he researched what time it would be busiest, according to the document.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Stelter: Shooting is 'replacement theory' rearing its ugly head again 05:04 - Source: CNN\n\nHe’s from a town hours away from Buffalo\n\nThe ZIP code that includes the store, 14208, is 78% Black – the highest percentage of Black population of any ZIP code in upstate New York – per the Census Bureau’s 2020 American Community Survey. Conklin, where the suspect is from, is a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Buffalo.\n\nGendron’s parents were not known to hold extremist views, according to two New York residents who have worked with his parents at the state Department of Transportation and who shared their views on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.\n\n“I never thought of the family as racist or hateful,” said one coworker, who said she was heartbroken for the victims’ families as well as Payton’s parents, Pam and Paul. “I can’t wrap my head around this tragedy.”\n\nPayton Gendron talks with his attorney during his arraignment Saturday in Buffalo City Court. Mark Mulville/AP\n\nGendron was a worker at the local Conklin Reliable Market for about four months before he left about three months ago, the store’s owner said, adding he was very quiet and left on his own terms, giving two weeks’ notice.\n\nGendron’s mother regularly would walk in the neighborhood, neighbors said. She was a nice woman, one said, adding they “never would have thought that in a million years” Gendron would have racist views. “It’s pretty shocking,” the neighbor added.\n\nWhen you talked to Payton Gendron, “you wouldn’t get more than a word or two” from him, another neighbor said.\n\nGendron’s former classmates said while he could sometimes be a loner and “odd,” he wasn’t known to be violent.\n\n“I just don’t understand what convinced him to do this,” said Bryce Gibbs, who said he attended elementary through high school with Gendron and described him as “nice.”\n\nHe made ‘generalized threat’ at high school\n\nGendron made a “generalized threat” in June while he attended Susquehanna Valley Central High School in Conklin, Gramaglia said Sunday, adding the threat was not racially motivated.\n\nState police took the student for a mental health evaluation, Gramaglia said at a Buffalo news conference. After a day and a half, he was released.\n\nThe suspect was visited last year by New York State Police after he did a high school project about murder-suicides, Garcia told CNN on Monday. Concerns about alleged mental health issues “were brought to light” after he turned in the post-graduation project, the sheriff said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I'm sad, I'm hurt, I'm mad': Buffalo reacts to racially motivated shooting 01:25 - Source: CNN\n\nState police spokesperson Beau Duffy said that on June 8, 2021, state police officers responded to the high school to investigate a report that a 17-year-old student made a threatening statement. The student was taken into custody under NYS Mental Health Law section 9.41 and transported to a hospital for a mental health evaluation.\n\nDuffy confirmed it was an evaluation and not an involuntary commitment – so it would not have prevented the suspected shooter from purchasing or possessing a gun under federal law.\n\nState police were unable to confirm how long the person was in the hospital or the findings of the evaluation. The agency also refused to name the then-17-year-old.\n\nThe suspect addressed the incident in posts on Discord later shared on 4Chan, writing in a post-dated January 30 that he “had to go to a hospital’s ER because I said the word’s ‘murder/suicide’ to an online paper in economics class.”\n\n“I got out of it,” the suspect claims, “because I stuck with the story that I was getting out of class and I just stupidly wrote that down. That is the reason I believe I am still able to purchase guns.”\n\n“It was not a joke,” the post reads, “I wrote that down because that’s what I was planning to do.”\n\nThe suspect goes on to claim his mental health evaluation lasted only 15 minutes after he spent hours waiting in the emergency room. CNN has reached out to New York State police about this account.\n\nBroome County District Attorney Michael Korchak, the district attorney in the suspect’s hometown, is reviewing “all aspects” of last year’s investigation into the threat and also “going back several years” to understand the suspected shooter’s behavior and relationships with family, teachers and other students.\n\nBut it’s “hard to say” whether more should have been done in June, Korchak told CNN.\n\n“Unfortunately this is nothing new in the criminal justice system,” Korchak said. “Individuals that have mental health issues may have it under control for a period of time, and then one day they just snap and things as tragic as this happen.”\n\nInvestigators are talking to the suspect’s parents and they are being cooperative, Korchak said.\n\nGun was legally purchased, governor says\n\nThe gun used in the mass shooting was purchased legally in New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul told CNN earlier, describing the weapon as an AR-15. It’s believed the high-capacity magazine was purchased out of state, the governor added.\n\nIn addition to the AR-15, Gendron had a rifle and a shotgun in his car, Gramaglia said. The online diatribe attributed to Gendron said he planned to bring those same three types of guns with him that day.\n\nHere’s how the suspect legally obtained guns\n\nThe “main firearm” Gendron planned to use was a Bushmaster XM-15 assault rifle that he bought from Vintage Firearms, a gun store in Endicott, New York, before “illegally modifying it,” according to the diatribe. Gendron passed a background check before he bought the gun and he didn’t stick out among his other customers, Vintage Firearms owner, Robert Donald, told The New York Times; no one at the store has responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nGendron also bought a Mossberg 500 shotgun from Pennsylvania Guns and Ammo, a store in Great Bend, about a 10-minute drive across the state border from his hometown of Conklin, the racist document attributed to him states.\n\nThe suspect passed a background check at the store and legally purchased the shotgun in December 2021, the store owner, who did not want his name used, told CNN. The shotgun was not used in Saturday’s shooting.\n\nThe third gun was a Savage Axis XP rifle that Gendron’s father bought for him for Christmas in 2020 “so that I could go hunting without borrowing my cousin’s guns,” the document states.\n\nThe racist statement also says the shooter planned to use the shotgun and rifle to shoot other Black people on the street as he drove away from the supermarket.\n\nCNN obtained a photo of two long guns allegedly brought to the scene. The photo was confirmed by two law enforcement sources.\n\nA photo of two long guns allegedly found in the suspect's car, according to law enforcement sources. CNN\n\nThe image shows the weapons inside a car, which was found by law enforcement after the suspect’s arrest, according to one of the law enforcement sources. The weapons were not used in the shooting. Writing appears all over the weapons, including the phrase “White Lives Matter” and names including what appears to be the name of a victim of a crime allegedly committed by a Black suspect.\n\nOther notations seized by investigators reflect the racist beliefs of the shooter, as well as his obsession with mass killing, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nHe allegedly livestreamed on Twitch\n\nThe shooting suspect used the popular livestreaming platform Twitch to stream a live broadcast during the attack, the company confirmed Saturday.\n\nThe company was “devastated” to hear about the shooting, it said, adding the user “has been indefinitely suspended from our service, and we are taking all appropriate action, including monitoring for any accounts rebroadcasting this content.”\n\nCNN obtained a portion of the livestream showing the alleged shooter pulling up to a Tops store.\n\nThe video is recorded from the point of view of the alleged shooter as he drives into the supermarket’s parking lot. The person is seen in the rearview mirror wearing a helmet and is heard saying, “Just got to go for it,” before he pulls into the front of the store.\n\nIn the video, store patrons can be seen walking through the parking lot as the suspect drives up.\n\nThe company removed the livestream less than two minutes after the violence started, a spokesperson for Twitch said. The company did not immediately respond to follow-up questions about whether the suspect was firing when the livestream was halted.\n\nHe will likely face more charges\n\nThe suspect pleaded not guilty to one count of first-degree murder Saturday evening before Buffalo City Court Chief Judge Craig Hannah, according to the judge and the district attorney’s news release. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole, the release said.\n\nGendron’s attorney’s request for a mental health forensic examination was withdrawn, Flynn said. Gendron remains on suicide watch, Garcia said, and in custody without bail.\n\nThere may be more charges coming, officials said.\n\n“My office is working closely with the US Attorney’s Office and our partners in law enforcement into potential terrorism and hate crimes. This is an active investigation and additional charges may be filed,” Flynn said.\n\nGendron is set to return to court Thursday morning for a felony hearing, the release said.\n\nHe is likely the “most highly visible incarcerated individual” in the country, Garcia told CNN on Monday. There are video cameras in his cell, and he remains under a sheriff’s deputy’s watch at all times.", "authors": ["Shimon Prokupecz Christina Maxouris Dakin Andone Samantha Beech Amir Vera", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Christina Maxouris", "Dakin Andone", "Samantha Beech", "Amir Vera"], "publish_date": "2022/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2019/08/22/white-supremacy-america-internet-fuels-growth-hate-groups/2030636001/", "title": "White supremacy in America: The internet fuels growth in hate groups", "text": "Brad Galloway could be called an expert on white supremacists.\n\nFor 13 years of his life, he was one.\n\nA troubled adolescence left him searching for acceptance. He found it in the late 1990s with a skinhead community in Toronto. Later, he joined a prominent neo-Nazi organization in Portland before starting his own chapter in Vancouver.\n\nEventually, he abandoned that life of hate, motivated in part by his wife and daughter.\n\n\"Hate became very exhausting for me — every day trying to convince myself of this ideology I was questioning,\" said Galloway, 37, who now works with two international nonprofits that counter violent extremism.\n\nTheir work turning people from radicalization seems more crucial than ever after three mass shootings in a little more than a week that left 34 people dead and 66 wounded in Gilroy, California; El Paso, Texas; and Dayton, Ohio.\n\nAuthorities have said the suspected gunman in El Paso shared white supremacist and anti-immigrant views on an anonymous online message board before the shooting.\n\nA domestic terrorism investigation has been opened into the Gilroy shooting, while the motive in the Dayton shootings remains unclear.\n\nBut what is clear is domestic terrorism's very real threat to Americans.\n\nLast year, domestic extremists killed at least 50 people, the fourth-deadliest total since 1970, according to a report from the Anti-Defamation League. White supremacists carried out 39 of those killings, the report states.\n\nThe number could be higher.\n\nMore:Kentucky's US attorneys pledge to prosecute rioters who stormed the Capitol\n\nThe tally, for example, does not include the Oct. 24, 2018, fatal shootings of two African American people at a Jeffersontown, Kentucky, Kroger grocery store because, as the organization notes, the accused gunman did not appear to be connected to a white supremacist group.\n\nHowever, Gregory Bush, who is charged with two counts of murder in the Kroger incident, has been accused of targeting African American victims in the shooting.\n\nThe simple truth, experts say, is that there is no one path toward domestic terrorism and no single profile of the perpetrators, although most are white males. Conflicting ideologies of some of the extremists further complicate the issue.\n\nThe suspected gunman in Gilroy, for example, had a list of targets that included Republican and Democratic institutions, according to the Los Angeles Times, and a novel he reportedly mentioned on Instagram has been championed by both white supremacists and nihilists.\n\nBut most academics who study violent extremism agree that the internet has exponentially extended the reach of hate groups, giving their ideologies nearly unfettered access to minds susceptible to their message.\n\nAnd the digital platforms they inhabit often shield them from detection by family members who can't — or won't — see the signs of radicalization.\n\n\"There is a definite grooming and indoctrination process that happens in the many hours spent in these online spaces,\" said Dana Coester, an associate professor at West Virginia University’s Reed College of Media who has researched and reported on white nationalism in the Appalachia region.\n\n\"I think most parents don’t have a clue what’s happening in these spaces.\"\n\nHate in America is growing\n\nJohn Johnson can remember a time when, as a black kid in southern Kentucky, he couldn’t walk down the same sidewalk as a white woman or make direct eye contact with a white man, for fear that either act could be met with violence.\n\nIt's why he has spent the better part of the last half-century working to stop the spread of racism, through his time with the NAACP and, since 2007, as executive director of Kentucky’s Commission on Human Rights.\n\nAnd it's why he is so troubled by the resurgence of white supremacy linked to deadly acts of domestic terrorism across the U.S.\n\n\"You’d think in 2019 we’d be so much more advanced in our thinking that we wouldn’t be accepting of the extremist groups we still see operating in the country,\" said Johnson, 74.\n\nThe signs of radicalism and white supremacism are rampant across Kentucky and Indiana.\n\nOpinion:Republicans should shut up unless they first say they're sorry for supporting Trump\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center tracked 13 hate groups in Kentucky and 24 in Indiana last year and more than 1,000 across the U.S.\n\nMeanwhile, the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks extremist and anti-Semitic incidents across America, reported a stark rise in such incidents in Kentucky this year: 55 through mid-June compared with 30 in all of 2018.\n\nIn Indiana, the organization tallied 38 incidents in 2018 and 24 through mid-June of this year. All but one of the incidents in both states this year were categorized as the appearance of white supremacist propaganda, an ongoing problem.\n\nMeanwhile, Kentucky’s law enforcement agencies have reported an 84% increase in hate crimes from 2016 (206 reported crimes) to 2017 (379 reported crimes), the most recent year of data published by the FBI.\n\nRacial or ethnic bias motivated three of every four hate crimes reported in Kentucky in 2017, FBI data show.\n\nNationally, the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting system reported an average of 7,500 hate crimes each year from 2013 to 2017, according to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nDuring that same time period, the bureau’s survey of crime victims put the average yearly total of hate crimes — both reported and unreported — at upwards of 200,000.\n\nA search for identity leads to white supremacy\n\nThe reasons why people gravitate toward extreme ideologies can vary greatly. For some, hate is a learned behavior.\n\nOthers see a particular group as the cause of whatever problems are in their own lives. They might feel the need for power or purpose or protection from some perceived threat to their way of life.\n\nFor Galloway, it was the search for an identity.\n\n“I wasn’t good enough in sports or academics, so I wasn’t fitting in those normal boxes,” he said. “And I wasn’t good enough at skateboarding or snowboarding that were popular when I was a teen. So what else could I be good at?”\n\nA friend from high school who had already been part of Toronto’s skinhead scene saw this and gave Galloway a possible answer.\n\nOver the next few years, he exposed Galloway to the group’s music and literature, selling him on the tough-guy image, the shaved heads and bomber jackets, the partying and comradery.\n\n“This was my identity,” Galloway said.\n\nHe said he didn’t initially share his new friends’ hatred toward minorities. “There are things you say to get along with the group.”\n\nBut the more time he spent with them, the more his mind warped.\n\n“It was creating that echo chamber — guys talking about what they hate,” he said.\n\nThe partnership between extremism and the internet\n\nThe indoctrination process Galloway experienced 20 years ago has been amplified and, to an extent, normalized by the internet.\n\nHate groups that once met in secret in someone’s basement or at a remote, fortified compound need only a computer and internet connection to rally their followers.\n\nAnd a person who harbors hate can find plenty of like-minded supporters on online messaging boards like the one authorities say was used by the suspected gunman in El Paso to share a four-page document full of white nationalist and anti-immigration rhetoric.\n\nThe same message board also has been linked to the gunmen in two other mass shootings, including the man who killed 51 people at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\nRead this:170-plus killings and few answers: Louisville besieged by record homicides and gun violence\n\n“It’s come along to a point where there are a lot more people involved in it than we would have thought before,” Galloway said. “The types of groups out there, there are so many more than when I joined up.”\n\nThe online ecosystem for hateful ideologies includes multiplayer gaming platforms, social media and YouTube.\n\nIn June, The New York Times profiled Caleb Cain, a young West Virginia man who became radicalized by right-wing extremist videos on YouTube after first searching the platform for self-help videos on depression.\n\n“He was just a frustrated, unemployed guy trying to help himself,” said Coester, who has consulted with Cain in her research. “Slowly he got funneled, through no initial choices of his own, into more extreme content online. And that slowly started to make sense to him.”\n\nIn another New York Times piece, this one from March 2018, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina’s School of Information and Library Science said she experimented with YouTube’s autoplay algorithm and found it directed her to increasingly extreme content no matter the starting place.\n\nFor example, videos of Donald Trump campaign rallies eventually led to white supremacist content, she wrote, while videos of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders led to left-leaning conspiracy theory content.\n\nEven a video on being a vegetarian took her to more extreme content — in this case, veganism.\n\n“It seems as if you are never ‘hardcore’ enough for YouTube’s recommendation algorithm,” the professor, Zeynep Tufekci, wrote. “It promotes, recommends and disseminates videos in a manner that appears to constantly up the stakes.”\n\nThe content is not necessarily affiliated with a specific hate group, but that’s not to say those groups aren’t using the internet as a weapon for radicalization.\n\n“It is dangerously naïve to believe that they’re not just as equipped to carry their messaging as anyone else,” said Sammy Rangel, co-founder and executive director of Life After Hate, a Chicago-based nonprofit that attempts to divert people from hate groups. “They sent out paper airplanes with messages 20 years ago that have now turned into full-scale messaging platforms.”\n\nTech companies have tried to fix the issue. But taking down extremist videos or message boards can be a bit like playing the arcade game whack-a-mole.\n\nAnd some question whether the push to regulate hate speech will end up restricting free speech.\n\nCan parents stop radicalization?\n\nThe internet’s ability to radicalize is also why the process is so difficult to detect.\n\nParents might not monitor their children’s internet use, either out of convenience or the desire to respect their children’s privacy. Or they mistakenly believe some of the more mainstream websites or social media platforms are safe from hate-filled content and, thus, need no monitoring.\n\nWhen they do take in an interest in what their children do online, they might only look for overt signs of racist propaganda.\n\n“They’re not seeing the coded, white supremacy content,” Coester said.\n\nJ.J. MacNab is a nationally recognized expert on domestic extremism and a research fellow with George Washington University’s Program on Extremism.\n\nIn her work, she searches a domestic terrorist’s online history for indicators of a specific ideology. For example, a suspected mass shooter could have frequently shared a meme or a fabricated quote popular with members of a certain hate group.\n\n“It’s a little red flag, but when you start to get a bunch of red flags from the same group you delve deeper,” she said.\n\nBut without that deep understanding, how can a parent know what to look for?\n\n“It’s really difficult,” MacNab said. “I’m not sure what to tell parents.”\n\nCoester had one possible message for parents: “They need to inhabit and immerse themselves in the space their child is in. You can’t glance at it. You have to be in the space to really understand how normalized this content has become in every platform.\n\n\"And if you don’t have time to do that, then I wouldn’t let my kids on technology.”\n\nBut even if a parent does suspect their child is being radicalized, they don’t always know what to do next.\n\nSome hope their child is merely going through a phase that will disappear with time. Others fear any intervention will drive their child away or immediately end in their child’s arrest.\n\n“I think families and communities are afraid,” Rangel said. “Imagine the amount of shame and guilt associated with being found out this is in your family.”\n\nMore:Rep.

In total, 31 people from at least 12 states were arrested and charged with conspiracy to riot. All have been released on bond.\n\nMost of the men arrested had logos on their hats “consistent with the Patriot Front group,” and some had other clothing associated with the White supremacist group, White said.\n\nHere’s what we know about Patriot Front – and what makes it different from other groups:\n\nHow did Patriot Front start?\n\nPatriot Front “is a white nationalist hate group that formed in the aftermath of the deadly ‘Unite the Right’ rally in Charlottesville, Virginia,” the Southern Poverty Law Center said.\n\n“The organization broke off from Vanguard America (VA), a neo-Nazi group that participated in the chaotic demonstration,” the SPLC said.\n\nThe rally turned deadly with the killing of anti-racism demonostrator Heather Heyer. Later that month, Rousseau – who led Vanguard America members at “Unite the Right” – rebranded the group’s website and launched a new group called Patriot Front, the Anti-Defamation League said.\n\nWhat do Patriot Front members believe?\n\n“Patriot Front is a white supremacist group whose members maintain that their ancestors conquered America and bequeathed it to them, and no one else,” the ADL said.\n\n“Patriot Front justifies its ideology of hate and intolerance under the guise of preserving the ethnic and cultural origins of its members’ European ancestors.”\n\nThe group’s manifesto claims those in America who are not of European ancestry are not truly American.\n\n“An African may have lived, worked, and even been classed as a citizen in America for centuries, yet he is not American. He is, as he likely prefers to be labeled, an African in America,” Patriot Front’s website said.\n\n“The same rule applies to others who are not of the founding stock of our people, or do not share the common unconscious that permeates throughout our greater civilization, and the European diaspora.”\n\nWho is Patriot Front’s leader?\n\nRousseau, who grew up in suburban Dallas, founded Patriot Front when he was a teenager, according to the SPLC.\n\nThomas Rousseau Kootenai County Sheriff\n\n“While working for his high school newspaper, Rousseau frequently wrote opinion columns in support of conservative topics including the controversial ‘campus carry’ law in Texas and North Carolina’s since gutted ‘bathroom bill.’ He was also an ardent supporter of Donald Trump during the 2016 election,” the SPLC said.\n\n“Under Rousseau’s direct leadership, Patriot Front’s Texas chapter is its most active – relying mostly on flyering, banner drops and occasionally demonstrations. When the organization ventures off the internet, its activities are primarily conducted in the dead of night, anonymously.”\n\nAfter the arrests in Idaho on Saturday, CNN reached out to the Patriot Front and people believed to be associated with Rousseau but did not immediately hear back.\n\nWhat are the goals of Patriot Front?\n\n“I think when you look at the past actions of the Patriot Front, they’re varied,” former FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok told CNN on Monday.\n\n“A lot of what they do is designed for image – for creating propaganda that they can use to spread their message to recruit more followers,” Strzok said.\n\n“So in the past, what we’ve seen from a lot of their activities (is) not so much intent on engaging in violence as much as engaging in protests. Certainly, hateful speech, for sure, but this is much more a group that’s designed for image and for creating a public spectacle.”\n\nBut Strzok said there’s always a key question with such groups: “Is there a trigger point where their intention is to move from simply protesting to violence?”\n\nHe said it’s not clear what may have happened at the Pride parade in Idaho.\n\n“The real question in my mind is their intention for what they were going to do that day,” Strzok said.\n\nHow is Patriot Front different from other White nationalist or White supremacist groups?\n\nMembers of Patriot Front are “comparatively young,” Strzok said.\n\n“A central tactic to Patriot Front is ‘flash demonstrations’ – privately planned and unannounced events that allow groups to promote their beliefs while limiting the risk of individual exposure, negative media coverage, arrests and public backlash,” the ADL said.\n\n“These flash demonstrations are mainly orchestrated for a quick photo and video opportunity that is then turned into online content.”\n\nAnd Patriot Front “has declined to participate in large rallies with other hate groups, preferring instead to work with small, local chapters that allow Patriot Front to remain the center of attention while controlling their message and presentation,” the SPLC said.\n\nStrzok said he’s worried the country might be in a new phase of extremism.\n\n“I think there’s certainly a lot of personal grievances out there across America. And what particularly concerns me right now is you see a lot of people – both political leaders as well as some in the media – who are tacitly encouraging not violence, but certainly these extremist beliefs,” the former FBI official said.\n\n“Whether it’s replacement theory, which plays into a lot of the White nationalist propaganda, whether it’s political figures using images of violence, I think that’s encouraging or accepting behavior that in the past we had moved away from,” Strzok said. “So I am worried that people who are inclined to violence … might be driven to violence.”\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that CNN had reached out to Thomas Ryan Rousseau's legal representative.

Members of the extremist street gang the Proud Boys were decked out in bright orange beanies, tattoos and more body armor. QAnon conspiracists carried banners and wore garb emblazoned with the conspiracy theory’s nonsensical slogans.\n\nMembers of these factions would go on to be charged with some of the most serious crimes of the insurrection. A Proud Boy would grab a riot officer’s shield and use it to break one of the first windows of the riot. Oath Keepers would march in a military-style “stack” formation into the building, hands on one another's shoulders, carrying out a plan they had been hatching for months. A QAnon adherent would lead a vicious mob against a Capitol police officer.\n\nIn the two years since that day, these groups have come to define much of what is known about the insurrection. Members of the Oath Keepers, Proud Boys and the extremist movement the Three Percenters have faced seditious conspiracy charges — the most high-profile cases to come out of that day. The man known as Jacob Chansley or Jake Angeli — the furry-horned-hat-wearing Arizona QAnon disciple who marched, bare-chested through the Capitol — would, for people across the world, become a human emblem of Jan. 6.\n\nNow, two years later, these groups are fractured and leaderless.\n\nStewart Rhodes, founder of the Oath Keepers, was convicted of seditious conspiracy late last year and faces decades in prison. With his demise, his organization has all but disappeared from public view.\n\nWho is Stewart Rhodes?:Vegas parking valet, Yale law graduate, unhinged Oath Keepers leader: Who is Stewart Rhodes?\n\nThe Proud Boys, with their leaders facing similar charges, have largely abandoned national politics and large protests in favor of smaller, localized gatherings.\n\nProud Boys splinter:Proud Boys splintering after Capitol riot, revelations about leader. Will more radical factions emerge?\n\nAnd QAnon – with its figurehead, Trump out of office, increasingly shunned by Washington and facing multiple investigations – has largely shrunk back into the dark corners of the internet whence it came.\n\nQAnon evolves:QAnon followers distance themselves from the movement's most bizarre conspiracy theories as they rebrand\n\nBut the ideologies that underpin extremist hatred and conspiracy theories, and which galvanized thousands to march on the Capitol, are as present as ever in today’s America, and should not be underestimated or forgotten, experts on extremism warn.\n\nViolent domestic extremism remains a top priority for federal, state and local law enforcement. Extremist ideologies including white supremacy and anti-LGBTQ hate have inspired or been linked to several mass shootings since the insurrection, with dozens of victims.\n\nThus, while the groups that were central to the Jan. 6 insurrection may have come undone, the ideologies that fueled them – stuck in the country’s subculture for decades – show no signs of disappearing.\n\nInstead of forming specific groups, the far-right has spent the past two years rallied around opposing certain themes. They’ve fought COVID vaccine mandates. They’ve decried the teaching of ideas they dub Critical Race Theory. And, most recently, they’ve protested all-ages drag shows. Some saw the shows as a proxy for progressive politics, and some claimed (without evidence) that they’re havens for child predators.\n\nWhat focus will unite extremists during 2023, experts aren’t sure. What they do know is that these ideologies, and their followers, haven’t gone away.\n\n“Things are constantly evolving in the extremist landscape — it’s a fluid threat, not a static one,” said Jared Holt, a senior researcher at the think tank the Institute for Strategic Dialogue and an expert on domestic extremism. “When power vacuums open up, whether that is a major figure going down, or somebody going to jail or a group breaking up, there's always somebody standing out there ready to step into that vacuum.”\n\nWhat’s become of the big extremist groups?\n\nThe most well-known extremist groups involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection have fractured over the last two years, but only one appears to have fallen apart.\n\nLate last year, Rhodes and another senior Oath Keeper, Kelly Meggs, were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other felonies, along with three other Oath Keepers who were convicted of lesser charges. Rhodes and Meggs, who are yet to be sentenced, could spend the rest of their lives behind bars.\n\nRhodes, who was arrested last January, spent most of 2022 in prison. With its charismatic leader behind bars, the Oath Keepers largely disappeared from public view, said Alex Friedfeld, an investigative researcher with the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. Friedfeld said he expects things to stay that way.\n\n“Rhodes has been the guiding force of the Oath Keepers since its founding and has been behind every major decision they make and organized everything and without him I think it's going to be very difficult for the Oath Keepers to continue,” Friedfeld said. “I think it's telling that Rhodes got arrested last January, and we still don't know who's running the group.”\n\nThe Proud Boys are a different story.\n\nFounded as a men’s “drinking club” based on pro-western bigotry in 2016, the Proud Boys weren’t initially interested in a national political movement. But starting around 2018, the group began to step into the vacuum left by the fading “alt-right” movement. The group selected a national leadership that included a national “Chairman,” Henry “Enrique” Tarrio, and regional leaders.\n\nBy 2020, the Proud Boys were so ubiquitous that then-presidential candidate Joe Biden questioned Trump about them in a live televised debate. The President infamously responded that the group should “Stand back and stand by.”\n\nInside the Proud Boys:They joined the Wisconsin Proud Boys looking for brotherhood. They found racism, bullying and antisemitism.\n\nTarrio and four other Proud Boy leaders are currently on trial for seditious conspiracy. But unlike the Oath Keepers, the group hasn’t faded into insignificance, said Emily Kaufman, a researcher who specializes in the Proud Boys at the Anti-Defamation League.\n\n“Where we might have expected the Proud Boys to be decimated by one of the highest number of arrests related to the insurrection, we saw the Proud Boys really become galvanized by their participation,” Kaufman said.\n\nThe Proud Boys pivoted away from a brief stint as a national force to more localized activity, organized on a chapter-by-chapter basis, Kaufman and other experts said. Instead of sending people to march in Washington, Proud Boys in 2022 were much more likely to be seen at local school board meetings or protesting all-age drag shows.\n\n“What's concerning is that now, with the absence of national leadership that was at least ostensibly concerned about optics, it really is going to be up to individual chapters to determine the direction of the group going forward,” Kaufman said.\n\nMore of a movement than a group: QAnon\n\nFollowers of the conspiracy theory QAnon never had an “organization” per se. The QAnon community has never had leaders, or a command structure. Instead, it relies on an organic web of “influencers” and so-called “experts” who have helped shape and direct QAnon followers.\n\nBut QAnon has always had a de-facto leader: Trump.\n\nThe conspiracy theory was largely based on the belief that Trump was engaged in a complex “game” that would eventually result in the imprisonment of powerful Democrats, liberal celebrities and other left-leaning global power brokers. According to QAnon lore, which was dispensed online in “drops” of cryptic information, those global elites were engaged in widespread pedophilia and “harvesting” children for a compound called “adrenochrome.”\n\nThis is, of course, all nonsense, and, after countless defeats for the QAnon belief system, including the 2020 election, the 2022 midterms and a dozen failed prophecies in between, even the most ardent supporters began to distance themselves last year. QAnon, some even claimed in a short-lived effort in 2022, never really existed anyway, but was made up by the media.\n\n“The Q community really has transitioned away from the Q branding and become a mainstream anti-vaccine, anti-trans … popular movement,” said Mike Rothschild, a conspiracy theory researcher who wrote a book on QAnon. “People share Q memes and slogans without knowing what they are, and Q promoters make little effort to push the drops or Q mythology.”\n\nSeveral adherents to QAnon arrested for their activity on Jan. 6 have already been convicted, including Chansley, who was sentenced in November to 41 months in prison and 36 months of supervised release.\n\nA fourth extremist group that sits somewhere between the Oath Keepers and QAnon is the Three Percenters. More of an idea than a formalized organization, the Three Percenters was founded by an Alabama gun rights activist on the (again, untrue) theory that only 3% of Americans took up arms against the British during the Revolutionary War.\n\nUnlike the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters movement has never had a clear leader or leadership structure. Self-professed members of the group espouse similar beliefs to the Oath Keepers, with the central themes being a deep mistrust of Washington, D.C., and the belief that Americans will have their guns taken away by a tyrannical federal government.\n\nSix men affiliated with the Three Percenters are also facing charges of seditious conspiracy and will go to trial later this year. Experts said it’s too soon to know whether that trial, which has received little media attention in the shadow of the more well-known Proud Boys and Oath Keepers prosecutions, will have much of an impact on the Three Percenters’ legacy or popularity.\n\nExtremist groups come, and go\n\nThis is certainly not the first time in history that well-known far-right groups have fallen into disarray.\n\nIn the 1980s and 90s, civil rights groups mounted challenges, often in the civil courts, against overtly white supremacist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan and the Aryan Nations. Court rulings eventually brought these groups to their knees, financially, with a corresponding erosion of their support base.\n\nHate groups hit by lawsuits:Lawsuit over Charlottesville 'Unite the Right' rally\n\nIn the mid 2000s and 2010s the alt-right movement, led by white supremacist Richard Spencer, gained traction among American racists, culminating in the deadly 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The ensuing lawsuits and criminal charges eventually gutted the Alt-Right, all but silencing Spencer, and leaving white supremacist groups bankrupt and languishing.\n\nIn 2017, neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin, who published what was then perhaps the most influential white supremacist website, was sued by a woman who claimed his trolling subjected her and her family to months of abuse and death threats. Anglin lost the case, was ordered to pay $4 million, and claims to have fled the country. A judge ordered an arrest warrant for him in November.\n\nAs one far-right group, or influencer, fades away, there’s always somebody to take their place, said Kesa White, a researcher who tracks extremists at the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (PERIL) at American University.\n\n“They’ll always still be there,” White said. “Just because they aren’t doing any action right now doesn’t mean they’re not planning what they might do tomorrow.”\n\nWatch the ideologies, not the groups\n\nWhile much media and law enforcement attention is paid to organized extremist groups, some experts believe that attention would be better focused on understanding how the extremist ideologies underpinning them are spread, and how they can best be countered.\n\nCynthia Miller-Idriss, PERIL’s director, said research shows that only between 7% to 15% of extremists ever participate actively in groups or organizations. And not one hate-based mass shooting has been carried out by a card carrying member of an extremist group in recent years, she said.\n\nThe man who shot up a Buffalo supermarket last year, killing 10 people, wasn’t a member of any specific organization, but he espoused the same ideas spread by hate groups.\n\n“Generally the most dangerous actors are not the ones that are messing around in the groups,” Miller-Idriss said. “The groups are reshuffling, but I think the question is what happens with the other 85% of people who are radicalized and are looking for something to glom on to.”\n\nAs American extremism enters its third year since Jan. 6, then, experts like Miller-Idriss caution it’s vital to watch which groups emerge to take the place of those fragmented by the Jan. 6 prosecutions. But, no matter who or what takes up the far-right mantle, they say, the ideas underpinning the movement always have a way of re-emerging.\n\n\"Where I have caution is when I hear people say ‘Oh, well, it's over — like that moment has passed,’” Miller-Idriss said. “I don't think you can put the genie back in the bottle quite that easily.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/29/opinions/shooting-buffalo-uvalde-lynching-racism-jordan/index.html", "title": "Opinion: Mass shootings have a lot in common with another ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Emma Coleman Jordan is the J.

Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nIn 1899, a mob in Newnan, Georgia tortured, mutilated and burned to death a Black farm worker named Sam Hose, who was accused of killing his White employer.\n\nIn that era, it was rare for a Black person accused of a crime to receive evenhanded treatment by the justice system, so it’s impossible to know whether there was any truth to the accusations against him. Some accounts say Hose acted in self-defense. Guilty or innocent, he was subjected to the summary justice of the mob. Hose was hunted down, captured and lynched without a trial.\n\nCourtesy Emma Coleman Jordan\n\nHis grisly execution was widely attended. People arrived by chartered train from Atlanta, some 40 miles away, to witness the appalling spectacle, which was viewed by as many as 2,000 people, according to contemporaneous accounts.\n\nLynching as public entertainment was not unusual in the decades after the official end of slavery in 1865, when Black people often were terrorized by Whites intent on buttressing an oppressive, racist hierarchy in which they were at the pinnacle. And these oppressors did not hesitate to use violence to safeguard the system.\n\nAnd lynchings were not only bloodthirsty events, they were also jarringly festive. White parents routinely brought their children to spectacle lynchings of Black men and women as family entertainment. Fathers lifted their young children on their shoulders for a better view. The hideous mutilations were looked at in much the same way as we might regard sporting events today. Their celebratory nature was captured by postcards that were popular souvenir items of the day. These artifacts often bore photos showing graphic lynching scenes as well as the jubilant White crowds in attendance.\n\nSuch acts of racial barbarity have not been relegated to America’s past, however. They are links in an unbroken chain of hate that continue. For evidence, one need only look at the shooter in Buffalo who mowed down 10 Black people at a supermarket this month, in a deadly attack fueled by racism and allegedly perpetrated by a young man who identified himself as a White supremacist.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder and more charges are expected.\n\nIllustration depicting 'The riots in New York: The mob lynching a negro in Clarkson Street.' during the draft riots.

Fotosearch/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nAs with the perpetrators of the lynching of Sam Hose more than a century ago, the alleged shooter in Buffalo intended for his heinous act to be witnessed by others who shared his White nationalist views, even if no racist spectators in modern times travel to lynchings on packed train cars.\n\nNo less significantly, acts of racial terrorism are meant to strike fear in the heart of Black people, to make them feel hunted, unwelcome and oppressed. And indeed, Black residents of Buffalo dealing with the aftermath of the attack have voiced similar emotions.\n\nIn fact, many Black Americans harbored such fears of attack by White terrorists even before the Buffalo massacre. And in the wake of the shooting, a majority of Black Americans recently polled said they live with the fear of another such attack.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Before Tulsa, this Georgia county forced out nearly all Black residents 07:54 - Source: CNN\n\nAs with the lynchings of the past, today’s racially-based attacks put Black suffering on display for the entertainment of a 21st century version of the White mob. In the case of the Buffalo shooting, this was captured on video and shared on online platforms. Those who viewed the violent spectacle were presumably seated in the comfort of their own homes, logged in by computer and via their cellphones.\n\nHe streamed the carnage online with a helmet-mounted video camera while he opened fire on the people in the store, many of whom were elderly people purchasing groceries in one of the few food stores in their Buffalo community.\n\nNews reports said the video of the shooting was taken down within minutes by the online forums on which it was shared, but not before it could be copied and shared millions of times.\n\nThe shooter appears to have embraced White nationalist views after joining similar online racist forums. He reportedly wrote in a long online post he was inspired by the shooting attack carried out by a White supremacist in Christchurch, New Zealand on two mosques that killed 51 people. The shooter in that attack aimed to foment discord between Muslims and non-Muslims, with the goal of driving followers of Islam out of the country. And like the shooter in Buffalo, he filmed and streamed video of the attack, in his case on Facebook.\n\nAccording to the posts shared on Discord and on the hate-filled online forum 4Chan, the Buffalo suspect planned the massacre for months. The streaming site Twitch, most often used for sharing games — including ones simulating violence battlefield violence — was also used by the shooter, including during his livestream of the attack. In this case however, the violence was all too real.\n\nIn a statement to the New York Times, Angela Hession, Twitch’s vice president of trust and safety, said the site had a “very strong response time” to the Buffalo shooting “considering the challenges of live content moderation.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback A lynching memorial remembers the forgotten 04:13 - Source: CNN\n\nShe added: “In the end, we are all part of one internet, and we know by now that content or behavior rarely — if ever — will stay contained on one platform.”\n\nPosts written by the alleged shooter were made visible to a group of at least 15 people about 30 minutes before the attack began. A 180-page diatribe attributed to him was also posted online, elaborating his racist beliefs.\n\nThe document cited resentment over a rising percentage of people of color in American — so-called replacement theory — as his justification for stalking, then launching attacks against unsuspecting Black citizens who already bear the weight of 400 years of structural racism and subordination, and who were trapped in a segregated, redlined community in Buffalo.\n\nOne striking phenomenon is so many of the perpetrators in recent mass shooting events have been young people. The shooter’s youth — he was just 18 — was a likely factor in his receptivity to the unsavory ideas he took up so readily.\n\nBUFFALO, NEW YORK - MAY 20: People gather at a memorial for the shooting victims outside of Tops market on May 20, 2022 in Buffalo, New York. 18-year-old Payton Gendron is accused of the mass shooting that killed 10 people at the Tops grocery store on the east side of Buffalo on May 14th and is being investigated as a hate crime.

The gun he used to carry out the massacre of school children this week was something of an 18th birthday present to himself, and was purchased the same week he reached that milestone.\n\nThe motive for the Texas shooting remains unclear. The alleged shooter was a young man of Latino origin, as were most of his victims. Like some other recent mass shooters, he shared his murderous plot online minutes before carrying it out.\n\nIt is a sad statement on the tragedy of spiraling gun violence in America that the shooting in Buffalo already has been supplanted in the public’s attention by the horrifying massacre in Texas.\n\nAmerica has failed to find a way to stem the carnage associated with the proliferation of powerful automatic firearms of the sort used in both mass shootings, which occurred just a week and half apart.\n\nWith respect to shooters spurred by White supremacism, this country more than has its hands full.

The statements were clear and filled with hate toward the Black community. Investigators also uncovered other information from search warrants and other methods indicating the alleged shooter was “studying” previous hate attacks and shootings, the official said.\n\nThe revelation comes a day after a gunman killed 10 people and wounded three others at the Tops Friendly Markets store in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo. Eleven of the people who were shot were Black, officials said. The victims range in age from 20 to 86, police said. Buffalo police identified all 13 victims Sunday. Among them were a former police officer who tried to stop the shooter, the octogenarian mother of the city’s former fire commissioner and a long-term substitute teacher.\n\nTwo people remain hospitalized in stable condition, a spokesman for Erie County Medical Center said Saturday night.\n\nLive updates: Buffalo supermarket shooting\n\nThe suspect was identified as Payton S.

It will be prosecuted as a hate crime,” he said. “This is someone who has hate in their heart, soul and mind.”\n\nPeople gather outside a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, where 10 people were killed on Saturday. Derek Gee/The Buffalo News/AP\n\nInvestigators believe the suspect acted on his own in the shooting, Gramaglia said. The suspect was in Buffalo a day before the shooting and did some reconnaissance at the Tops Friendly Markets store, the commissioner said.\n\nGendron, the suspect, surrendered to police and was taken into custody. He was charged with first-degree murder, prosecutors said, and pleaded not guilty in court Saturday night, Buffalo City Court Chief Judge Craig Hannah told CNN.\n\nErie County Sheriff John Garcia said Gendron is currently under suicide watch.\n\nOn Sunday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced $2.8 million in federal and state funding for the victims and their families, according to a statement from her office.\n\n“The past 24 hours have been traumatizing for New Yorkers, and my administration will spare no effort to ensure the victims of this act of terrorism by a white supremacist are receiving all the resources and support they need,” Hochul said in the statement. “The entire world is watching how we will come together as New Yorkers to overcome this unthinkable tragedy. Buffalo, my hometown, is the City of Good Neighbors and New York State will be good neighbors for them.”\n\nNew York State’s Office of Victim Services will be in Buffalo throughout the week to help administer funding and assist victims and families in obtaining financial assistance from the state, according to the statement.\n\nIn addition, Hochul announced a partnership with rideshare services Uber and Lyft to provide transport to and from local grocery stores for affected community members.\n\nThe grocery store company, Tops Markets, is also providing free transportation to members of the Buffalo community affected by the shooting “to ensure our neighbors are able to meet their grocery and pharmacy needs,” according to an update on Twitter from the grocery chain.\n\n“While the Tops location at Jefferson Avenue will remain closed until further notice, we are steadfast in our commitment to serving every corner of our community as we have for the past 60 years,” the statement reads. “Knowing the importance of this location and serving families on the east side of the city, we have taken immediate steps to ensure our neighbors are able to meet their grocery and pharmacy needs by providing free bus shuttle service starting today.”\n\nSaturday’s attack bears similarities to a number of mass shootings in recent years that were motivated by hate and intended to be seen online, including the shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019.\n\nThe Buffalo attack was the deadliest US mass shooting of the year. There have been at least 198 mass shootings so far in 2022, per the Gun Violence Archive, which – like CNN – defines a mass shooting as four or more people shot, not including the shooter.\n\nThe owner of a firearms shop in New York told The New York Times that the suspect recently bought a Bushmaster assault weapon.

Kathy Hochul told CNN investigators believe the suspect targeted the busiest place in that area at the busiest time.\n\n“This was targeted by ZIP code,” Hochul said. “This was the highest concentration of African Americans within hours.”\n\nThe ZIP code that includes the store, 14208, is 78% Black, according to the US Census Bureau’s 2020 American Community Survey. That is the highest percentage of Black population of any ZIP code in upstate New York.\n\nHochul said an AR-15 used in the shooting was purchased legally in a gun store in New York state but was modified with a high-capacity magazine, which is not legal in the state.\n\nThe suspected gunman had previously been on the radar of police, officials said.\n\nAs a student at Susquehanna Valley Central High School, he made a “generalized threat” in June 2021, Gramaglia said. The student was brought in for a mental health evaluation and was released after a day and a half, according to Gramaglia. The threat was not racially motivated, he added.\n\nA spokesman for the New York State Police confirmed to CNN it investigated and responded to a report that a 17-year-old student had made “a threatening statement” in June 2021 at the same high school. The student was taken into custody and transported to a hospital in June 2021 for a mental health evaluation.\n\nState police were unable to confirm how long the individual was in the hospital or the findings of the evaluation. They also refused to name the 17-year-old.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Hochul said on ABC’s “This Week” the suspect had previously been under surveillance with medical authorities related to “something he wrote in high school.”\n\nIn his hometown, the suspect worked at the local Conklin Reliable Market for about four months and left about three months ago, according to the store’s owner. The owner described him as very quiet, while a neighbor similarly said “you wouldn’t get more than a word or two” from him.\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Mayor identifies hero who engaged shooter 01:34 - Source: CNN\n\nAt around 2:30 p.m., the suspect drove to Tops Friendly Markets near the areas of Masten Park and Kingsley. Wearing tactical gear and armed with an assault weapon, the suspect allegedly shot and killed three people in the parking lot and wounded a fourth, according to a statement from Erie County District Attorney John J. Flynn.\n\nThe suspect then entered the store and exchanged gunfire with an armed security guard who was a retired member of the Buffalo Police Department, the district attorney said. The guard was identified as Aaron Salter, Brown said.\n\nBecause the suspect wore heavy tactical gear, however, the guard’s bullets did not have any effect, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said Saturday.\n\n“He was very heavily armed,” the police commissioner said. “He had tactical gear, he had a tactical helmet on, he had a camera that he was livestreaming what he was doing.”\n\nInside the store, nine people were shot before the suspect was apprehended by police, according to the district attorney’s statement.\n\nIn a statement sent to CNN, livestreaming service Twitch confirmed the shooting was streamed and said the user “has been indefinitely suspended from our service, and we are taking all appropriate action, including monitoring for any accounts rebroadcasting this content.”\n\nCNN obtained a portion of the livestream which showed the suspect arriving at the supermarket in his vehicle. CNN is not airing the video.\n\nPeople hug near the scene of the mass shooting at the Tops Friendly Markets store Saturday. Joshua Bessex/AP\n\nGrady Lewis said he was outside the supermarket when he heard seven or eight gunshots and saw a White man dressed in tactical gear spraying gunfire at the entry of the store. Law enforcement arrived within two minutes after the shooting began, Lewis told CNN affiliate WKBW. He “heard at least 20 or so shots” before the suspect exited the store.\n\n“He came out, he put the gun to his head, to his chin. Then he dropped it and took off his bulletproof vest, then got on his hands and knees and put his hands behind his back,” Lewis said, describing the moments the suspect was arrested by police. “I thought they were going to shoot him but they didn’t shoot him.”\n\n“I still don’t even believe it happened … that a person would go into a supermarket full of people,” he said. “It was horrible, it was really horrible.”\n\nThe Tops Friendly Markets store released a statement Sunday saying it was heartbroken over the violence. “Tops has been committed to this community and to the city of Buffalo for decades and this tragedy will not change that commitment,” the company said.", "authors": ["Eric Levenson Sarah Jorgensen Polo Sandoval Samantha Beech", "Eric Levenson", "Sarah Jorgensen", "Polo Sandoval", "Samantha Beech"], "publish_date": "2022/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/06/19/what-is-boogaloo-movement/3204899001/", "title": "The boogaloo movement is gaining momentum. Who are the ...", "text": "During recent months of unrest over coronavirus shutdowns and deaths of unarmed Black Americans in police custody, a right-wing extremist group aimed at overthrowing the government has been growing, experts say.\n\nThe \"boogaloo\" movement – named for a 1980s breakdancing movie and characterized by members who carry weapons and wear Hawaiian shirts and tactical gear – looks to exploit unrest in order to start a second civil war.\n\nBut there are various facets to the loosely organized group: One generally stems from its original ties to neo-Nazis and white supremacists, while a newer facet is libertarian.\n\n\"There's a lot of overlap and the boundary is blurry because they both evolved together,\" said Alex Newhouse, digital research lead at Middlebury Institute's Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism. \"It is very difficult to know if the 'boogaloo boi' you see standing in the middle of the street at a protest is there in solidarity or to incite violence.\"\n\nAntifa, explained:What is antifa and what does the movement want?\n\nWhile the full group is not expected to perform large-scale attacks, individual actors are more likely to initiate violence, Newhouse said.\n\nHere's what to know about the boogaloo movement.\n\nWhat is the boogaloo movement and what do members want?\n\nThe boogaloo meme began emerging in both white power and antigovernment spaces online in the early 2010s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\"In both of these communities, 'boogaloo' was frequently associated with racist violence and, in many cases, was an explicit call for race war,\" the SPLC said.\n\nRecent events play into the group's hands, said Devin Burghart, executive director of the National Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights.\n\n“They believe that in this current moment, the chaos that surrounds us is signaling the potential for an impending second civil war which, believe it or not, they are hoping for because they believe that will rid the United States of all its problems,” Burghart told USA TODAY.\n\nThere are mainly two wings of the boogaloo movement, but their objective of overthrowing the government and sparking societal collapse remains the same, Newhouse said. One side is made up of some neo-Nazis and white supremacists, whose plan for destroying the government is by starting a race war.\n\n\"They want to spark some sort of confrontation that will kill both sides,\" Newhouse said. \"They believe, 'If we start the bullets flying, then they'll kill each other' sort of thing,\" with no regard for who lives or dies.\n\nAnother side is characterized as radical libertarian, notably men carrying weapons and wearing Hawaiian shirts. Some have recently been spotted at Black Lives Matter protests, waving anti-police signs alongside protesters, Newhouse said.\n\nThey believe in defending the rights of individuals against the government and have been known to incite violence against police.\n\nNazis used red triangles to mark political prisoners.That symbol is why Facebook banned a Trump reelection campaign ad.\n\nThe libertarian side of the movement becomes enraged when referred to as a \"white supremacist group,\" said JJ MacNab, research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. She said there are some Black and Hispanic members.\n\n\"The earlier boogaloos were white supremacist,\" MacNab said. \"The ones that came later did not inherit that side of the belief system. Most of them aren’t even aware of white supremacy in subsets of the movement until they read it in the newspapers. A vast majority on Facebook are adamantly against it.\"\n\nThe boogaloo bois' relationship to antifa – left-leaning, anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of neo-Nazis – is murkier. The libertarian side of the movement is split between members who see antifa as communists, whom they want to dissociate from, and members who see them as \"brothers-in-arms,\" MacNab said.\n\nWhat's the meaning of 'boogaloo'? Why do they wear Hawaiian shirts?\n\nThe \"boogaloo\" name is a code word for the second civil war and came from the 1984 movie \"Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo,\" according to Associated Press. The film is about breakdancing teens battling to save their local community center from corrupt politicians and corporate development.\n\nSam Firstenberg, director of the cult classic, told The Hollywood Reporter that the \"Electric Boogaloo\" began as a meme on the internet. \"In the last 10 years or so, it became equal with the word 'sequel,'\" Firstenberg said, in conjunction with the second civil war the boogaloo movement aspires to create. \"Civil War 2: Electric Boogaloo\" began popping up on message boards, The Hollywood Reporter said.\n\nBoogaloo bois often wear Hawaiian shirts, body armor and carry weaponry or tactical gear.\n\nThe shirts come from the popular term in boogaloo internet spaces, \"Big Luau,\" from the tradition of luau pig roasts, which boogaloo bois are drawn to because their common reference to police as \"pigs,\" experts with the Middlebury Institute of International Studies say. The \"Big Luau\" is another code used to describe the fall of society.\n\nTies to boogaloo:Grand jury indicts 3 men on terror charges over Las Vegas protest plot\n\nIn Wisconsin:Young white men with long guns at George Floyd protests likely affiliated with far-right group Boogaloo\n\nBoogaloo on social media\n\nThe movement, which stemmed from memes in social media pro-gun groups, has been organized through Facebook, Reddit and YouTube. The Tech Transparency Project, a public research and data initiative, identified roughly 125 Facebook groups related to the movement, more than half of which were created between February and April and had recently attracted tens of thousands of members.\n\n\"Online extremists are using Facebook to plan and organize for a militant uprising in the United States as they cast coronavirus lockdowns as a sign of rising government suppression,\" according to a Tech Transparency Project investigation.\n\nFacebook has taken steps to limit the groups. In May, the social media company banned the use of the term boogaloo and related words when they accompany pictures of weapons and calls to action. Later, Facebook said it would no longer recommend such groups to members of similar associations.\n\nInvolvement in protests over coronavirus shutdown, George Floyd's death\n\nDuring the coronavirus lockdowns, \"something changed,\" MacNab said.\n\n\"It put a pressure on (the boogaloo movement) that I've never seen before. I saw (online) rhetoric through the roof on killing cops,\" she said.\n\nThis month, an Air Force sergeant, who prosecutors claim has ties to boogaloo, faces murder charges in the deaths of a California sheriff's deputy and a federal security officer. He also is accused of wounding five other law enforcement officers.\n\nIn March, a Missouri man with ties to neo-Nazis was shot and killed when FBI agents tried to arrest him. Timothy Wilson, 36, was planning to bomb a hospital in the Kansas City area on the day that a stay-at-home order was scheduled to take effect, authorities said. Wilson told an undercover FBI agent that his goal was “to kick-start a revolution” and referred to his plans as “operation boogaloo,” according to an agent’s affidavit.\n\nIn May, three alleged boogaloo members were arrested on terrorism-related charges in what federal prosecutors say was a conspiracy to spark violence during protests in Las Vegas over reopening businesses and George Floyd's death. Authorities allege the three white men filled gas cans and made Molotov cocktails in glass bottles and were headed to a Black Lives Matter protest, according to a copy of the criminal complaint.\n\n\"Violent instigators have hijacked peaceful protests and demonstrations across the country, including Nevada, exploiting the real and legitimate outrage over Mr. Floyd’s death for their own radical agendas,\" said Nicholas A.

We want to be in a position where we’re ready, we're prepared enough, ready enough that we can take advantage of whatever chaos, power vacuum, that might emerge. We want to try and fill that power vacuum and take advantage of the chaos.\"\n\nThe law center's three-part podcast – parts two and three publish later this month – takes listeners through 83 hours of secret recordings as 100 men apply for membership. The recordings were made on an encrypted app called \"Wire\" by a Canadian journalist who infiltrated the group and via a separate confidential source who provided the recordings unsolicited. The authenticity of the recordings was verified by subject matter experts who recognized Nazzaro’s voice from previous audio appearances and were able to verify other corroborating details.\n\nMuch of the conversation makes for disturbing listening and includes racial slurs, offensive language and discussions about how to precipitate the collapse of American civilization and engineer their fantasies of a white ethnostate.\n\nUSA TODAY could not independently verify the identities of those featured on the podcast.\n\nNazzaro repeatedly makes clear in the recordings that he favors recruiting members who have either served in the police or the military because of their experience with guns and/or combat expertise. Several of the candidates Nazzaro interviews claim to have such backgrounds, including some who claim to be on active military duty, although the SPLC acknowledges that some of the statements made by candidates to Nazzaro may be exaggerated to win his approval. An estimated 20% of potential recruits claimed to be connected to the military in some capacity.\n\nHOW TO:Talk to family and friends about racism\n\n\"​Right. But I mean, you know, even when you do deploy, I'm assuming that you'll still be able to maintain contact with us,\" Nazzaro says to one candidate being interviewed, who claims to be responsible for operating weapons on tanks in the U.S. military.\n\nAlso discussed: bombings, arson and economic sabotage.\n\nRight-wing extremists responsible for 90% of U.S. terrorist attacks in 2020\n\nThe U.S. Marine Corps. has confirmed that two of the 13 men charged by federal and state authorities in an alleged domestic terrorism plot to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer were Marine veterans. Some of the men are accused of scheming to storm the State Capitol building, take Whitmer and other government officials hostage and start a civil war over their anti-government views and grievances ranging from poor economic prospects to anger over coronavirus restrictions.\n\nFBI:Virginia Gov. Northam was also targeted in plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Whitmer\n\nThe alleged Michigan plot has renewed attention on warnings from security experts, U.S. lawmakers and extremism researchers about the growing threat of domestic terrorism from far-right groups, many of them with links to white supremacy extremists.\n\n\"Today, white supremacist terrorism is responsible for more deaths on U.S. soil than jihadist terrorism since 9/11,\" the Soufan Center, a New York-based global security think tank, noted in a recent report.\n\nIn May last year, Assistant Director for Counterterrorism Michael McGarrity testified before Congress that of the FBI's 850 open domestic terrorism cases a \"significant majority\" were related to white supremacist extremists.\n\nAnd according to a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, right-wing extremists were responsible for more than 76% of terrorist attacks and plots in the U.S. in 2019; 90% in the first half of 2020.\n\nThe Soufan Center says many of these extremists maintain strong transnational links to like-minded organizations and individuals all over the world from Australia to South Africa. But Russia and Ukraine, in particular, have emerged as a \"hub in the broader network\" where the leaders of American white extremist groups have traveled to learn recruitment, financing and propaganda techniques that in many cases imitate the \"tactics, techniques and procedures of groups like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.\"\n\nIn 2018, several members of the Southern California-based Rise Above Movement (RAM) traveled to Germany, Italy and Ukraine to meet with members of white supremacy groups, according to an affidavit and criminal complaint against Robert Paul Rundo – RAM's founder – and three other members of the group unsealed by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe complaint charged Rundo and his associates with inciting and conspiring to commit violence in connection with several rallies, including the August 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that led to the death of protester Heather Heyer. Three RAM members were later given prison sentences for their part in conspiracies to riot at the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, and other alleged political rallies in California.\n\nHate crimes:Avowed neo-Nazi James Fields sentenced to life in prison\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden said in late April last year that he decided in part to declare his candidacy for the Democratic nomination and presidency after hearing President Donald Trump say of the rally in Charlottesville that there were \"very fine people on both sides.\" Trump later said he was quoted out of context. However, far-right groups such as the all-male Proud Boys have expressed admiration for Trump and the president has appeared inconsistent in condemning right-wing extremist organizations.\n\nThese countries quietly slid into authoritarianism: Should the US be concerned?\n\nThe SPLC and reporting from news outlets such as ProPublica and Britain's The Guardian have established that Nazzaro is 47-years-old, attended Villanova University and owns land in a remote corner of Washington state. He says he served in the U.S. military in Afghanistan and claims to have worked for American intelligence agencies as a contractor. At one point, he owned a security company registered in New York City.\n\nNazzaro left the U.S. in late 2017 when he moved with his Russian wife and family to St. Petersburg, Russia. The Guardian has reported that the FBI is scrutinizing any links between Russian intelligence or its proxies and Nazzaro. It is believed he is originally from New Jersey.\n\nNew Jersey's Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness said in a statement that The Base will in 2020 \"likely attempt to recruit new members in the region, rely on members with military expertise and training, and use intimidation tactics to terrorize its victims and spread its white supremacist ideology.\"\n\nGeraldine Moriba, a producer of law center's podcast, notes in the series that The Base's members and potential recruits who feature in the recordings \"claim to live in 26 different states and participate in small, two-or-three person cells in every quadrant of America. An additional eight countries were represented on these calls.\"\n\nBut Cassie Miller, an SPLC analyst on extremism who is featured in the series, said that while Nazzaro appears at pains to make potential recruits believe the group is a \"highly sophisticated terror network\" with \"strict internal discipline\" and vetting methods, the opposite may be true. \"They accepted almost everyone who applied,\" she said.\n\nMembers of the public can report suspected terrorists to the FBI at tips.fbi.gov or 1-800-CALLFBI (225-5324).", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/04/26/pro-palestinian-protests-college-columbia-usc-ut-austin/73465781007/", "title": "More arrests Saturday as pro-Palestinian protests embroil US colleges", "text": "NEW YORK − After more colleges joined in the coast-to-coast protest fray over Israel's war in Gaza this week, protesters were pressing on Saturday in the face of some university leaders cracking down on demonstrations with armed police.\n\nWhile Columbia University has been the epicenter of student protests for over a week, on Saturday police arrested students and protesters at college campuses in Massachusetts, Arizona and Indiana.\n\nHundreds of students have set up encampments from California to Massachusetts, leading to a national debate over free speech on college campuses as some Jewish students and administrators say the demonstrations have at times been sites of antisemitism.\n\nThe protesters have called on universities to cut financial ties to Israel and Israeli companies, especially those benefiting from the ongoing war in Gaza. While the demonstrations have not led to any divestments, the week of protests have had broad impacts, forcing classes to move online and disrupting graduation plans.\n\nOn Thursday, law enforcement in riot gear broke up a peaceful demonstration at the University of Ohio. Arrests also occurred the same day at Indiana University and the University of Minnesota.\n\nThe dayslong demonstrations have centered on the war in Gaza that was triggered by Hamas' incursion into southern Israel on Oct. 7, when about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and more than 240 people were taken hostage. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas and the resulting bombardment and ground assault has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, leveled large swaths of Gaza and caused a humanitarian crisis that's left the population on the brink of starvation.\n\nReporter's Notebook:There's been campus protests overseas. They've flown under the radar\n\nArrests continue into the weekend in multiple states\n\nIn the early morning hours on Arizona State University's campus, police arrested 69 people on trespassing charges after protesters refused to leave encampments, the school said.\n\nAlso on Saturday morning, police cleared out an encampment at Northeastern University in Boston. About 100 people were detained, and those with student IDs were released and will face disciplinary action, university spokesperson Renata Nyul said in an emailed statement.\n\nLater Saturday, Northeastern's campus was back to normal, with admissions tours taking place and students posing for graduation photos, the school said in an emailed statement. At other Boston area schools, encampments continued through the day.\n\nAnd at Indiana University in Bloomington, another 23 protesters were arrested Saturday by police in riot gear, the Indiana Daily Student reported. Police also dismantled tents, poured out water and took food from the encampment, according to the paper. The action came after the school announced a policy change banning temporary structures without prior approval earlier this week.\n\nMIT president says protests must end soon\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology officials had been in talks with protesters who have set up camp, but the students made clear they would not accept less than their full demands, which include cutting research funding ties with Israel's military, university President Sally Kornbluth said in a statement Saturday.\n\nIn a video statement, Kornbluth said administrators had thus far chosen not to interfere with the protests despite violation of school rules about reserving space to demonstrate. The protests at MIT have been peaceful, she said, though campus police have been present at all times.\n\nHowever, Kornbluth said, \"this particular form of expression needs to end soon.\"\n\nKornbluth said the encampments are a \"magnet\" to outside agitators, are violating campus rules and are taking away resources and staff hours from other campus functions.\n\n\"Rules have already been broken.

The complaint alleges harassment, death threats, doxing, stereotyping and unequal treatment by Columbia administrators, including President Minouche Shafik.\n\nMaryam Alwan, one of the complainants, told USA TODAY the harassment – both online and in person – has impeded her academic progress. She has to delay her graduation a year, she said.\n\nThe university did not provide comment to USA TODAY on the complaint.\n\n“I’m unable to focus on my classes anymore,” Alwan said. “The narrative is that the protests are extremely harassing and discriminatory when in reality the only discrimination that I’ve faced has been at the protest by counter-protesters.”\n\nPalestine Legal is also asking the DOE to investigate Columbia’s decision to allow “NYPD officers in riot gear — for the first time in decades — to arrest over a hundred students peacefully protesting Israel’s genocide last week.” The OCR does not comment on pending investigations, an Education Department spokesperson told USA TODAY.\n\nAlwan says she hopes for “deep institutional changes,” including mandatory training about anti-Palestinian discrimination, protections for academic freedom to teach about Palestinian history and “equal treatment across the board.”\n\n− Clare Mulroy\n\nACLU to US university leaders: Don't sacrifice free speech\n\nThe ACLU sent an open letter Friday evening to American public and private universities urging them to protect free speech and academic freedom. The letter came in response to anti-war protests across the U.S. that have resulted in “disturbing arrests,” according to a news release from the civil rights organization.\n\n“As you fashion responses to the activism of your students (and faculty and staff), it is essential that you not sacrifice principles of academic freedom and free speech that are core to the educational mission of your respected institution,” said the letter, authored by ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero and David Cole, the national legal director.\n\nACLU recommended guardrails to ensure this, such as not singling out particular viewpoints for censorship. Students should be protected from targeted discriminatory harassment, but institutions “may not penalize students for taking sides on the war in Gaza, even if expressed in deeply offensive terms,” the letter said.\n\nThe letter said students should have ample room to express themselves even as schools announce and enforce reasonable content-neutral protest policies and armed police on campus should be a measure of last resort. ACLU added, \"Schools must resist the pressures placed on them by politicians seeking to exploit campus tensions.”\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nChicago students call for disbanding of campus police\n\nOne day after students at Northwestern University set up an encampment, other Chicago-area universities joined in. At the University of Chicago where students demanded the school disband its private police force alongside demands of breaking with Israeli institutions.\n\nOver 200 students joined in the march at the campus on Chicago’s South Side, according to local media reports. Chief among their demands was the disbandment of the university’s police force, which is reported to be among the largest private police forces in the city.\n\nA university spokesperson reported no arrests at the South Side protest and did not comment on the group’s demands.\n\nIn downtown Chicago, students from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Columbia College Chicago and Roosevelt University also protested, marching along Michigan Avenue before police ushered them into Millennium Park, as seen in videos shared on social media by attendees.\n\nStudents at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the central part of the state set up an encampment on campus as well, according to videos shared on social media that showed dozens of students camped out and about a dozen tents.\n\nCampus police attempted to break up the encampment and arrested one person Friday, according to student media.

Tents stood for around four hours before being taken down at the request of university administration.\n\nOrganizers at the school, one of the most prestigious public universities in the country, say UNC’s place in the South is an important part of the national movement pushing for university divestiture from Israel.\n\n“It feels exhilarating and inspiring,” Slyvie Tudor, a graduate student with UNC Students for Justice in Palestine, told USA TODAY. “It has to start somewhere, and I think it’s really meaningful that we’re at a public university in the South,” Tudor said, referencing how North Carolina’s Republican-controlled state legislature makes decisions impacting the university.\n\nOn Friday, professors, town residents and students gathered beneath a canopy of tall, leafy trees and amid pops of bright orange and blue camping gear as protest leaders made announcements on bullhorns.\n\nMuslim students prayed and organizers took down tent poles at around 1:30 p.m., laying the gear flat on the ground in response to university requests to take down tent structures.

He said he visits Chapel Hill every year during the Passover holiday.\n\nAt times, the small group, comprising around a dozen men, women and children, exchanged chants with the more than 100 pro-Palestinian student encampment protesters.\n\n“When one group, especially a minority, feels targeted, we’re here for them, we’re their Jewish brothers,” Cohen said, pointing to one onlooker, whom he said was visibly Jewish, who was being followed around by pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nThe onlooker encircled the pro-Palestinian tent encampment on foot for nearly 20 minutes Friday afternoon, filming while students from the encampment tried to block his phone camera.

On Friday, a group of demonstrators milled around outside holding signs as some students sat inside among the scattered tents reading and talking.\n\nStudents outside declined to speak with the press, referring instead to a press statement on the FIT Students for Justice in Palestine Instagram which lists their demands. The demands include the FIT Foundation, SUNY and Suny Research Foundation committing to financial transparency and President Joyce Brown and SUNY Chancellor John King making a public statement acknowledging genocide in Gaza.\n\nUntil demands are met demonstrators plan to hold their ground in what signs are dubbing the \"liberated zone\" and \"The People's Museum: FIT Gaza Solidarity Encampment.\"\n\n− Anna Kaufman\n\nArizona State University encampment doused by sprinklers\n\nArizona State University police said three people were arrested Friday morning as dozens of Pro-Palestinian student protesters set up tents on the campus and called for an official statement from the university condemning the violence in Gaza.\n\nSprinklers around the protesters were turned on after the first round of arrests, leading some in the crowd to use buckets and tarps to block the flow of water. Campus police said it did not know who set off the sprinklers.\n\nAs the crowd of demonstrators swelled to around 100, the group was eventually able to build back its encampment.\n\nThe Ybarra Maldonado Law Group is seeking to represent those arrested on Friday. Attorney Ray Ybarra Maldonado told The Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, he is concerned the protesters’ First Amendment rights and right to due process were violated when police arrested demonstrators within the first twenty minutes of the demonstration.\n\n− Helen Rummel, Arizona Republic\n\nPolice: 36 protesters arrested Thursday night at Ohio State University\n\nDozens of people were arrested Thursday night at Ohio State University when police disbanded an encampment that had been set up outside the student union.\n\nPolice records show that 36 people were arrested starting at 10:16 p.m. Thursday and charged with criminal trespassing, a fourth-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail or a $250 fine, reported the Columbus Dispatch, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nAmong the 36 arrested, only 15 were current undergraduate or graduate students at Ohio State, according to a check done of the university's online directory. The protesters were released on their own recognizance − without having to pay any bond amount − and are scheduled to have their first appearances in Franklin County Municipal Court early next week.\n\nVideos showed scuffles in which police in riot gear took protesters to the ground as onlookers screamed for help. Skyler Goody, 21, an OSU junior, said she and her roommate were nearly arrested as she helped form a circle around the encampments.\n\n\"People of Columbus, look at how your cops treat people,\" Goody said. \"I don't know what the students were doing that warranted riot gear and pushing people over while they're praying.\"\n\n− Shahid Meighan and Cole Behrens, Columbus Dispatch\n\nRevolving demonstrations outside gates of Columbia University\n\nAs Columbia’s encampment quietly hummed on a sunny Friday morning, just outside campus gates, revolving protests were taking place.\n\nFirst hundreds gathered in a pro-Israel demonstration, waving Israeli flags and holding images of hostages taken by Hamas and other militants in the Oct. 7 attacks, chanting “Bring them home now! Alive!” New York City police, donning helmets and batons, stood behind barricades as the rally concluded peacefully.\n\n“There are people that support Israel, that believe Israel has the right to exist,” said retired educator Lois Stavsky, 76, a self-described “left-wing Zionist” who had returned after three months in Israel and Europe because she “didn’t like the vibes” in New York, home to the world’s largest Jewish population outside of Tel Aviv. She saw the student encampment as “mindless,” she said. “I think they’re naive. I don’t hate them. I kind of feel sorry for that mob mentality.”\n\nSoon after, the space was occupied by a large group of Hasidic Jews, who were holding signs reading \"All Palestine must be returned to Palestinian Sovereignty\" and \"Judaism Rejects Zionism.\" They could be heard chanting \"one, two, three, four, Zionism no more. Five, six, seven, eight, stop the killing, stop the hate.\"\n\nCharges dropped against 57 protesters arrested at University of Texas\n\nAll charges have been dropped against the 57 people arrested in connection with the Wednesday pro-Palestinian protest at the University of Texas.\n\nThe Travis County attorney's office said all 57 arrests, which were all criminal trespassing charges, lacked probable cause. County Attorney Delia Garza, whose office handles misdemeanor cases, told the American-Statesman, part of the USA TODAY Network, on Thursday that her office agreed with defense lawyers that there were \"deficiencies\" with the probable cause arrest affidavits.\n\nWhile state police with the Texas Department of Public Safety and officers with the Austin Police Department were seen handcuffing people at Wednesday's protest, all 57 arrests were technically by the University of Texas Police Department. This means university police filled out each of the 57 probable cause affidavits.\n\nNouha Ezouhri, an attorney with the Travis County public defender's office, helped file jail release forms for those arrested at the protest. She told the American-Statesman on Thursday that it looked like university police \"copied and pasted\" each probable cause affidavit for every person arrested.\n\n\"That's not how it's supposed to be,\" Ezouhri said.\n\n− Skye Seipp, Austin American-Statesman\n\nPolice stand guard at George Washington University encampment\n\nAt the entrance of a cordoned off yard at George Washington University in the nation's capital, a statue of George Washington was draped with a Palestinian flag. The statue was surrounded by dozens of tents where students had camped out overnight. Police stood guard.\n\nFor hours, protesters chanted “Up, up with liberation. Down, down with occupation” and “The people united will never be defeated.” The sidewalk was covered with messages written in chalk, including: “Fund education not decimation.”\n\nSome protesters came from nearby universities, including American University and Georgetown University, and others from communities in the metropolitan area.\n\n“We're here first and foremost for Palestine,\" said Yasin Shami, who is part of the Palestinian Youth Movement. “We will not leave until our demands are met.\"\n\nShami said he and others want the university to disclose how it is spending money and who it partners with and reverse disciplinary actions against students participating in pro-Palestine protests.\n\nSome counter protesters yelled, “You all are terrorist supporters.”\n\nAnother person in the crowd waving an Israeli flag shouted, “Bring them home.”\n\n− Deborah Barry\n\nUT president asked for state law enforcement help with protest\n\nUniversity of Texas President Jay Hartzell told a state lawmaker that he and other officials sought law enforcement help from the state leading up to a large pro-Palestinian protest Wednesday that led to more than 50 arrests because “our police force couldn’t do it alone,” according to text messages obtained by the Austin American-Statesman, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nIn response to message from state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt, D-Austin, asking about the heavy law enforcement presence at the University of Texas at Austin, Hartzell said, “We asked for help, Senator. They indicated their desire to mimic what happened at Columbia and elsewhere, which we are doing our best to avoid for obvious reasons.\"\n\n“I can’t speak to the other campuses, but this group is a chapter of a national organization that has done this elsewhere. They clearly intended to break our protest rules, despite our statements to them that we couldn’t allow them to do so. I wish we weren’t in this situation.”\n\nThe campus protest on Wednesday was planned by the Palestine Solidarity Committee, a registered student group. Republican pundits and politicians hailed the heavy law enforcement response, while multiple faculty members and students have called for Hartzell to resign. Members of the UT chapter of the American Association of University Professors also began collecting signatures for a letter stating faculty members have \"no confidence\" in Hartzell on Thursday afternoon.\n\n−Tony Plohetski and Bayliss Wagner, Austin American-Statesman\n\nTrump weighs in on college protests, calling them 'tremendous hate'\n\nDonald Trump on Thursday described the ongoing protests and unrest at college campuses across the U.S. as \"tremendous hate\" and placed the blame at the feet of his opponent in the upcoming presidential election, Joe Biden.\n\n\"This is tremendous hate and we have a man that can’t talk about it because he doesn’t understand it,\" Trump said following the day’s testimony in his hush money trial in New York. \"He doesn’t understand what’s going on with our country.\"\n\nTrump's comment's follow statements from several Republican members of Congress who accused university administrators of allowing harassment toward Jewish students − allegations which led to the ousting of the president's of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n“It's detestable. As Columbia has allowed these lawless agitators and radicals to take over, the virus of antisemitism has spread across other campus,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday during a visit to the Columbia campus. “Anti-Israel encampments are popping up in universities all across this country. The madness has to stop.”\n\nColumbia students frustrated with politicians' response\n\nJonathan Ben-Menachem, a PhD student with the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group, told reporters that the students “encourage all politicians to take the time to understand what is happening in Gaza and at universities around the country.”\n\n“Mike Johnson parachuted in here with no regard for the actual safety of Jewish students,” Ben-Menachem said Friday.\n\n“White supremacists have been invigorated by our encampments because they see that we are a multiracial coalition composed of primarily Black, brown and Jewish students – everything that they hate.\"\n\nStudents also expressed frustration when asked how they respond to accusations that they support Hamas. “Hamas backed these protests at Columbia,” Johnson tweeted Thursday.\n\n“We find that question deeply racist,” said Sherif Ibrahim, a graduate student with CUAD. “We want to say that we are here for Palestinian liberation and to label us as Hamas supporters is deeply problematic. Students are here because they want an end to a genocide.”\n\n− Clare Mulroy\n\nMore student encampments form at New York City schools\n\nOn Friday, the antiwar encampment at the City College of New York entered its second day with about three dozen tents visible at the center of its West Harlem campus.\n\nOn a flagpole with the American flag, people added a Palestinian flag. Signs in support of the City University of New York public school system divesting from Israel were at the base of the flagpole. Inside the encampment, a few people served coffee, water and food.\n\nOn Thursday, when the encampment at CUNY first formed, campus public safety attempted to enter the space but were forced out. City College is a public school part of the CUNY system and its campus is largely open. Demonstrators at the Fashion Institute of Technology, a public school part of the State University of New York system, also formed an encampment protesting the war at its Manhattan campus.\n\nNYU's Manhattan Campus settled into a relative calm Friday afternoon after several days of protests. Gould Plaza, the courtyard in front of the Stern School of Business where student demonstrators clashed with police earlier in the week was completely walled off with school security guards sitting nearby.Keana Nelson, a 24-year-old graduate student studying social work, expressed disappointment over the school's response to the protests. \"In the past, like, during the Vietnam war when students were protesting, law enforcement used to subdue the protests and we saw how negatively that went,\" she said. \"So it's like now we're doing it again, we haven't even learned.\"\n\nCity College of New York begins negotiations with student protesters\n\nThe student encampment at the City College of New York began negotiations Friday afternoon with the public school’s administration.\n\nStudents are demanding CUNY divest from all companies profiting from weapons, surveillance and construction Israel is using against Palestinians, a boycott of all academic trips to Israel, including birthright and the Fulbright program, while affirming Palestine’s right to national liberation and right of return to Palestinians.\n\nThey also seek the removal of the NYPD from CUNY campuses, in addition to ending collaboration with Reserve Officers' Training Corps and federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security. The last demand includes restoring free tuition at CUNY, which has undergraduate tuition for New York state residents at $7,000 per year.\n\nOrganizers declined to comment before negotiations. Jay Mwamba, a CUNY spokesperson, said the administration had no comment “except to reiterate that for the students, faculty and staff across our campus, our most important goal is the safety of our entire campus community.”\n\nCUNY faculty and staff held a picket in support of the encampment. The university system’s Professional Staff Congress, the union representing faculty and staff, issued a statement against police arresting protesters.\n\nCity College is currently on spring break until classes resume on Wednesday.\n\n“This is sort of, in no uncertain terms, a labor issue, the repression of free speech, of academic freedom,” said graduate student Zoe Hu, the chapter president for CUNY’s Graduate Center, in midtown Manhattan. “On top of that, Israel has destroyed all of the universities in Gaza. It has wiped out an entire educational system.”\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nImprisoned political activist, journalist speaks to student encampment by speakerphone\n\nIncarcerated political activist and journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal told USA TODAY he supports “anti-imperialist” student encampments spreading across the country to protest the war in Gaza. He has been in prison for over 40 years after being convicted for the 1981 murder of a Philadelphia police officer. Abu-Jamal's death sentence was overturned by a federal court. He has maintained his innocence.\n\nToday’s activism on college campuses reminds 70-year-old Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther, of his youth during protests against the war in Vietnam and the civil rights movement for Black Americans, he said in a brief phone call from Mahanoy state prison in Pennsylvania. He compared the protests to people once holding up lighters at concerts. Today, people tend to use cell phones.\n\n“These are flickers of light in an anti-imperialist movement,” he said. “It’s remarkable to see.”\n\nAbu-Jamal was set to speak Friday afternoon to the City College of New York student encampment in West Harlem, but Muslim students were in prayer on the campus lawn, so his call would be rescheduled for the evening. On Thursday, he spoke to Columbia University's student encampment via speakerphone. A microphone amplified his voice.\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nNegotiations at Columbia University at an impasse\n\nColumbia University students and negotiators with the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group spoke to reporters Friday about the ongoing negotiations between the university and students in the encampment. They said they have made some progress in terms of their financial disclosure demands but not with divesting from financially and academically in Israel, the group’s main demand.\n\nColumbia President Minouche Shafik previously warned students that if the tents aren't moved by Friday, \"we will have to consider options for restoring calm to campus.\"\n\nNegotiators said they spent 11 hours yesterday and an hour today at the negotiating table. Now they say they are at an impasse.\n\nThe students said it is in their best interest to reach an agreement before commencement, which is scheduled for May 15. They also said they were met with an increased “unwillingness” to understand CUAD’s core demands.\n\n“Columbia has asked students to operate within the confined of bureaucratic red tape with no assurances of binding divestment decisions if we end the encampment,” said student negotiator Sueda Polat.\n\n“The university seems to believe students cannot maintain their resolve regarding staying on this lawn, ignoring the reality that over the past 10 days, we have demonstrated how committed we are, how high our resolve is and how truly we wish from the heart for complete divestment and boycott. They believe that they can outstand us, we tell them that we cannot.”\n\n− Clare Mulroy\n\nThe protests' impacts on classes, graduation\n\nOver the past two weeks, the large demonstrations have led university administrators to adopt new policies to deal with the protests while others have been forced to restructure class schedules and graduation ceremonies.\n\nIndiana University Bloomington this week changed its longtime policy regarding \"temporary structures\" saying students now needed prior approval from the university to set up tents on the campus' main lawn, according to the Indiana Daily Student. Northwestern University in Illinois abruptly banned temporary structures after hundreds of students joined in the nationwide antiwar protests on Thursday, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nAt Columbia, students were given a virtual class option for the rest of the semester after protests forced the university to cancel in-person classes on Monday.\n\nOn Thursday, USC announced it was canceling its main commencement ceremony for what it said were safety reasons. The decision came 10 days after administrators decided to bar valedictorian Asna Tabassum, who is Muslim, from delivering a commencement address.\n\nOther schools must soon decide whether to hold their commencement ceremonies as the spring semester winds down and graduation ceremonies are scheduled for the weeks ahead.\n\nContributing: Reuters; Rachel Barber, Anna Kaufman, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/14/us/buffalo-supermarket-shooting-what-we-know/index.html", "title": "What we know about the mass shooting in Buffalo and the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDetails continue to emerge about the May 14 shooting at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket and the 18-year-old who authorities say is responsible.\n\nThirteen people – 11 of whom are African American – were shot, according to city officials, who have said the massacre was racially motivated, pointing in part to racist writing purportedly by the suspect. Ten were killed, while three victims suffered non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nThe suspect – identified as Payton S. Gendron, an 18-year-old White man – surrendered to police. He pleaded not guilty to a charge of first-degree murder later that day, per Buffalo City Court Chief Judge Craig Hannah. Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said he expected to file additional charges.\n\nOn June 1, a grand jury returned a 25 count indictment against Gendron. He is facing 10 counts of first-degree murder, 10 counts of second-degree murder as a hate crime and three counts of attempted murder as a hate crime, according to court documents. Gendron is also facing a charge of domestic terror and a weapons charge, court documents state.\n\nGendron pleaded not guilty to the indictment, his attorney said in court Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting as both a hate crime and a case of racially motivated violent extremism, said Stephen Belongia, FBI special agent in charge of the Buffalo field office.\n\nFederal prosecutors are also working to bring charges against Gendron, law enforcement officials say.\n\nHere’s what we know about the shooting and the investigation.\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nWhen the suspect arrived at the Tops Friendly Markets on Jefferson Avenue about 2:30 p.m., he was “very heavily armed,” according to Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia.\n\n“He had tactical gear, he had a tactical helmet on, he had a camera that he was livestreaming what he was doing.”\n\nThe suspect first opened fire in the store’s parking lot, authorities said, shooting four people. Three of those people died, Gramaglia said.\n\nThe suspect went inside the store and began shooting customers, police said. A security guard inside the store who was a retired Buffalo police officer shot the suspect. But because the suspect wore heavy armor, the bullets did not have any effect, Gramaglia said.\n\nThe suspect shot and killed the security guard and continued working his way through the store, the commissioner said. When police arrived, the suspect put his gun to his neck but later dropped the gun and took off some of his gear, he added.\n\nHe surrendered and was transported to Buffalo police headquarters.\n\nPolice speak to bystanders after the shooting at a supermarket on May 14, 2022, in Buffalo, New York. Joshua Bessex/AP\n\nDuring his arrest, the suspectmade very disturbing statements describing his motive and state of mind following his arrest, according to an official familiar with the investigation. The alleged shooter made it known he was targeting the Black community during the statements, according to the official.\n\nWarrants are being obtained for suspect’s home, vehicle, social media platforms, computer, telephone, and any other digital technologies, Gramaglia said. The investigation shows Gendron acted on his own in the shooting, he added.\n\nWhat we know about the victims\n\nOf the 13 people shot, 11 are African American and two are White, said Gramaglia.\n\nFour were store employees, he said. Three suffered “nonfatal wounds,” he said. The fourth, security guard Aaron Salter, a retired Buffalo police lieutenant, was killed as he tried to stop the suspect. Mayor Byron Brown called him a “hero, who tried to protect people in the store, tried to save lives, and in the process, lost his own life.”\n\nPolice identified the victims, ranging in age from 20 to 85.\n\nAmong them was 62-year-old Geraldine Talley, who was shopping with her fiancé when gunfire erupted, her niece, Lakesha Chapman, said. Talley was at the front of the store, Chapman said, but her fiancé had gone to get orange juice. He escaped unharmed.\n\nChapman’s “Auntie Gerri” was always “the life of the party,” she said. “She was just a lover. I mean she didn’t meet a stranger, and that’s why this hurts so much,” said Chapman.\n\nHeyward Patterson, a 67-year-old taxi driver, was waiting for passengers outside the supermarket when he was gunned down, according to his nephew, Terrell Clark.\n\nPatterson – who loved to tell jokes and sing at church – “took pride in helping people,” Clark said. “And if the person had little or no money, he would still give them a ride. He had a big heart.”\n\nSuspect livestreamed the violence\n\nLivestreaming platform Twitch confirmed the suspect used its platform to stream a live broadcast during the attack, saying in a statement the video was removed less than two minutes after the violence began.\n\nCNN obtained a portion of the livestream showing the alleged shooter pulling up to a Tops store.\n\nThe video is recorded from the point of view of the alleged shooter as he is driving into the supermarket’s parking lot. The person is seen in the rearview mirror wearing a helmet and is heard saying, “Just got to go for it,” before he pulls into the front of the store.\n\nIn the video, store patrons can be seen walking through the parking lot as the suspect drives up.\n\nThe company was “devastated” to hear about the shooting, it said, and the user “has been indefinitely suspended from our service, and we are taking all appropriate action, including monitoring for any accounts rebroadcasting this content.”\n\nInvestigators examine document purportedly written by suspect\n\nAuthorities at the state, local and federal level continue to investigate the shooting and motive, but they have already said they believe it was racially motivated.\n\n“The evidence that we have uncovered so far makes no mistake that this is an absolute racist hate crime. It will be prosecuted as a hate crime,” Gramaglia said. “This is someone who has hate in their heart, soul and mind.”\n\nGarcia, the Erie County sheriff, similarlysaid the shooting was a “straight up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community,” describing it as “pure evil.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback National security expert explains how White supremacists are radicalized 04:04 - Source: CNN\n\nOne piece of evidence may be a 180-page document purportedly written by the suspect and posted online before the shooting. The document, independently obtained by CNN shortly after the massacre and before authorities released the name of the suspect, is allegedly written by a person claiming to be Payton Gendron confessing to the attack.\n\nThe author attributes the internet for most of his beliefs, describes himself as a fascist, a white supremacist and an anti-Semite.\n\nThe suspect allegedly says he bought ammunition for some time but did not get serious about planning the attack until January. The author also writes about his perceptions of the dwindling size of the white population and claims of ethnic and cultural replacement of whites.\n\nAlongside tirades about his false belief that White Americans were being “replaced” by people of other races, the document included pages upon pages listing the equipment and clothing he planned to wear, from military-style body armor down to the brand of his underwear.\n\nThe document also included a minute-by-minute outline of the suspect’s plan. The author drew a color-coded map of the interior of the store, laying out how he planned to “shoot all black people.” It’s unclear how closely the gunman’s attack followed the plan listed in the document.\n\nWhen asked during a news conference why authorities are calling the mass shooting a hate crime, Flynn, the district attorney, said investigators have “certain pieces of evidence” that “indicate some racial animosity.”\n\nFurther investigation also revealed Gendron made a “generalized threat” while he attended Susquehanna Valley Central High School in June 2021, Gramaglia said.\n\nThe suspect was visited last year by New York State Police after he did a high school project about murder-suicides, Garcia said.\n\nAccording to Garcia, concerns about alleged mental health issues “were brought to light” after he turned in the post-graduation project.\n\n“The state police arrived at his house at that point last year,” Garcia said. “He stayed at a facility – I’m not sure if it was a hospital or a mental health facility – for a day and a half.”\n\nThe suspect planned to continue his shooting rampage beyond the supermarket, Gramaglia told CNN, saying there was “some documentation” he allegedly planned to target “another large superstore.”\n\nSocial media posts indicate months of planning\n\nThe suspect visited the supermarket in early March and then the day before the shooting to gather information, “basically doing reconnaissance on the area,” Gramaglia said.\n\nWritings posted to social media by Gendron and analyzed by CNN reveal that the suspect visited Tops Friendly Market spent months extensively planning his attack.\n\nThe posts were originally posted to Discord and were later shared on the hate-filled online forum 4Chan.\n\nAccording to his posts, Gendron drove from his home to the Buffalo supermarket March 8.\n\nHe adds that he was pulled over on his way to Buffalo at 10:17 a.m. for speeding on State Route 36, “going 64 in a 40.”\n\nGendron writes that he went into the Tops Market three times – at 12 p.m., 2 p.m. and again at 4 p.m – and each time he details what is happening in the market. He notes how many Black and White people are present and provides a hand-drawn map of the market with marked aisles and exit points.\n\nDuring his last visit to the supermarket at 4 p.m., Gendron says he is approached by a “Black armed security guard” who asked him what he is doing going in and out of the store. The suspect says he told the security guard that he was collecting “consensus data,” for which the security guard said he needed to talk to the manager.\n\n“I asked for his name and he told me and I instantly forgot, then I said bye and thanks and walked back to my car,” Gendron writes. “In hindsight that was a close call.”\n\nIn a March 10 post, Gendron writes, “I’m going to have to kill that security guard at Tops I hope he doesn’t kill me or even hurt me instantly.”\n\nThe shooter writes that he planned his attack for March 15 but then delays the date several times.\n\nGendron cites online research in choosing Buffalo as his site of attack, saying that the 14208 zip code in Buffalo has a higher Black population than the other locations he was considering. He also says he considered attacking a church or an elementary school, but chose the market because of how many people frequent grocery stores.\n\nHe refers to the Google popular times graph for Tops Friendly Market in determining the time of his attack when the store would be the busiest.\n\nSuspect was radicalized by message boards\n\nIn the document, the suspect allegedly detailed how he had been radicalized by reading online message boards, while describing the attack as terrorism and himself as a White supremacist.\n\nHe wrote he had “moved farther to the right” politically over the last three years.\n\nThe suspect started browsing the message board 4chan – a hotbed for racist, sexist and White nationalist content – in May 2020 “after extreme boredom” during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the document. Posts he had read on the site made him believe “the White race is dying out,” among other racist beliefs, and led him down a rabbit hole to other extremist websites, the document states.\n\nThe conspiracy theory of a “great replacement” has been a motivator of other violent attacks, experts in extremism have said. Some forms of the theory have more recently gone mainstream in conservative news outlets and politicians.\n\nOne day while browsing 4chan, the suspect allegedly saw a video clip of the gunman who killed 51 people in New Zealand at two mosques in 2019, according to the document. That livestream “started everything you see here,” the document states.\n\nIn addition to the New Zealand massacre, the suspect was allegedly inspired by other racist mass shooters, including Dylann Roof, the gunman who killed nine Black people at a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015, and the assailant who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011, according to the document.\n\nThe document includes dozens of pages of racist and anti-Semitic screeds, including some language that appears to be copied from the New Zealand shooter’s own writings.", "authors": ["Christina Maxouris Amir Vera Chuck Johnston Shimon Prokupecz", "Christina Maxouris", "Amir Vera", "Chuck Johnston", "Shimon Prokupecz"], "publish_date": "2022/05/14"}]}

Unable to speak, the former president, 99, listened from a hospital bed wheeled into the crowded church.\n\n“My darling,” the letter began.\n\nThe televised service and VIP-filled pews – three presidents, all five living first ladies – was familiar and somber, and yet marked a brief return to normalcy in today’s chaotic culture of mean-spirited memes and digital cynicism. Death and remembrance do that.\n\nIn this year’s annual “Passages,” USA TODAY’s roundup of the most notable deaths of 2023, there are lifetimes of such losses. The accomplishments of those who came before, the true “influencers” of their times, can be measured by their impact on our culture, our nation and, most importantly, on the lives of those around them. The departed leave lessons and sometimes spark smiles amid the tears.\n\nIt’s hard not to smile at the hyper-energized joy of singer Tina Turner, 83, who never did anything “nice and easy,” and influenced everyone from Janis Joplin to Beyoncé. “You have paved the way,” remembered Beyoncé, who teamed with Turner on “Proud Mary” at the Grammys in 2008. “You are strength and resilience.”\n\nDefying trends was singer Tony Bennett, 96, a kid from Queens who shortened his name from Benedetto because it had too many syllables. Through rock, disco and rap, he never gave up his embrace of the Great American Songbook. “For my money, the best singer in the business,” rival Frank Sinatra once said.\n\nTesting cultural boundaries was television producer Norman Lear, 101, whose socially aware comedies such as “All in the Family,” “Maude” and “The Jeffersons” brought issues such as racism, gay rights and abortion to prime time. You can get away with it, Lear said, “as long as you stay strong and the ratings are good.” They were.\n\nA lifetime of music and activism marked the long career of singer and actor Harry Belafonte, 96. “He lived a good life,” said former President Barack Obama. “Transforming the arts while also standing up for civil rights.”\n\nOthers like television evangelist Pat Robertson, 93, divided the nation. A self-described “happy warrior,” he drew criticisms for relentlessly targeting homosexuals, Democrats and social welfare. Nonetheless, “he transformed the Republican Party and with it American politics,” said Christian activist Ralph Reed.\n\nControversial as well was the architect of U.S. foreign policy through much of the 20th century, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, 100, who opened the path to China for President Richard Nixon but also helped prosecute and end the Vietnam War. He won a Nobel Peace Prize even as he was denounced by some as a war criminal.\n\nAnd then there were deaths that simply shocked everyone, such as amiable “Friends” actor Matthew Perry, 54, who drowned in his hot tub. “This has cut deep,” said his former co-star Jennifer Aniston. “Rest, little brother. You always made my day.”\n\nFew knew actor Andre Braugher, 61, popular star of \"Homicide\" and \"Brooklyn-Nine-Nine,\" was battling lung cancer before he died in December. \"An extraordinary actor but, more profoundly, the departure of a warm and kind soul,\" said producer Shonda Rhimes.\n\nLance Reddick, 60, popular star of \"The Wire\" and the John Wick movies, died of a stroke. \"A man of great strength and grace,\" remembered actor Wendell Pierce. \"The epitome of class.\"\n\nUnexpected too was the loss of feel-good singer Jimmy Buffett, 76, a victim of cancer. With roots in calypso and toes deep in middle-class vacation dreams, Buffett knew it was always 5 o’clock in Margaritaville. His Parrothead fans were as reliable as Deadheads or Swifties, all searching for that \"lost shaker of salt.”\n\nWith 42% of Americans born after 1980, according to the U.S. Census, to millennials and beyond, some of the departed may be simply names from the 20th century, if those generations remember them at all. But these people were all, for good or bad, shapers of what was to come.\n\nNewsmakers who made a difference\n\nProminent deaths also included the first woman on the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, 93, a conservative who cast swing votes on social issues such as abortion and affirmative action; Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 90, of California; global civil rights activist Randall Robinson, 81; military analyst Daniel Ellsberg, 92, who released the secret Pentagon Papers in 1971 about Vietnam; Bill Richardson, 75, former New Mexico governor, congressman and ambassador to the U.N.; Dr. Susan Love, 75, a surgeon and advocate for breast cancer research; and former Federal Communications Commission Chairman Newton Minow, 97, who memorably called television a “vast wasteland.”\n\nPatricia Schroeder, 82, Colorado’s first female member of Congress, ran unsuccessfully for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination; Kevin Phillips, 82, helped develop a “Southern strategy” for Republicans in the 1970s; Roslyn Pope, 84, wrote “An Appeal for Human Rights” in 1960 that helped advance the civil rights movement; María Martin, 72, was a radio pioneer and founder of \"Latino USA\"; and Samuel Wurzelbacher, 49, known as \"Joe the Plumber,\" became a favorite of conservatives in the 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nThey were the entertainment of our lives\n\nActors lost also included Ryan O’Neal, 82, star of hit films such as “Love Story,’’ which brought tears to moviegoers in 1970. “A huge part of my success was due to his generosity as my co-star,’’ said Ali MacGraw. “We remained friends ever after.”\n\nOscar-winner Alan Arkin, 89, was a reliable character actor in more than 100 films, including “Wait Until Dark” and “The In-Laws”; Richard Roundtree, 81, helped kick off Black action movies with “Shaft” in 1971; Italian movie icon Gina Lollobrigida, 95, was called “the most beautiful woman in the world”; in America, Raquel Welch, 82, softened her sex-symbol image with comic roles;

It is a must-watch film. -Mary Cadden\n\nCheck out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist\n\n2. “American Psycho”: We’ve all been feeling a little “psycho” being locked up during stay-at-home orders, but nothing compares to the serial-killing tendencies of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a wealthy New York investment banker. -Jenna Ryu\n\n3. “Athlete A\": I’m a former gymnast and a current journalist, so when those two worlds collide, I’m all in. This documentary, chronicling how the Indianapolis Star broke the story of systemic abuse at USA Gymnastics, is triumphant and gut-wrenching in equal measures. It speaks to the power of a free press and the ability of the human soul to overcome tragedy. -Alison Maxwell\n\n4. “Bad Education”: A story of school administrators embezzling from a high-achieving, Long Island, N.Y., school system doesn’t sound like the most scintillating movie pitch, but Hugh Jackman and Allison Janney create compelling, entertaining characters in HBO’s darkly comic look at the corrupting effects of the American drive for success. -Bill Keveney\n\n5. “Barry Lyndon”: A grievously underrated 1975 Stanley Kubrick masterpiece. I spent three full hours exclaiming, “Look at that depth of field!” and “It’s like a painting!” to an empty room. I am cool and all the boys like me. -Barbara VanDenburgh\n\n6. Black-and-white movies: More time at home offers a chance to revisit film classics or finally get to ones you’ve heard about but haven’t seen. My random sampler includes: “The Best Years of Our Lives” (1946), which poignantly depicts the toll war takes on the winning soldiers; “A Face in the Crowd” (1957), which offers a sharp-eyed, early look at the demagogic power of television; and Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove” (1964), a dark comedy about nuclear self-destruction famed for Peter Sellers’ three-role tour de force. -B.K.\n\n7. The “Bourne” film franchise: Matt Damon as an amnesiac spy with a devastating kill set delivers the thrills, even upon repeat watching. For a decidedly different action film set in Europe, try 1968’s “Where Eagles Dare,” an exciting if somewhat implausible World War II rescue adventure starring a fascinating duo: Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. -B.K.\n\n8. “Braveheart”: July 4th weekend felt like a good time to conquer this three-hour event of a movie, which lived up to its campy, bloody and epic reputation. -Kelly Lawler\n\n9. \"Dark Waters”: A must watch for anyone who loves a legal thriller or a movie based on a true story, about chemical contamination of a small town. -Morgan Hines\n\n10. “Disclosure”: Quarantine is an opportunity to educate oneself. The documentary, which counts Laverne Cox as an executive producer, traces transgender representation in TV and movies. -Erin Jensen\n\n11. Disney animated movies (a lot of them): After several weekend days spent in the wonderful world of Disney+, I have the following assessments: The “Frozen” music is mostly terrible, the live-action “Lady and the Tramp” is wildly underrated and we should go back to the glory days of 90-minute animated musicals like “Mulan” and “Aladdin.” - K.L.\n\n12. “Elf”: One day in lockdown, my pre-K daughter wanted to pretend it was Christmas. We decorated sugar cookies with red and green sprinkles, made Santa hats from construction paper and watched Will Ferrell prance around New York City in tights proclaiming, “The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.” -Jennifer McClellan\n\n13. “Emma”: Anya Taylor-Joy is perfectly cast as Emma, a wealthy youth with hubristic views on her matchmaking abilities. The chemistry between her and Johnny Flynn’s Mr. Knightley is undeniable and, like all great Jane Austen adaptations, peaks while they are dancing at a ball. -J.M.\n\n14. “Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga”: If there was ever a time for a feel-good movie, it is now. And that movie is “Eurovision.” Inspired by the actual Eurovision song contest, and even featuring some of its past contestants and winners. The Netflix film is a perfect balance of sweet and slapstick. Stars Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams are everything.Well, almost everything. Dan Stevens steals quite a few scenes and there is, of course, the music of Abba. I laughed, I cried, I downloaded the film’s \"Song a Long\" and have it on constant repeat. -M.C.\n\n15. “Hamilton”: Having never seen the stage production, I’d always regretted not being able to watch Daveed Diggs rap 6.5 words per second while jumping off a table during “Guns and Ships.\" On Disney+, \"Hamilton\" was as good – if not better – than I expected. But it was the little things that stood out to me while watching the filmed performance of the Broadway musical: the use of the bullet as a character, that look on Leslie Odom’s face when he defiantly sings, “I am the one thing in life I can control” during “Wait for It.\" All in all, I’m satisfied. -Jayme Deerwester\n\n16. “Her”:\" Maybe watching a 2013 movie about a man falling in love with a Siri- or Alexa-like voice wasn’t the greatest idea during the height of quarantine and lack of human connection. But also, who cares? Get yourself some catharsis and watch a movie for which Joaquin Phoenix should’ve won an Oscar. -David Oliver\n\n17. “Hitch”: I rewatched the 2005 Will Smith film during quarantine, and it remains my favorite rom-com. Enough said. -M.H.\n\n18. “Inception”: Ten years after its release, I rewatched “Inception,” a movie I had never conceptually been able to understand until now (kind of). The 2010 Christopher Nolan film, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, follows a corporate espionage plan to infiltrate the dreams of a competitor. -J.R.\n\n19. James Bond movies: About halfway through an attempt to watch all of the Bond films, I mostly resent my parents for letting me watch “Austin Powers” before showing me what inspired the parody. -K.L.\n\n20. Orson Welles films (other than \"Citizen Kane\"): If you like “Kane” (1941), often voted the greatest film of all time, don’t miss two other Welles-Joseph Cotten collaborations: as director and star in 1942’s “The Magnificent Ambersons” and as actors in 1949’s “The Third Man,” which has the added bonus of zither music! -B.K.\n\n21. “Palm Springs”: Yes, the plot is just like Bill Murray’s “Groundhog Day.” I don’t care. This winning comedy starring Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti was a treat on Hulu, after bypassing theaters. The pair had great chemistry and the movie was sweet, funny and sort of thought-provoking, too. -Gary Levin\n\n22. “Showgirls”: I don’t know what it says about me that watching 1995's “Showgirls” (streaming on HBO Max) for the first time has been a highlight of self-quarantine. I love a movie that's so bad it’s good, and this is an all-timer of the genre. -B.V.\n\n23. \"The Surrogate\": This 2020 feature debut of filmmaker Jeremy Hersh tells a thought-provoking story of a woman (Jasmine Batchelor) who agrees to carry a child for her married gay friends, only to learn the fetus has Down Syndrome. It’s a complex and emotional film that deftly explores weighty issues of race, class and ability. -Patrick Ryan\n\nTV shows\n\n24. “13 Reasons Why”: I started this show back when it first made waves years ago, but after going back to the beginning and watching all four seasons during the pandemic, I highly recommend you don’t do the same (at least not when the world is already stressful enough). This Netflix series is packed with heavy and disturbing elements, so instead of providing an interesting escape, it turns into a depressing undertaking. -Sara Moniuszko\n\n25. “Better Call Saul”: With final-season production postponed by the pandemic, you’ve got time to catch up with AMC's “Breaking Bad” prequel, which might be the best spinoff series ever. Bob Odenkirk is great in the title role, but Rhea Seehorn’s Emmy-worthy performance was the jewel of the just-concluded Season 5. -B.K.\n\n26. “Big Little Lies”: I’m embarrassed to say it took me this long to watch HBO's incredible miniseries. Although a lot of the plotlines and themes are heavy, the series provides the perfect binge option that will keep you hooked. (And the twists and turns may even help you escape from the world’s problems for a bit.) -S.M.\n\n27. “Damages’’: Glenn Close and Rose Byrne are terrific in every season of FX's legal thriller. -Dawn Gilbertson\n\n28. “Dead to Me”: The Netflix series starring Christina Applegate and Linda Cardellini will surely take you to the “Are you still watching?” screen. With twists and turns in every episode, we’re grateful they are renewing it for a third and final season. -Amy Haneline\n\n29. “A Discovery of Witches”: Witches and vampires. Good and evil. Love and hate. Supernatural power struggles and scientific discovery. This Netflix series (and book series on which it’s based) has it all (including Matthew Goode as a brooding, love-struck vampire). -J.M.\n\n30. “Dispatches From Elsewhere”: Created by Jason Segel (\"How I Met Your Mother\"), AMC's \"Elsewhere\" focuses on four diverse strangers, struggling through challenges in life, who unite to find magic in the world. It’s fantastical, surreal, mind-bending, and one of the few things that has made me smile during this dark time. -A.M.\n\n31. “Doc McStuffins”: When you become a parent, your bingeing takes a turn. But we admittedly love watching Disney Channel's confident Black doctor care for her toys even when we wish to never hear “time for a checkup, time for a checkup” ever again. -A.H.\n\n32. “Elementary”: I had always loved Sherlock Holmes-like detectives on shows like “Monk” and “Psych,” and enjoyed this CBS take on the most famous literary detective, played by Johnny Lee Miller. But the real reason I devoured all seven seasons was Lucy Liu's Watson. -K.L.\n\n33. “Expecting Amy”: Anyone who loves Amy Schumer's brand of honest comedy will enjoy this HBO Max docuseries, an unwatered-down recount of her difficult pregnancy, during which she suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, an extreme form of morning sickness, and attempted to tour and film a stand-up special. -E.J.\n\n34. “Felicity”: I adored J.J. Abrams’ college-set WB series, even if I was one of the fans who checked out after Felicity Porter’s (Keri Russell) ill-advised Season 2 haircut. Finally, I’m seeing this Felicity-Ben-Noel love triangle (Team Noel!) through to graduation. -Kim Willis\n\n35. “Five Came Back”: This documentary series on Netflix highlights the work of five Hollywood directors who, at the top of their careers, joined the U.S. military during World War II to document the many facets of the war. Modern-day directors analyze both their predecessors and the films. It's powerful on its own, and life-changing if paired with the documentary “Nazi Concentration Camps,” which shows some of the government-funded footage shot by the directors. -M.C.\n\n36. “Floor is Lava”: I started watching this Netflix competition show about an extreme version of the childhood obstacle game to be ironic, and now I can’t stop. -Hannah Yasharoff\n\n37. “Friday Night Lights”: An NBC show that I watched only sporadically the first time around, this combo of sports and soap, which followed Buzz Bissinger’s book and a movie, won me over. -G.L.\n\n38. “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” I rewatched “The Good Wife” and caught up on “The Good Fight,” and couldn’t help but fall in love all over again. Both are perfect ways to view how the world changed under both the Obama and Trump administrations, respectively – with smart writing and brilliant performances. Watching both series is like taking walks up and down a spiral staircase: Spinning around and around only to arrive somewhere new yet alarmingly familiar. -D.O.\n\n39. “The Great British Baking Show” My favorite form of comfort TV is this quaint British series full of soggy bottoms and delectable treats. I watched all the streaming seasons in the first few weeks of quarantine. -K.L.\n\n40. “Holey Moley” Come on. Sometimes, you just want to see a miniature-golf player knocked into the drink by a whirling windmill blade. If so, ABC has you covered. -B.K.\n\n41. “Jane the Virgin’’: This CW series (streaming on Netflix) has long been on my to-watch list and I loved it, even the over-the-top antics of Rogelio de la Vega (Jaime Camil). -D.G.\n\n42. “John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City”: John Mulaney’s performance in his Netflix stand-up special “Kid Gorgeous\" is as close to a perfect routine as I’ve seen. -E.J.\n\n43. “Justified”: I binge-watched six seasons of this FX gem on Hulu in less than a month, one of them in a single day. And now I desperately miss Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant) and Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins). -D.G.\n\n44. “The Last Dance”: ESPN’s 10-episode documentary (streaming on Netflix July 19) is a great retrospective about the Chicago Bulls’ six NBA championships, but it also reveals much about the players – Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Steve Kerr and others – and about sports and culture in the 1990s. -B.K.\n\n45. “Little Fires Everywhere”: If you binged “Big Little Lies” and are looking for your next drama/mystery series, look no further than Hulu's “Little Fires,” starring Kerry Washington and Reese Witherspoon. What’s even better? It’s only one season, so no long commitment required! -S.M.\n\n46. “Lovesick”: This British show (Netflix) follows Dylan (Johnny Flynn), a perpetually in-love man who tests positive for chlamydia and must contact women he’s slept with to let them know. As he revisits past flames, he reveals a backstory that has consequences for Dylan’s present, when he’s in love with his best friend (Antonia Thomas), who’s engaged to someone else. But don’t let that description fool you: The show is hilarious and its characters nuanced and compelling. -J.M.\n\n47. “Mad Men”: AMC's take on the Madison Avenue advertising world is just as intoxicating now as it was when Don Draper (Jon Hamm) and company finished their run five years ago. Aside from the obvious Mid Mod eye candy, the show’s abruptly changing 1960s culture and depiction of a business constantly on the brink of collapse feel oddly timely amid the coronavirus crisis. -K.W.\n\n48. “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”: I’ll admit, I was late to the game with bingeing this feel good, award-winning Amazon series about a 1950s housewife turned aspiring stand-up comic. But what better time to catch up on all the shows I wished I watched than during a pandemic? Cheering on Midge (Rachel Brosnahan) as she uproots her life and starts anew felt like a fitting story for a time when many people are reflecting on the world and their priorities. -Charlie Trepany\n\n49. “Medici: Masters of Florence”: I’m a sucker for any kind of historical fiction, and binged through all three seasons on Netflix during time off, which provided entertainment and a new topic of interest. I spent a good deal of time Googling and reading up on the Medici family after various episodes to compare historical sources with the show. -M.H.\n\n50. “Money Heist”: This Spanish Netflix series is excellent. I thought I wouldn’t be able to get past watching a show dubbed into English, but the plot line is so exciting (and anxiety inducing) that I don’t even notice anymore. -Rasha Ali\n\n51. “Motown Magic”: I’d like to thank the creators of this Netflix kids show for allowing me to listen to The Temptations, The Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas and Marvin Gaye while my kids watch TV. -J.M.\n\n52. “Nate Bargatze: The Tennessee Kid”: To boost my mood during the current climate, I’ve been turning to beloved stand-up specials. Bargatze’s delivery in this Netflix special makes me laugh out loud! “Olivia?” -E.J.\n\n53. “The Office”: I was a fan of the British version starring (and co-created by) Ricky Gervais, but never quite cottoned to Steve Carell’s Michael Scott. But a pandemic binge-watch of NBC's nine seasons of this series endeared me to a stellar supporting cast (and there are so many of them!) and far more nuance than the UK edition could accomplish in its measly 14 episodes. -G.L.\n\n54. “Ozark”: When your days are spent indoors, a thriller like “Ozark” can bring some much-needed excitement. My family turned this on because we’d heard it was good and thought, “Why not?” Once we started watching, we couldn’t stop. -C.T.\n\n55. “Queer Eye”: The latest season of Netflix's “Queer Eye” dropped June 5 and has provided such a pick-me-up during the pandemic. Have I imagined what the experts – Bobby Berk, Jonathan Van Ness, Karamo Brown, Tan France and Antoni Porowski – would say to help me improve my life? Absolutely! -E.J.\n\n56. “Ramy\": This Hulu series has been on my “to watch” list for far too long, and I’m so glad I finally started. Star and creator Ramy Youssef’s semi-autobiographical dramedy, which follows a millennial Muslim man in New Jersey torn between his faith and wanting to fit in with American culture, is fun to watch and unlike anything else on TV right now. -H.Y.\n\n57. “Reconstruction: America After the Civil War”: As an alternative to cable news shows fixated on the controversy of the moment, often with little context, try history. PBS’ four-hour 2019 documentary from Henry Louis Gates is a great starting point to learn more about the history of racism, voter suppression and other topics that are just as relevant today. -B.K.\n\n58. “Say I Do\": So maybe you’re ready to release with a good cry? The couples featured in Netflix's “Say I Do” (and their devotion to each other) will have you bawling – in the best way. Each receive the wedding of their dreams with help from interior designer Jeremiah Brent, fashion designer Thai Nguyen and chef Gabriele Bertaccini. -E.J.\n\n59. “Schitt’s Creek”: This six-season Pop TV comedy (now on Netflix) is a riches-to-rags delight that has heart, charm and so many witty and quotable one-liners. Watching the Rose family navigate going from bazillionaires to living in a small town they once purchased as a joke was the perfect mindless diversion. As Alexis frequently said, “love that journey for me.” -A.M.\n\n60. \"Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker\": If quarantine has left you feeling less than motivated, this Netflix period drama chronicling the story of Madam C.J. Walker, whose fierce determination made her the first African American self-made millionaire, might just be the kick in the pants that you need. -A.H.\n\n61. “Snowpiercer”: Sure, the 2013 Bong Joon-ho sci-fi movie about class struggle was awesome, but TNT's new remake gives us Daveed Diggs as the world’s coolest post-apocalyptic homicide detective on a 1,001-car train bound for nowhere. -Brian Truitt\n\n62. “The Sopranos”: In the time it took Meadow Soprano to parallel park in the divisive series finale, I binge-watched David Chase's HBO mob masterpiece and am already itching to start it again. It's a funny, tear-jerking and often surreal exploration of family in a moral gray area, and Edie Falco as Carmela Soprano is the GOAT. -P.R.\n\n63. “Supernatural”: Worried that I was running through too many TV shows in quarantine, I came up with a solution: Watch one really, really long series. There are 15 seasons of CW’s (and formerly WB's) mystical drama (minus a few episodes in the final season yet to shoot because of the pandemic), and the brotherly ghost fighting has been more than satisfying. Bonus: I’m only nine seasons in. -K.L.\n\n64. “Treme\": Revolving around a national emergency, racial tensions and police corruption, David Simon's HBO series set in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina couldn’t feel more on-point right now. The show’s exhilarating, authentic music and conspicuously great food are pretty good coping mechanisms for COVID-19, too. -K.W.\n\n65. “Unorthodox”: I needed to be immersed in a TV show to distract myself from the increasingly tragic news about the pandemic, and this four-episode Netflix series, about a woman who escapes an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, certainly sucked me in. -K.L.\n\n66. “Upload”: This new Amazon comedy from Greg Daniels (“The Office”) offers a funny, insightful take on the benefits and dangers of technology as the consciousness of a dead man (Robbie Amell) is moved to a digitally created virtual afterlife. The complicated relationship forged with the very alive tech worker assigned to manage his afterlife (Andy Allo) is poignant and funny. -B.K.\n\n67. “We’re Here”: In this HBO series, three former competitors on “RuPaul's Drag Race” – Shangela Laquifa Wadley, Bob the Drag Queen and Eureka O’Hara – transform residents of small towns for a drag show, which (spoiler alert!) typically helps ignite an internal makeover as well. -E.J.\n\n68. “Yellowstone”: This popular Paramount Network drama has something for fans of Westerns and Kevin Costner. But what it really offers to viewers stuck at home is the most marvelous Big Sky, wide-open scenery, vistas of mountains and fields and streams from location shooting in the Rocky Mountain states. -B.K.\n\nBooks\n\n69. “And Then There Were None” by Agatha Christie: I had never read any of Christie’s classics, so I started with this one, which tops many best-of lists. It did not disappoint. The tale reads like a game of “Survivor” as visitors lured to an island die one by one. The twist at the end is worth the wait. -A.M.\n\n70. The Charlotte Holmes series by Brittany Cavallaro: The four mystery-filled novels center on teenagers John Watson and Charlotte Holmes, whose great-great-great grandfathers were quite the crime-solving duo. The kids are a formidable pair in that same vein, too, though they also have to navigate their own complicated family legacies and feelings about each other. -B.T.\n\n71. “The Cruel Prince” by Holly Black: I love young adult fantasy fiction, and Black has a compelling series about fairies, politics and finding your place in the world, starting with this novel, which I read in a single day. -K.L.\n\n72. “Death in Her Hands” by Ottessa Moshfegh: After thoroughly enjoying the emotion, humor and writing style of “My Year of Rest and Relaxation,” I couldn’t wait for Moshfegh’s next book. Unfortunately, the story is a bit of a snoozefest, and Moshfegh gets a little too caught up in the inner workings of the protagonist’s mind. -A.M.\n\n73. “Ex Machina” by Brian K. Vaughan and Tony Harris: Not the slick sci-fi movie but the even better 50-issue comic-book series that marries “The West Wing” and superheroes. The mayor of New York City is a former masked vigilante who balances running the Big Apple with dealing with supervillains and interdimensional threats. -B.T.\n\n74. “The Fire Next Time” by James Baldwin: Esteemed writer Baldwin's book is split into two: The first part, a letter to his nephew about the history of race in America; the second, an essay on his experiences with religion and race. Baldwin's writing is beautiful and striking, and his prose will stick with you long after you reach the final page. -H.Y.\n\n75. “Fleishman Is in Trouble” by Taffy Brodesser-Akner: This was the first title that my quarantine book club read, and it proved a fruitful discussion starter. Conversation ranged from how much being a woman/man is part of one’s identity to whether it’s OK to grow together and apart in relationships. Much wine was happily consumed. -Carly Mallenbaum\n\n76. “Florence Adler Swims Forever” by Rachel Beanland: I reviewed this book and it was the first that entirely held my attention. I was so enthralled by the plot that I woke up thinking about it at 3 a.m. after the first afternoon of reading. -M.H.\n\n77. “Followers” by Megan Angelo: I came for the interesting premise of two women trying to game the social media influencer system; I stayed for the nail-biting commentary about the dangers of internet usage and the downsides to celebrity culture. -H.Y.\n\n78. “Hard Times: An Oral History of the Great Depression” by Studs Terkel: The current economic climate is stressful and I thought I might read up on a similar time – the Great Depression. I have heard stories from my parents, who were born into the Depression. They have passed, but I found a great deal of additional perspective from the late author and historian Terkel, who compiled a book of experiences from a cross section of people, both socially and economically diverse, who lived through that dramatic period of history. -M.C.\n\n79. “How to Make a Plant Love You” by Summer Rayne Oakes: To supplement my quarantine gardening hobby, I picked up this highly recommended book on plant parenthood. More than a guide on how to not kill plants, the book ponders our relationship with nature, something I’ve been thinking about a lot from the confines of my apartment. -K.L.\n\n80. “Know My Name” by Chanel Miller: Miller, the survivor in the Brock Turner rape case formerly known as Emily Doe, tells her empowering story about reclaiming her name and healing after surviving sexual assault. -J.R.\n\n81. “Learn to Lucid Dream” by Dr. Kristen LaMarca: The internet has endless resources on how to lucid dream (should you be as interested as I am on the topic), but LaMarca’s book efficiently condenses all of the most effective practices into one book. So far, I’ve had two lucid dreams! -C.M.\n\n82. “A Little Life” by Hanya Yanagihara: Who knew someone could write 800+ pages of torture and never let up? A trigger warning disguised as a novel, this disturbing work is full of unrelenting trauma. I will discuss this book with you if you read it, for sure, but I can’t in good faith recommend it. To anyone. -D.O.\n\n83. “The Long Call” by Ann Cleeves: In the North Devon-set novel, Detective Matthew Venn investigates a murder that hits close to home: One that could possibly involve the church community he turned his back on years ago or his beloved husband, with whom he has made a new life. A serious page-turner that keeps you guessing. -M.C.\n\n84. “A Man Called Ove’’ by Fredrik Backman: I haven’t stopped recommending this beautiful book about a curmudgeon and his outgoing neighbors. -D.G.\n\n85. “Normal People” and “Conversations With Friends” by Sally Rooney: After binge-watching and falling in love with Hulu's “Normal People,” I went back to read the source material. I didn’t think I could love it more than the series, but I did. That prompted me to read Rooney’s earlier hit, “Friends,” which Hulu is also developing into a series. Book or series, Rooney’s meditations on the messiness of love will hook you. -A.M.\n\n86. “Red, White and Royal Blue” by Casey McQuiston: The queer romantic comedy novel I wish I had as a kid. The president’s son and the Queen of England’s grandson falling (literally) into a forbidden romance? Don’t walk – run – to read this. Surprisingly steamy to boot. -D.O.\n\n87. “The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company” by Robert Iger: I’m a Disney junkie, so I jump at the chance to learn about anything behind the scenes from the House of Mouse. In addition to providing an interesting look into Disney’s relationship with Pixar, Marvel and more, it has some great insight about how one of the world’s most recognizable CEOs got to where he is today. -H.Y.\n\n88. Ruth Ware’s books: Ware is the contemporary queen of the psychological crime thriller. Here’s my ranking of the books from best to great: “The Death of Mrs. Westaway,” “The Lying Game,” “The Turn of the Key,” “The Woman in Cabin 10,” “In a Dark, Dark Wood.” -A.M.\n\n89. “So You Want to Talk About Race” byIjeoma Oluo: Oluo’s book was written for many types of people, including white people working toward becoming effective allies. For that group, I can say that it’s an educational gift. -C.M.\n\n90. “War and Peace” by Leo Tolstoy: OK, so I still have 300 pages left, but I’m in the home stretch of this massive Russian tome. I plucked my dusty, unread copy off the shelf back in March, so when people asked what I did during the great plague of 2020, I could say I read “War and Peace.” -B.V.\n\nMusic\n\n91. “Chromatica” by Lady Gaga: This high-energy pop album was probably meant to be blasted at crowded clubs rather than in my living room with just me and my dog, but I’ll take my dance parties where I can get them. -C.T.\n\n92. “Dear Evan Hansen Original Broadway Cast Recording”: The soft pop score of this Tony-winning musical, with vocals from the great Ben Platt, helped get me into a work-from-home groove, unseating other Broadway cast albums in my recently played feed on Spotify. -K.L.\n\n93. “Fetch the Bolt Cutters” by Fiona Apple: Apple couldn’t have known the world she’d be releasing her fifth album into when she recorded it, but this primal scream of righteous anger is exactly what these plague times call for. “Kick me under the table all you want/ I won't shut up” is my new life motto. -B.V.\n\n94. “Hamilton Original Broadway Cast Recording”: What’d I miss? Five years of listening to this infectious blend of rap, R&B, jazz and good ol’ musical-theater standards, that's what. Spotify may think I have a problem. -B.T.\n\n95. “Let’s Dance” (2018 remastered) by David Bowie: I’ve head-bobbed my way through the opening hook of “Modern Love” about a hundred times since quarantine started, and it’s not getting old. When this classic Bowie album was released in 1983, we used to have family dance parties around the record player in our living room. Now I’m streaming it as I do burpees and push-ups inside my condo. It’s still perfect. -A.M.\n\n96. “RTJ4” by Run the Jewels: Rap duo Killer Mike and El-P wrote most of this album in 2019, well before the racial reckoning currently cascading across the U.S., but the lyrics are eerily prescient. Listening now is a powerful call to action, a message of urgency to fix so much that is broken. You’ll be singing earworm “Ooh la la” for days. -A.M.\n\nPodcasts\n\n97. \"Armchair Expert\": The weekly podcast by actor Dax Shepard and co-host Monica Padman isn’t exactly an escape from reality, but their conversations with celebrities, journalists and academics about deep things like addiction, racism and yes, even the coronavirus pandemic, are sure to stretch your mental muscles. And there’s no better time than now to try to improve upon ourselves. -A.H.\n\n98. “The Happiness Lab”: The show from Laurie Santos, the professor behind the super-popular Yale course about “the science of well-being,” is the soundtrack for my outdoor walks because it has a winning podcast combination: fascinating stories, science and self-help. -C.M.\n\n99. “The Office Ladies”: To keep myself from re-watching “The Office” for the billionth time, I instead turned to a weekly recap podcast that goes episode by episode, hosted by actresses Jenna Fischer (who played Pam Beesly) and Angela Kinsey (Angela Martin) with occasional cameos from the rest of the cast. -H.Y.\n\n100. “This Is Love”: The latest season of this audio series about romance and connection (which I listen to while I fold my laundry) is all about animals. Of course, I tear up over the episodes of a heroic guide dog and the goose with a human BFF. I tend to immediately retell the \"Love” stories to my loved ones. -C.M.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/2015/07/03/rest-summer-events-preview/29657775/", "title": "Rest of your summer events preview", "text": "Gregory J. Holman\n\nWho doesn't love summer?\n\nSaid the great American author Henry James: \"Summer afternoon — summer afternoon; to me those have always been the two most beautiful words in the English language.\"\n\nWe're right there with you, Henry.\n\nTo help you revel in this quintessential season for chillaxing, the News-Leader got to reporting — and reached out to readers on social media — to dig up more than 200 fun things to do, from Independence Day weekend all the way through the September equinox. Did you know fall doesn't start until Sept. 23? On that day, the sun shines directly on the equator, causing equal minutes of night and day throughout the world. Buh-bye, summer.\n\nBut before the onslaught of pumpkin-spice coffee drinks and salads festooned with cranberries, there's still plenty of time for days (and nights) on the lake, ice cream socials, backyard barbecues, fireworks, concerts, free days at the zoo — or the art museum — yoga, cardio, musical book clubs, summer classes for kids, and so much more.\n\nA garden of fun grows in our place. Enjoy the rest of your summer!\n\nCareful caveat: This is a big list, but it could still grow online. Tweet us @GregHolmanNL with your news tips on what we missed.

Let's find ...", "text": "Tom Noie: The leaves are falling left and right off the trees. Snow's in the forecast for Friday around these parts. That can only mean that it truly is college basketball season. Notre Dame opens Saturday at home against Cal State Northridge. The Irish are the last of the Atlantic Coast Conference's 15 teams to start the season, but that was by design. Enough with all that - let's talk hoops. Make sure you include your name and hometown with your question or comment. And with that, you know the rest - let's light this NDI chat candle. Let's go!\n\nJon: Is Hub going to pass the ball?\n\nTom Noie: Jon: Great to hear from you, but a question...are you new around here? Prentiss HUBB led the Atlantic Coast Conference in assists last season at 5.85 per game. In his three seasons as the lead guard, Hubb has 445 assists. That's an average of 148 per year. he gets 148 more this season, he'll finish his collegiate career with 593, which would be fourth in school history behind only Chris Thomas, Tory Jackson and Jerian Grant. That's some pretty good point guard company. So to answer your question, yes, I think he will pass the ball this season. A lot. Just as he's done the previous three seasons.\n\nKling: What's the ceiling for this team?\n\nTom Noie: Kling: Too early to tell. As we start, the baseline is double-digit league wins, a top half finish in the Atlantic Coast Conference and a trip to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2016-17. Let's see how the first month unfolds. Can Notre Dame do something in the Maui Invitational? What will it look like in non-league games against Illinois, Kentucky and Indiana before Christmas? IF they show enough signs of being really good, then that ceiling shifts. How about a Top Six finish in the league? How about an NCAA tournament win or two. We're getting ahead ourselves on everything because this core group never has shown that it can do either. But the potential is there. Time to tap into it.\n\nTony: Tom, why do you think it took Coach Brey so long to realize a staff changed was needed? I hope it helps on the court as much as it is in recruiting. Now they can go after the 2023 players.\n\nTom Noie: Tony: Because when you compile a coaching staff of Notre Dame graduates (Ryan Ayers, Ryan Humphrey) and someone who's been by your side since you arrived at Notre Dame (rod Balanis), you really want it all to work. You're maybe more patient with the process than you otherwise would be. This was the staff that was in place when Notre Dame went to the NCAA Tournament in 2016-17. Then it went sideways. If you're Brey, you want it to work. Loyalty is big with him and he was maybe too loyal before making any changes. He realized before last season started that changes needed to be made. He made them. A lot of them. I didn't think he had THAT in him, to go to that extreme. But this staff has re-energized everything around the program. It's almost an entirely different outfit. That allows for optimism instead of the same-old, same-old.\n\nTrevor B from Punta Gorda Fl: First, I just gotta say I appreciate your coverage of ND basketball fan. Always enjoy reading your articles and these chats you bring to the fan base. I have two questions for you. First one may be a bit premature but since you’ve seen him live and in person I was wondering how far along you believe Blake Wesley is compared to some of the former Irish you’ve seen. Thanks!\n\nTom Noie: Trevor: Great to hear from you....send some of that Florida sun up this way. Blake Wesley's waaaaay further along than I would've thought. Watching him a ton in high school, I thought it would take time to shape his game into what Mike Brey likes to do. Wesley had to do a lot in high school. How would that translate? Would it? It has. He's gotten serious about not being only a scorer. He's a basketball player. There haven't been many freshmen (maybe going back to Tory Jackson) who are this ready this early. He's going to play. A lot. Early.\n\nTrevor B from Punta Gorda Fl: Second question. Do you believe there’s a good chance Blake breaks into the starting 5?\n\nTom Noie: Trevor: Only a matter of time. Mike Brey has a core starting five right now, but has never been shy about shaking that up. Wesley's a main guy regardless. He's going to play heavy minutes. Heavy doesn't mean 32+ but it does mean that he's firmly in the rotation. To stay. To play.\n\nTrevor B from Punta Gorda Fl: what player are you looking forward to seeing the most this season and why?\n\nTom Noie: Trevor: I want to see how former Yale power forward Paul Atkinson, Jr.'s game translates to the ACC. He's going to face bigger and better competition. How will he respond? It's one thing to do it in the Ivy League, and Atkinson did it quite well during his three seasons. If he can do it as well in the ACC, that just opens everything up for everyone else.\n\nTrevor B from Punta Gorda Fl: What line up do you believe will prove to be most productive?\n\nTom Noie: Trevor: All of it is going to depend on how well this team can and will guard. If they really are bought into defense, and can do it consistently over 40 minutes, the four-around-one lineup (four guards with one big) might be Notre Dame's best lineup with guard Dane Goodwin as the second big. He can play around the rim. He can rebound. That's a smaller but a quicker yet also probably better lineup than playing two bigs. It just seems like the Irish have another gear when they can get to four-around-one.\n\nTyler from Michiana: Tom, I read on a recruiting site that the consistent message from Brey & staff to Ven-Allen Lubin during his recruitment was that he’d have “an immediate role in starting.” If this is true, that leads me to believe that the staff is expecting to lose 2 guards next year (Hubb + Wertz or Goodwin) because Starling, Ryan, Wesley are all but locks to start in 2022-23. Too soon to say that we can just bury Sanders in his 3rd year or a 2nd year Konieczny for that SF/PF hybrid role that I’m assuming Brey sees Lubin in. Opinion?\n\nTom Noie: Tyler: Great to hear from. That Ven-Allen Lubin at 6-foot-8, 220 -pounds, might be in line to challenge for a starting spot doesn't necessarily mean the Irish might lose two guards - it means there's opportunity along the front line. Paul Atkinson, Jr., will be out of eligibility. He won't be back. Nate Laszewski? Not sure. If he leaves, those are your two frontcourt starters. You need to replace power forwards with power forwards. Next season is a HUGE guessing game. Six of the seven guys who graduate in the spring could conceivably return. Dane Goodwin already has expressed an interest in playing a fifth year so he can get his Master's. You'd think Cormac Ryan and Trey Wertz would want a fifth year as well.\n\nTom Noie: If you shoot the coaching staff with truth serum, then ask them about the 2022-23 lineup, I think they'd want to have a lineup of J.J. Starling and Blake Wesley in the backcourt. Ryan or Goodwin as the third guard. If Lubin is that advanced, maybe he earns a spot on the front line. The fifth starter? How about J.R. Konieczny, who might be closer to 6-8 by then as a sort of a hybrid role of forward/guard? Gotta keep developing the back end of the rotation in Elijah Taylor and Tony Sanders, Jr., and Matt Zona. You also can explore the transfer portal. Maybe they get another guy like Paul Atkinson, Jr. A lot of options and not a lot of answers. For now.\n\nTyler from Michiana: Tom, not that you’d share if you knew exactly but what’s your best guess about Laszewski going into 2022-23? I’d imagine his professional future regardless of his season this year is international basketball. That’s not going anywhere. Do you see Nate as a 5 year guy?\n\nTom Noie: Tyler: Nate's a hard guy to get a read on in that he doesn't share a lot of his feelings. He's really quiet. Ask him about next season and he'll say he'll think about it at the end of the season. It's hard to say if he'd want a fifth year. Maybe. Maybe not. There are guys who would jump at the chance, and then there are guys like former Irish forward Carleton Scott who believe that when their time is up, it's up and it's on to the next basketball challenge.\n\nTyler from Michiana: Tom, I know this is a question you’ve addressed before but I’m just curious on what you think the thought process behind the cost of these tickets is? Attendance will be down this winter because of the ongoing health concerns. That’s understandable. But for Notre Dame to rather have a half empty arena at the expense of not selling those tickets for half the cost just makes no sense from both an economic standpoint (what’s money to ND anyway) and a fan/player experience. Everybody all around benefits from a sold out arena. Players, fans, and most importantly the university. Winning of course is the cure all but still…\n\nTom Noie: Tyler: What IS the cost of a ticket to a Notre Dame men's basketball game? Tiered like football? Though it would be hard to justify paying $100 for games against Kentucky and Duke. I get where the athletic department is coming from - it has to make up for last year's loss of revenue, but it also needs to understand the market. Notre Dame men's basketball tickets isn't anywhere close to Notre Dame football tickets.\n\nTyler from Michiana: Tom, with the Crossroads ending at the conclusion of this season, what game do you see in 2022-23 being the neutral site game or the “marque” game that replaces it? Any rumblings? My prediction is a true road game at Marquette with the return game in South Bend in 2023. What do you think?\n\nTom Noie: Tyler: Thank God the Crossroads is ending with this last installment of Notre Dame playing Indiana in Indianapolis at whatever Bankers Life Fieldhouse is called these days. It's run its course. Notre Dame and Marquette announced in 2019 that it would renew its rivalry beginning with a game at Fiserv Forum in the 2022-23 season. It's a home and home, which means Marquette comes to South Bend in 2023-24. No Crossroads opens the Irish to explore different games against different teams. Maybe Villanova. Maybe DePaul. Maybe UCLA. Maybe Georgetown. Mike Brey mentioned Wednesday he's also talked with Indiana coach Mike Woodson about rekindling that series, only home and homes instead of neutral sites. So there's that.\n\nJim Tal, Valley Center, CA.: Good morning Tom. Thanks so much for all your fine work when it comes to ND hoops. Heck, your football stuff is pretty darn good too. My question is a fairly straight forward one. Do you foresee any way that Brey returns as ND coach in 2022-23 if the Irish fail to make the Big Dance? If not, does he leave on his own or does AD Jack give him a gentle nudge out the door? Or could he conceivably stay on if the Irish show modest improvement this year and given that he's bringing in a very solid recruiting class next fall? Does this truly amount to a do-or-die season for the coach?\n\nTom Noie: Jim: Thanks for the note and the kind words. Having the overlap of football and basketball keeps me hopping, but it sure beats the alternative, so no complaint there. I really don't see this as a make-or-break season for Mike Brey in terms of the way Jack Swarbrick sees it. He often looks at a program - hoops, football, hockey - you name the sport - a little differently than just wins or losses. Are the coaches reaching the student-athletes? Are the student-athletes responding to the coaching staff? What's the overall vibe around the practice facility? I get the sense in my conversations with Jack Swarbrick that a whole lot has to go wrong with any given program for him to believe a coaching change is necessary. And if the previous four years weren't make-or-break years, why would the fifth be? No, I think Mike Brey is the coach of this program until at least the end of the 2024-25 season when his contract expires. Then what? New coach? Contract extension? Think all that works itself the next few years.\n\nZach: How do you think the recent recruiting class (getting 3 4-star players) impacts the likelihood of any 5th year guys next season (Laszewski, Goodwin, Wertz, Ryan, etc)\n\nTom Noie: Zach: It really doesn't. If all six of the guys who have eligibility remaining want to return, I think Mike Brey will give them that chance. It's a little different situation than bringing back Nik Djogo or Juwan Durham this season for a SIXTH year. Brey is pretty up front with his guys in that after five years, it's just time to move on. After four? Don't think he's escorting any of those guys out the door at Rolfs if they say, hey, Coach, I'd like to come back.\n\nJeff from Schererville, IN: Tom, I’m wondering if you saw Kentucky-Duke and if so what your impressions were of that game and its participants. It looks like the WV transfer is a beast on the glass for UK and that’s been a problem for ND, and as for Duke, Banchero was what we thought he’d be but Keels looked like a hidden gem. Their games against ND are a month or more away, but what are some things ND might be able to do or should do against each in order to give themselves the best chance to win? Thanks and keep up your great work.\n\nTom Noie: Jeff: Trevor Keels is going to be a problem in the league, not just for Notre Dame. He's really good. Notre Dame just needs to be Notre Dame - remember when Jahlil Okafor was the latest big with the tremendous upside like Banchero is today. Notre Dame beat Duke twice that season, including in the ACC tournament semifinals. So just do what the Irish do. It really is about them and not so much about the other teams. It's good to get a team like Kentucky early before the Wildcats figure it out. I also saw where John Calipari played only seven guys. Mike Brey's not the only one....lol\n\nRockaway Mike: Do you think Notre Dame will be better at handling the full court press this season?? Last year they mostly dumped the ball in the corner and hoped for the best. On the flip side; with a defensive minded, deeper and more athletic lineup, do you expect Notre Dame to utilize and be more of a full court/trapping defence?? I think that would surprise everyone!! Thanks Tom.\n\nTom Noie: Mike: They can't be any worse than last season, right? I still think of that second half at Syracuse and shudder. So does Mike Brey. Don't think you're going to see these guys running all over the floor and throwing traps and double teams here and there and everywhere. At least, not yet. Let's perfect halfcourt defense and key in on gang rebounding before branching out. Small steps with this group, but the small steps have been good. Let's see them translate.\n\nMark Metzler - Rochester, NY: Tom, great to be back! How deep will this team play once we get to ACC play? 8-9 guys?\n\nTom Noie: Mark: Ha! Good one. I kid, I kid. There will be nights - a lot of them really and against the elite teams - when this rotation won't go beyond seven. It's the starting five of Hubb, Ryan, Goodwin, Laszewski and Atkinson and Wertz and Wesley off the bench. Now, there might be chances for say, Elijah Taylor as the eighth man against a physical team or J.R. Konieczny against a perimeter team. But not on a regular basis.\n\nTyler from Michiana: Tom, I’m curious about the relationships you have with the 2018 class. Hindered given the current health circumstances of course, but I’m curious if you plan to remain in touch with any of these guys after 2022 (or 2023) or see a certain relationship that you feel that door would always be open?\n\nTom Noie: Tyler: It's been hard to get to know these guys, like, really know them as I have with so many classes/teams/guys in the past. I've asked more than once about doing something with Robby Carmody and all that he's been through. It's never gone any further than that. As for the future, I feel comfortable contacting just about anyone (there are a few exceptions, lol) that's played in this program during my 24 years on the beat if I need to reach out. Ninety-nine point nine times, guys get back to me.\n\nAidan: How much will Wesley contribute this year and when it’s all said and done can he rank up there with some of the great players Brey has had in the past decade (Grant, Pat, DJ, etc.)\n\nTom Noie: Aidan: Whooooooaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh. I get the excitement around Wesley, and rightfully so, but let's see him get through his freshman year where the struggles are real, especially the next few months when the games are coming quickly and finals lurk and more games and the spring semester. That said, the tools are there for Wesley to be really good. I'm not going into greatness territory. Not before he's played a game.\n\nClint from Winnipeg: Which of the returning players has surprised you the most in terms of his improvement?\n\nTom Noie: Clint: Too early to tell. Notre Dame has played two exhibition games, both of which got out of hand really early. After that, it's just a pickup game and hard to really say, whoa, haven't seen that. Like, Trey Wertz hit five 3s and played with great pace in the second exhibition, but he missed the first exhibition with an ankle injury. Can he do that for more than one game? It's kind of like that across the board. There's a lot to like from the two exhibitions, but it really doesn't matter - right now. Let's see it for a week or two or three and then you're like, yeah, this guy or that guy has gotten better. And here's why.\n\nThe man: record projection for regular season and acc play? and also maybe an acc tournament projection as well as march madness? very early but would be fun to think about\n\nTom Noie: My man....need to see more from these guys to really have a handle. Let's go with 20-plus overall wins and 10-plus league wins. Top half of the ACC and an NCAA tournament seed of some sort. After missing out on the last four years, even if the Irish have to go to the play-in game, they'll take it.\n\nJacob: What big games do you think we win this year, including the maui tournament?\n\nTom Noie: Jacob: Let's go with Kentucky at home. North Carolina at home. Virginia at home, then the Irish do what the Irish historically have done and steal a few on the road. Illinois will be difficult. Indiana at neutral site will be difficult. That's OK - as long as this group competes and isn't down double digits by the second media timeout.\n\nRick, Iowa City, IA: Hey Tom! Long time fan here and excited for 2021-22. Feels like this group can finally bring home a second weekend NCAA Tournament appearance. Do you think we'll see a different defensive identity with Slo back in the mix? Go Irish!\n\nTom Noie: Rick: If the first six weeks are any indication, defense will take on a whole new priority with this group. Everything they do in practice starts with defense. That's a step in the right direction. Now build on it. This won't be a lockdown outfit, but they shouldn't be anywhere near the sieve-like team they were last year when they didn't stop anybody.\n\nRyan mars pa: Tom what do you think about this year’s team i think it will be good with hubb nate Atkinson wertz Goodwin Zona and everyone else I’m hoping they make the tournament go Irish\n\nTom Noie: Ryan: A lot to like, but a lot to be determined. There's so much age and experience back and new guys added to the mix, but this group never has done it over the long haul. That has to change to keep from being the same old Irish.\n\nRick, Iowa City, IA: That time of year baby!!! Let's just get a few wins in \"Maui\" and take it from there! On a scale from 1-10, what's your confidence meter at in terms of this group reaching the NCAA Tournament? I'm at a 7!\n\nTom Noie: Rick....I'll go 7.5 with good undercarriage and sauce....oooops....thought we were doing pizza. Nah, I'll still go 7.5 with ability to bump to an 8 between now and the first of the year.\n\nRobert from Michiana: What have been your impressions of Elijah Taylor in practice and the two exhibitions?\n\nTom Noie: Robert: At 6-foot-8, 242, he certainly looks the part of a guy that's usually on the other teams in the ACC. He had seven rebounds in 12 minutes the first time out, then tallied one of the strangest stat lines I've ever seen with four fouls in seven minutes. Baby steps with Taylor. Remember, he didn't play at all last year after offseason ankle surgery. There's a lot there, though we might not see much of it this season. And that's OK. It will be a process with him.\n\nRobert from Michiana: We have seen what coach Solomon brings back to the program. What in your opinion will coach Wyche bring?\n\nTom Noie: Robert: An edge. A hunger. A drive. An accountability level that former Irish coach Ryan Ayers never really secured with the guys. And he can recruit. Antoni Wyche was the lead assistant in getting Ven-Allen Lubin. He's been the ultimate grinder assistant at Siena and Lehigh. Expect more of the same - in the best of ways - now that he's back at his alma mater.\n\nJerrick: we winning maui??? i wanna see a shirtless brey!!\n\nTom Noie: Jerrick: Can college basketball handle Maui Mike? Shirtless and running down the Strip with the tournament championship? Just beat Saint Mary's and worry about the next game. For now.\n\nClint from Winnipeg: How many wins over last season do you think upgrading the defense to an \"average\" level can bring?\n\nTom Noie: Clint: Looking at last season's results and off the top of my melon, I can remember five games where if Notre Dame just defended even a little, it would've won - home against Ohio State, at North Carolina (one-point loss), at Georgia Tech (one-point loss), at Syracuse (Irish were up 20 in second half) and at Boston College (defense was optional). That flips an 11-15 record to 16-10. Those games now have to go Notre Dame's way.\n\nJoey from Highland: Hey Tom, miss me? I was at both exhibitions and I noticed the ball movement seems way more crisp this year. Hubb seems to be more confident in the other guys too. I was surprised Taylor was ahead of Zona, Zona seems to crash the boards like a mad man. Your thoughts?\n\nTom Noie: Joey: Always miss a chance to talk hoops with you man. The ball does move better, in part because the Irish had a chance to practice and play together for the summer. That wasn't an option the previous offseason because of the pandemic, and it showed last year. Think Zona and Taylor are both back-end-of-the-rotation guys until they get a little more seasoning. Zona HAD to play at times last year. That won't be the case this year. Not with this group.\n\nDick from Detroit: Is Mike Brey really Ted Lasso in disguise?\n\nTom Noie: Sigh....hard pass.\n\nChris , DC: Tom, How big of a year can Laszewski have with the addition of Atkinson? Thanks\n\nTom Noie: Chris: Laszewski first has to stop dribbling his way into issues that have no way out. There have been times in the exhibition where he has an open 3 on the wing or the corner, gives a pump fake, then dribbles toward the basket. He's shut off and now the good look he had is no look and it's a scramble. Laszewski has to keep it simple - see ball, shoot ball. I loved his game in the second exhibition where scoring points wasn't there, so he just went out and grabbed 15 rebounds. That's a big step when guys realize, OK, the offense might not be there tonight, so how can I impact games in other ways?\n\nJoey from Highland: I watched the ACC Championship game on YouTube. That team was soooo good. Take me back!\n\nTom Noie: Joey: I could watch that one possession during Notre Dame's second half run where all five guys touched the ball from five different areas of the floor before Steve Vasturia sticks the 3. The look on the face of Roy Williams that night in Greensboro Coliseum was like, how do I stop THAT????\n\nJoey from Highland: I am a Jay Bilas fan but he’s a Duke alum. Not sure he should be doing their games. Thoughts?\n\nTom Noie: He's fine....except when he gets on his Duke-colored soap box. But he's better than the alternative, and honestly, ESPN took a step back when Bill Raftery jumped to FOX.\n\nJustin, Ft Wayne: Tom, you have any games your really looking forward too?\n\nTom Noie: Justin: Honestly, all of them, because it's a journey to see how this team is going to do what it needs to do to get to the end, which is the NCAA tournament. I'm not one of those guys who's like, yeah, wake me in February when everything matters. The joy is in the journey. Who are these Irish going to be? Let's find out.\n\nMike from Rochester, NY: Tom, Juwan Durham never evolved into the inside force I think we all expected. Why was that and what does Paul Atkinson bring that should give us hope for a stronger inside game?\n\nTom Noie: Mike: It's easy to say now, I know, but I never looked at Juwan Durham and thought, whoa, he's going to be an issue for teams during his career. He was tall. He blocked a few shots. But he was who he was, and what he was. Limited athlete, limited scorer. Limited guy. Good guy, but not someone that was going to influence games. Atkinson's a different cat, in so many good ways. That he's 23 shouldn't be ignored. He just plays basketball. Doesn't look like he's out there sorting through his options as Durham seemed to do. Just play. Let it flow.\n\nGreg from New Jersey: Thanks for doing these chats Tom! Anything specific we should watch for relating to the improved defense? Of course, effort and technique need to improve, but have you seen or heard anything regarding specific strategies/philosophy? Pack-line principles or more aggressive ball-pressure/deny? Ice, switch or hedge ball screens? Anxious to see the new focus on defense so curious to see what Coach Slo has planned and what to look for to see if the players are executing....Go Irish!\n\nTom Noie: Greg: Good to hear from you. This should help you with what to watch for - https://tinyurl.com/3ex93b68. Wrote about that topic last week. They'll be better. Can't be any worse than last year, right?\n\nMatt from Campus: You've discussed the schedule a bit already, but what would you say is successful outcome in the non-conference portion for this team? My thoughts of \"successful\" are win all the games you are supposed to, go 2-1 in Vegas, and take 2 of 3 of IU, Illinois, and Kentucky. Is that too high of a bar?\n\nTom Noie: Matt: Good stuff, and good to hear from you. I'll go with Meatloaf - two out of three, ain't bad - to address your question. Right on with winning all the non-league games you're supposed to win. No slip-ups allowed. Same with going 2-1 in Vegas, no matter who you play. I'd say getting two of the three out of Illinois, Kentucky and Indiana might be too much to ask - at least right now. The Illinois game will be the first time that this core will be in that type of road atmosphere against a really good team. How are they going to respond? Yeah, you want to win, but it's more important to play well. Not fall into early double-digit hole and then you spend the rest of the night trying to dig out of it. Kentucky? Win a big game at home. That's a must. But then we get to Indiana, which really is a road game. It's not a neutral site....it's all cream and crimson down there. But you get the experience in the Illinois and Indiana games to prepare for what's coming in the ACC. Let's see how it plays out.\n\nTyler from Michiana: Thank you for your time in answering all these questions. I say this with all respect to the young man. I think he’s a great kid & I think despite what happens with his progression in the program, he’ll spend his four/five years here & get his degree like your typical “Notre Dame man.” I believe he’s of that character as a student athlete. Great fit. But basketball wise, his game to me is just meh. I’m just not impressed. I think if he gets it figured out, it’ll be in year three or four like a Cooley or a Geben but even his ceiling feels lower than those guys. Zona is a low floor, low ceiling kinda guy IMO. Maybe he was recruited that way as depth as a “project” but I’d prefer to take a transfer reserve big with a higher floor & years of college experience. What’s your closest comp for Matt Zona?\n\nTom Noie: Tyler: Good points. Fair points. I did a live Zoom on Wednesday and compared Matt Zona to a combination of Jack Cooley and John Mooney in terms of where he is in the early stages of his career. When Cooley and to an extent Mooney were young, there was zero indication that they would go on to have the college careers that they had. Nobody saw them coming, especially when they were underclassmen. I'd put Zona in that category. Give him time to grow his game and see what happens. Maybe nothing. Maybe something, but he's a long way off to being a rotational piece to this basketball puzzle. I'd look hard at the transfer portal in the offseason for a big with experience who could help.\n\nTom: I want to see focus and consistency from this season's team. Think ND can play with some urgency this year and get off to a good start?\n\nTom Noie: Tom: If not now, then when? Seems like I've typed that sentence in chats or emails now for the last few years. Honestly, I'm tired of waiting to see something - to see anything - from this core. Like, let's go already, right? They haven't gone to the NCAA tournament, but believe they can go to the NCAA tournament. OK, so how do they handle that? Wilt under pressure? Embrace it and thrive? Can't wait to find out.\n\nMatt from Campus: Very bummed that the Duke and UNC games are over the school's Christmas break. Seems like those big name games are the only time we get better draws in the student section, not to mention it will be Coach K's last visit. Could a positive year rejuvenate the student body's interest in the team? I've been frustrated by the lack of attendance the last three years, but understand it some because we are a football school and some because the team has not been very good. What was the student section like in the back to back elite 8 years? Much better, somewhat better?\n\nTom Noie: Matt: You're new around here, right? I've had a weird relationship with the student body and with the fan base in general. For so many years, this fan base seemingly was stuck in the 1970s and 1980s of college basketball independence. Where were the Adrian Dantleys and Davis Rivers of the Irish hoops world? Different time there, people. The student section? Fair weather on a good day. Yeah, they'll show up and show out for Duke and Carolina, but you can't just be there for the big games. The student body gonna student body like they always have. Even during the Elite Eight years, the fan experience at Purcell Pavilion was middle of the ACC road on a good day. The student body/local fans and I aren't just going to get along very well.....lol\n\nMaggie, Oak Park: Not a question. Just wanted to say that I couldn't agree with you more that this core group really has not stepped up to show something in any way.\n\nTom Noie: Maggie: Thanks, which is why I have to couch everything when people ask about the excitement level of the season and the potential of this team. It would be one thing if this core had previously won 11, 12, 13 games in the ACC one year or played in the NIT. That's stuff you can build on. But to not have ever done it (NCAA) and then to HAVE to do it this year, that's a really big step. Do they realize it? Do they know how hard it really is? There's no margin for error with this group, or this season. They have to go and do something that they've never done. Do they have it in them? I don't know, because, well, they've never shown it. Ever.\n\nTom Noie: That will do it for today's chat. Many thanks for all who dropped in for a few minutes. We'll circle back and have another one in a few weeks. Maybe the week after Notre Dame opens Atlantic Coast Conference play Dec. 3 at Boston College. Stay tuned!\n\nFollow South Bend Tribune and NDInsider columnist Tom Noie on Twitter: @tnoieNDI", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/10/black-hills-yaks-serious-senioritis-campus-pony-express-news-around-states/39563041/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: The University of Alabama gave back a philanthropist’s $26.5 million donation and took his name off its law school Friday, a week after he called on students to boycott the institution over the state’s new abortion ban. Hugh F. Culverhouse Jr., a 70-year-old Florida real estate investor, said he has no doubt the board of trustees acted in response to his remarks, and he bitterly complained that the state of Alabama is only reinforcing its reputation as “the land of the backward,” full of “hicks.” University officials emphatically denied the decision had anything to do with Culverhouse’s stand on the abortion law and said it was prompted instead by his attempts to dictate how the money should be spent. They did not elaborate. Within minutes of the trustees’ vote, a maintenance crew had removed his name from the building.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: Wildlife authorities are warning residents in the state’s interior to beware of hares. Alaska Department of Fish and Game veterinarian Kimberlee Beckmen says tularemia is showing up in hares. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports tularemia can be transmitted to dogs and cats that mouth or catch sick hares. The disease is spread by bacteria through hare and vole ticks. It’s most often seen in summer, when ticks are most active. Late stages of the disease can make hares slow and easy to catch by pets. People can become infected by handling hares or coming into contact with an infected pet’s saliva. The most common symptoms in people and pets are lethargy, high fever and swollen lymph nodes. The disease can be fatal if untreated but cured with antibiotics if diagnosed quickly.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey vetoed legislation Friday that would have tripled the amount state lawmakers receive for each day they work. Ducey said such a change shouldn’t apply to current lawmakers but rather should kick in only after the next election. Lawmakers in both parties backed the proposal, saying rural lawmakers especially are undercompensated for their costs of traveling to and staying in Phoenix during the session. They also noted that changes to federal tax law eliminated many write-offs for expenses. Ducey seemed to take a dim view of boosting expense payments for lawmakers who live in the Phoenix area but noted that “Arizona is the sixth largest state in terms of land area” and said that for certain legislators living farther away, “there is a strong case to be made” for adjusting the stipend.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Supreme Court has cleared the way for an 88-year-old bridge to be demolished. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the court’s 6-1 decision dismissed an appeal Thursday to save the White River Bridge in Clarendon. An Arkansas Department of Transportation spokesman says a demolition timeline will be established within four weeks. The bridge and its replacement are in wildlife sanctuaries on the White and Cache rivers overseen by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The department has agreed to restore the site’s natural topography and re-establish native hardwood trees. Supporters of the bridge have been rallying to preserve and adapt it for cyclists and pedestrians.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Three architect-led teams will compete for the job of leading master planning for renovation of the city’s famed La Brea Tar Pits. Officials of the Natural History Museums of Los Angeles County announced the beginning of the long-term initiative Thursday. The Tar Pits are an active Ice Age excavation site that has yielded millions of fossils including saber-toothed cat, dire wolf and mastodon skeletons, as well as samples of plants, small animals and insects that give researchers insight into 50,000 years of history. In addition to being an active paleontological research facility, the Tar Pits receive more than 400,000 visitors each year. The teams competing to reimagine the 12-acre campus are Dorte Mandrup of Copenhagen, Weiss/Manfredi of New York and Diller Scofidio + Renfro of New York.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Fort Carson officials say they are working to improve housing at the military installation after a report documented poor maintenance and squalid conditions. The Gazette reports a survey by the Military Family Advisory Network found problems at more than 160 military locations in the U.S. but recorded the most complaints – 147 – at Fort Carson. According to the survey, 63% of Fort Carson respondents said their units needed better maintenance, repairs or remediation. Fort Carson’s garrison commander, Col. Brian Wortinger, says nearly 11,000 work orders have been submitted since mid-February, with all but 500 completed. He says the company overseeing housing has hired two resident engagement specialists, two quality control supervisors and a specialist to improve communications with residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNewtown: A festival was held Saturday to raise money for an animal sanctuary that is being built to honor the memory of a 6-year-old Sandy Hook School shooting victim. The 5th annual Catherine’s Butterfly Party on the Fairfield Hills Campus in Newtown was to include children’s activities, wildlife demonstrations, food trucks, music and pet adoptions. It was hosted by the Catherine Violet Hubbard Animal Sanctuary. The 34-acre sanctuary is being built to honor Hubbard, who was among 26 people killed inside the Sandy Hook School in December 2012. It is being designed to provide rescue and support services for companion animals, farm animal refuge, wildlife rescue and rehabilitation, and educational programming.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: Separation Day commemorates the state’s independence from Great Britain and Pennsylvania, but over the weekend it also brought the community of New Castle together with visitors and local nonprofits. “Is a very important patriotic event for Delaware. It is almost like the Independence Day,” said Cindy Snyder, site manager of the New Castle Courthouse Museum. The 244th anniversary of Delaware’s independence drew thousands to Old New Castle on Friday and Saturday, with a barbecue contest, children’s activities, a parade, fireworks and more. Snyder said the event was slated to see almost 10,000 attendants throughout the two days of celebration, especially during the Saturday concert and fireworks.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Tourists may find it harder to get that perfect snap of the White House after construction begins on a new 13-foot fence, almost double its current height, to help keep intruders out. The Secret Service says a $64 million construction project will begin soon on what eventually will be a 13-foot, 1-inch fence with wider and stronger pickets. The existing fence stands about 6 feet, 6 inches tall. The agency, which protects the president, declined to discuss details of the state-of-the-art features it says will be part of the new barrier. The National Park Service, which provides care and upkeep for the White House and its 18 acres of grounds, has also been involved in the project. Active construction, once it begins in the summer, is expected to continue into 2021, the Secret Service said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation Friday that creates more hurdles for citizens to change the state Constitution through petition drives. The bill requires paid petition gatherers to register with the secretary of state, outlaws paying gatherers based on the number of signatures they collect and creates fines if petitions aren’t turned in within 30 days. The petitions also must include the name and permanent address of the gatherer. Democrats said that will discourage people from collecting petitions in an already difficult amendment process. Republicans said it will help prevent fraud and keep out-of-state interests from meddling with the Constitution. Last year an amendment restored voting rights for most felons once they’ve completed their sentences. In 2016 an amendment legalized medical marijuana.\n\nGeorgia\n\nRome: Classes are optional for hundreds of seniors expected to transfer to the serene campus of Berry College next summer. And once they settle in, they plan to never leave. But cut them some slack: The seniors in question are in their 70s and 80s, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The private liberal arts institution is leasing land on its Rome campus to a nonprofit for a retirement complex now under construction. The college also provided seed funding for the complex. With the opening of The Spires next summer, 350 senior residents will be just a third of a mile from the main part of campus. They’ll be welcome to roam the college’s more than 40 miles of trails, hang out in the student center, attend school football games or concerts, and take classes for free, space permitting.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: State officials say an introduced caterpillar and moth native to Southeast Asia is eating indigenous plants on Maui that provide important habitat for native species. The Maui News reports a biologist looking for native snails in October noticed signs of unfamiliar caterpillars feeding on mamaki leaves. The caterpillar and moth turned out to be the Ramie moth. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources says it then received reports of the bug from across the island. The Ramie moth is laying its eggs on several plants in the nettles family, such as mamaki and akolea. These plants are food sources for the Kamehameha caterpillar and are valued by Native Hawaiians for their fiber and medicinal qualities. It’s the first documented sighting of the caterpillar in the U.S.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S Air Force says a federal lawsuit seeking to halt coordinated urban air- and ground-training exercises over nine cities in southern Idaho should be dismissed. The Air Force says in documents filed Friday in U.S. District Court that it did not abuse its discretion when giving the OK for up to 160 training events per year. The military says air support for ground forces has been increasingly required in urban combat areas. The training in Idaho involves aircraft flying over cities, including the capital, Boise, and communicating with service members dressed as civilians on the ground to identify targets with low-power lasers. The lawsuit filed by area residents contends that the Air Force did not do enough to inform the public and that the training endangers residents’ health, safety and quality of life.\n\nIllinois\n\nChampaign: A group is recommending that the University of Illinois erect a plaque or monument to commemorate the history of Chief Illiniwek, the mascot who was dropped amid much criticism in 2007. The Chancellor’s Commission on Native Imagery says the site outside Memorial Stadium, as well as a public retirement, could provide “healing and reconciliation.” The group also recommends regular activities involving the university and Native Americans who consider Illinois their ancestral home. A student dressed as Chief Illiniwek performed a traditional dance at sporting events, running the entire 100-yard football field. But many people called the portrayal offensive and would not watch. The university stopped using the chief in 2007.\n\nIndiana\n\nAlbany: The former headquarters of the company that oversees licensing for the lasagna-loving cartoon cat Garfield will be auctioned off this month. PAWS Inc. employees have moved out of the complex in this eastern Indiana town, but the business is still in operation, with workers now working from home. Garfield creator Jim Davis donated PAWS Inc.’s former headquarters to the Ball State University Foundation, which will receive the proceeds from the June 24-26 online auction of two parcels totaling 19 acres. The property includes a nearly 43,000-square-foot main facility, a free-standing studio building, warehouse and maintenance buildings, and a commercial greenhouse. PAWS Inc. was founded by Davis in 1981 to support Garfield’s licensing and handle creative and business concerns.\n\nIowa\n\nDubuque: The cities of Dubuque, Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa have been awarded federal grants to clean up and redevelop contaminated sites. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced last week that the cities had been selected to receive $1.6 million in brownfield grants. They’re among 149 communities nationwide selected to receive 151 grant awards totaling nearly $65 million. Dubuque will receive $800,000 to revitalize areas across the community, including sites in the South Port, Washington Neighborhood and North End neighborhoods. Fort Dodge is getting $500,000 to clean up the Wahkonsa Annex contaminated with inorganic contaminants, and Oskaloosa will get $300,000 to promote investment in existing neighborhoods, encourage cleanup and reuse contaminated property.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state is asking anyone who bought a rhododendron plant at Walmart stores in the state since April to destroy them. The Kansas Department of Agriculture reported Friday that confirmed cases of the sudden oak death disease have been found in rhododendrons sold at 60 Walmarts in Kansas and one Home Depot in Pittsburg. The plant disease has infected trees and native plants in California and Oregon and has also been identified in 10 Midwestern states. It is the first time the disease has been noted in Kansas. The diseased plants sold in Kansas originated from the Park Hill Plants nursery in Oklahoma. The plants must be destroyed because there is no cure for the disease. The plants should be burned or double-bagged and thrown away. The root ball should also be thrown out. The disease poses no risk to humans or animals.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Officials have unveiled new branding for the city’s airport to go along with a renaming to honor Muhammad Ali. Mayor Greg Fischer and Ali’s widow, Lonnie, unveiled a new logo and designs at the airport during a ceremony Thursday. The Airport Authority Board voted in January to change the airport’s name to the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport. The logo shows a silhouette of Ali with arms raised against a butterfly. Officials say the butterfly pays homage to Ali’s famous phrase “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee” and the context of flight for the airport. The unveiling took place as part of the city’s Ali Week, which is held the first week of June to mark the passing of Ali, who died in 2016.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: From a falling facade to broken windows, the historic Arlington Hotel in the city’s downtown has been vacant since 1990. But for the first time in decades, the old building will soon see new life. KTBS-TV reports the Metropolitan Planning Commission has voted to approve a special use permit for the Larsen Family LP to turn the former hotel into a distillery, a French-style restaurant and a speakeasy bar. The man behind the project is Shreveport architect Kevin Bryan. It will be called Every Man a King Distilling. The name stems from famed Louisiana senator and former Gov. Huey Long, nicknamed the Kingfish. While seeking re-election in 1930, Long promised to make every man a king. It was a message voters had never heard before.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state now has an official ballad that commemorates a unit that fought during the Civil War. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed into law on Friday legislation that named the “Ballad of the 20th Maine” as the state’s official ballad. The ballad was performed at the Statehouse by the group known as The Ghost of Paul Revere. NewsCenterMaine reports the ballad tells the story of the 2nd Maine Infantry Regiment through the eyes of Litchfield soldier Andrew Tozier as the unit joined the 20th Maine, which fought valiantly at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in the Civil War. Mills says the ballad reminds Mainers about important the role state played in the nation’s history. Maine already has a separate state song and state march.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Four top executives of the University of Maryland Medical System’s board have resigned amid the continuing investigation into board financial arrangements that led Baltimore’s previous mayor to resign. The Baltimore Sun reports the resignations announced Thursday include chief administrative officer Jerry Wollman, chief compliance officer Christine Bachrach, chief performance improvement officer Keith Persinger and the system’s primary lawyer, Megan Arthur. The changes are effective June 21. Former Mayor Catherine Pugh was a former board member who left her mayoral post last month amid investigations into whether she sold self-published books to the system to disguise hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks. Three other members resigned last month, including former board chairman Stephen Burch.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Republican Gov. Charlie Baker has signed a bill providing $200 million to cities and towns for local infrastructure projects. The so-called Chapter 90 funds were given final approval by the Democratic-controlled Legislature last week. Baker said in a statement Friday that the state money is critical for cities and towns for highway construction, road paving and other projects. Under the program, communities submit receipts to the state for reimbursements for costs associated with eligible infrastructure projects. The state Department of Transportation verifies the expenses are eligible for reimbursement. The Baker administration says more than $1.1 billion in Chapter 90 funds have been given since the governor took office in 2015.\n\nMichigan\n\nEau Claire: The polar vortex that enveloped much of the Midwest early this year nearly wiped out the peach crop in southwestern Michigan, according to experts. Some of the region’s apricot, plum and apple crops may also be affected after the blast of polar air plummeted temperatures to minus 20 degrees in late January, breaking water pipes and ice-jamming bridges in areas around the state. Bill Shane, a tree fruit specialist at Michigan State University, told the South Bend Tribune that Michigan’s southwestern counties will suffer millions of dollars in losses from damage to fruit crops. The polar vortex also may have shortened the life span of trees that were severely damaged, he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nThief River Falls: Rural communities in the state are scrambling to recruit and retain workers as baby boomers reach retirement age. Minnesota Public Radio News reports that electronic component distributor Digi-Key is among the companies testing innovative strategies to attract workers at all stages of their lives. The Thief River Falls business plans to add 1,000 new jobs over the next 10 years. The expansion plans come during a decade when Pennington County’s over-65 population is estimated to rise from about 18% to 27%. Digi-Key pitches higher starting salaries and low-cost health insurance. But the distributor also offers flexible schedules, training, an onsite medical office, and buses from Crookston and Grand Forks, North Dakota.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The governor is asking that the federal government declare a fisheries disaster as water from a Mississippi River spillway gushes into what’s normally a saltwater estuary. The unprecedented second opening of the Bonnet Carre spillway last month also has an increasing number of Mississippi officials demanding a voice in when the spillway is opened. That’s because the freshwater from the river that streams through Louisiana’s Lake Pontchartrain and into the Mississippi Sound is bad for oysters, shrimp, crabs and other saltwater-loving seafood. Gov. Phil Bryant announced Friday that he had made the request, releasing a May 31 letter to U.S Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Bryant says 70% of the Mississippi Sound’s already imperiled oyster population is estimated to be dead, with the crab catch down by 35%.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Voters in the city will decide Nov. 5 whether to keep a historic city boulevard named for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The City Council on Thursday approved an initiative petition seeking to change the nearly 10-mile boulevard’s name back to The Paseo, which it has been called since 1899. That comes after the council voted in January to rename the street, ending a long campaign by black pastors and the local chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to name a street in the city for King. A grassroots group opposed to the name change quickly formed and gathered more than 2,800 signatures on petitions to put the issue on the ballot – far more than the 1,700 needed. That made Thursday’s council vote a procedural matter.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Federal, state, local and tribal fire managers say they’re ready for the upcoming fire season, but they stopped short of predicting how many acres might burn. After discussing this winter’s snowpack, runoff, temperature trends and expected weather patterns, meteorologist Colleen Haskell said most of the state has “normal” potential for significant wildfires. Northwestern Montana’s potential is “above average.” Haskell cautioned that wasn’t suggesting how many acres would burn, just conditions that could lead to fires. Sudden drought and thunderstorms are less predictable. Agency heads told Gov. Steve Bullock on Friday their personnel were trained, their equipment was ready, and they were prepared to work together to fight fires. Officials suggested more resources needed to go into preventing catastrophic fires such as conducting prescribed burns, forest management and community preparation.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Visitors to two state historical parks can see a reenactment of the Pony Express this week. The rides will take place Tuesday and Wednesday at Rock Creek Station and Fort Kearny state historical parks. Each year, members of the National Pony Express Association re-create the Pony Express with a commemorative ride over 10 days. Riders carry letters over the original trail. The 1,966-mile, eight-state event is conducted 24 hours a day until the mail is delivered. Riders will hand the letters to a fresh team at Rock Creek Station State Historical Park near Fairbury at 1:45 p.m. Tuesday. Another handoff will take place at Fort Kearny State Historical Park at 6 a.m. Wednesday. Free biscuits and gravy will be available for visitors at 5:45 a.m.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A new state law allowing the Silver State to test out a limited marijuana banking system is expected to bring some relief to the state’s booming cannabis industry, where dispensaries and other businesses are forced to deal in cash. The measure, signed into law Wednesday by Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, would let the state treasurer’s office set up a three-year pilot program for cannabis businesses. State Treasurer Zach Conine, who pushed for the program, said the system would try to remove the large amounts of cash that Nevada’s pot industry must deal with and instead set up an online system where digital currency could be sent and received. Conine likened the system to gift cards or digital wallet apps like Venmo and said the program would not include broader banking services like loans.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLittleton: Fans of Pollyanna have something to be extra glad about this year – a state law recognizing the eternally optimistic fictional character. Gov. Chris Sununu signed a bill last week designating the second Saturday in June “Pollyanna of Littleton New Hampshire Recognition Day.” Eleanor H. Porter, author of the 1913 book “Pollyanna,” lived in Littleton, where a bronze statue of the beloved character welcomes visitors. The town has been hosting “Pollyanna Glad Day” in June for years. Saturday’s event featured a pancake breakfast, a celebration near the sculpture, a sing-along and a walking tour. The event’s motto is “Be Glad. Be Cheerful. Eat Cake!”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSalem: A 600-year-old oak tree known as the tallest in the state has uprooted. The Salem oak came down Thursday evening, drawing people to mourn its loss. The Salem Religious Society of Friends owns the tree and a graveyard that surrounds it. Society member Jim Waddington tells NJ.com the tree has been in declining health over the past 100 years despite efforts to preserve it. The group will meet to decide what to do with the remains. It is believed Quaker John Fenwick, who brought the first English settlement to West Jersey in 1675, brokered a treaty with a Native American tribe under the tree’s branches. The Environmental Protection Department said it was the largest white oak in New Jersey.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Police are investigating damage to a rainbow-colored crosswalk created in honor of Albuquerque Pride after videos emerged of several motorcyclists trying to deface it. One video posted online shows dozens of bikers riding along Route 66 before a couple of them take turns burning rubber over the crosswalk, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Another biker appears to suffer a blowout from the effort and duckwalks his bike to the curb, its back tire flopping around on the rim. “The facts will determine the appropriate charges, including whether damages amount to misdemeanor or felony charges,” Albuquerque police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos said Thursday. The crosswalk was just days old at the time of the episode, having been installed in honor of Pride Week and the city’s LGBT community.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: With Puerto Rican pride on full display along Fifth Avenue, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on Sunday that he’s appointing a commission to oversee the construction of a memorial in Manhattan’s Battery Park City to victims of the 2017 storm. This year, for its 62nd iteration, the parade sought to promote the economic development needed for the island to fully get back on its feet. Grand marshal Ricky Martin, the singer known for his stint in Menudo and his hit “Livin’ La Vida Loca,” was celebrated alongside his foundation, dedicated to fighting human trafficking. As New York City marks Pride Month, the parade paid posthumous tribute to Sylvia Rivera, an LGBTQ rights activist who took part in the Stonewall rebellion 50 years ago this month. Others honored in the parade were singers La India and Jose Feliciano, golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez and Hall of Fame-bound baseball slugger Edgar Martinez.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilmington: The Coastal Land Trust has completed the purchase of one of its “Top 40” priority conservation projects on the state’s coast. Trust officials said in a news release Friday that the group purchased more than 700 acres along the banks of the Neuse River across from the city of New Bern. The trust then transferred the property to the state for management by the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission. They say the area’s significant natural resources made it a priority for the trust to save. The property’s resources include freshwater marsh, cypress-gum swamp, and forests of bottomland hardwoods, loblolly pine and longleaf pine. Funding for the purchase came from state and federal agencies and grants. The purchase price wasn’t disclosed.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The idea for the next Fortnite or Risk could come from a group of game developers meeting at a video game store here. KVRR-TV reports Kyle Weik started the group Fargo Game Makers to help other game designers develop their ideas into products. Members meet once a month at Replay Games. Weik owns startup game studio Beach Interactive in Fargo. He says it can be difficult to follow through on developing a game when you’re doing it alone. He says he’s enjoyed seeing how members have shaped their games since the group started nearly five years ago. Davin Loegering is among the game designers who have brought their ideas to the group. He’s getting close to releasing his first board game, Imagine Majesty. Loegering says it’s helpful to discuss the game and gauge people’s reactions.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: An arts district that Ohio State University envisions as the new “front door” to its Columbus campus is a step closer to reality. A committee of university trustees late last month approved $147 million for design services and construction for a project estimated to cost $162 million. The Columbus Dispatch reports the district would be located near 15th Avenue and High Street. Plans include a renovated Weigel Hall to house the School of Music, as well as a new building for the Department of Theatre that will house a Moving Image Production program. Renderings shared with the trustees’ Master Planning and Facilities committee showed a new black box theater, a recital hall for the School of Music, a proscenium theater and rehearsal spaces.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Medical marijuana sales are continuing to climb in the state, topping $23 million in May and marking the eighth straight month of growth for the new industry. Figures from the Oklahoma Tax Commission show the state collected more than $1.6 million in May from the 7% excise tax on marijuana. Another $2 million was collected in state and local sales taxes. To date, medical marijuana sales have generated nearly $10.7 million for state coffers. Sales have grown significantly each month since dispensaries began selling cannabis in October. The number of people eligible to obtain the drug also is continuing to skyrocket. The Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority says it has approved nearly 130,000 patient licenses since August.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Wildlife commissioners have approved the state’s long-overdue Wolf Management Plan after years of revisions, contentious meetings, an outside mediator and half the stakeholders abandoning talks. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the plan, meant to govern how wolves are handled in areas of the state where they don’t enjoy federal protection under the Endangered Species Act, was approved Friday by the commission of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The state’s first wolf plan was issued in 2005 before any wolves had come back to the state after decades of extirpation due to hunting and trapping. The plan’s second version came out in 2010. The plan finally approved Friday came after hunters and ranchers squared off with environmentalists and wolf advocates over when, why and by whom wolves can be killed.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nFort Indiantown Gap: The lieutenant governor is opening the pool in the official residence he doesn’t use to children who typically wouldn’t have access to one. Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman announced Friday the new access to the pool at the State House. The residence is on National Guard property, about 25 miles from Harrisburg. Fetterman’s wife, Gisele, will run a program to teach water safety and coordinate wider use of the 30-by-40-foot pool. Any Pennsylvania group can request to swim there, but it must provide its own transportation and lifeguard. General Services built a ramp for disabled access, patched the pool, built a lifeguard stand and painted safety messages. Two diving boards were removed, and the pool basin was repainted. The site has a small picnic pavilion, changing rooms and bathrooms.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: Rhode Islanders have commemorated their ancestors’ role in helping spark the American Revolution. The annual Gaspee Days celebration began Saturday with a road race and a parade marking the 247th anniversary of the burning of a British ship – a daring act of rebellion that happened more than a year before the Boston Tea Party. On Sunday, costumed actors planned to recreate the June 9, 1772, torching of the HMS Gaspee by setting fire to a smaller model of the ship. Historians say the Gaspee’s burning was an important, if relatively little-known, event that helped touch off America’s war for independence from Britain. A local ship captain lured the schooner into shallow waters in Narragansett Bay a few miles south of Providence, where it ran aground.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The state is warning beachgoers to beware after a small number of Portuguese man-of-wars have been sighted. News outlets report the state Department of Natural Resources says people should avoid making contact with the highly venomous creatures – even if they’re dead. Experts say a dead man-of-war can create a sting strong enough to require medical attention. Authorities say the sting to humans is excruciatingly painful but rarely deadly. The creatures, which are marine hydrozoans and relatives of jellyfish, have recently been spotted on Sullivan’s Island and in Hilton Head. The DNR says the man-of-wars are pushed ashore by strong winds and have recently washed onto beaches from Florida to North Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: An area farmstead is raising animals more accustomed to the cold, high-altitude areas of Tibet and central Asia. The Rapid City Journal reports that Julie and Jim Smoragiewicz are raising 10 yaks at their Pennington County business, Yak Ridge Cabins and Farmstead. Julie Smoragiewicz says the yaks enjoy climbing the Black Hills, where they can cool down in creeks and under trees. The animals may get too hot in other areas of South Dakota. They also turn yak milk into soap and use their hides and fiber for throws and rugs. Smoragiewicz calls yaks sustainable animals because they eat less food and create less waste than cattle. The animals can also give birth on their own. She says yaks have unique personalities, and they’re fun to be around.\n\nTennessee\n\nClarksville: There tends to be lots of laughter in the home of DJ and Shanieke Pryor – after all, DJ is a professional stand-up comedian.But now, thanks to a video that’s gone viral of DJ and their 19-month old son Kingston Jierre chatting up a storm about the season finale of the TV show “Empire,” much of the world is laughing alongside them. The two say they shot the video about a month ago. It shows DJ lounging on the couch watching TV, with his young son sitting beside him, seemingly striking up a conversation about the show. “They need to work on that, right?” Pryor starts out by saying. “Yes,” Kingston says decidedly. “Did you understand it, though?” Pryor asks the child. Kingston responds: “No.” They go on to have a full-fledged “talk” filled with hand gestures and gibberish. Finally, DJ tells his son: “That’s exactly what I was thinking! We think a lot alike.”\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Fifty years after desegregation separated classmates at Booker T. Washington Technical High School, the class of 1969 turned its recent reunion into a belated convocation. The Dallas Morning News reports although some alumni had graduated from the all-black trade school, others had begun the process of desegregating the Dallas Independent School District by attending historically white schools closer to their own homes. Dozens of former students of the class of 1969 gathered to share memories in the state-of-the-art auditorium behind what is now Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts. The celebration also honored students who would have graduated in 1970 had officials not closed the school that year. Their unofficial commencement ceremony came complete with red-ribboned diplomas and candles to honor friends who had died.\n\nUtah\n\nMagna: A gathering at the Great Salt Lake in hopes of making it into the record books fell way short. Utah park officials invited people to a beach on the lake’s south end Saturday in an attempt to set the world record for the largest number of people floating together, unassisted, in a line at one time. The lake’s high salinity makes it easy to float on the water. According to the Guinness World Records website, Argentina holds the current record after 1,941 people successfully floated together on the surface of Lago Epecuen de Carhue in 2017. Utah State Parks manager Jim Wells said only about 300 people showed up for Saturday’s event, but “everybody had fun, (and) it ended up being a beautiful day.”\n\nVermont\n\nSpringfield: The state Fish & Wildlife Department is urging anglers and others not to disturb spawning sea lamprey in the Connecticut River and some of its tributaries. They are not to be confused with a separate population of sea lamprey that are controlled as a nuisance species in Lake Champlain. The department says sea lamprey spawn each spring in the main stem of the Connecticut River and in many tributaries. Officials say adult sea lamprey die shortly after returning to freshwater to spawn. The department says the larval lamprey live in freshwater for a few years burrowed in sandy substrate. At age 5, they move downstream to the ocean, where they feed on fish as parasites.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The governor has set a July 9 start date for a special legislative session on gun-related legislation after a recent, deadly shooting rampage in Virginia Beach. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, who announced the date Friday, says the best way to respond to the May 31 mass shooting at a municipal building is with “votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers.” He wants the Republican-led General Assembly to consider gun-control measures including universal background checks and a ban on silencers. Police say the gunman who fatally shot 12 people used a silencer. Northam can call the session but can’t dictate how it’s conducted. Republican leaders have given little indication they plan to follow his agenda. Instead, they’ve said they’ll propose tougher penalties for those who use guns to commit crimes.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: What should the city do with its public golf courses and the 528 acres of mostly green space they occupy? That’s a question being asked by the city, which commissioned a study looking at the future of the city’s municipal courses, the Seattle Times reports. Mayor Jenny Durkan insists it’s a question that has not been answered but said, “It would be a breach of our duty to the people of Seattle not to be really looking at what is best use of those golf courses, from everything to continuing as golf courses, to finding a way to use part of them as parks, to use part of them for affordable housing.” No one is suggesting, yet, that Seattle ditch one or more of its courses, but the fact that it’s even a topic of conversation has golfers worriedly making the case for their sport.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A West Virginia University robotics team has won a NASA competition for the second time in three years. The college on Friday announced the team’s win in NASA’s Moon to Mars Ice & Prospecting Challenge. WVU’s Mountaineer Ice Driller Automated System III beat out other machines made by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stevens Institute of Technology and Virginia Tech. The contest has the drilling systems extracting water from a test bed of ice, rock and soil. The competition is meant to help inform approaches for space exploration and development.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Flying a gay pride rainbow flag over the state Capitol for the first time Friday drew backlash from conservatives, including a pair of state lawmakers, who said it was divisive, while Democrats hailed it as a sign of inclusivity. The flag flap erupted after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers ordered the raising of the flag to recognize June as “Pride Month.” The move drew a fast rebuke from state Rep. Scott Allen, who tweeted, “Is this any more appropriate than erecting the Christian flag over the Capitol?” Democrats praised the raising of the flag, including state Sen. Tim Carpenter, one of five openly gay state lawmakers. Dozens of people stood outside the Capitol’s east wing Friday afternoon and cheered as the flag was raised on a pole just below the U.S. and Wisconsin flags.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: The park has recorded its third-busiest visitation during the month of May as the park began opening up for the busy summer tourist season. The National Park Service says the park recorded 434,385 visits last month. The total is 2.8% less than May 2018, which was the busiest May on record. So far in 2019, Yellowstone has counted more than 576,700 visits, which is up 1% from the same five-month period last year. The park in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho typically sees its most visitors during the summer months.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/29/beggars-night-stranger-hotel-stays-haunted-history-news-around-states/49302057/", "title": "Beggars' Night, 'Stranger' hotel stays: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Special tours Friday at Old Alabama Town, an otherwise charming group of restored 19th- and 20th-century structures, aim to show the frightful side of history. “It’s interwoven with character stories, as well as the history of the buildings and the people,” said Ella Martin, special events coordinator for Landmarks Foundation of Montgomery, who will be one of the tour guides for the Haunting at Old Alabama Town. Tickets are $25 at landmarksfoundation.com. There is limited space, and no tickets will be sold at the door. Tours will go through 10 buildings in Old Alabama Town’s Living Block, starting in Lucas Tavern, where guests be greeted by the ghost of Eliza Lucas, who ran the establishment. From there, a guide will lead guests to the Yancey dogtrot home, where Southern secession leader William Lowndes Yancey – the man Abraham Lincoln held responsible for the Civil War – lived and died. One of the darker stops will be Dr. Duncan’s office. “People were dying. Death was prevalent,” Martin said. “It’ll be a little scary because he’ll have his amputation kit and tell what he had to do take care of people since there weren’t any antibiotics around.” There’s also a gruesome story of a teenage horse rider from the Martin-Barnes House, whose life ended after being impaled on a fence. “He didn’t come home for supper,” Martin said. “He’ll be around to give his story. We’ll have a real horse there with its ghostly rider.” The tours are family-friendly but rated PG-13.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: An impromptu fundraiser to allow a library to purchase books amid cries of censorship has twice surpassed its goal. The fund was established after the Kenai City Council delayed accepting a $1,500 grant until the library director provide a list of the books that would be purchased with the money. The grant was intended to buy library materials related to health and wellness, including mental health, suicide prevention, self-care, and reference books about Medicare and Medicaid, the Peninsula Clarion reports. The council asked Kenai Community Library Director Katja Wolfe to provide an inventory of proposed purchases to be funded by the Collection Equity Award grant, from Region 5 of the Network of the National Library of Medicine. Kenai Peninsula residents Sovala Kisena and Todd Smith said they organized the crowdsourcing page to raise funds for the library and act as a positive response to the council’s action. “It’s the definition of censorship … and it bothered me,” Smith said. Before the council voted to postpone action at its Oct. 20 meeting, one resident questioned whether any of the books would be about the coronavirus, the Clarion reports. Another said he took particular issue with the term “equity” in the name of the award and asked if the grant would be “enhancing some sort of a federal agenda … which would not necessarily represent the views of the people of Kenai.” “I think equity can create division,” Peck said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, which is facing a spike in COVID-19 cases, is prohibiting trick-or-treating and haunted houses on Halloween. COVID-19 cases are up 140% over this time last year, according to an emergency declaration signed by community President Martin Harvier and posted on the community’s Facebook page. The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community has land adjacent to Scottsdale, Tempe, Fountain Hills and Mesa. The community was created in 1879 and represents two pre-American tribes: the Pima and Maricopa, according to the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona. The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community appears to be the first jurisdiction in Arizona to publicly ban trick-or-treating. Arizona health experts are advising that people who do go out on Halloween to take precautions. Banner Health, the state’s largest health system, advises people who do choose to take part in the tradition this year to remain outside and avoid crowds, such as Halloween parties. Children should also use hand sanitizer or wash their hands with soap and water after they get home and before they eat any treats, Banner Health officials said. Also, they should try to keep 6 feet away from anyone who doesn’t live with them.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state filed a consumer protection lawsuit Wednesday against a medical supplier for nearly $11 million for failing to deliver supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic, Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said. Rutledge said Wednesday that Med-Care Healthlink LLC of Suffolk, Virginia, and its representatives failed to deliver gowns, ventilators and face shields ordered in March and April 2020 to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. “This had been a company the state had worked with previously, and so therefore there was no reason to believe at that point that we would have something this significant occur,” Rutledge said. A phone call to the company rang unanswered. Deputy Attorney General Shannon Halijan said state officials were told at various times that the supplies had been bought by another entity, were held in China or were in other states. UAMS attorney Sherri Robinson said the company initially responded to questions about the supplies, then stopped after four to six months. UAMS ordered 1.5 million medical gowns and 60 ventilators, while the state ordered 2.5 million gowns, 500 ventilators and 1 million medical face shields, Rutledge said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nTahoe City: Drought fueled by climate change has dropped Lake Tahoe below its natural rim and halted flows into the Truckee River, a historically cyclical event that’s occurring sooner and more often than in the past, raising fears about what might be in store for the famed alpine lake. Scientists are concerned that the growing frequency of low-water extremes may become the new normal. They point to seasonal shifts in weather patterns causing precipitation that historically falls as snow to arrive in the form of rain atop the Sierra along the California-Nevada state line. “Our summers are lasting longer. Springs are coming sooner,” said Gregory Schladow, a water resource and environmental engineering professor who is the founding director of the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center. Over the past century, the amount of precipitation falling as snow has declined from 52% in 1910 to 33% in 2020 and is projected to drop below 20% by the end of the century, according to experts at the research center. Rain runs off the mountains instead of piling up as snow on mountaintops for safe storage until it is most needed in late spring and summer – the high Sierra equivalent of leaving a freezer door open atop a refrigerator. Since summer, boat ramps have been closed. Docks sit precariously above the receding lake’s dry bottom. Boat and kayaking rentals have fallen, and river rafting operations on the Truckee River had to end early. “Our season was short, and we fear there may not be one next summer,” said Toni Rudnick of the Truckee River Raft Company.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A federal judge has issued a restraining order against a suburban Denver county’s policy allowing parents to opt their children out of a mask mandate at school, finding that the rule violates the rights of students with disabilities who are vulnerable to COVID-19. U.S. District Judge John L. Kane on Tuesday called the Douglas County Board of Health order that allowed parents to opt their children out of mask-wearing a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which guarantees equal access to education for all. Kane’s order came in a hearing about a lawsuit filed by the Douglas County School District challenging the county Board of Health order. The school district, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of nine children with disabilities, argued that the board’s action allowed a relaxation of universal masking that placed those students at high risk of severe disease, The Denver Post reports. The school district also challenged the Board of Health’s relaxation of quarantine rules affecting students suspected of having the coronavirus. Kane’s order is not the end of the legal challenge, even though it sets aside the opt-out rule for now, and he set a Nov. 8 hearing about the case.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: An early 18th-century painting depicting Yale University’s namesake with an enslaved Black child has been returned to public display at one of its museums even as art experts investigate its origins and amid campus discussions about the school’s ties to slavery. The nearly life-size, oil-on-canvas portrait shows Elihu Yale and family members sitting at a table with tobacco pipes and wine glasses, while an enslaved boy with a metal collar locked around his neck looks on. In the background are playing children, believed to be Yale’s grandchildren. The Yale Center for British Art removed the painting from display in October 2020 to conduct a technical analysis, which continues and includes efforts to identify the boy, as well as to confirm the identities of the others. Over the years, some patrons expressed concerns about the depiction of an enslaved child, but that was not a reason for removing it, said Courtney Martin, the center’s director. For several months, the painting was replaced by a 2016 work of art by Titus Kaphar that included a portrait of just the enslaved boy, without the metal collar, on top of what appears to be a crumpled version of the original painting. There is no evidence Elihu Yale owned slaves. His papers, including financial records, have not been found. But experts believe Yale oversaw slave trading and other commerce in India. There are other paintings showing Yale with slaves, and his relatives in New Haven were slave owners, researchers say.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The Delaware Art Museum is reprising an exhibition 50 years after its premiere, in the wake of a nearly yearlong occupation of the city by the National Guard. National Guardsmen focused primarily on West Center City, a mostly Black community, after rioting and unrest following Dr. Martin Luther King’s murder. The trauma of those nine months in 1968 left the community reeling, and Percy Ricks, an artist and longtime educator, had something he thought people needed to see: a momentous exhibition of drawings, paintings, prints and photographs created by 66 Black artists. Ricks, the first Black art instructor in Wilmington’s public schools, was a driving force behind the city’s art scene. He went on to found arts and humanities collective Aesthetic Dynamics Inc., which aimed to highlight Black artists and their contributions to the arts. Still, the organization’s inaugural exhibition struggled to find a home as Black artists were shut out of institutions and as segregation persisted across Delaware. It eventually premiered at the Wilmington Armory but has largely been forgotten and overlooked by historians and institutions. Now, the Delaware Art Museum – which at the time overlooked requests to stage the exhibition – is trying to reconcile its initial disregard and to illustrate the cultural legacy Ricks left behind.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Earlier this month, a federal judge held two top officials from the D.C. Department of Corrections in contempt over a delay in handing over medical records for a Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendant. Now, the Department of Justice says he appears to have “invented” the emergency that led to that decision, WUSA-TV reports. U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth hauled D.C. Jail Warden Wanda Patten and D.C. Department of Corrections Director Quincy Booth into court Oct. 13 to explain why the jail hadn’t complied with his order the prior week to turn over an orthopedic specialist’s notes about a hand surgery for Christopher Worrell. The Florida man has been in D.C. Jail custody since his arrest in March on multiple felony charges in connection with the insurrection, accused of joining other members of the Proud Boys in storming the U.S. Capitol and assaulting federal officers with pepper gel spray. In May, Worrell fell in his cell and broke his pinky finger. In filings, he claimed officials didn’t get him the proper medical treatment, and he’d need surgery because of the delay. On Wednesday, the Justice Department said a Howard University Hospital doctor determined Worrell’s hand had already healed normally, and he was suffering no pain or loss of function. Prosecutors said his records show he was “primarily dissatisfied with the appearance of his pinky finger” and demanded surgery even after the doctor told him the risks could outweigh the benefits.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state has withheld funding from two school districts over their coronavirus mask mandates, flouting threats from White House officials who warned that such penalties would violate federal law. School officials in Alachua and Broward counties on Wednesday said the state docked school board salaries and overall funding in amounts equal to federal aid packages meant to blunt the state’s sanctions on mask requirements. This month, more than $164,000 was withheld from the Alachua school district, and more than $455,000 was withheld from Broward. The penalties are the latest development in an ongoing feud between the White House and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration over coronavirus regulations. The Florida State Board of Education earlier this month approved plans to withhold a month’s salary from school board members in districts with classroom mask requirements and reduce overall funding if those counties receive a federal grant intended to offset the state’s fines. The announcements come days after the U.S. Department of Education sent a letter to Florida warning that deducting money from districts that received the grant would violate federal law. The letter added that the federal government “is prepared to initiate enforcement action to stop these impermissible state actions.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A high school is marking its new name and a larger building after students said the old name was offensive and pushed to remove it. Midtown High School hosted a ceremony this week to highlight the new name of the former Henry W. Grady High School, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Students had complained for years that their school was named after Grady, a newspaper editor who advocated for white supremacy after the Civil War. While credited by many with helping in the rebirth of Atlanta after the war, Grady also wrote editorials and gave speeches that ignored the plight of Black people in the region. Grady was an editor and part-owner of The Atlanta Constitution.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Starting next week, the city will allow outdoor and indoor entertainment venues to operate at full capacity with vaccinated attendees, the mayor said Wednesday as he announced the latest measures easing coronavirus restrictions. Patrons will have to wear masks, Mayor Rick Blangiardi said at a news conference. No food will be allowed, only water, he said. The change will take effect Nov. 3, in time for the next University of Hawaii football home game a few days later, when the Warriors host San Jose State. Blangiardi said the city plans to allow the Honolulu Marathon to go ahead Dec. 12, though the race will be required to stagger runners’ starting times. Competitors will leave the starting line in groups of no more than 200 people at a time, he said. He expressed confidence that the city was ready to relax its rules, noting Honolulu has one of the highest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country. As of Wednesday, 95% of the population 12 and older had received at least one shot. The mayor said the city still has public safety and public health at top of mind, and it will be ready to tighten restrictions again if COVID-19 hospitalization metrics deteriorate. “This is about going forward and living with it,” the mayor said of the virus.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The company that successfully brought genetically modified potatoes to the market announced an agreement Thursday to help a plant breeding company grow strawberries they say will stay fresh longer and have a longer growing season. J.R. Simplot Co. and California-based Plant Sciences Inc., both privately held companies, said they expect to launch the first commercially available, gene-edited strawberries within a few years. U.S. growers produced $2.2 billion in strawberries in 2020, mostly in California, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But consumers discarded an estimated 35% of the crop due to spoilage. Simplot and Plant Sciences officials said genetically modified strawberries will help reduce waste and make them available to consumers much of the year. The strawberries will only contain genes from strawberries, selecting desirable traits that have been cultivated over decades. “It’s the same technology we’re working on with potatoes,” said Doug Cole, director of Marketing and Biotech Affairs at Simplot. There is no evidence that genetically modified organisms, known as GMOs, are unsafe to eat, but changing the genetic code of foods presents an ethical issue for some. Federal agencies approved a previous gene-modifying technique on Simplot potatoes. Now, more than 1.1 billion pounds of the potatoes are sold in some 40 states and 4,000 supermarkets and 9,000 restaurants.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state Senate on Thursday night approved a weakened and criticized plan to preserve ramifications for those who refuse to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Democrats who control both houses of the General Assembly struggled through caustic debate all week in pushing a COVID-19 carve-out of the Illinois Health Care Right of Conscience Act. The Senate endorsed the plan 31-24 on the last day of the Legislature’s fall session. Initially approved in the 1970s to protect physicians from repercussions for refusing, based on religious beliefs, to perform abortions, supporters argue the law was never intended to give similar protections to people who refuse to get a preventive shot in a worldwide pandemic. “Your right to exercise your religious belief is not always without consequence, and the Health Care Right of Conscience is not a defense in certain circumstances,” Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, said during floor debate. “You’ve asked where we draw the line. The line of my personal liberty ends at the beginning of your nose.” Lawsuits have sprung up – nine alone in which Gov. J.B. Pritzker or other public agencies are defendants – in which repercussions, such as losing a job, are being contested based on the right of conscience law. The proposal, which now goes to Pritzker, doesn’t require anyone to be vaccinated. It targets the law’s language prohibiting retribution, such as dismissal from a job, in the case of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: A hotel offers guests a chance to enter the “Upside Down” with themed accommodations based on the Netflix series “Stranger Things,” set in the fictional Indiana town of Hawkins. Entering Graduate Bloomington yields a few subtle hints. The hotel’s ground floor mixes framed Eggo waffle art and a photo of the faded Starcourt Mall facade with older references to famous Hoosiers and pop culture. Its restaurant, Poindexter, offers an Upside Down burger and Demogorgon smoothie on the menu. And on the third floor, spaces once occupied by rooms 318 and 320 now house the “Upside Down Experience,” a suite with detailed recreations of two key settings from the sci-fi hit. The suite’s showstopper is an alphabet and Christmas light wall, like the one Winona Ryder’s character, Joyce Byers, uses to communicate with her captured son, Will. The Wheelers’ basement serves as the suite’s bedroom, complete with a Dungeons and Dragons game. General Manager Corey Parton said the suite, which opened to the public Tuesday, is meant to be an immersive experience. Guests are loaned Polaroid cameras for an ’80s documentation of their visits, as well as Eleven’s Eggo Extravaganza – a recreation of the main character’s iconic meal of three waffles doused in whipped cream and candy. A stay also includes two passes to the nearby WonderLab Science Museum, as a nod to the main characters’ love for science. Graduate also donates 11% of the suite’s profits to WonderLab.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Beggars’ Night is nearly here. Trick-or-treaters in the city go out Oct. 30, not Oct. 31, in a quirky tradition started about 80 years ago to curb the violence and vandalism that had become an annual problem. In the 1930s, a long list of teenage miscreants who’d spent the night soaping windows, setting fires and tossing bricks at homes was published every year in the Nov. 1 newspaper. Kathryn Krieg, then the director of recreation for the Des Moines Playground Commission (now the Parks and Recreation Department), proposed naming Oct. 30 “Beggars’ Night” and sending children out to perform for homeowners after saying “tricks-for-eats.” Children were to receive a treat “only if such a ‘trick’ as a song, a poem, a stunt or a musical number, either solo or in group participation, is presented.” The event reversed the conventional tradition of asking homeowners to provide a treat to avoid being tricked or pranked. Beggars’ Night gained traction and in 1942 was promoted as a way for children to play a part in the war effort. The rallying headline “Kids! - Don’t help the Axis on Halloween” topped an Oct. 29, 1942, Des Moines Register article. It also chided teenagers for soaping windows, saying that “soap wasted … means waste of an ingredient used in manufacture of high explosives.”\n\nKansas\n\nManhattan: Construction on a national laboratory to study diseases that can be spread from animals to humans has been delayed, federal officials said. Officials said earlier this year that the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Manhattan would be substantially completed by this October. Now, the construction is expected to finish next spring, with commission of the laboratory in the summer, The Manhattan Mercury reports. The Department of Homeland Security and the United States Department of Agriculture are collaborating on opening the facility. A Homeland Security official said technology upgrades and equipment installation are taking longer than expected. “The technology efficacy of the building is of the utmost importance and is a critical aspect of standing up this facility,” Tim Barr, NBAF program manager for Homeland Security, said in a statement. “We are testing individual systems and testing again as systems are integrated with other systems, so it is very difficult to predict how long it will take to ensure each system is working as intended given the complexities of the facility.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture began managing operations and maintenance in the facility earlier this month.\n\nKentucky\n\nHazard: The superintendent of Hazard Independent Schools said that “appropriate disciplinary action has been taken” after photos surfaced showing students giving lap dances to staff and wearing scant clothing as part of Hazard High School’s homecoming week festivities. Students and staff took part in a “Man Pageant” and “Costume Day” on Tuesday, according to Hazard High School’s Facebook page. Photos that were subsequently taken down from the athletics department’s Facebook page showed students in underclothing giving lap dances to faculty and staff, including Principal Donald “Happy” Mobelini, who is also mayor of the Perry County city. Other photos on the athletics page that also were later taken down showed female students dressed up in “Hooters” outfits and students and staff appearing to paddle one another. Mobelini, the principal and mayor, did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday. “Um. Exactly what is going on here, y’all? C’mon Hazard,” Nema Brewer, cofounder of education advocacy group KY 120 United, wrote Tuesday night in a tweet that showed the lap dance photos. “Get it together.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: Violence at a high school has stopped since a group of fathers started patrolling the campus, and the dads are aiming to expand their initiative into a movement across the parish. “Dads on Duty” started in response to a series of fights at Southwood High School in September that led to the arrests of about two dozen students. Michael LaFitte gathered other parents after a Sept. 17 incident to form a strategy for combating violence at the school. Expected to meet for 45 minutes that weekend, the group solidified a plan four hours later. “At the end of the meeting, there was a group of fathers who decided to just go to the school and patrol and walk around and show a strong male presence on the campus,” LaFitte said. “I don’t care how old you are or what size you are – it’s something about seeing a man, a positive male figure, a father, your daddy or whatever you want to call them, at the school. It will make you straighten up and fly right.” On the Monday after the meeting, a group of fathers showed up before the 7:30 a.m. bell to usher students inside. Dads have been there every morning since, with about 40 now taking shifts to patrol during lunch and after school, too. They’ve tried to assume the roles of “cool uncles” to the students, according to LaFitte. He said there have not been any fights on campus since they started.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Forestry officials are asking residents who want to decorate for the fall and winter to be on the lookout for common invasive plants. The plants are sometimes used in wreaths and garlands and other decorations, according to the Maine Department of Agricultural, Conservation and Forestry. State law prohibits the import or sale of invasive plants in any form. The forestry department said the most common invasive plants in the decorations are Asiatic bittersweet and multiflora rose. The plants can cause environmental damage and overtake forests, wetlands and backyards. The state said the plants are also difficult to control and can re-sprout after being cut. It’s asking decorators to use native species, such as winterberry holly, red twig dogwood and American mountain ash.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: The city will move forward with its plans for a multimillion-dollar indoor sports facility, despite calls to slow down the project. The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to enter into an agreement with Eastern Sports Management to develop the structure, along with authorizing city staff members to prepare a demolition contract for Municipal Stadium, which sits on the property where the structure will be built. The money will come from the city’s fiscal year 2021 general fund surplus. Early estimates for the new indoor turf facility were around $7 million, but it is now estimated to cost between $10 million and $20 million, according to city officials. The city will be responsible for tearing down Municipal Stadium, which will cost about $100,000.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A hospital says someone hacked into its employee email system, potentially exposing the personal information of thousands of patients. UMass Memorial Health notified patients earlier this month if their information was involved in the breach, which occurred between June 2020 and January. The personal data included Social Security numbers, insurance information and medical information. More than 200,000 patients and health plan participants could have been affected by the breach, according to a federal database of cybersecurity incidents at medical facilities. The hospital said it had investigated the incident but couldn’t determine how much of the personal information might have been stolen. Affected patients will receive free credit monitoring and data protection assistance.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state Supreme Court has agreed to take another look at a law that allows communities to collect millions of dollars from poor criminal defendants to pay salaries, keep lights on, and wax floors in courthouses up and down the state. The issue is whether it’s unconstitutional, especially when a judge knows a conviction will bring in cash and please local officials who count on the money to ease budget pressures. The Supreme Court issued an order Wednesday saying it would hear arguments in a case from Alpena County. Travis Johnson was ordered to pay $1,200 in local court costs for a pair of convictions. The court especially wants to hear whether the law “deprives criminal defendants of their right to appear before an impartial judge.” A judge can order people convicted of crimes to pay a portion of a court’s operating costs, such as salaries, utilities and other services. Someone who is acquitted doesn’t get a bill for overhead, nor do parties in a civil lawsuit. If prosecutors lose a case, money isn’t deducted from their budget. From 2016 through 2019, courts collected $172 million, nearly 75% of it in district courts, which handle traffic tickets, drunken driving cases and other misdemeanors mostly committed by people who can least afford it.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A judge has denied a defense request to dismiss the most serious charge against a former suburban police officer who said she meant to use a Taser instead of a handgun when she fatally shot Black motorist Daunte Wright. Former Brooklyn Center police Officer Kim Potter will stand trial in Hennepin County on first- and second-degree manslaughter charges in the death of Wright, who was shot after being stopped April 11 for a traffic violation. Potter, who is white, was initially charged with second-degree manslaughter, which requires a finding that she acted with “culpable negligence” in Wright’s death. Prosecutors later added a first-degree manslaughter count against Potter, alleging she recklessly handled a firearm and endangered Wright’s safety when death or great bodily harm was reasonably foreseeable. In allowing the first-degree manslaughter charge, Hennepin County Judge Regina Chu said Wednesday that she only had to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and make a finding of “probable cause,” meaning it was more probable than not that a crime was committed. She noted the state will have a much higher burden of proving the crime beyond a reasonable doubt during a trial, the Star Tribune reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Two new lawsuits claim hundreds of children have been exposed to dangerous lead levels through the drinking water in the capital city, which has been facing water system problems for years. One lawsuit represents one child, while the other has hundreds of children as plaintiffs. The suits, filed last week in federal court in Jackson, say the city and the state Health Department have made “conscience-shocking decisions and have shown deliberate indifference that have led to Plaintiffs’ exposure to toxic lead in Jackson’s drinking water.” One of the attorneys who filed the lawsuits, Corey M. Stern, has represented people who sued over tainted water in Flint, Michigan. Attorneys for Jackson are reviewing the lawsuits, and “the city will eventually have a response,” city spokesman Justin Vicory said. The lawsuits seek unspecified amounts of money for punitive damages and compensatory damages, plus attorneys’ fees and “other relief the Court deems appropriate.” Jackson has about 160,000 residents, and the city has long-standing problems with water quality and distribution. Since July 1, Jackson has been under a safe drinking water consent order with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which sets a schedule for work on water treatment facilities and delivery systems.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mark McCloskey said he does not support allowing abortions for young girls who become pregnant through rape or incest. McCloskey, a St. Louis personal injury lawyer who gained national attention after he and his wife waved guns at racial injustice protesters last summer, made the remarks last week at a forum in Osage Beach. “I’ve got a client who was raped by an uncle when she was 13 years old, had the child; she finished high school, finished college and got a master’s degree,” McCloskey said. “That child she would have aborted finished high school, finished college and now has a master’s degree. … I don’t believe in any exceptions.” McCloskey did not specifically address whether he would support an abortion to save the life of the mother, The Kansas City Star reports. He said it has always bothered him that people who oppose the death penalty often support abortion rights. “The justices of the Supreme Court in the most heinous crimes don’t have the right to decide who should live and die,” he said. “But every 13-year-old girl on the street should be able to decide the fate of the life of their child?” The subject of abortion exceptions famously sank the U.S. Senate campaign of another Missouri candidate in 2012. Asked if he supported abortions for women who were raped, Republican nominee Todd Akin, who died this month, responded: “If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A commission created to allocate federal COVID-19 relief funding to help stabilize the state’s economy recommended Wednesday that the governor allocate $4 million to help recruit new medical workers to Montana. But members rejected a proposal to spend $13 million on retention bonuses for existing hospital workers. The health care worker recruitment program would allow health care providers to cover up to $12,500 in moving expenses for new hires, along with another up to $4,300 to cover the taxes on that payment, said Scott Mendenhall, the state’s new American Rescue Plan Act program director. The program could recruit another 238 medical employees to the state, which has seen a surge in COVID-19 cases since mid-July. New workers would have to remain in their jobs in Montana for at least a year, or they would have to repay the money, Mendenhall said. Democratic House Minority Leader Kim Abbott, a member of the committee, argued the proposal overlooked members of the existing health care workforce, who are stressed and frustrated by seeing traveling workers receiving more pay than they receive. Abbott proposed recommending that the state set aside $13 million in federal relief funding for retention bonuses for employees of inpatient hospitals who stuck with their jobs during the pandemic.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s largest and oldest prison lost running water because of a plumbing issue, forcing inmates and staffers to use bottled water and portable toilets and raising concerns about conditions at the facility. Officials at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln said they had to shut off the water Tuesday when they discovered numerous leaks in the facility’s old, brittle pipes. Laura Strimple, a spokeswoman for the state corrections department, said in an email Thursday that crews had restored water service to the prison. State Sen. Terrell McKinney visited the prison Wednesday and said he saw toilets filled with human waste. He said he was told prisoners were getting two water bottles a day, but some complained that they had only received one, and a few prisoners were using mop buckets to shower. “From what I saw, it was horrible,” McKinney said. “You could smell it when you walked in.” Prison officials said the problem demonstrates the need for a new, $230 million facility proposed by Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts. But some state lawmakers, including McKinney, an Omaha Democrat, argue that a new prison isn’t necessary, especially when other states are closing prisons to save money.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Tourists are returning, events are expanding, and a wave of wagering is washing over the state, where a September casino winnings report showed gambling at pre-pandemic levels. Casinos statewide took in almost $1.2 billion in house winnings in September, the Nevada Gaming Control Board reported Wednesday. The figure marked seven straight months of $1 billion or more – one short of a record eight-month streak set in late 2006 and early 2007, before the Great Recession. Tourism officials in Las Vegas reported separately that hotel occupancy increased to 73% last month and that more than 2.9 million people visited the region, down 15% from the same month in 2019 but up 72% from 1.7 million in September 2020. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority characterized the month as a “stabilization” and noted that nightly hotel room rates have climbed to the highest during the “pandemic era,” to an average of $155. Increased vehicle traffic on Interstate 15 at the California-Nevada border reflected a return of domestic tourists, but regular international air travel has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. Federal authorities have set vaccination requirements for foreign, non-immigrant adults flying to the U.S. beginning Nov. 8.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s Executive Council on Wednesday approved using federal funds to boost COVID-19 vaccination efforts in a vote that involved much less drama – and money – than previous requests. Two weeks ago, the Republican-led council that approves state contracts turned down $27 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over concerns that language in the grants would have bound the state to follow federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19. More than 100 vaccine-mandate opponents packed the room, and nine were arrested for interrupting the meeting. But protestors were absent Wednesday when the the council unanimously voted to use $4.7 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funding to help community health centers and regional public health networks set up school-based and community vaccination clinics. “This will be an additional resource that is needed,” Republican Councilor Joe Kenney said. But Cinde Warmington, the lone Democrat on the council, noted that using the ARPA funds instead of the CDC money diverts money that could have been used for other programs. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette agreed.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOceanport: Netflix has confirmed it will enter the bidding for a 289-acre tract of Fort Monmouth, where it hopes to create a mix of soundstages, post-production buildings and backlot sets. Gov. Phil Murphy supports Netflix’s bid, according to an account in The New York Times, the first to report on the development. In a statement to the Asbury Park Press on Tuesday, Netflix said: “America’s first movie studio was in New Jersey, and today it’s home to many talented people working in entertainment.” The world’s first film studio was part of Thomas Edison’s laboratories in West Orange – now part of the U.S. National Park Service. Years later, but before the motion picture industry moved to the warmer and stable climate of Los Angeles, the capital of American filmmaking was Fort Lee. Fort Monmouth was formerly the base for the U.S. Signal Corps and over its long, nearly 100-year history contributed to many technological advances. Radar was developed at the fort, and it was the first place to bounce an electronic signal off the moon. The fort closed in 2011 and has been undergoing redevelopment and a return to private hands. Prospective purchasers have until Jan. 12 to submit a proposal to buy what is called the Mega Parcel, which sits in parts of Eatontown and Oceanport.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: School bus drivers in the city have gone on strike, shutting down much of the public school transportation system that serves 3,500 students. Current drivers picketed the office of southern New Mexico district school bus contractor STS New Mexico on Thursday, demanding better pay and working conditions. Bus driver shortages have strained schools across the state as education officials struggle to hire and train more workers. Some offer free training, signing bonuses and other perks for new employees. The shortage has led the company to push mechanics into driving service, meaning there aren’t mechanics to fix buses when they break down, a bus driver union representative said. “We’re just going to do the best that we can do,” STS General Manager Van Wamel said. “This shift in focus is unfortunate, but we are confident that it is temporary,” Las Cruces Public Schools Superintendent Ralph Ramos said in a statement. District officials told parents by text message Thursday to “please make alternative transportation arrangements if possible.” District spokeswoman Kelly Jameson said special education students with transportation specified in their individualized learning plans won’t be affected by the strike.\n\nNew York\n\nMechanicville: A furry, four-legged scourge is wreaking havoc on a Hudson Valley town’s water supply, forcing local officials to scramble to keep up. The culprits are a family of beavers that has been building dams near Mechanicville, impeding the flow of water from the primary stream that empties into the small reservoir on which the town depends for drinking water. “I wouldn’t call it a fight. I call it a very challenging opponent, and we play a game of chess,” Mechanicville Public Works Commissioner Anthony Gotti told the Albany Times-Union. “I take his dam down. I’ve got to figure out where he goes next.” Towns like Mechanicville, about 20 miles up the Hudson River from Albany, don’t have the luxury of relying on large reservoirs fed by numerous tributaries. That has made the problem more pressing, as beavers are capable of building a dam in as little as two nights that can slow water flow and create algae in the reservoir. The challenge is complicated by the fact that the dams, which consist of tightly wound branches secured by mud and leaves, usually must be removed by hand, as work crews can’t bring heavy equipment into the forest without building a road, the Times-Union reports. The beaver, a protected species, became New York state’s official mammal in the 1970s and was once nearly extinct.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: U.S. Sen. Richard Burr and his brother-in-law are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for potential insider trading – a case that stems from their abrupt sales of financial holdings during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, according to recent federal court filings. Burr, a Republican, is among several lawmakers from both parties who faced outrage over their aggressive trading in early 2020, before the economic threat from the virus was widely known. That fueled accusations that the members of Congress were acting on inside information gained through their official duties to benefit financially, which is illegal under a law known as the STOCK Act. Burr was previously investigated by the Trump administration’s Justice Department for offloading $1.6 million from his portfolio in January and February 2020. The department cleared him of wrongdoing almost a year later – on Jan. 19, Donald Trump’s last full day in office. But the SEC continued to investigate Burr, according to court documents filed in the Southern District of New York that were first made public last week. The agency enforces federal securities law. Attorneys for Burr as well as for Gerald Fauth, the brother of Burr’s wife, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Burr has previously denied any wrongdoing.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: A lawmaker was barred from boarding a flight at Minot International Airport this week after a run-in with a security agent during a pat-down. Republican state Rep. Jeff Hoverson said he and his wife were planning to travel Monday for their anniversary. He said a Transportation Security Administration agent said he was going to give him a pat-down but did not ask permission. Hoverson said he moved the agent’s hand away. TSA said in a statement that the pat-down was initiated when Hoverson set off the alarm in the screening machine. The agency said Hoverson objected during the pat-down and called the police. He eventually complied, but the airline made the decision to deny boarding, TSA said. Hoverson said everyone overreacted, including himself. A pastor who’s among the most far-right legislators in the GOP-controlled Legislature, he introduced legislation last session to repeal mask mandates in the state. He also unsuccessfully sponsored legislation that would make it a felony to help women get abortions, including by giving them rides to abortion clinics. And as a freshman legislator two years ago, Hoverson protested a prayer by a Hindu cleric, saying he didn’t “want to be compelled to pray for a false god.”\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A roller derby team that has called itself the Cleveland Guardians since 2013 sued the city’s Major League Baseball team in federal court Wednesday, alleging that the switch from Indians to Guardians infringes on its trademark. “A Major League club cannot simply take a smaller team’s name and use it for itself,” the lawsuit said. “There cannot be two ‘Cleveland Guardians’ teams in Cleveland, and, to be blunt, Plaintiff was here first.” The Cleveland Indians announced in July that the team would assume the name Guardians for the 2022 season after years of criticism that the Indians name and Chief Wahoo logo were racist. The new name, the team has said, was influenced in part by the two large art deco statues that appear to stand guard on a bridge spanning the Cuyahoga River. The all-gender roller derby team is based in the Cleveland suburb of Parma. It formally registered the name Cleveland Guardians in 2017 with the Ohio secretary of state and has been selling team merchandise since 2014, the lawsuit said. The baseball team filed a trademark application for the Guardians name in the East African island nation of Mauritius, “effectively hiding the application unless one knew where to look,” it said. In a statement Wednesday, the Indians said officials “believe there is no conflict between the parties and their ability to operate in their respective business areas.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A federal judge has temporarily blocked parts of a new state law that makes it a misdemeanor for people to unlawfully obstruct a public street or highway during a protest. U.S. District Judge Robin Cauthron also put on hold Wednesday a provision that could result in fines of up $50,000 for groups or organizations “found to be a conspirator” with someone who violates any one of a number of state laws pertaining to riots and unlawful assemblies. The injunction temporarily prevents the enforcement of these parts of the law as the court weighs its constitutionality. A key provision of the new law that grants immunity to drivers who run people over is not being put on hold. The Oklahoma chapter of the NAACP sued Attorney General John O’Connor and Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater, alleging parts of the law are unconstitutional because it will limit protests and have a chilling effect on free speech. The law was passed this year by the Republican-controlled state Legislature and signed by GOP Gov. Kevin Stitt shortly after an incident in July in which a pickup truck pulling a horse trailer drove through Black Lives Matter protesters on Interstate 244 in Tulsa. Three people were seriously injured, including a 33-year-old man who fell from an overpass and was left paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A lawsuit has been filed saying the residency requirements for the state’s assisted suicide law violate the U.S. Constitution. Oregon was the first state to legalize medical aid in dying in 1997, when it allowed adult residents with a terminal diagnosis and prognosis of no more than six months to live to end their lives by taking a lethal dose of prescribed medication. The national advocacy organization Compassion & Choices and an Oregon Health & Science University professor of family medicine filed the new lawsuit. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports experts believe the legal action could have broad implications as the first challenge in the nation to raise the question of whether such residency requirements are constitutional. Oregon’s law was the basis of the laws that have since been adopted in eight other states and Washington, D.C. California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Vermont and Washington state allow aid in dying for residents of their states only. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Portland on Thursday asks the court to prohibit Oregon officials from enforcing the residency provision of the law. It says the residency requirement violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV of the Constitution and the Commerce Clause in Article I.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state Senate on Wednesday approved legislation that would bar municipalities in the nation’s No. 2 natural gas state from adopting building codes that prohibit gas hookups or otherwise restricting utility service based on the energy source. The Republican-penned bill passed 35-15 and heads to the state House of Representatives for consideration there. The chamber approved it without debate, with six Democrats joining all 29 Republicans in favor of it. The bill defends a homegrown energy source in Pennsylvania as some states, cities and counties elsewhere begin looking at all-electric building codes that exclude gas infrastructure as a way to fight climate change and accelerate progress toward a carbon-free electricity grid. The vast Marcellus Shale reservoir beneath Pennsylvania is the nation’s most prolific natural gas reservoir, and the state has helped subsidize the build-out of gas infrastructure to help the industry find new customers. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Gene Yaw, R-Lycoming, said the legislation ensures the state controls any decision to restrict the use of an energy source in housing and commercial buildings. Combustion of natural gas emits carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, while natural gas contains methane, which is far more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, according to researchers.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: The thousands of drivers who use the Route 37 highway on their way to work every day probably have no idea they are passing over the graves of some people who died in the late 1800s and early 1900s at state institutions. Route 37 was built between 1963 and 1969 over part of the institution cemetery called State Farm Cemetery #1, which has about 1,200 gravesites containing 3,000 people, WPRI-TV reports. A thousand of those graves should have been moved, said Charles St. Martin, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. “It was during a time when regulations were far more lax than they are now,” he wrote in an email. “This would never happen now.” There were no grave markers when the highway was built because the original grave markers were wooden stakes that had rotted away, St. Martin said. Some of the grave markers had been destroyed by fire too. The cemetery was near railroad tracks, and sparks from the steam engines set fires that consumed the markers, according to a description of the cemetery by the Rhode Island Historical Cemetery Commission. The cemetery deteriorated and became overgrown. In 2006, when dozens of coffins were exposed due to rain, the transportation department realized the graves were there, St. Martin said. The agency does not plan to move the graves that are under Route 37.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The governor wants to put $500 million of federal COVID-19 relief money toward fixing and improving water systems across the state, with priority given to rural and smaller systems. Gov. Henry McMaster announced his idea Thursday, saying a modern clean drinking water and sewer system is vital to citizens and to bring in businesses. “In rural South Carolina, water and sewer is the key to life,” McMaster said at a news conference in Great Falls. The $500 million is part of about $2.4 billion in pandemic relief money that the state can spend. The General Assembly will make the final decision on where the money goes. Senate and House committees discussing the relief money have brought up the idea of water system building and repair, but with a big difference: requiring local systems to also put up money for the effort. The state has more than 260 water systems and 200 wastewater systems, and their average age is approaching 50 years old, officials said. McMaster said a local match wasn’t in his plan. “Some of these communities just don’t have the money,” the governor said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem issued an executive order Wednesday aimed at ensuring that state employees can easily obtain medical and religious exemptions from federal vaccine mandates. Noem said the move was necessary to ensure employees aren’t forced to get COVID-19 vaccinations under President Joe Biden’s initiative, which covers not only people directly paid by federal contracts but also anyone who works to support them. State lawmakers have said South Dakotans are being denied medical and religious exemptions from feds and have called for a special session to stop the order. Noem spokesman Jordan Overturf said Noem’s exemptions are “explicit and offer a clear path” for state workers to opt out of the shots. For medical exemptions, state employees need a note from a doctor stating that the vaccination is too risky because of health reasons. For religious exemptions, workers need to fill out and sign a form stating they object to the COVID-19 vaccine based “on religious grounds, which includes moral, ethical, and philosophical beliefs or principles.” Once either forms are submitted, the exemptions are automatic, Overturf said. Noem said she is talking to lawmakers about extending those protections to private employees.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A new piece of legislation aims to grow and preserve the city’s beleaguered tree canopy by creating a dedicated stream of revenue to help fund the effort. Nashville’s continued growth and development has come at an environmental cost. Between 2008 and 2016, the city lost 918 acres of tree canopy to development – about 13% of its urban canopy, according to a 2018 report. More than 30,000 metric tons of carbon were released into Davidson County’s atmosphere as a result. The bill, drafted by Mayor John Cooper’s administration, would create a dedicated revenue stream for tree restoration by allocating 1% of annual revenue from each of three funding sources: building permits, grading permits and general obligation bond-funded construction projects. The tree restoration and maintenance fund would be capped at $2.5 million annually, and the legislation would “sunset” June 30, 2023, allowing an opportunity for future review and potential renewal if deemed necessary. The bill will go before the Metro Council for its first of three readings Tuesday. The majority of tree loss in Davidson County occurs on private property, according to the bill.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: A museum dedicated to telling the history of Juneteenth with a national scope is set to be built in the city. The National Juneteenth Museum will be built as part of a mixed-use development, the city of Fort Worth said in a news release Tuesday. When President Joe Biden signed a bill into law over the summer making June 19 a federal holiday to commemorate the end of slavery in the U.S., those by his side included Opal Lee, a 95-year-old Fort Worth woman who spent years rallying people to join her push to see the day get that recognition. The city said Lee has been leading the charge for the new museum, which will be built on land that currently houses her Fort Worth Juneteenth Museum. “To have lived long enough to see my walking and talking make an impact is one thing, but to know that a state-of-the-art museum that will house the actual pen that President Biden used to sign the bill, and many other exhibits, is coming to pass as well – I could do my holy dance again,” Lee said. The city said the museum will be led by a collaboration that includes activists, researchers and historians.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The Southwest Symphony opens its 41st season Friday with the annual Halloween Spooktacular, featuring the music of John Williams. Maestro Lucas Darger returns for his sixth season as music director and conductor. Over the years, Darger and his predecessor Gary Caldwell have offered audiences an smorgasbord of Williams’ works. The composer best known for his film scores has received Academy Awards, Grammys, Golden Globes and Emmys. “Our ‘haunted’ orchestra will feature Williams’ music with selections from ‘Star Wars,’ ‘Jurassic Park,’ ‘Superman,’ ‘E.T.,’ ‘Saving Private Ryan’ and many more,” said Scott Raine, marketing director of the Southwest Symphony. The traditional Handel’s “Messiah” will be returning in early December. Prokofiev’s “Peter and the Wolf” is slated to be presented in early February, followed by award-winning international flutist Demarre McGill in March.\n\nVermont\n\nRockingham: The town is planning to spend up to $20,000 to save the steeple and a stained glass window from an old church in the village of Bellows Falls that is slated for demolition. The Brattleboro Reformer reports the Rockingham Select Board voted unanimously to spend up to $15,000 to remove the steeple from the Methodist Meeting House and up to $5,000 to remove and crate the stained glass window of “The Parable of the Sower.” Town Manager Scott Pickup said what will happen to the historic items after they are removed has not been decided. The demolition date has been pushed back to December to allow more time to salvage the historic items, Pickup said. The board voted last month to demolish the 1835 building. It was extensively renovated in 1880. But while it was home to the local YMCA, the building fell into a state of serious disrepair. Efforts to save the building failed. The town took ownership of the dilapidated building this summer. Select Board member Elijah Zimmer, a member of the town’s Historic Preservation Commission, said the steeple is in excellent condition, unlike the rest of the building. “I’m sad to lose the building, but glad to see a commitment to historic preservation,” Zimmer said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Police are warning that an unlicensed tow truck is being used to quickly steal vehicles throughout the city. On Sunday, the tow truck was captured on surveillance video backing up toward a vehicle, lifting it with tow gear and towing it away seconds later, Richmond Police said in a news release. Police said the truck is black with no logo or lettering on it, as is required for tow trucks for hire. Detectives asked the public to call 911 if they see this tow truck or any tow truck without a company name, lettering or logo.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A federal jury has determined that The GEO Group must pay minimum wage – rather than $1 a day – to immigration detainees who perform tasks like cooking and cleaning at its for-profit detention center in the state. The verdict came Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Tacoma in a second trial over the issue. The first trial ended in June with a deadlocked jury. “This multi-billion dollar corporation illegally exploited the people it detains to line its own pockets,” Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement. “Today’s victory sends a clear message: Washington will not tolerate corporations that get rich violating the rights of the people.” The jury will now consider how much the immigrant detainees who worked at the facility are owed, and U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan on his own will determine what The GEO Group must pay the state for its claim that the company unjustly enriched itself. Ferguson, a Democrat, sued the Florida-based GEO Group in 2017, saying the company had unjustly profited by running the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma – now known as the Northwest ICE Processing Center – on the backs of captive workers. A separate lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees was also filed that year, seeking back pay. The judge, who rejected several attempts by GEO to dismiss the lawsuits, consolidated the cases for trial.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A new program enables owners of small forestlands to prosper from improving forest health while slowing climate change. The Family Forest Carbon Program, which pays family and individual small-forest owners to implement practices that increase the amount of carbon sequestered and stored on the land, is opening enrollment to West Virginia landowners. The program could pay significant financial and environmental dividends in the Mountain State, given that West Virginia is the third-most-forested state in the nation, with more than 12 million acres of forestland. The program, a product of the American Forest Foundation and the Nature Conservancy, enables the carbon sequestered by enrolled landowners to become part of a carbon market in the form of carbon credits to be verified by a third party. The program provides expert consultation from foresters to landowners and a forest management plan customized for the landowner’s property. “We built into (the program) a management plan, not to tell them what to do but to help them reach the goals and visions they have for their land, put it into a management plan so that their woods are producing timber, wildlife, carbon for the years to come,” American Forest Foundation CEO Tom Martin said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A sheriff who supports former President Donald Trump accused the bipartisan state Elections Commission of breaking the law during last year’s election, taking the unusual step Thursday of detailing the allegations publicly even though no charges have been filed. Racine County Sheriff Charles Schamling called on the Wisconsin Department of Justice to investigate the commission’s decision last year to tell local elections officials not to send poll workers into nursing homes to assist residents with voting during the pandemic. The move is the latest example of Trump supporters seeking to undermine confidence in the election in a critical battleground state that President Joe Biden carried last year. The state Department of Justice has already said it has no plans to pursue the case, the sheriff said. In a 75-minute presentation streamed on his Facebook page, Schmaling detailed what he said was evidence collected from the Ridgewood Care Center in Racine County. Trump issued a statement encouraging his supporters to watch the presentation. Schmaling said the families of eight residents told investigators they believed that their loved ones did not have the capacity to vote but that ballots were cast for them. “I don’t know how or who they voted for,” the sheriff said. “I didn’t ask because it doesn’t matter.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Central High School’s theater program returned in full capacity with an intimate production of “Typhoid Mary.” The play tells the story of Mary Mallon, an Irish cook who immigrated to America in the early 1900s while unknowingly serving as a carrier of the disease typhoid. The story begins after Mary has already infected and killed several people with her cooking, but still she refuses to be vaccinated or studied by scientists who offer to help her. Choosing a play with such a relevant premise was entirely intentional, but director Jeremiah Kolkman wasn’t looking to take sides, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. “If the audience walks out of here thinking that they were able to relate to this because of current events as they are, that’s great,” he said. “If audience members are walking out of here disgusted because they don’t like the differences of religion and science, that’s great. I just want them walking out of here thinking about it.” While the director chose the play for its relevance, the production remains bipartisan. It presents the situation from a variety of different perspectives. Mary and her husband struggle through religious reconciliation, while the two scientists throughout the production face conflict in their field. Prior to last weekend’s shows, the last time Cheyenne Central held a full production was fall 2019, before the contagious, deadly coronavirus reared its head.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/29"}]}

Met Police officers were drafted in to support the firefighters.\n\nSeveral London Underground stations, including Covent Garden, Edgware Road, Kennington and Stockwell, were forced to close, as well as east London’s Pudding Mill Lane DLR station, which was entirely submerged by rainwater. Videos shared on social media showed what the London Evening Standard described as “torrents of water” gushing into the station, creating “a whirlpool” at the ticket barriers.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Although the weather was warmer and drier on Monday than Sunday, more torrential rain is expected in the capital during the rest of the week.\n\nBut as shocking as yesterday’s London Underground flooding was, the Tube system’s vulnerability to flash flooding should not have come as a surprise to Transport for London.\n\nBack in 2016, The Independent accessed an unpublished London Underground flood risk report which was funded after Hurricane Sandy submerged parts of the New York metro system in 2012. The report identified 85 Tube stations as being at “high risk” of flooding, including the particularly busy terminals of King’s Cross, London Bridge and Waterloo.\n\nAcross the city, Finsbury Park, Notting Hill Gate, Seven Sisters, Colliers Wood, Stockwell and Marble Arch were all in the top ten highest-risk stations.\n\nThe report found that both climate change and the “increased laying of asphalt over earth surfaces”, which puts more pressure on sewers, would contribute to increase flooding in London and subsequently the city’s underground system in the future. “London has been fortunate to escape the worst of recent storm events in the UK, but it is only a matter of time before heavy rainfall seriously affects London and the underground network,” it added.\n\nThe Guardian, which also obtained a copy of the unpublished report, reported that the London Underground had requested £3m over the next three years “to analyse the riskiest sites in greater detail and to begin to install protective measures”. But the Tube’s head drainage engineer told the paper that the amount would not “scratch the surface” of the problem. Over the past few years, Transport for London, which oversees London Underground’s budget, has seen its funding repeatedly slashed.\n\nIn 2019, a report by Caroline Russell, a Green Party representative of the London Assembly, found that flooding had forced the closure of Tube stations for more than 137 hours since 2014. The Climate Change Risks for London report found that, on average, a station closed for more than two hours when shut by flooding and that 41 different stations had reported closures due to floods since 2015.\n\nFifteen months later, in January 2021, Russell warned London Mayor Sadiq Khan that he needed to accelerate the construction of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) or London could face a future of flooded Tube stations. SuDS avoid letting excess rain run off into conventional drains and sewers, which cannot deal with “the extreme weather expected in the coming years”, Russell said.\n\n“The Mayor needs to show leadership and speed up the delivery of new SuDS schemes all over London to stop flooding closing our tube stations, blocking streets and putting the homes and businesses of Londoners at risk,” she added in a statement.\n\nIn December last year, the mayor said “London and other urban areas find it harder to attract government funding for surface water flood protection” as the many small schemes needed to manage the problem “rarely meet the funding criteria”.\n\nHe said City Hall was working with the Environment Agency and other key stakeholders to manage flood risk and unlock further funding.\n\nSunday’s flooding came just two weeks after flash flooding hit parts of London, with some neighbourhoods receiving a month’s worth of rain in a single day.\n\n“The pictures of flooded stations and roads show the work that needs to be done to give people – not just in London but around the UK – the protection they need to try and help mitigate such events as and when they arise”, writes Chris Stevenson in The Independent.", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson", "Ellie O'Mahoney", "The Week Uk", "Marc Shoffman", "Theara Coleman", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Devika Rao", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/962095/coober-pedy-australian-town-people-live-underground", "title": "Coober Pedy: inside the Australian town where people live ...", "text": "In the dry, desolate landscape of the Australian Outback 500 miles north of Adelaide stands Coober Pedy, a seemingly unremarkable town of 2,500 people. But all is not what it seems here.\n\nThat is because 60% of the population live underground in this opal-mining centre, the name of which comes from an indigenous Australian term that roughly translates as “white man in a hole”. There are still 70 opal fields operating in the area but many of the old shafts and tunnels have been converted over time into living quarters. And as the number of subterranean dwellers has increased so churches, a hair salon, a bookshop and even a pool room have also been built.\n\nThis “troglodyte lifestyle may seem merely eccentric” in winter, said BBC Future Planet, but its purpose becomes clearer in the sweltering Australian summers, when “birds have been known to fall from the sky”. With temperatures regularly exceeding 50C, living underground provides a cool reprieve from the harsh desert climate.\n\nOutsiders can experience the “subterranean serenity” for themselves, Travel and Leisure said, as Coober Pedy has two hotels, as well as offering the chance to “camp underground”. Once visitors are down in the converted mines, they find “it’s actually pretty homey”, Insider added.\n\nAnd the experience is especially relevant right now as living underground could be an option for more people as global temperatures rise. People have been “living comfortably underground throughout history”, said Science Alert. Temperatures, the site said, are more consistent as rock and soil absorb and hold heat, meaning less need for “energy-intensive air conditioning or heating”. And “going underground maximises privacy”.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced. Will Hunt, the author of “Underground: A Human History of the Worlds Beneath Our Feet”, told Live Science that humans “do not belong” in underground climates as bodies are “not designed” for this way of life.\n\nThe residents of Coober Pedy appear content with life down under. Jenny Gough, who has lived in the town since 1961 and found $10,000 (£5,000) worth of opals while digging her underground home, told That’s Life that she would “never leave”.", "authors": ["Rebekah Evans", "The Week Uk", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Peter Weber", "Sorcha Bradley", "Julia O'Driscoll", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/22"}]}

The tour is set to pick back up in Europe in 2025, bookended in London from March to May.\n\nUsher injury postponed earlier concert hours before tour kickoff\n\nOn Wednesday hours before he was set to embark on his tour Wednesday night at the State Farm Arena in his hometown of Atlanta, the singer pulled the plug on the first show after dealing with physical pain in the lead up to the show.\n\n\"For my 30-plus year career, 100% of my blood, sweat and tears has gone into putting on the best performance and creating a memorable experience for my fans,\" Usher wrote in a statement shared to social media Wednesday. \"I have every intention of doing that for this tour as well which is why I have to postpone tonight's show and reschedule it for a later date to give my body a second to rest and heal.

Who ...", "text": "Ramon Ramirez\n\nSpecial to American-Statesman\n\n“Is the juice worth the squeeze?” A buddy recently asked me about the South by Southwest Music Festival.\n\nThe post-COVID era of SXSW’s music weekend may lack the roaring excess of Lady Gaga performing on behalf of Doritos like she did a decade ago, but it’s a wonderful time to be a badge-less music fan. In most cases, you can pay a reasonable cover at the door and watch world-class talent in an intimate space without any credentials.\n\nAnd the principle of SXSW Music endures: Most sets are a tidy 40 minutes, so watch at least 10 of them daily. You’ll leave with a year’s worth of playlists.\n\nHere’s what to listen for as the industry camps in our town this week.\n\nWhere can I see Black Keys, Peso Pluma, Big Boi and other stars?\n\nMexican crossover idol Peso Pluma and Jack White’s least favorite blues rock duo the Black Keys are the most established names performing during SXSW Music. So can you actually get in?\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe Black Keys perform their album “Delta Kream” Thursday at the Mohawk; without a badge, your chances of being there are slim because it’s a 1,000-capacity, mismatched venue for a band that could headline the Austin City Limits Music Festival. Their second show, Friday at Stubb’s, is a more realistic entry point: Their set kicks off at 12:30 a.m. With the bulk of SXSW’s star wattage focused on its opening weekend and the University of Texas campus dormant during spring break, Friday nights on Red River during weekend two of SXSW have become downright manageable. There will be considerably fewer badge patrons still in town. If you get in line early, there’s a good chance you’ll get in.\n\nI’ve heard Pluma’s “Ella Baila Sola” spin during last call at East 6th club Mala Vida, and the crowd reliably erupts. The 24-year-old from Jalisco is the most-streamed Mexican artist ever. Although it's an official showcase and badge-holders will get priority entry, his Wednesday night concert at ACL Live is open to the public with an online RSVP. But party links do little but get you a newsletter these days. He performs at 10:55 p.m. and uncredentialed RSVP-holders will want to line up, realistically, at lunch.\n\nA Hulu documentary about mid-’90s Atlanta party the Freaknik is a jumping-off point for southern hip-hop royalty to hold court: Killer Mike, Big Boi, Jermaine Dupri (fresh off a Super Bowl halftime cameo), DJ Drama, and 2 Live Crew’s Uncle Luke rock the Stubb’s stage Wednesday night.\n\nToronto R&B star PartyNextDoor performs Thursday at Waterloo Park. Tickets are $55, and even when Young Thug camped in this slot in 2022 at the height of his pre-arrest, “Pushin P” TikTok fame, the crowd was thin. Norteño fusion artist Christian Nodal ($65) plays the stage Friday and EDM act ILLENIUM ($85) closes the series on Saturday.\n\nIn addition to an appearance at a free Friday get down at Auditorium Shores, Parliament Funkadelic luminary Bootsy Collins performs 10:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Mohawk. He and wife Patti lead a jam with special guests including Henry Invisible, a local multi-instrumentalist you see pop up at Halloween parties. Noted hip-hop storyteller Slick Rick will be there, too.\n\nIn the “guitar rock from 20-plus years ago” category, the At the Drive-In guys will be doing spin-offs: Omar and Cedric will support Glaswegian post-rock legends Mogwai with a set by their dormant band DeFacto Monday at ACL Live (the duo is also premiering “If This Ever Gets Weird,\" a documentary about how Scientology fractured their friendship); Jim’s long-running band Sparta plays Empire Garage on March 16.\n\nWho will this year’s SXSW breakout bands be?\n\n(For official SXSW showcase times visit schedule.sxsw.com. Side party schedules are slipperier, but bands often post full gig rosters on their social media accounts.)\n\nLet’s define a “breakout” as an act that could become a mid-flier festival performer by 2025. Teezo Touchdown opened for Travis Scott in November, so that’s an easy ask for the wildly creative rapper. He’s the flashiest entertainer from Beaumont, Texas since (‘90s Texas quarterback) James Brown.\n\nSony Music’s J Noa is an acclaimed rapper from the Dominican Republic who destroys reggaeton and rap beats alike. Flo Milli and Monaleo’s “We Not Humpin’” is a gnarly, generation-defining banger. Warner Records’ Forest Claudette has the chops, sincerity, and taste to propel his inward-gazing R&B as far as he wants.\n\nWolves of Glendale are a comedy band who’ve opened for Tenacious D and sing about the malaise of being disappointing modern men who can’t change a tire. I’ve listened to “The Gym” more than any SXSW single this winter and can’t get it out of my head. It’s about two minutes too long but the joke is great: Signing up for the gym in January is a losing game. Sultan Stevenson is a heralded jazz pianist from London. Kneecap is a politically charged rap group from Northern Ireland and its music is charismatic and sharp. You know how British rappers generally sound funny and bad to Americans because we’re fiercely protective about hip-hop? Kneecap is not instantly cringe.\n\nCumgirl8’s performance art has rendered a buzzy new EP on 4AD Records; more importantly, two different experts have recommended them to me in recent weeks. Locals the Tiarras have a killer cover of 1930s Cuban song “La Negra Tomasa,” a certified classic interpreted by generations of Latinx artists over the past century. They pass the litmus test.\n\nTwo wildcards: German experimental pop duo ATNA have a looming debut album and “Remission” is a haunting breakup ballad that shatters the psyche because it’s performed by non-native English speakers who are interpreting the language with arresting new imagery. Norwegian soul man Beharie put out a beautiful record in October.\n\nAre there some under-the-radar artists I should see?\n\nOf course. And this is the best part. You’ll enjoy memorable, intimate shows and then you’ll hear the songs all around area coffee shops for the next decade. Here are some of my favorite pseudo-genres of music that reliably flourish during SXSW.\n\nGo deep in your feelings with SXSW's sad girls\n\n“Woman” is not a genre of music, to be clear. I mean soul-searching, downtempo rock music brimming with existential dread because society hates women and gender non-conforming people. And ever since Boygenius performed at the airport last year, this strain of bud has been dominant.\n\nFaye Webster (Atlanta) has a decade’s worth of underrated album cycles. Austin’s formerly anonymous Fuvk have perfected the craft. Bubble Tea and Cigarettes (Brooklyn, New York) sing about getting empanadas at 5am with someone special and later longing for the feeling. Bloomsday have that sweet dual-vocal punch that recalls contemporaries like Girlpool. Sorry Girls’ “Waking Up” (Montreal) features a rollickingly infectious chorus. Georgia Gets By (Nelson, New Zealand) empowers listeners to ditch relationships in neutral with gems like “Easier to Run.” Marem Ladsen (Galicia, Spain) writes sad lyrics in English and Spanish. There are only two members of SXSW veterans Hinds (Madrid, Spain) now but they have this new song “Y Como?” about what they’ll possibly do now that their person is out of the picture, and it crushes spirits. Maura Weaver (Cincinnati, Ohio) on “Crush on You Pt. 2” expertly sums up the sad girl wave: It’s really about stumbling backward into your subconscious.\n\nPut a tear in your beer with melancholy country\n\nSure, I guess country music is spiritually about longing for lost opportunities on a barstool. But two twang-friendly songwriters to shout-out: Brennan Wedl (Nashville) has one tightly woven missive after another featured on her Spotify page (and she leads a “queercore” Boston band on the side, too); Edan Archer (Gainesville, Florida) grew up singing Appalachian music as a child and her storytelling is lived-in and wry.\n\nDon't forget the home team: Austin at SXSW\n\nI used to think: “Why would I ever see A Giant Dog perform live during SX when I can catch them next month at a brewery?” But then you never make it out. And there is a ton of Austin music in bloom, including AGD which released its sixth A+ rock album in August.\n\nPedal Steel Noah has a viral Instagram where he posts guitar videos with his dog. Peelander Z — a Japanese punk band that apparently liked Austin so much, after a few SXSWs they just moved here permanently — always erupts live. Schatzi is a power-pop band from 20 years ago. I remember because my childhood dresser has one of their stickers on it. Voxtrot took inspiration from Belle and Sebastian (aristocratic lyrics, whisper-singing) and the hipster class of 2007 swore by its artfully curated mp3 files. The beloved blog band is back. Fugitive is among the heaviest bands in Texas, emerging from the ashes of Power Trip after the tragic fentanyl death of its former frontman.\n\nFont makes dance rock with aplomb, live instrumentation in the key of LCD Soundsystem. Katy, Texas’ Dende is a powerful new R&B voice. Daiistar’s psych rock was released on English label Fuzz Club and hits all the cool revivalist notes. So does Being Dead but with more wit in its lyrics. Ben Aqua’s production got him an Apple “Shot on iPhone” drop.\n\nLastly, lots of mainstays such as Vallejo and Bob Schneider are coming together to celebrate defunct club Steamboat more than 20 years after it left Sixth Street at a free show at Auditorium Shores on Thursday.\n\nAs heard on TikTok: Viral stars swarm SXSW\n\nA TikTok band is effectively anyone who hits a viral home run. The social media platform is in a tier with Spotify, Soundcloud, and Myspace when it comes to digital discovery. A rapper like Key Flippin (Raleigh, North Carolina) can reach a mass audience by cleverly making a rhyme with the phrase “TikTok” in it. It’s likewise super common for “hyperpop,” be it an original song by a leading genre producer like Chinese songwriter Alice Longyu Gao (New York City) or a sped-up chunk of a Dua Lipa song, to pinball through the platform. Budding pop star Ivoris (Melbourne); mental health advocate and songwriter Robert Grace (Kilkenny, Ireland); bedroom producer Iris Jean (Alkaar, Netherlands); and rapper Erica Banks (Dallas) will all be performing... and boast enormous TikTok hits.\n\nBlazin’ hip-hop and R&B\n\nA continual SXSW treat is the treasure of CDs you’ll swap with aspiring rappers who pull up to Sixth and make themselves seen. And then you can usually snag a giant City Girls poster off a light post for the office. It’s a whole parade.\n\nAs far as the official showcases go, we have household names with giant songs like Gorilla Zoe (Atlanta), superproducer Just Blaze (Paterson, New Jersey) who soundtracked Jay-Z at his peak powers, and Kirko Bangz (Houston). I’m excited to watch DJ Rosegold (Mississauga, Ontario), star rapper Saweetie’s touring partner who is riding a hot streak of standout singles.\n\nThe #CarefreeBlackGirl Cookout on Saturday features more than 10 performers. Prowess the Testament (Washington, D.C.) writes tongue-twisters about her love for “Sailor Moon.” So does Talia Goddess (Brooklyn, New York), but she also flirts with R&B on singles such as last month’s polished “10.25.”\n\nFrom West Africa, with love\n\nThis sound is getting too omnipresent to ignore, but let’s define it: As my editor recently put it, Afrobeats is effectively the dancehall version of Fela Kuti. Afrobeat, singular, is a vastly influential Nigerian sound that combines American funk, jazz, and traditional Western African instrumentation. Afrobeats (with the s) is all the fun, hip-hop-tinged stuff that Drake gets a pass on for ripping off because he’s cool with Wizkid. Given Texas’ multi-faceted immigrant population (more than 100,000 Nigerians live in Houston, according to World Population Review), these sounds should feel familiar.\n\nSXSW features sets by Afrobeats artists Bisa Kdei (Accra, Ghana); BM Casso (Lagos, Nigeria); Kelvyn Boy (Kumasi, Ghana); and Yung D3mz (Accra, Ghana). All have released absolute missiles that I’ve personally taste-tested on Spotify for freshness.\n\nUnique international SXSW moments\n\nSXSW has built relationships with global tourism boards that regularly send cultural ambassadors. It makes for special, unique music programming.\n\nNhac Gay is a DJ collective known for ragers (Saigon, Vietnam). Band of five literal brothers Los Cogelones (Nezahualcóyotl, Mexico) ascend into the ancestral plane for richly flavored rock. Lair (Jatiwangi, Indonesia) plays funk. New wave band La Securite (Montreal) is my pick of the bunch from the always-on Pop Montreal showcase at Swan Dive. Venesti (Cali, Colombia) has one of those giant Latin singles in tow (“No Es Normal”) with “spin at Mexican weddings where the waiters bring out flaming bottles of Smirnoff forever” upside. Marcelo D2 is a veteran Brazilian rapper with a cult following (Rio de Janeiro), Majin makes Afrobeats by way of Taipei, Taiwan and Jazzbois (Budapest) churn dank and experimental genre fare ripe with hip-hop references.\n\nDudes rock\n\nOK but guys can rock, too. We’re talking blazed fans of T. Rex who play chunky riffs with fat fingers full of Doritos dust. It soundtracks the skatepark, bachelor party, and is made for the door guy who got fired because he slept-in and couldn’t make a 7 p.m. shift.\n\nHot Garbage (Toronto) performs moody, cavernous psych rock. Gurrierrs (Dublin) chant-sing like the band Idles about working-class despair. Heffner (Athens, Georgia) has an anthemic slacker jam “Truck,” from the band’s curiously titled new album “Super Bowl LXIX,” that will make you want to rip the pen at work. Two years ago, hardcore band Fade ‘Em All (Houston) braved a late-night set without a guitar player.\n\nHopefully he can make it this year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/11/14/phoenix-concert-news-listings-announcements/71580074007/", "title": "Phoenix concerts announced: Mariah Carey, Kehlani, Luke Bryan", "text": "Heart's postponed the Royal Flush Tour will now play Footprint Center in downtown Phoenix on Thursday, March 5, 2025.\n\nThat's the latest concert news for metro Phoenix, where other recent announcements include Mariah Carey playing Footprint Center on a tour celebrating the 30th anniversary of her classic \"Merry Christmas\" album, which gave the world \"All I Want for Christmas is You,\" and Tinashe playing the Van Buren.\n\nYou’ll find details on how to get tickets, including presale information, in this running list of all the biggest tours headed our way, continually updated as concerts are announced to help you plan accordingly.\n\nIf you’re looking for something to do this week, you’ll want to check our monthly concert guide.\n\nHeart at Footprint Center in downtown Phoenix\n\nThe remaining dates on Heart's the Royal Flush Tour have been rescheduled for 2025, including Footprint Center in downtown Phoenix, where the Rock & Roll Hall of Famers will now perform on Thursday, March 5.\n\nNeed a break?

The temperatures are getting warmer. And the nights are about to get a lot louder.\n\nFor millions of music fans across metro Detroit and Michigan, summertime spells prime concert season, and there’s another bonanza of stuff on the way for 2024.\n\nThe summer schedule will feature acts from across the spectrum — rock, country, hip-hop, pop, R&B, electronic music and more — as part of the humming array of live music at big venues, small clubs, major festivals and community events.\n\nAt Pine Knob Music Theatre, the state’s leading summer music hot spot, the roasted-almond stands and drink machines have already revved up for a season that will feature nearly 50 concert nights.\n\nOn Thursday, the Clarkston amphitheater — which traditionally has ranked among the most-attended summer venues in the U.S. — notched the earliest start in its half-century history with a rock bill featuring the bands Primus, Puscifer and A Perfect Circle.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe Pine Knob action will resume May 22 with Neil Young, part of a five-month season scheduled to wrap up Sept. 28 with WRIF-FM’s Riff Fest, headlined by the veteran hard rock band Godsmack.\n\nThe 2024 season doesn’t wield quite the firepower that ruled in 2023, when Detroit’s summer calendar was loaded with mega draws such as Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Morgan Wallen, Drake and Ed Sheeran. Ford Field, the region’s largest venue, hosted nine shows and more than half a million concertgoers for the busiest stretch of music in the stadium’s 22-year history.\n\nIndeed, last year was the biggest ever for the North American concert business, as the live-events industry continued to revel in a post-pandemic rebound: The top 100 tours alone generated $6.63 billion in grosses, according to data collected by the trade magazine Pollstar, with at least $1 billion of that coming from Swift’s Eras Tour.\n\nThis summer is teeming with hot shows, and here we break out some highlights for what's coming through October. Note that these bullet points — along with the assorted venue schedules we're providing at freep.com — are just a taste: There's plenty more notable and compelling stuff ahead at spaces big and small across southeast Michigan.\n\nConcerts galore:Long list of artists coming to metro Detroit venues this summer\n\n$25 concert tickets\n\nThe 10th edition of Live Nation’s Concert Week promotion will start Wednesday and run through May 14, with more than 170 Michigan shows offering $25 seats. Dates include shows at Comerica Park, Little Caesars Arena, Pine Knob and other metro Detroit amphitheaters, along with theaters and clubs across the state. Details: livenation.com/concertweek\n\nPromoter AEG Presents is offering its own $25 tickets, on sale Tuesday through May 15, for shows at the Masonic Temple Theatre and Royal Oak Music Theatre, including Sum 41 (Sept. 14), Lyle Lovett (July 23) and Daryl Hall’s coheadlining visit with Elvis Costello (July 8).\n\nMore:Live Nation's $25 concert ticket sale starts this week\n\nFor both promotional events, the discounted tickets are billed as \"all-in\" — meaning $25 flat, with no service fees or other charges.\n\nStadium spectaculars\n\nFord Field will follow its record-setting concert year with a trifecta of country nights, starting with Zach Bryan on June 20. It's part of a fast, remarkable rise for the Oklahoma artist and U.S. Navy veteran, whose only Detroit show until now was a Majestic Theatre gig in 2021.\n\nHe'll be followed at the downtown stadium by George Strait (July 13) and Kenny Chesney with the Zac Brown Band (Aug. 10).\n\nFor Chesney, this will be the 12th headlining performance in the Lions’ den, the most for any artist since the stadium's 2002 opening. His August visit with Zac Brown will feature Detroit’s Uncle Kracker in the opening slot.\n\nAt Comerica Park, there are two shows on the docket: Def Leppard and Journey will serve up rock hits July 18, while Green Day will bring its Savior Tour with guests Smashing Pumpkins and Rancid on Sept. 4.\n\nWelcome back\n\nThe summer schedule includes a handful of folks we haven’t seen in a while, including the reunited rock band Creed, which will play Pine Knob on July 31 before returning Nov. 20 for a night at LCA. Those will be the first Creed shows here in 12 years for Scott Stapp, Mark Tremonti and company.\n\nSmooth-singing George Strait, a pioneer of country music stadium concerts, will make his first Michigan appearance since his avowed retirement tour in 2014. Strait is now firmly back in the saddle and headed to Ford Field on July 13 with Chris Stapleton and Little Big Town in support.\n\nHip-hop veteran and freshly minted Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Missy Elliott, meanwhile, will play the first Detroit headlining show of her career when she hits LCA on Aug. 15 with Busta Rhymes and Ciara.

Some listeners took issue with Lamar misgendering his relatives – Lamar uses both “he/him” and “she/her” pronouns interchangeably for both family members. Other criticisms point to his use of his cousin’s former name and repeated use of an anti-LGBTQ slur.\n\n“My auntie became a man and I took pride in it,” Lamar says on the new track, saying he “grew accustomed” to his uncle’s transition as a young person.\n\nHe later says in the song that his uncle was the “first person (he) seen write a rap,” introducing him to the art form he would eventually dominate.\n\nLamar also mentions his “favorite cousin” and their transition and how he “still loved” them, though the relationship between the two was strained for a period because his cousin “wasn’t comfortable” around him.\n\nWhen Lamar addresses his past use of homophobic language, he uses the f-slur repeatedly throughout.\n\n“I said them f-bombs, I ain’t know any better,” he says at one point, later referencing an incident at a concert when a White fan used a racial slur onstage while rapping to one of Lamar’s songs.\n\nVariety music critic Jem Aswad praised “Auntie Diaries” as a “powerful, genre-shifting statement on transphobia” and the evolution of Lamar’s views.\n\nBut the song was not uniformly praised among listeners. Some called it “transphobic” and “selfish” of Lamar to center himself in a story about his trans relatives while repeatedly using incorrect pronouns and a slur, while others defended it as Lamar’s reflection on his past and love for his family. Still others said that, flawed as the song is, it was meaningful to hear a rapper of Lamar’s caliber – he’s the only rapper who’s won a Pulitzer for their work – to say they support trans people.\n\nPreston Mitchum, director of advocacy and governmental affairs at the Trevor Project, a nonprofit that works to prevent suicide among LGBTQ young people, discussed his mixed reaction to the song.\n\n“I’m thankful he spoke in favor of love & acceptance of trans sibs – even after admitting what society did to them first,” he tweeted. “The [slur] threw me off because it isn’t his word to use. But that’s his point at the end.”\n\nThe song was released at a contentious time for trans people’s rights: According to one report as of March, states had introduced more than 200 bills aimed at LGBTQ people, particularly trans young people.\n\nReviews for the long-awaited “Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers” are still rolling in, but “Auntie Diaries” is already one of its most talked about songs. Lamar just announced a world tour to support the album, beginning in July.", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/05/13"}]}

Within five years, she would be Queen – and she’d go on to be the longest serving monarch in British history.\n\nThe speech was given in Cape Town on April 21, 1947 during a tour of South Africa – when it was still a British colony – and it speaks to several key themes of her reign.\n\nFirstly, Elizabeth II dedicated herself to lifelong service. This explains why she never abdicated, even as many of her younger contemporaries did. Between February 2013 and June 19, 2014, four European monarchs stepped down: Pope Benedict XVI of Vatican City; Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands; King Albert II of Belgium; and King Juan Carlos I of Spain.\n\nElizabeth, a devout Christian who rarely missed a Sunday at church, resisted the exodus because of the promise she made not just to her subjects but to God. There’s a clue to that at the end of her 21st birthday speech: “I shall not have strength to carry out this resolution alone unless you join in it with me, as I now invite you to do: I know that your support will be unfailingly given. God help me to make good my vow, and God bless all of you who are willing to share in it.”\n\nEven when her husband, Prince Philip, retired in 2017, Elizabeth continued public engagements and brought in other members of the family to accompany her as needed. Just days after Philip’s death in 2021, she resumed official duties with the appointment of new ambassadors to the UK.\n\nSecondly, in that 1947 speech, she devoted herself to the “great imperial family,” by which she meant the British empire. The UK was losing world dominance at the time. It was the year India declared independence and ousted her father, King George VI, as head of state.\n\nDozens more were to follow suit over the following decades, across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. By the time of her death, Elizabeth was head of state in 14 countries besides the UK.\n\nElizabeth came to see that as an opportunity rather than a threat. India had asked to remain part of the Commonwealth and two years later the request was granted, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting of 1949. The monarch’s role in India was redefined as “the symbol of the free association of the independent Member Nations and as such Head of the Commonwealth.”\n\nThat was a model later adopted by other newly independent states, as British rule came to an end across Africa, Asia and other regions of the world.\n\nWhen the Queen inherited the title of Head of The Commonwealth from her father, she embraced it – which is why she is often credited with the “managed decline of the empire.” She may have lost her empire, but she retained her international footprint and reinforced it by traveling more than any of her predecessors.\n\nShe visited every one of the Commonwealth nations apart from Rwanda and Cameroon and made sure she attended key Commonwealth meetings to show her support. As she got older, she cut back on international travel but called on her eldest son, Prince Charles, to represent her instead.\n\nThen-Prince Charles speaks during the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali, Rwanda on June 24. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nIn November 2021, Barbados severed its last imperial ties to Britain, removing the Queen as head of state as it marked its 55th anniversary of independence. Like others before it, the island nation has remained part of the Commonwealth.\n\nOn Saturday, Antigua and Barbuda signaled it could be the next country to go its own way, with the prime minister saying he wanted to hold a referendum to become a republic within three years.\n\nBeyond that, the republican movements in Australia and Jamaica have perhaps the most momentum, but their biggest obstacle was always the Queen herself.\n\nIn July 2017, then-Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull – a co-founder of the Australian Republican Movement – summed it up when he was granted an audience at Buckingham Palace. “Although I am a Republican, I am also an Elizabethan,” he tweeted. “It was an honour to meet Her Majesty today at Buckingham Palace.”\n\nKeeping public loyalty\n\nOver the decades, the Queen did as she promised and devoted herself to the service of the British people. This, coupled with her ability to adapt with the changing times and make sure she remained in the public eye, meant she largely kept their loyalty despite painful upheaval within the royal family.\n\nAs a result, the British republican movement gained little traction during Elizabeth’s reign except for two periods. The first was in 1992, which she herself described as her Annus Horribilis, or “terrible year.” Two of her children, Charles and Andrew, announced their separations and her daughter, Anne, got divorced. Her favored home, Windsor Castle, also went up in flames.\n\nA fire in 1992 wreaks havoc in Windsor Castle, causing major structural damage. AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Nineteen-ninety-two is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure,” she told an audience at Guildhall in November of that year. “In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an ‘Annus Horribilis.’ I suspect that I am not alone in thinking it so.”\n\nHer other big low was after the death of daughter-in-law, Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997. There was a backlash when people noticed the flag hadn’t been lowered over Buckingham Palace. Newspapers questioned why the Queen hadn’t returned to London from her holiday home in Scotland. She had her reasons. That flag had never been lowered even on the death of a monarch and she stayed in Scotland because she was helping to care for Diana’s children, Princes William and Harry.\n\nEventually, she returned to the capital and paid tribute to Diana in a live broadcast. She also had the flag lowered for Diana’s funeral.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip view the floral tributes to Diana, Princess of Wales, at London's Buckingham Palace, on September 5, 1997. Pool/AP\n\nNonetheless, Elizabeth’s approval rating didn’t fully recover until the blockbuster wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton at Westminster Abbey in 2011. William was given free rein on whom he wanted to marry – and he chose a commoner. This turned the story into a fairytale and the whole world tuned in to watch.\n\nWilliam was also given free rein on whom he invited to the ceremony. He told a documentary team in 2012 how he was handed an official guest list and didn’t recognize anyone on it, so he had a word with his grandmother. “There was very much a subdued moment when I was handed a list with 777 names on, not one person I knew or Catherine knew,” he said. “I went to her and said: ‘Listen, I’ve got this list, not one person I know. What do I do?’ and she (The Queen) went: ‘Get rid of it. Start from your friends and then we’ll add those we need to in due course. It’s your day.’”\n\nThe Queen was allowing the younger generation to do things their own way and appeal to people their own age.\n\nAfter the wedding, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge – as they were then styled – were also granted considerable freedom to set up William’s own court at Kensington Palace.\n\nBut that was nothing compared to the leeway his younger brother was allowed with his wedding to Meghan Markle. Not only was she a biracial, American actress, feminist and divorcee but she wasn’t a member of the Church of England, though she was brought up an Anglican.\n\nAs important as it was for all these elements to be reflected on her big day at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, it was also important for the monarchy – and the Queen knew it. The gospel choir; the sermon from Episcopalian bishop Michael Curry; the way Meghan walked herself down the first part of the aisle: she made the royal family relevant to so many people it wasn’t relevant to before and it was a triumph all round.\n\nEveryone involved was a winner, just as they all lost when Meghan and Harry felt they couldn’t carry on in their royal roles and moved to North America two years later. They gave their reasons why in an explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, accusing “the firm” of failing to support them and accusing an unnamed family member of making a racist remark about their son’s skin color.\n\nWhilst Harry was scathing in the interview about his father, he said he continued to have respect for his grandmother.\n\nAnother major challenge for the Queen in recent years was the scandal surrounding her son, Prince Andrew, and his connection to the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew stepped back from royal duties in late 2019 amid the furor.\n\nIn January 2022, the Queen stripped Andrew of his remaining military titles and charities, as well as his right to be called His Royal Highness, as her son vowed to battle on in a civil sex abuse case brought against him in the United States. The following month the prince reached a deal with his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. Andrew repeatedly rejected the allegations against him.\n\nThe Queen largely avoided becoming the target of public anger over the saga, though questions remain over how her son was able to afford the undisclosed legal bill, which was expected to run into the millions.\n\nAlthough the palace would not comment on the settlement at the time, insiders believed the move would have been welcomed by the institution ahead of the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebrations later that summer.\n\nMembers of the royal family watch an RAF flypast on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the Trooping the Colour parade on June 2, 2022, as part of the Queen's platinum jubilee celebrations. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nHarnessing the power of media\n\nThe Queen’s ability to adapt was perhaps best exemplified by her unquestionably historic visit to the Republic of Ireland in 2011, the first by a British monarch in a century. Mary McAleese, the Irish President, described the visit as the culmination of the success of the peace process. A transient politician would never have lent the occasion the same weight.\n\nThe Queen received a standing ovation after a speech at Dublin Castle and plaudits from across the political divide. The following year, she followed up with a visit to Northern Ireland where she put aside the murder of her cousin, the Earl of Mountbatten, by the IRA in 1979, to shake hands with Martin McGuinness. He was allegedly an IRA commander at the time of Mountbatten’s death.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II shakes hands with Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, left, watched by First Minister Peter Robinson and Prince Philip at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on June 27, 2012. Paul Faith/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe result: one handshake caught on camera and another footnote in history with the Queen at the center of it.\n\nElizabeth understood the power of the media from an early age, and harnessing it was to become another key theme of her reign. That speech on her 21st birthday was recorded not just for radio but also for the emerging medium of television. At her coronation in 1953, she personally requested that cameras be allowed in to Westminster Abbey to broadcast the ceremony live.\n\nPeople famously went out to buy television sets so they could watch. It was a sacrosanct moment the public had never before been able to witness; they remembered where they were and who they watched with. The Queen had inadvertently invented event television. All she wanted was for as many people as possible to feel part of it.\n\nA phrase often attributed to Elizabeth was that “you have to be seen to be believed.” She understood that it wasn’t enough to go out in public, but she had to be seen there. Television gave her a bigger audience and when color was introduced, she wore brighter shades so she would stand out.\n\nShe allowed cameras into her day-to-day engagements too, whether it was opening a hospital or attending a local event of some sort. Instead of walking past the crowds of well-wishers, she stopped and talked to them, something which was almost unheard of at the time. Those “walkabouts” would appear in the media and show her amongst the people, not hidden behind palace walls. She supported hundreds of charities and good causes so she could get out and meet even more people.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II visits the set of the long-running television series \"Coronation Street,\" on July 8, 2021 in Manchester, England. Scott Heppell /WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nPlaying the long game\n\nWhen the digital revolution arrived, the Queen embraced it with her own website. She established a social media presence long before her children or grandchildren did. The internet presented her with another way of connecting with her public and making herself relevant to their lives. She didn’t have to say anything. She never gave an interview. She understood that she just needed to be present.\n\nThis was a woman playing the long game. Headlines came and went.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II appears on a large video screen accompanied by Bond actor Daniel Craig during the Opening Ceremony for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London. MCT via Getty Images\n\nIf Elizabeth gave a speech, she wouldn’t show any expression, or offer an opinion. This approach meant she retained broad public support, including in parliament, which was the one body that had the power to dethrone her.\n\nIf she had a particular talent, it was knowing when to step in and take center stage. Who can forget her “parachuting” into the London Olympics opening ceremony with James Bond?\n\nAt times of crisis, such as the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, she addressed the country in her role as “Head of the Nation” and expertly articulated the national mood and offered reassurance. She said the UK “will succeed” in its fight against the virus and she praised those who had been following government guidelines and come “together to help others.”\n\nEvoking wartime language to place the scale of the crisis in context, she added: “We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.”\n\nQueen Elizabeth II takes her seat during the funeral of Prince Philip in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on April 17, 2021. Jonathan Brady/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nAs the lockdown continued in the United Kingdom, the Queen and her family had to find a way to continue to “be seen” when they weren’t able to go out and meet people anymore. So, they did what everyone else did. They video-conferenced into public engagements and released the video to the media.\n\nIt showed a more personal side to the Queen and her family which one doesn’t see when they are surrounded by people and cameras. Photographers were also allowed into Windsor Castle to capture Prince Philip’s funeral, delivering a poignant and profound image of the Queen grieving on her own in the chapel, as she followed social-distancing rules like her subjects around the nation.\n\nIf any monarch’s primary role is to secure and strengthen the Crown for the next generation, then Elizabeth did so with her constant presence, but always adapting and keeping the institution relevant.\n\nOver the course of her long reign, she transformed and updated the brand more than people realize and kept it fit for purpose.

And at the time, it was thought that my condition was noncancerous,\" she said. \"The surgery was successful, (but) after the operation (doctors) found cancer had been present.\" The princess went on to explain that she is having \"preventative\" chemotherapy.\n\nThe announcement follows weeks of speculation about Kate's well-being after she stepped away from public appearances for a \"planned abdominal surgery\" in January and after King Charles, 75, also announced a diagnosis of an undisclosed form of cancer. The lack of transparency surrounding the whereabouts and condition of the princess fomented conspiracy theories and rampant speculation. Kate's video, which did not specify what kind of cancer she is fighting, appeared to be a direct response to the confusion and anger: She explained that she and her husband, Prince William, 41, wanted time to break the news to their children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5.\n\nThe conspiracy theories can be put to rest now that the news is out there, but what happens next for Kate, her family and the British monarchy?\n\nWhat does Kate's cancer diagnosis mean for the monarchy?\n\nThe British monarchy has long been a symbol of strength and longevity in the United Kingdom, illustrated by the slogan \"keep calm and carry on.\" But now, with two senior members of the royal family fighting a potentially fatal disease, it's looking significantly shakier.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"We’re just as a nation coming to terms that our monarch is going through cancer treatment ... and now we’ve been dealt a double blow,\" says Katie Nicholl, author of “The New Royals” and Vanity Fair's royal correspondent. \"So the royal family is looking pretty vulnerable.\"\n\n\"The late Queen Elizabeth II reputedly said, 'I have to be seen to be believed,'\" says Carolyn Harris, co-editor of \"English Consorts: Power, Influence and Dynasty\" and a professor at the University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies. The queen \"was constantly appearing in public and traveling.\" Without two of its most important members in the public eye, the monarchy is taking a blow.\n\nBut, as Nicholl notes, the Windsors have survived crises before: \"The show will go on, because it has to.\"\n\nWill Kate continue to step back from public life?\n\nIt seems that way. \"It's likely that we're going to see William and Catherine and their children out of the public eye,\" Harris says.\n\nChemotherapy is a famously taxing medical treatment that can cause nausea, vomiting, hair loss, fatigue and many other side effects, according to the Mayo Clinic. While King Charles has been undergoing his own treatment for cancer he has kept up mandatory constitutional duties, such as meeting with the British prime minister, but minimized public appearances and interactions. Experts expect a similar approach from Kate but declined to speculate when she might return to a public schedule.\n\nWill other members of the royal family step up in Kate's absence?\n\nYes. With the princess and the king out of commission, you can expect Queen Camilla and Prince William to take a bigger role, along with more royals along the big family tree. Harris predicts that \"Edward and Sophie, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, Princess Anne and even Queen Elizabeth the second's cousin Prince Richard, the Duke of Gloucester (will be) undertaking a very busy schedule of royal engagements.\"\n\nNot on the list? Prince Harry and his wife, Duchess Meghan, who stepped away from royal life in 2020.\n\nWhat will happen with Kate's husband, Prince William, and their children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis?\n\nThe young royals are about to begin an Easter break from school, a time of year that Kate and William traditionally step away from royal duties to spend time together as a family. Nicholls predicts the press will give the family the space they are asking for at this difficult time. But if not, the royals won't be shy about asserting their privacy.\n\n\"We know from the past how protective (William) is of his children and his family; he’s taken legal action in the past\" against the media, Nicholls says. \"If he has to, he'll take legal action again to protect his wife.\"\n\nBut with Kate and the king in treatment, William will have more responsibility, personally and professionally. \"Prince William is carrying the burden of the crown, which could come to him sooner than he hoped. He's going to have to hold the fort while caring for his wife and caring for three young children at home,\" Nicholls says. \"He’s got his father to worry about and now his wife as well.\"\n\nWill the 'Where is Kate' conspiracy theories die?\n\nThe uproar over her whereabouts is likely to die down now that she released the \"very personal message to the public,\" Harris says. \"She’s been able to address a lot of speculation (in) allowing the public to see her and hear her speak and to know the condition she’s experiencing.\"\n\nThat won't stop a hunger for details about every aspect of Kate's experience now that royals watchers know what's going on. \"There's going to be less scrutiny of Catherine's health, but there's going to continue to be a lot of public interest in her course of treatment, (and) when she will return to public duties.\"\n\nWhat will happen if Kate dies from her cancer?\n\nAlthough Kate shared a message of positivity in the video announcing her diagnosis, most people worry that any kind of cancer can be fatal. Many are already making comparisons to Kate's late mother-in-law, Princess Diana, the last princess of Wales, who died in 1997 at age 36.\n\nIf Kate died, it would \"bring back memories of the young William and Harry losing their mum,\" Harris says. \"There would be tremendous sympathy for young George and Charlotte and Louie as another generation of the royal family growing up without their mom.\"\n\nAs a member of the royal family who married in, Kate is not in the direct line of succession, so her death would not change the future monarchs (William and George are next in line). But Kate is an integral member of the family, and losing her would be bad for the monarchy as a whole. \"This would be a real blow to the the monarchy as an institution as well.

U.K. tabloid The Sun reported later in March that Kate had been spotted shopping with Prince William, and U.S. tabloid TMZ backed up photos with a video of the outing. But the video did not necessarily end the conspiracy theories.\n\nIn February, Kensington Palace aimed to put theories about her absence to rest in a statement that said she is \"doing well\" and stressed that she was always expected to remain out of the public eye through the end of March.\n\n\"We were very clear from the outset that the Princess of Wales was out until after Easter and Kensington Palace would only be providing updates when something was significant,\" the statement, provided to People and ABC News at the time, said.\n\nWhere is Princess Kate?Timeline of what to know about the royal amid surgery, photo drama\n\nPrincess Kate photo editing drama fuels onlookers\n\nConspiracy theories were fueled by a photo editing scandal in early March.

I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother's Day.\"\n\nSocial media users quickly began to overanalyze the footage, with some refusing to believe that the video was authentic in light of the photo editing snafu.

Busy, noisy affairs held in cavernous conference halls where hundreds of vendors try to sell expectant parents everything they could possibly desire for their new bundle of joy – and plenty of other things they never knew they needed.\n\nBut this is a shrinking business, and the customer base is dwindling.\n\nSouth Korea recently broke its own record for the world’s lowest fertility rate. Figures released in November showed the average number of children a South Korean woman will have in her lifetime is down to just 0.79.\n\nThat is far below the 2.1 needed to maintain a stable population and low even compared to other developed countries where the rate is falling, such as the United States (1.6) and Japan – which at 1.3 reported its own lowest rate on record.\n\nAnd it spells trouble for a country with an aging population that faces a looming shortage of workers to support its pension system.\n\nNurses at a nearly empty infant unit of a hospital in Seoul, South Korea, in February 2017. Yonhap/EPA/Shutterstock\n\nThe problem is commonly blamed on economic factors that have put off the young from having families – high real estate prices, the cost of education and greater economic anxiety – yet it has proved beyond the ability of successive governments to fix, however much money is thrown at it.\n\nCritics say that is a sign the problems go deeper than economics and that a change in approach is needed. Whether the government is listening is another matter.\n\nThrowing money at the problem\n\nDuring a visit to a nursery in September, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol admitted that more than $200 billion has been spent trying to boost the population over the past 16 years.\n\nYet since assuming office in May, his administration has come up with few ideas for solving the problem other than continuing in a similar vein – setting up a committee to discuss the issue and promising yet more financial support for newborns. A monthly allowance for parents with babies up to 1-year-old will increase from the current 300,000 won to 700,000 won ($230 to $540) in 2023 and to 1 million Korean won ($770) by 2024, according to the Yoon administration.\n\nAccording to President Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea has spent more than $200 billion in the past 16 years trying to solve its population problem. Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nThe public’s skepticism that Yoon has any better grip on the problem than his predecessors has only been reinforced by the president’s at times clumsy messaging.\n\nDuring his visit to the nursery, Yoon expressed surprise that babies and toddlers were not being looked after at home and appeared to suggest that it was common for 6-month-old babies to be able to walk, leading to criticism that he was out of touch (the average age for babies to walk is more like 12 months).\n\nMany experts believe the current throw-money-at-it approach is too one-dimensional and that what is needed instead is continuing support throughout the child’s life.\n\nPrams at a baby fair in Seoul, South Korea, on Sept. 15. Yonhap/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nBrowsing the stalls at a recent baby fair was Kim Min-jeong, whose second child is due this month. She brushed aside the government’s pledge of more funds, saying: “They’ve changed the names and merged allowances but for parents like us, there are no more benefits.”\n\nThe problem she faces, she said, is that she hasn’t been able to work since her first child was born as she and her husband cannot afford private child care.\n\nGovernment-funded nurseries are free but a handful of scandals in recent years involving caregivers striking infants has put many parents off. While the cases were minimal, they were well publicized and the CCTV footage emotive.\n\n‘A puritanical approach’\n\nAlso standing in the way of would-be parents are a host of problems that are more social than economic in nature and likely to endure however much money is splashed around.\n\nAmong them are what might be called the unwritten rules for parenthood.\n\nWhile having a baby is very much expected of married couples in South Korea, society still frowns on single parents. IVF treatment is not offered to single women, official hospital figures show.\n\n“We still have a very puritanical approach to single mothers,” said law professor Cho Hee-kyoung, who writes a newspaper column on social issues.\n\n“It’s as if they have done something wrong by becoming pregnant out of wedlock… why does it necessarily have to be within a marriage that you can raise a child?”\n\nMeanwhile, couples in non-traditional partnerships also face discrimination; South Korea does not recognize same-sex marriage and regulations make it difficult for unwed couples to adopt.\n\nAuthor Lee Jin-song at Spain Bookshop in Seoul where her books are sold. Charles Miller/CNN\n\nLee Jin-song, who has written books about the trend of young people choosing not to get married or have a baby, said policies to boost the birth rate need to embrace more than just the traditional idea of marriage as being between a man and a woman.\n\n“I’ve thought about how heterocentric and normality-centric discussion is in the traditional sense of marriage… (it) excludes people with disabilities, diseases or poor reproductive health,” Lee said.\n\nChoosing to stay single\n\nLee pointed to a common joke that in South Korea, “if you are not dating by the time you are 25, you’ll turn into a crane, meaning if you’re single you become non-human.”\n\nShe said society considers her, and others like her, selfish for not conforming to the traditional expectations of marriage and children, “neglecting their duties for society only for the sake of their happiness.”\n\nLee highlighted the pressures of having children on women in a patriarchal society that is slow to evolve. “Marriage, childbirth and child care require too much sacrifice for women in a patriarchal society especially over the past decade. So, they are beginning to explore the possibility of being able to live well without getting married.”\n\nProfessor Cho agreed, saying there is a lingering social expectation that the father sacrifices for the company and the mother supports the family, even if she also works.\n\n“I know so many couples where the women are actually earning more money than the men, but when they come home, it’s the women who have to do the housework and look after the children and provide emotional support to the husband.”\n\nThe job doesn’t end when the office shuts\n\nMeanwhile, husbands who would like to be more involved in child-rearing find the business culture in South Korea does not always allow for that.\n\nWhile on paper, parental leave has been increased, few feel comfortable to take it in full.\n\nBack at the baby fair, Kim’s husband Park Kyung-su said he is hoping to help with his second child, but “there is no special understanding or treatment from work for having a young child. I can use my time off, but I feel uncomfortable using it because I want good feedback at work.”\n\nThere is a widespread fear that the workers who are promoted are rarely the ones who put family first.\n\nLee Se-eun, a mother of two boys, hasn't worked in seven years. Charles Miller/CNN\n\nLee Se-eun, who has two boys ages 3 and 5, said she would welcome more help from her husband, but he is rarely home in time.\n\n“It would be nice if companies would recognize employees with babies, for example, to exclude them from dinners or nights,” she said.\n\nIn South Korea, the job does not end when the office closes for the day. Rather, there is a culture of “team-building” after hours, which it is frowned upon to miss.\n\nLee used to work in a brokerage firm before launching her own start-up, but she has not worked in seven years and feels there was no option to continue her career as she did not want to put her boys in child care.\n\n“Raising a child is a very valuable, meaningful and very good thing from a personal point of view, but sometimes it feels like it doesn’t get valued in society,” Lee said.", "authors": ["Paula Hancocks"], "publish_date": "2022/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/china/china-covid-restrictions-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China eases some of its Covid restrictions, in significant step toward ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChina announced sweeping changes to its national pandemic response on Wednesday, the clearest and most significant sign yet that the central government is moving away from its strict zero-Covid approach that prompted protests across the country.\n\nIn a statement reported by state broadcaster CCTV, China’s State Council unveiled 10 new guidelines that loosen some restrictions – most notably, allowing home quarantine and largely scrapping the health QR code that has been mandatory for entering most public places.\n\nLocal governments had already taken steps this week that indicated a possible change in direction – including some major cities loosening requirements on Covid testing.\n\nBut this is the first official change in Covid policy on a national level – a notable turnaround by Beijing, which for the past three years has insisted that unwavering restrictions are the only effective way to stamp out the highly transmissible virus.\n\nHere are some of the biggest changes.\n\nQR codes scrapped\n\nPeople shopping at a supermarket in Urumqi, China, on December 5. CNS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSince early in the pandemic, China has used health codes on mobile phones to track individuals’ health statuses. The color of these codes – in red, amber or green – decides whether users can leave their homes, use public transport and enter public places, or potentially need to quarantine.\n\nUnder the guidelines released Wednesday, people will be able to enter most places without showing a negative test result or their health code – a significant step after nearly three years of disruption to people’s daily routines and livelihoods.\n\nOnly a few exceptions will still require these checks, including nursing homes, medical institutions and secondary schools. Businesses can now determine their own prevention and control policies, the report added.\n\nHome quarantine allowed\n\nIn another massive change, asymptomatic Covid patients or those with mild symptoms will be allowed to quarantine at home instead of being taken to a government facility, unless they choose otherwise.\n\nPatients whose condition deteriorates will be transferred to hospital for treatment, the report said. Close contacts can also quarantine at home.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, Chinese residents have described the chaos and stress of going into quarantine camps, many saying it was unclear when they would be allowed to leave, and others complaining of crowded or poor conditions.\n\nIn several cases, health workers reportedly killed the pets of those taken to government quarantine, citing health risks – triggering outrage on Chinese social media each time. Others criticized the policy after reports earlier this year of elderly residents being forced out of their homes in the middle of the night for transport to quarantine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Man dragged out of home after allegedly refusing to go to quarantine facility 00:59 - Source: CNN\n\nLimits on lockdown\n\nThe new guidelines also urge authorities to “ensure the normal functioning of society and basic medical services,” saying areas that aren’t designated high-risk should not restrict people’s movements or close businesses.\n\nLockdowns are only allowed in “high-risk areas,” and even then, should be “promptly” lifted if no new cases are found for five consecutive days, it said. It added that authorities are forbidden from blocking fire escapes, apartment or building entrances, and other gates, so residents can still evacuate and seek medical attention if needed.\n\nThis particular guideline comes at a particularly sensitive time, with China still reeling from a wave of rare public protest in late November and early December, that had been triggered by a deadly fire in the far western Xinjiang region. Public fury had swept the nation after videos of the incident appeared to show lockdown measures had delayed firefighters from reaching the victims.\n\nDuring the protests, thousands across the country took to the streets to call for an end to lockdowns and other zero-Covid measures – with some voicing broader grievances against censorship and the ruling Communist Party’s authoritarian leadership.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Chilling': Protester tells CNN what the atmosphere is like in China 03:57 - Source: CNN\n\nVaccination plan\n\nThe State Council on Wednesday also emphasized the need to accelerate Covid vaccination among the elderly, saying all locations should be “administrating as many vaccinations as possible.”\n\nWhile the Omicron variant is milder than previous strains and China’s overall vaccination rate is high, experts say even a small number of severe cases among vulnerable and under-vaccinated groups like the elderly could overwhelm hospitals if infections spike across the country of 1.4 billion.\n\nMore than 86% of China’s population over 60 are fully vaccinated, according to China’s National Health Commission. That leaves around 25 million who have not received any shot, according to a comparison of official population figures and November 28 vaccination data. But booster rates are lower, with more than 45 million of the fully vaccinated elderly yet to receive an additional shot.\n\nFor the most at-risk over 80 age group, around two-thirds were fully vaccinated, but only 40% had received booster shots as of November 11, according to state media.\n\nDomestic travel\n\nThe rules also make domestic travel within China easier, with cross-regional travelers no longer needing to provide a negative test result or their health code – or test upon arrival.\n\nThese former requirements, as well as other travel restrictions such as provincial border closures and provincial train and bus suspensions, have made domestic travel difficult over the last few years.\n\nFor the many in China who left their hometowns to find work in other cities and provinces, that meant being separated from family for long stretches – or being stranded far from home without an income during snap lockdowns.\n\nResidents line up for Covid tests in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China on December 1. CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nIn recent days, some social media users have pointed out that Lunar New Year is just a month away – the country’s biggest annual holiday, a time when people typically travel home to gather with family, akin to the American Thanksgiving.\n\nFor some, the prospect of mass nationwide travel has raised concern of the virus spreading once more. Others, long fatigued with the toll of zero-Covid, greeted the news with relief.\n\n“I haven’t been home for Chinese New Year for two years now, I’m crying,” one person said on Weibo. Another wrote: “It’s been a long time. Welcome home.”\n\nMedicine, schools, and monitoring\n\nA few other guidelines are also likely to ease the transition away from zero-Covid toward a less disruptive model.\n\nFor instance, schools without Covid outbreaks are now asked to carry out “normal offline teaching activities,” and to reopen on-campus facilities such as cafeterias, libraries and sports venues. Schools with Covid cases can continue “normal teaching and living,” as long as they designate certain “risk areas” with control measures.\n\nThe guidelines also emphasize the need to make medicine widely accessible, dropping restrictions that previously made it difficult to buy cold and fever medication in pharmacies. Since early in the pandemic, China has required a prescription and negative Covid test to buy these.\n\nPerhaps reflecting public concern that the relaxation in rules could cause a surge in cases, residents have rushed to drug stores, with reports last week that cold and fever medicines were flying off shelves.\n\nThe State Council also urged doctors and local medical institutions to continue closely monitoring the health situation of key populations, including the risks posed to elderly or immunocompromised residents.\n\nSome experts have warned that a broader reopening inevitably brings health risks, especially to those vulnerable groups.\n\n“The key risk when countries decide to move away from a zero-Covid policy is really the strain this will exert on the health care system,” said Ruklanthi de Alwis, deputy director for the Centre for Outbreak Preparedness at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/24/middleeast/mahsa-amini-death-iran-internet-un-investigation-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Mahsa Amini death: Iran restricts internet as protest deaths mount ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIranian authorities say they will restrict internet access in the country until calm is restored to the streets, as protests over the death of a young woman in the custody of the morality police rock the Islamic Republic.\n\nThousands of Iranians have taken to the streets in protest since the death last week of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was apprehended in Tehran and taken to a “re-education center,” apparently for not wearing her hijab properly.\n\nSince Friday, demonstrations have taken place in at least 40 cities nationwide, including the capital Tehran, with protesters demanding an end to violence and discrimination against women as well as an end to compulsory wearing of the hijab.\n\nAt least 1,200 have been arrested in connection to the protests, Iranian state-backed news agency Tasmin reported Saturday, citing a security official.\n\nDozens of protesters have reportedly been killed in the resulting clashes with security forces.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the death toll – a precise figure is impossible for anyone outside the Iranian government to confirm – and different estimates have been given by opposition groups, international rights organizations and local journalists. Amnesty International said Friday that at least 30 people, including four children, had died; according to state media the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, 35 people have died.\n\nThe demonstrations have also seen journalists targeted by authorities, with at least 17 arrested, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a non-profit that monitors press freedom.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has asked all people to identify protesters, the country’s semi-official news agency Fars News said.\n\nThe IRCG is the elite wing of the Iranian military that was established in the aftermath of the country’s revolution in 1979.\n\nPeople light a fire during a protest over the death of Mahsa Amini in Tehran on September 21, 2022. West Asia News Agency/Reuters\n\nDecades of repression\n\nAuthorities hope that by restricting the internet they can control the protests – the latest in a wave that has swept Iran in recent years. They started with the Green movement in 2009 over contested election results and more recently the 2019 protests sparked by a rise in fuel prices. Hundreds were believed to have been killed in the violent crackdown three years ago and thousands injured, according to estimates released by the UN and rights groups.\n\nBut this year’s protests are different – in their scope, scale and unprecedented feminist nature. There is also mobilization across the socio-economic divide. A young generation of Iranians are rising up on the streets against decades of repression – arguably bolder than ever.\n\nThe demonstrations have spread to dozens of Iranian cities, from the Kurdish region in the northwest, to the capital Tehran and even more traditionally conservative cities like Mashhad.\n\nWhile they were ignited by the death of Amini – the initial calls for accountability have turned into demands for more rights and freedoms, especially for women who for decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution have faced discrimination and severe restrictions on their rights.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Iranian women open up about hijab law and morality police 01:13 - Source: CNN\n\nBut calls for regime change are growing too. People across the country are chanting for “death to the dictator,” in a reference to the Supreme Leader, tearing down portraits of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Remarkable images emerged on Friday night from Khamenei’s birthplace in the city of Mashhad, where protesters set fire to the statue of a man considered one of the symbols of the Islamic Revolution. Such scenes were unthinkable in the past.\n\nThis is all happening at a time when Iran’s hardline leadership is under growing pressure with talks to revive the stalled 2015 nuclear agreement and the state of the economy under US sanctions; ordinary Iranians are struggling to cope with soaring levels of inflation.\n\nWhile these protests are the biggest challenge for the government for years, analysts believe the government will likely move to contain them by resorting to the heavy-handed tactics it has used in the past. There are signs a brutal crackdown is coming, along with the internet restrictions on a level not seen since 2019. Other measures include the government mobilizing its supporters in mass rallies following Friday prayers; officials dismissing the demonstrators as rioters and foreign agents, and ominous warnings the army and powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps will be deployed to deal with the protests.\n\nSpeaking with state broadcaster IRIB on Friday, Iran’s Minister of Communications Ahmad Vahidi said, “Until the riots end, the internet will have limitations. To prevent riot organization through social media, we are obliged to create internet limitations.”\n\nVahidi’s comments came after videos on social media showed scenes of public defiance, with women removing and burning their headscarves and demonstrators chanting such slogans as, “women, life, freedom.”\n\nThe move to further restrict the internet also followed a call by the United Nations for an independent investigation into Amini’s death and for Iran’s security forces to refrain from using “disproportionate force” on the protesters.\n\nOutrage over Amini’s death comes from public skepticism over the account given by state officials, who claim she died after suffering a “heart attack” and fell into a coma. But Amini’s family have said she had no pre-existing heart condition.\n\nAmini’s death has now become a symbol of the violent oppression women have faced in Iran for decades, and her name has spread around the globe, with world leaders invoking her even at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City this week.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on Thursday said UN experts strongly condemned the use of physical violence against women in Iran by state authorities.\n\n“Iranian authorities said (Amini) died of a heart attack, and claimed her death was from natural causes. However, some reports suggested that Amini’s death was a result of alleged torture and ill-treatment,” it said in a statement.\n\n“We call on the Iranian authorities to hold an independent, impartial, and prompt investigation into Ms Amini’s death, make the findings of the investigation public and hold all perpetrators accountable,” it added.\n\nInternet crackdown\n\nThe internet monitoring agency Netblocks said Friday Iranians are facing a third wave of “nation-scale” loss of mobile internet connectivity as the protests continue.\n\nThe watchdog group said earlier in the week that Iran was experiencing the most severe internet restrictions since 2019, with mobile networks largely shutdown and social networks Instagram and WhatsApp restricted in the country since protests began.\n\nTo circumvent internet blocks, Iranians both inside the country and in the diaspora are turning to popular Virtual Private Network (VPN) providers such as Tor Project and Hula VPN – the top downloaded apps available in Iran via Google Play Store, a marketplace for Android smartphone users to download apps, according to monitoring service AppBrain.\n\nHowever, Netblocks has warned that the kind of internet disruption seen currently in the country “cannot generally be worked around with the use of circumvention software or VPNs.”\n\nSimilar internet restrictions took place in Iran in November 2019, taking Iranians almost entirely offline as authorities tried to curb the spread of nationwide protests over fuel prices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Violent crackdown doesn't slow protest against Iran's morality police 02:35 - Source: CNN\n\nOracle’s Internet Intelligence called it at the time the “largest internet shutdown ever observed in Iran.”\n\nMeanwhile, Internet activist hacker group Anonymous has also targeted the Iranian government online over the past week, announcing several breaches of government websites on Thursday.\n\nUsing the hashtag #OpIran, short for Operation Iran, which started gaining traction on social media following the death of Amini, Anonymous also tweeted Thursday that the organization was successful in hacking more than 1,000 CCTV Iranian cameras – a claim CNN has not been able to independently confirm.\n\nUN calls for investigation\n\nUN Secretary General António Guterres said Friday he was “concerned about reports of peaceful protests being met with excessive use of force leading to dozens of deaths and injuries.”\n\n“We call on the security forces to refrain from using unnecessary or disproportionate force and appeal to all to exercise restraint to avoid further escalation,” Dujarric said at the daily briefing on UNTV.\n\nThe UN said it’s closely following the protests in Iran and called on authorities to “respect the right to freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly and association.”\n\n“We also call on the authorities to respect women’s rights and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women and girls and implement effective measures to protect them from other human rights violations, in accordance with international standards.”\n\nGuterres reiterated a call from the Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights for a prompt investigation into the death of Amini by an “independent competent authority.”\n\nIran’s Interior Minister denied Mahsa Amini was beaten up, citing investigations into the incident, the country’s state news agency, IRNA, reported Saturday.\n\n“The results of observations, talking with those who were on the scene, receiving reports from relevant bodies and other investigations showed that late Ms. Amini was not beaten, Iranian Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi told (Iran’s state broadcaster) IRIB,” IRNA reported.\n\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi called Amini’s family saying he had ordered the incident to be investigated carefully so that no rights would be violated, according to IRNA. He said during his trip to the UNGA in New York last week that early coroner’s findings found no signs of beating.\n\nAfter returning to Iran follow his trip to the UNGA in New York, Raisi also called the family of a Basij member, a volunteer paramilitary group connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who was killed during protests in Mashhad, according to his official website.\n\nIn the statement released by his office, Raisi expressed his condolences to the family of Rasool Doust Mohammadi, the Basij member, and said there is a “need to distinguish between protest and disruption of public order and security,” while also describing the protests “as rioting and evil.”", "authors": ["Artemis Moshtaghian Jomana Karadsheh Caitlin Hu Kathleen Magramo Sahar Akbarzai Richard Roth", "Artemis Moshtaghian", "Jomana Karadsheh", "Caitlin Hu", "Kathleen Magramo", "Sahar Akbarzai", "Richard Roth"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/health/early-onset-cancer-increase/index.html", "title": "A global epidemic of cancer among people younger than 50 could ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIana dos Reis Nunes was 43 when she told her husband that she could feel something like a bubble in her abdomen when she lay on her side.\n\nAn ultrasound scan found spots on her liver, which led to blood tests and a colonoscopy.\n\n“There was a tumor the size of your fist, and she had no pain and no problems with bowel movements or anything like that,” recalled Brendan Higgins, her husband, who works as an artist in New York City.\n\nBy the time doctors found it, dos Reis Nunes’ colon cancer had spread. It was stage 4, meaning it had reached other parts of her body.\n\nThe family was blindsided.\n\n“She had had a baby 15 months prior to her diagnosis, so she’d had a million blood tests, you know, care from doctors and sonograms … and there was no indication of anything, nothing whatsoever.”\n\nWhen cancer strikes an adult under the age of 50, doctors call it an early-onset case. These cancers at younger ages are becoming more common.\n\nIana dos Reis Nunes was 43 when she was diagnosed with colon cancer. Brendan Higgins\n\nA new review of cancer registry records from 44 countries found that the incidence of early-onset cancers is rising rapidly for colorectal and 13 other types of cancers, many of which affect the digestive system, and this increase is happening across many middle- and high-income nations.\n\nThe review’s authors say the upswing in younger adults in happening in part because of more sensitive testing for some cancer types, such as thyroid cancer. But testing doesn’t completely account for the trend, says co-authorShuji Ogino, a professor of pathology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nOgino says the spike is due to an unhealthy stew of risk factors that are probably working together, some which are known and others that need to be investigated.\n\nHe notes that many of these risks have established links to cancer like obesity, inactivity, diabetes, alcohol, smoking, environmental pollution and Western diets high in red meat and added sugars, not to mention shift work and lack of sleep.\n\n“And there are many unknown risk factors as well, like a pollutant or like food additives. Nobody knows,” he said.\n\nOgino thinks the fact that so many of these cancers – eight out of 14 studied – involve the digestive system points to a big role for diet and the bacteria that live in our gut, called the microbiome.\n\n“I think this actually is an important piece because what it’s pointing to is changing exposure prevalences at early ages, that are producing earlier-onset cancers,” says Dr. Elizabeth Platz, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who also edits the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, who was not involved in the review.\n\nTake obesity. Once, it was rare. Not only has it become more common to have a dangerously high body mass index, but people are becoming obese earlier in life, even in childhood, so these cancer risks are building decades earlier than they did for previous generations.\n\nAn explosion of colorectal cancer in younger adults\n\nThe surge in early-onset colorectal cancer – the cancer dos Reis Nunes had – has been particularly steep.\n\nOgino’s review found that across the years of the study, the average yearly climb in colorectal cancer in young adults was about 2% in the US, Australia, Canada, France and Japan. In the UK, it’s almost 3% per year in England, Scotland and Wales. In Korea and Ecuador, it is roughly 5% per year.\n\n“It doesn’t seem big, but you can think about inflation: If it’s 2% every year, it’s going to be a big change in 10 years or 20 years, you know?” Ogino said. “It’s not trivial.”\n\nBetween 1988 and 2015, those yearly upticks pushed the rates of early colorectal cancers from nearly 8 per every 100,000 people to almost 13 per 100,000 – a 63% increase, according to another recent review published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nStudies show that about 1 in 10 colorectal cancers in the US is diagnosed in someone who is between the ages of 20 and 50.\n\nThe younger you are, the higher the risk\n\nOgino’s review found something called a cohort effect, meaning the risk of an early-onset cancer has increased for each successive group of people born at a later time. Those born the 1990s have a higher risk of developing an early-onset cancer in their lifetime than those born in the 1980s, for example.\n\nOther malignancies going up in younger Americans include those in the breast, endometrium, gall bladder and bile duct, kidney, pancreas, thyroid, stomach and plasma cells in the blood – a cancer called myeloma.\n\nDr. Karen Knudsen, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society, calls the review “a call to arms.”\n\nCancer is a serious diagnosis at any age, but when it shows up in younger adults, the tumors are typically more aggressive, and they often go undetected for longer because routine cancer screening isn’t recommended for some of the most common cancer types, such as breast and prostate, until age 50.\n\n“Not only were these early-onset type of cancers more likely to be diagnosed when the tumor is at a more advanced stage, it was also in some of the reports that were tabulated here associated with worse survival outcome,” Knudsen said.\n\n‘Not an old person’s disease anymore’\n\nDos Reis Nunes started treatment in 2017at Sloan Kettering and Mount Sinai cancer centers in New York.\n\nHer husband remembers the doctors explaining that she was one of a growing number of younger patients they were seeing.\n\n“I recall it being a point of discussion in both hospitals that people getting colon cancer were getting younger and younger, more and more, and they couldn’t explain it,” Higgins said.\n\nHiggins says he spent a lot of time in online support groups, looking for answers and comfort.\n\n“And there were a lot of young people in those groups,” he said. “It wasn’t populated by people in their 50s and 60s. It’s like 30s, 40s, 50s. So I was very conscious that this wasn’t an old person’s disease anymore,” he said.\n\nIn fact, routine screening – with colonoscopies and tests that check for blood in stool – has driven down cases of colorectal cancer and made it less fatal in older adults, even as cases have soared in those under 50.\n\nKnudsen says three things should happen in the wake of large, definitive reviews like this one.\n\n“One is a call for research so that we truly do understand some of the specific trends that we are seeing,” she says.\n\nSecond, she wants to see more awareness of the risks, which will hopefully help people modify their behavior to control what risks they can.\n\nThird, she says, groups that make recommendations for cancer screenings should re-evaluate when those screenings should start. It could be that some should start at younger ages.\n\nIn fact, that’s already happening.\n\nLast year, the rising incidence of colon cancer in younger adults prompted the US Preventive Services Task Force to lower the age at which it recommends doctors start screening people for colon cancer to 45.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“If you’re heading to 45, you should really be thinking about this and not waiting until 50 or 55,” Higgins said.\n\nHiggins said his wife’s first 12 months of cancer treatment were almost miraculous, “like remarkable reactions to the chemo.”\n\n“And then – I read about this actually – it can unravel really quickly,” he said. “And once it started unraveling, it just went downhill extremely quickly.”\n\nHis wife died in 2019, leaving behind their daughter, Maeve, who had not yet turned 4, an 11-year-old and a 20-year-old.\n\n“We had a great love story,” he said. “I’m still bitter. Still angry.\n\n“Life is OK. Everybody is fine. But I’m like, deep down, I’m seething that it happened to her.

Queiroz has said Iranian players can protest at the World Cup, but only within FIFA regulations.\n\nThe players, the source said, had been promised “presents and cars” ahead of the England game but the regime, the source alleged, had switched to threatening players and their families after the humiliation of the team’s refusal to sing their national anthem.\n\n“In the last game against Wales, the regime sent over hundreds of these actor supporters in order to create a false sense of support and favor amongst the fans.

And that has made him an outstanding teacher, and his students have loved him.”\n\nHe was arrested 11 months ago at an airport in the Russian capital, where he was returning for the school year, after traveling into the country with cannabis.\n\nHis family and lawyer said he was carrying it for medical purposes that had been recommended by a doctor to treat “severe spinal pain.”\n\nLast month, he was found guilty in a court just outside of Moscow – the same where the trial of detained WNBA player Brittney Griner is taking place – of committing “large-scale drugs smuggling” and given the 14-year sentence.\n\nThe situation around Fogel’s case has other similarities to Griner’s. Both Americans were arrested at a Russian airport for having cannabis, which they testified was for personal ailments, although Fogel was found to have been carrying much more of the substance than Griner.\n\nHowever, unlike Griner, Fogel has not been classified as wrongfully detained – a designation which would prompt the US government to actively work on negotiations to secure his release as part of the efforts by the State Department’s Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs.\n\n“The Griner case makes the case for his classification as wrongfully detained even stronger. But even leaving that aside he should still be designated as wrongfully detained. It cannot be explained unless there is a political motive, because legally it does not add up,” Thomas Firestone, a member of Fogel’s US legal team, said.\n\n‘Wildly disproportionate’\n\nThe length of Fogel’s sentence floored his family, who have filed an appeal, and Firestone, who told CNN that “14 years for that kind of offense is wildly disproportionate.”\n\n“It is also disproportionate when you consider other sentences in the Russian system. There are murderers in Russia who are sentenced to only 10 years in prison,” said Firestone, a former Department of Justice official who has served as the Resident Legal Advisor and Acting Chief of the Law Enforcement Section at the US Embassy in Moscow.\n\nAnne Fogel told CNN they “have filed an appeal. And we’re hoping that the Russian judicial system will recognize the humanity of this, that a 61-year old man, elderly at this point, is not capable of doing this kind of time. This is a death sentence for him.”\n\n“Every day is full of frustrations, frustration probably doesn’t even go far enough,” Elise Hyland, another sister of Fogel, said, telling CNN that throughout the trial the family tried to “play by the rules” – keeping a low profile, working within the Russian legal system, providing all the supporting documentation in support of his case – in the hopes of a lenient sentence, but they did not get it.\n\n“This sentence that my brother has been given is outrageous. We know that the sentence exceeds what is reasonable and it is because of his status as an American citizen,” she said.\n\nA foreign government detaining an individual “solely or substantially because he or she is a United States national” is one of the criteria under the Robert Levinson Act for the US government to determine whether someone is wrongfully detained.\n\nFirestone said that “it is hard to say if Griner’s fame played into the State Department quickly designating her as wrongfully detained, because it is hard to say what information they have about her detention and the background of that case.”\n\n“These cases are always a multifactor analysis and are often based on confidential information and intelligence,” he told CNN.\n\nState Department spokesperson Ned Price said that “each case is unique, and in determining whether a detention is wrongful, in determining if a detention is wrongful, we look at the totality of the circumstances.”\n\n“We never close the book when it comes to any particular case. We are constantly looking at the facts. We are constantly looking at the circumstances,” he said at a State Department briefing Tuesday. “As we learn more about any given case, as we learn more about the circumstances of detention, the charges, fair trial guarantees, due process or lack thereof, we are always weighing those developments against the criteria to determine whether an American is wrongfully held or not.”\n\nFogel’s family said they would like to see him designated as wrongfully detained, but they are hopeful that the US government will do everything it can to bring him home.\n\nBut time is of the essence, his family said.\n\nAnne Fogel told CNN the family has only been able to receive letters from Marc, and they haven’t spoken to him in nearly a year.\n\n“It’s incredibly worrisome because we can’t really have, there is no honest conversation. Everything goes through the censors. It’s harrowing,” she said.\n\n“I feel like we’re in a black box.

It was not immediately clear exactly how much that would reduce the sentence.\n\nThe decision came after an appeal hearing Tuesday at which Griner, whom the US considers wrongfully detained, again apologized as she and her attorneys asked the court for a more lenient sentence, arguing the verdict was unfair and unjustified under Russian law. The attorneys urged the court to acquit her, calling her sentence disproportionate and the previous court ruling wrong in saying Griner had criminal intent.\n\n“I’ve been here almost eight months, and people with more severe crimes have been given less than what I was given,” Griner said Tuesday, appearing at the hearing via video link from her detention center, Correctional Colony No. 1 in Novoye Grishino, north of Moscow.\n\n“I really hope the court will adjust this sentence,” she said before the judgment, “because it has been very, very stressful and very traumatic to my mental and my psyche and being away from my family, not being able to communicate.”\n\nGriner’s attorneys expressed disappointment after the hearing, saying in a statement the verdict “contains numerous defects” and they feel “the punishment is excessive.”\n\nUS officials have tried to secure the release of Griner and Paul Whelan, another American imprisoned in Russia, by proposing a prisoner swap with Russia. Those efforts have continued in recent weeks, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Tuesday in a statement that called the latest hearing a “sham,” adding, “President Biden has been very clear that Brittney should be released immediately.”\n\nAt a Covid-19 vaccination event, the President said: “We have not been meeting with much positive response but we’re not stopping.”\n\nThe Biden administration has had conversations with Russia on the matter in recent days, State Department spokesman Ned Price said on CNN. “This has not been a static process, we are continuing to urge them to engage and engage them seriously on this,” he said.\n\nBrittney Griner, who was sentenced to nine years in a Russian penal colony in August for drug smuggling, is seen on a screen Tuesday via a video link before a court hearing to consider an appeal against her sentence at a Moscow court.

That has not changed, the most senior American diplomat in Moscow told reporters Tuesday outside the Moscow Regional Court.\n\n“Nothing in the previous sentence, nothing in the result of today’s appeal changes the fact that the United States government considers Griner to be wrongfully detained,” US Embassy Charge d’Affaires Elizabeth Rood said.\n\nGriner was initially taken into custody days before the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – when authorities accused her of trying to smuggle less than a gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. Griner plays in Russia during the WNBA’s offseason.\n\nFollow live updates: Russia’s war in Ukraine\n\nThe All-Star center for the Phoenix Mercury pleaded guilty to drug charges, telling the court during her trial that vape cartridges containing the cannabis oil were in her luggage because she had packed her bags in a hurry.\n\nIn court Tuesday, defense attorney Maria Blagovolina cast doubt on the Russian examination of Griner’s alleged drug use, calling the results of that examination “doubtful and unconfirmed.” “Continuous narcotic substance use is incompatible with a career as a professional athlete,” added Blagovolina, a partner at Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin and Partners law firm.\n\n“No lawyer will be able to say in all honesty that this verdict is in line with Russian judicial practice,” Griner’s other attorney, Alexander Boykov of the Moscow Legal Center, said.\n\nBoth attorneys previously indicated they felt Griner’s nine-year sentence was extreme, with Blagovolina calling it “very severe for this type of crime and this amount of this substance.”\n\nAhead of the hearing, Blagovolina and Boykov called Griner a “strong person” with a “champion’s character” who was nevertheless “severely stressed being separated from her loved ones for over eight months.”\n\nThe court hearing the appeal could have left Griner’s verdict in place, overruled it and sent it back to the lower court, or reduced her prison term, her lawyers said.\n\n“She is very nervous waiting for the appeal hearing,” they added in a written statement to CNN. “Brittney does not expect any miracles to happen but hopes that the appeal court will hear the arguments of the defense and reduce the term.”\n\nBlagovolina told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday that the next step would be a second appeal, “but normally we do not expect much from this legal step.”\n\nThe lawyer said the basketball star is a “fighter” and has been holding up well, but she was visibly upset with Tuesday’s decision.\n\n“Of course she didn’t expect much from today’s hearing, but still she did have some hope, in a way you could see from her face that she was very, very upset when the court hearing ended,” Blagovolina said.\n\nBlagovolina said that it’s still early to discuss what conditions Griner might face while incarcerated, but she could end up in a penal colony.\n\nUS officials work to secure Griner’s release\n\nWhile Griner’s case plays out, US officials have separately proposed a potential prisoner swap with Russia, offering to exchange convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout for Griner and Whelan, an American citizen who’s been held by Russia for alleged espionage since 2018. Whelan, who has consistently denied the charges, was convicted and sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years in prison.\n\nDespite the “pretty persistent” pace of discussions between the US and Russia to secure the Americans’ release, a senior administration official told CNN last week the Biden administration has yet to receive a serious counteroffer from the Russian side.\n\n“They’re not nonresponsive. I would say that they continue to respond with something that they know not to be feasible or available,” the official said of the Russian response.\n\nFormer Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico – whose namesake center works on behalf of families of hostages and detainees, and who recently traveled to Russia to discuss the possible release of Griner and Whelan – recently said he was “cautiously optimistic” the two Americans could be released.\n\nRichardson, who also served as US ambassador to the United Nations under President Bill Clinton, said he’s working with both their families and coordinating with the White House to work toward their releases. The former governor played a role in the release of Trevor Reed, an American veteran detained in Russia for three years before his release in April.\n\nMeanwhile, Griner’s wife, Cherelle, and their supporters have continued to highlight her case and maintain support and pressure to ensure she’s brought home, starting a #WeAreBG campaign on social media.\n\nThe WNBA on Tuesday reiterated its desire to see Griner brought home, saying in a statement the outcome of her appeal “is further verification that BG is not just wrongfully detained – she is very clearly a hostage.”\n\n“We must unite and support the stated public commitment of the Biden Administration and Congressional leaders to do everything possible to get her home,” the statement said, adding, “No athlete should be used as a political pawn.”\n\nGriner’s agent, Lindsay Colas, called a Moscow court’s rejection of Griner’s appeal “disappointing, yet unsurprising,” and said the basketball star was “being held by Russia simply because she is an American.”\n\nColas thanked the Biden administration and other outside groups for advocating for Griner’s return.\n\nAfter months of pushing, Cherelle Griner met last month with Biden, telling CNN the meeting illustrated the administration’s commitment to bringing her wife home.\n\n“It wasn’t a meeting where the President told me the news that I want to hear,” Cherelle Griner said. “It wasn’t that, but it was one of those still pivotal meetings where … it allowed me to have confidence in what he’s doing right now.”\n\nAs for Griner, she turned 32 last week, celebrating her birthday in a cell in the suburbs of Moscow, her attorneys told CNN. They spent a few hours with her in an effort to “cheer her up” as much as they could, relaying birthday messages from around the world.\n\n“Thank you everyone for fighting so hard to get me home,” Griner said in a message shared by her attorneys. “All the support and love are definitely helping me.”", "authors": ["Anna Chernova Dakin Andone Zahra Ullah", "Anna Chernova", "Dakin Andone", "Zahra Ullah"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}]}

The officer, who was on a motorcycle, pulled Hill over, knocked on the window of his McLaren 720S coupe and informed him that he was speeding.\n\nAll things Dolphins: Latest Miami Dolphins news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\n“Don’t knock on my window like that,” Hill told the officer, repeating it at least seven times. “Give me my ticket, bro, so I can go. Do what you have to do.”\n\nAfter Hill turned over his license, he rolled his window up again. The officer knocked on the window twice more.\n\n“Keep your window down or I’m going to get you out of the car,\" the officer said. \"As a matter of fact, get out of the car. … Get out of the car right now. We’re not playing this game. Get out. Get out!”\n\nAt least three officers are seen pulling Hill, who was on the phone, out of the car and onto the ground.\n\n“Hey Drew, hey Drew, I’m getting arrested dude. I’m getting arrested,” Hill said as he’s brought to the ground. Hill was speaking to Dolphins head of team security Drew Brooks, who later arrived at the scene.\n\nHill was placed in handcuffs, standing on the curb while another officer attempted to bring him down to the ground in a seated position.\n\n“I just had surgery on my knee! I just had surgery on my knee!” Hill said. “Chill bro, chill bro.”\n\nAfter forcing him to the ground, an officer said to Hill: “Did you just have surgery on your ears when we told you to put your window down?”\n\nHill complained about knee pain several times and repeatedly asked if he could stand, citing tendonitis.\n\n\"I'm not playing today bruh, because that dude (expletive) my knee up. Like he really tackled me on my knee on this damn cement, bruh,\" Hill said. (He went on to catch seven passes for 130 yards and a touchdown in the Dolphins' 20-17 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars.)\n\nTeammates Jonnu Smith and Calais Campbell are also shown on the body-camera footage, interacting with officers while attempting to assist Hill. Smith appeared to receive a traffic ticket for failing to move his car. Campbell was briefly placed in handcuffs after also declining to leave the scene.\n\nAs the initial officer explained to another officer what led to the stop, Hill can be heard in the background saying: “I’m just being a Black man, that’s it. I’m just being Black in America, bruh. … I’m just being a Black man in America, bruh, with a nice car.”\n\nAn officer informed Hill he was being cited for careless driving and driving without a seatbelt.\n\nHill’s Atlanta-based lawyer, J.B. Collins, released a statement Monday saying his legal team is “exploring all legal remedies.” They believe the officers’ actions were “excessive.”\n\n“Mr. Hill understands the inherently dangerous job that law enforcement is tasked with and understands that officer safety is important. However, at no point in time did Mr. Hill pose a threat to these officers,” Collins said.\n\n“We believe that this matter was escalated due to overzealous officers attempting to impose their authority on Mr. Hill because they were not pleased with how fast he complied with their request and that Mr. Hill did not roll down his window far enough to their liking.\"\n\nMiami-Dade Police director Stephanie Daniels said the department released the body-camera footage Monday, despite its ongoing internal investigation, as part of \"our commitment to transparency.\"\n\n\"The department is committed to conducting a thorough, objective investigation into this matter, and we will continue to update the public on the outcome of that process,\" she said in a statement.\n\nAfter being joined at the scene by Brooks and Hill's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, Hill left the scene by shaking hands with the responding officers, including the one who initially pulled him over. He told the officers: “Respect, for real. It’s nothing personal. Appreciate it. Appreciate it.\"\n\n“I still got love for y’all,” Hill added as he walked away. “I still want to be an officer one day. I’ve got respect for all of y’all.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/dolphins/2024/09/10/tyreek-hill-police-officer/75160068007/", "title": "Attorney for police officer involved in Tyreek Hill case speaks out", "text": "One of the police officers involved in the detainment of Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill was placed on \"administrative duties\" Sunday while the Miami-Dade Police Department investigates his actions.\n\nNow, attorneys for the officer are arguing that such a move was \"premature\" and requesting that their client be returned to his usual role.\n\n\"We call for our client’s immediate reinstatement, and a complete, thorough, and objective investigation, as Director Daniels has also advocated,\" attorneys Ignacio Alvarez and Israel Reyes said in a news release Tuesday. \"Our client will not comment until this investigation is concluded and the facts are fully revealed.\"\n\nThe lawyers declined to name their client, though the Miami-Dade Police Department announced later Tuesday that his name is Danny Torres and he is a 27-year veteran of the department\n\nSpokespeople for Miami-Dade police did not immediately reply to questions about the attorneys' request that Torres be reinstated.\n\nAll things Dolphins: Latest Miami Dolphins news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nThe department's director, Stephanie Daniels, said in a statement Sunday that she had initiated an investigation into Torres through the department's internal affairs office. She said she is \"committed to transparency and accountability to the community with any situation involving my officers.\"\n\nSunday's encounter between Hill and police caused a jarring scene just outside Hard Rock Stadium, hours before Hill and the Dolphins faced the Jacksonville Jaguars in their season-opener. And the officers' actions have come under scrutiny − particularly their use of force during what otherwise appeared to be a routine traffic stop.\n\nOn Monday evening, Miami-Dade police released more than an hour of footage from body-worn cameras on the scene, which showed officers forcefully pulling Hill from his McLaren after he rolled up his window during the interaction. The officers removed him from the car, took him to the ground and handcuffed him for more than 15 minutes. He repeatedly complained about knee pain during the encounter.\n\nHill later acknowledged to officers that he had been speeding but criticized them for escalating the situation by pulling him out of his car and putting him in handcuffs. He was eventually allowed to leave the scene after being cited for careless driving and driving without a seatbelt.\n\n\"They said I was speeding, reckless driving or whatever,\" Hill said in a news conference after racking up 130 receiving yards in Miami's win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. \"I wasn’t raised like that to name drop.

The lawsuit was filed in federal court three days after Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed the measure into law. Ivey is running for reelection this year and faces challengers in next month’s GOP primary. “By signing SB 184 Governor Ivey has told kind, loving, and loyal Alabama families that they cannot stay here without denying their children the basic medical care they need,” Dr. Morissa Ladinsky, one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “She has undermined the health and well-being of Alabama children and put doctors like me in the horrifying position of choosing between ignoring the medical needs of our patients or risking being sent to prison.” The parents of a 13-year-old transgender girl in Jefferson County and a 17-year-old transgender boy in Shelby County are participating in the lawsuit. The plaintiffs are known as Roe and Doe in the court filing to protect the children’s identities. The Southern Poverty Law Center; the Human Rights Campaign, a national advocacy group for the LGBTQ community; and other groups are representing the plaintiffs.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Legislature is not on track to finish its work within a voter-approved session limit. The 90-day mark will be reached Sunday. The voter-approved limit took effect in 2008, but lawmakers face no penalty for failing to meet the deadline and can continue working beyond it. The state constitution permits regular sessions of up to 121 days, with an option to extend another 10 days. Lawmakers last finished within the 90-day limit in 2013, according to statistics from the Legislative Affairs Agency. The state House over the weekend passed its version of a state operating budget, which the Senate still must consider. Senate President Peter Micciche did not have an immediate update on when the operating budget would reach the Senate floor. Differences between the versions that pass the House and Senate usually are worked out by a conference committee. The House version called for a $1,300 “energy relief” payment to Alaskans and a dividend of about $1,250. A long-standing formula for calculating the annual dividend was last used in 2015. While many lawmakers see that formula as unsustainable, agreement has yet to be reached on an alternative. The dividend amount in the meantime generally has been set by lawmakers.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state House voted Monday to delay the effective date for legislation signed last month requiring voters to provide evidence of their citizenship, which has already prompted two lawsuits amid fears by voting rights advocates that it could cancel the registrations of thousands of people. If approved by the Senate and Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, the citizenship requirement would take effect after the 2022 election, a concession demanded by a GOP lawmaker who provided the final vote to pass the bill out of the Senate. As it stands now, that requirement and others in a bill signed March 30 will take effect 90 days after the legislative session ends, which is likely to fall between the primary and general election. Monday’s update also would make a technical change that appears aimed at addressing concerns the bill could require hundreds of thousands of people who registered before 2005 to provide proof of citizenship. Arizona is the only state that requires documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote. A 2013 Supreme Court decision on Arizona’s law said anyone who registers using a federal voter registration form, which does not require documentation of citizenship, must be allowed to vote in federal elections. The controversial new law seeks to block those voters from voting for president or by mail.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A medical marijuana producer is opening a retail location in the city’s suburbs. Good Day Farm, which has operations across the South, on Tuesday unveiled Berner’s By Good Day Farm. Occupying 4,034 square feet of prime retail space in the Little Rock suburb of Chenal, the retail collaboration marks the Cookies brand’s entry into the Arkansas medical cannabis market and will provide the state’s patients with an expanded assortment of curated cannabis products and exclusive merchandise. “I never imagined our first store in the South being in Arkansas; I actually never pictured opening a store in the South in general,” said Berner, founder and CEO of Cookies, who goes by one name. “We are extremely excited about our partnership with Good Day Farm and look forward to providing real menus and a curated customer journey for those in Arkansas, especially those who have never experienced cannabis before. The last time I was in Little Rock, I was on a tour with Snoop (Dogg), and we had a blast. I look forward to setting the tone with Good Day Farm and giving Arkansas a taste of California.” A grand opening event will be held Friday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSantee: A judge has ordered the Southern California city to throw out approval of a long-planned housing project, ruling that developers hadn’t adequately considered how new homes could affect potential wildfire evacuations. The Santee City Council in late 2020 approved the Fanita Ranch project, giving the green light to 3,000 new homes in hills northeast of San Diego. In her decision, Superior Court Judge Katherine Bacal wrote that eight resolutions and ordinances giving approval must be overturned, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. The newspaper said the judge expressed concern that the plan didn’t fully address whether thousands of new residents would have time to flee during an emergency like a wildfire. The project, overseen by HomeFed Fanita Rancho, is not dead, and developers said they would revise the environmental impact report to address the judge’s concerns. Messages left by the Union-Tribune with the city’s manager and attorney were not immediately returned. The decision was celebrated by environmental groups that sued to stop the project, arguing that building more homes would only increase the risk of fire.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: An advisory board has begun the process of removing the disparaging word “squaw” from 28 of the state’s peaks, valleys, passes and creeks. The Colorado Geographic Naming Advisory Board met for three hours Sunday and considered task force recommendations and suggestions from local communities, The Colorado Sun reports. The board approved new names for nearly two dozen features but deferred a handful of name changes to a federal task force and steered clear of suggestions for naming features after people. The board also said all of its recommendations should take a back seat if Indigenous tribes suggest a better replacement. The word “squaw,” derived from the Algonquin language, may once have simply meant “woman.” But over generations, it morphed into a misogynist and racist term to disparage Indigenous women. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland in November created a committee to strip the name from federal maps. The Derogatory Geographic Names Task Force in February identified 660 features on federal land with the name, including 28 in Colorado.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A bill that would allow terminally ill adults in the state to request medication to help them die was suddenly derailed Monday by an unusual parliamentary procedure during a committee vote. Advocates had expressed optimism this would finally be the year, after roughly a decade of emotional debate, the legislation would get a vote in the full House of Representatives and Senate and be signed into law by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont. However, Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, the top House member on the General Assembly’s Judiciary Committee, made a motion to “divide the committee.” That meant only senators on the panel could vote on the legislation. In Connecticut, both House and Senate members comprise committees. Ultimately, the senators defeated the bill on a 5-4 vote. Democratic Sen. Mae Flexer of Windham voted with the four Republicans in opposing the measure. “It says a lot about support for medical aid in dying, both inside and outside the Capitol, that opponents had to resort to a rarely used parliamentary maneuver to defeat the legislation,” said Tim Appleton, campaign director for the advocacy group Compassion & Choices, arguing there’s strong support among Connecticut residents for the bill. He predicted the vote will mean “immeasurable suffering” for people who are already terminally ill.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A high-ranking state medical official who is also a former legislator has opted for a bench trial instead of a jury trial on charges of official misconduct and falsifying business records. The trial of Rebecca D. Walker began Tuesday afternoon in New Castle County Superior Court. Walker is the director of nursing in the state Division of Public Health and a former state House representative. She is accused of submitting phony records regarding employee alcohol and drug testing over a period of almost five years while she served as deputy director of the state Division of Forensic Science. Walker was placed on paid administrative leave from her nursing post after being indicted in April 2021 but was allowed to return to work less than three weeks later. As Democratic vice-chair of the House Health and Human Development, Walker co-sponsored and helped pass a bill in 2014 that created the forensic science division. Months later, without a public job posting, she was hired as deputy director of the division at a salary of more than $92,000. The indictment alleges that between May 2015 and February 2020, Walker, “with the intent to defraud,” falsified employee substance abuse testing records, indicating that employees had passed tests they never received.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. House Oversight Committee sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission saying it found evidence the NFL’s Washington Commanders engaged in unlawful financial conduct. In the letter obtained by the Associated Press, the committee said the team withheld ticket revenue from visiting teams and refundable ticket deposits from season ticketholders. The committee said emails, documents and statements made by former employees indicate team executives and owner Dan Snyder engaged in “a troubling, long-running, and potentially unlawful pattern of financial conduct.” The committee is sharing documents with the FTC while requesting the commission take any action necessary to make sure the money is returned to its rightful owners. Congress launched an investigation into the team’s workplace misconduct after the league did not release a report detailing the findings of an independent probe into the matter. After testimony from former employees, that investigation expanded to the organization’s finances. Lawyers Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, who represent more than 40 former employees, including some who testified, called the letter “damning.” “It’s clear that the team’s misconduct goes well beyond the sexual harassment and abuse of employees already documented,” they said in a statement.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state will create new grant programs to help fathers become more engaged with their own children and with children whose fathers aren’t in their homes under a bill signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday. The Department of Children and Families will manage the grant program and work with nonprofit organizations to promote the importance of fathers being a part of their children’s lives. It will also create a mentor program to help children who don’t have a father in their lives. “This has huge ramifications for someone’s ability to be able to realize their God-given potential,” DeSantis said. “Any dad who may not be engaged, we want to be able to support. We’ve got programs, we’ve got community groups, we’ve got nonprofits. … You’re not a man by leaving your kids hung out to dry. You need to be there.” DeSantis signed the bill at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers practice facility and was joined by former coach Tony Dungy.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSocial Circle: The state’s wildlife agency is asking residents to report sightings of an invasive lizard that can pose a threat to native species. The state Department of Natural Resources is trying to locate and remove South American tegus from Georgia before the lizards can thrive in greater numbers. So far, the state’s only known wild population has been found in Toombs and Tattnall counties in southeast Georgia. Wildlife officials hope to stop the black-and-white lizards from spreading further. They can grow up to 4 feet long and weigh up to 10 pounds, and the reptiles have a wide-ranging appetite that favors eggs of turtles, alligators and ground-nesting birds. “They can live almost anywhere and eat almost anything,” Daniel Sollenberger, a DNR wildlife biologist, said in a news release. “We are focusing our efforts to accomplish two goals: document the extent of where tegus occur in the wilds of southeast Georgia and remove those animals as soon as we can after they are detected.” Officials aren’t sure how tegus got introduced into the wild in Georgia, but they are commonly kept as pets. Last year the DNR removed a single tegu that was spotted on a game camera and later captured in a trap. Seven were collected in 2020. Wildlife officials warn if tegus become established in the wild, they will be nearly impossible to eradicate.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The governor said Monday that he is not currently considering reinstating a mask requirement for public indoor spaces. Hawaii was the last state in the nation to lift its indoor mask mandate at the end of March. “I don’t anticipate reinstating the mask mandate at this point,” said Ige in an email. The state has seen an uptick in new coronavirus cases since the rules were lifted. “We did expect a slight increase in case numbers after spring break, and we have seen that in the last week or so,” Ige said. “However, we are not seeing the kind of surges that are currently happening on the mainland. Hospitalizations continue to be low here, and we are in a good place.” Philadelphia reinstated its mask mandate Monday amid a surge in COVID-19 cases, and other cities across the country are seeing a rise in cases. Ige said if the conditions warranted it, he might consider requiring masks again in the future. “If there is a big spike, we may have to revisit masks,” he said. “However, I noticed over the weekend that many people continue to wear their masks indoors. We know that masks work, and they make a difference in keeping our communities safe.” Public schools in Hawaii still require children to wear masks indoors, a measure the governor said he continues to support.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge ruled Monday that a mother accused of conspiring to kill her children, her estranged husband and a lover’s wife is now mentally competent to stand trial on some of the charges in Idaho. Daybell and her new husband, Chad Daybell, face numerous charges in the complicated case involving allegations of bizarre spiritual beliefs involving “zombies” and doomsday predictions. Prosecutors have said Lori and Chad Daybell espoused the religious beliefs in an effort to encourage or justify the murders. The case against her had been hold for months after Judge Steven Boyce ordered her committed to a mental facility so she could undergo treatment in an effort to make her mentally fit enough to assist in her own defense. Boyce’s new order said Lori Vallow Daybell “is restored to competency and is fit to proceed” in the Idaho murder case. He did not provide other details about her treatment or mental condition. She is scheduled to be formally arraigned in court next week, and both Lori and Chad Daybell are set to stand trial together early next year. They are charged with conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder in connection with the deaths of Lori Daybell’s children, 7-year-old Joshua “JJ” Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan, as well as Chad Daybell’s first wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A convicted felon who pleaded guilty to charges that he opened fire on police in 2020, wounding three officers, was sentenced Monday to 31 years in prison. The sentence comes two months after Lovelle Jordan, 27, pleaded guilty to one count of attempted murder and five counts of aggravated battery to a peace officer, the Chicago Tribune reports. The charges stem from a July 2020 shooting that came shortly after Jordan was arrested in connection with a carjacking in downtown Chicago. Police had driven him to a station on the city’s Northwest Side. Officers patted him down, but while they found he was carrying drugs in his pockets, according to authorities, they did not see that he was carrying a small loaded pistol. Jordan was handcuffed behind his back. At the time of the shooting, Chief of Detectives Brendan Deenihan said that officers had searched Jordan before he was transported, but he apparently had the gun “extremely secreted, probably very close to his private area” and was able to retrieve the weapon during the ride to the station. Jordan was somehow able to move his cuffed hands from behind his back, grabbed the gun and opened fire when an officer opened the door for him at the station. Dozens of shots were fired in a shootout between Jordan and three officers were shot. Jordan was also shot and was left paralyzed.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: State officials have chosen the preferred route of a proposed highway that would run from the Ohio River to Interstate 69, linking small southern Indiana communities to I-69. The Indiana Department of Transportation announced its selection of the “Alternative P” route over several other options for the Mid-States Corridor in a public notice published Monday. The route would start in Spencer County and use existing U.S. 231 until it links with Interstate 64. A new, 54-mile portion of the road would then branch off and run parallel to U.S. 231 before linking with I-69 just north of the Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center in Martin County. That route would mostly bypass “developed” parts of towns along the path, including Jasper and Loogootee, the notice said. Mid-States Corridor Project spokeswoman Mindy Peterson declined to provide specifics – including why INDOT chose “alternative P” – until an environmental impact statement is released Friday. Public hearings on the preferred route are set for April 26 at WestGate Academy in Odon and April 28 at the Jasper Arts Center on Vincennes University’s Jasper campus. INDOT and the project’s supporters say it will improve southern Indiana’s highway connections. Opponents have argued that building a new highway would damage the region’s forests and caves.\n\nIowa\n\nOxford: Iowa Farm Sanctuary has become the first in the state to be accredited by the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries, joining the ranks of more than 150 GFAS-accredited and -verified sanctuaries, rescues and rehabilitation centers worldwide. “It’s a huge accomplishment, and there’s so much buildup to it. We were confident that we are accreditation-worthy, but it was just all the work that we put into it,” said Katie Valentine, assistant director of operations at the Iowa Farm Sanctuary. The Iowa Farm Sanctuary was founded by Shawn and Jered Camp in 2016. The nonprofit focuses on helping animals with special needs like Ellie, a cow who was born blind. Not all residents at the farm sanctuary have special needs. Many come from dangerous situations, like Kathy the goat, rescued from a hoarder. Accreditation from GFAS vouches for organizations with stakeholders such as donors or a foundation. An organization must meet the GFAS Standards of Excellence, which contain guidelines for housing, veterinary care, well-being and handling, financial stability and more. “In Iowa, which is a state known for having a lot of animal agriculture, Iowa Farm Sanctuary really stands out because unlike (in animal agriculture), they are providing individualized care to their residents,” said Jessica Harris, program director of farmed animals at GFAS.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly on Monday signed a bill pushed by Republicans to overturn three communities’ policies that could help immigrants stay in the state illegally. The bill was filed after Wyandotte County passed a “sanctuary” ordinance in February that would provide local identification cards for immigrants and other residents and would prevent local law enforcement from helping the federal government enforce immigration laws unless public safety is threatened. Lawrence and Roeland Park have similar ordinances. The Democratic governor said in a statement announcing that she would sign the bill that immigration policy is a federal responsibility and can’t be resolved at the local level. “Both Republicans and Democrats in Washington have failed to address immigration issues for decades,” Kelly said. “We need a national solution, and we need it now.” The Kansas House and Senate passed the bill in recent weeks, and supporters had the two-thirds majorities necessary in both chambers to override a Kelly veto. The bill nullifies the three existing ordinances and bans future ones that restrict cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The bill also says a local ID isn’t valid for voting.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A bill allowing lawyers to carry concealed weapons anywhere in the state, including courtrooms, drew a veto Monday from Gov. Andy Beshear, who said it could spark dangerous situations. The Democratic governor said he was contacted by judges, prosecutors and the state Fraternal Order of Police requesting that he veto the measure. The proposal was attached as an amendment to an unrelated bill by the Senate before it cleared the Republican-led Legislature in the final hectic days before lawmakers took their “veto period’” break to allow Beshear to review stacks of passed bills. The gun-carrying allowance would apply to lawyers arguing cases as well as attorneys personally involved in cases, including domestic disputes or divorces, Beshear’s veto message said. The bill is one of a raft of measures vetoed recently by the governor. Lawmakers will be able to take up veto override efforts when they reconvene Wednesday for the final two days of this year’s session. The governor said he supports Second Amendment rights to bear arms, but his veto message raised potentially dangerous scenarios in courtrooms if the measure becomes law. “Courtrooms are venues of often volatile disputes that can be filled with emotion and tension,” wrote Beshear, a former state attorney general.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The group Red Hot Chili Peppers has been added to the lineup of the 2022 New Orleans Jazz Fest. The rock band’s appearance is set for Sunday, May 1, and will be its first at the event since 2016. The group has sold 80 million albums, collected six Grammy Awards and been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Their 12th studio album, “Unlimited Love,” was released April 1. Last month, the festival announced plans to find a replacement for the Foo Fighters, which canceled all upcoming concert dates after the death of the band’s drummer, Taylor Hawkins. Their scheduled time slot has now been filled by the Chili Peppers. The 2022 festival will run April 29-May 1 and May 5-8 at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans. The Who, Stevie Nicks, Lionel Richie, Luke Combs, Willie Nelson, Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue, Charlie Wilson and Erykah Badu are among the headliners for this year’s festival. Started in 1970, Jazz Fest annually celebrates the unique culture and heritage of New Orleans and Louisiana, alongside performances by nationally and internationally renowned guest artists. It is returning after a two-year hiatus brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The lawyer for the former mayor made the case in court Tuesday that his client was served an eviction notice in retaliation for organizing on behalf of tenants. Ethan Strimling, the mayor of Portland from 2015 to 2019, appeared in court after he was served with the eviction notice last year and refused to leave. Strimling’s case has gone to court because his landlord, Geoffrey Rice, started legal proceedings to make him leave. Strimling’s attorney, Scott Dolan, said during opening statements in the case that the eviction was “a clear case of retaliation” for organizing the tenants’ union, the Bangor Daily News reports. Rice’s attorney, David Chamberlain, said during his own opening statement that the eviction was about economics. Rice offered an example that Strimling violated a section of his lease by leaving his window open in April. That presented a potential cost for Rice, who paid the heating bill. Portland voters passed a rent control ordinance in November 2020. That ordinance encouraged residents to organize.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A former police detective was found guilty of several federal crimes Monday, including providing a gun that he knew would be planted on a suspect. A federal jury convicted Robert Hankard of corruption and conspiracy charges, including allegations that he conspired with others to plant a BB gun on a suspect whom another officer had run over and later lied about it to a grand jury, news outlets reports. Hankard was also convicted of falsifying an application for a search warrant and an arrest report in another incident where drugs were planted on a suspect and of falsely testifying to a federal grand jury. The prosecution was part of the fallout from the rogue Gun Trace Task Force, which was supposed to take illegal guns off the streets, but instead members robbed drug dealers, planted drugs and guns on innocent people, and assaulted seemingly random civilians. Hankard didn’t testify and remains out of custody until his sentencing hearing, which has yet to be scheduled.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A bill passed by the state Senate aims to assist members of communities disproportionately harmed by the enforcement of past marijuana laws in participating in the growing cannabis market. The legislation would create a new fund that supporters say will increase equity in the cannabis industry in part by addressing the lack of access to capital that has kept many would-be entrepreneurs from taking part in the new industry. Opening an average cannabis retail shop can require more than $1 million, backers of the legislation said, with the numbers even higher for manufacturing facilities – as much as $5 million. Another hurdle is federal cannabis law preventing businesses from accessing traditional bank loans, leaving many entrepreneurs vulnerable to predatory financial deals and damaging equity partnerships. The bill would create a social equity fund to facilitate new access to capital by making grants and loans, including forgivable and no-interest loans. The fund would receive 10% of annual revenue collected from the marijuana excise tax, an estimated $18 million for the 2023 fiscal year. If approved, the state would join a handful of other states in pioneering the program. The bill now heads to the Massachusetts House.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: PFAS compounds, the emerging contaminant “forever chemicals” raising public health and environmental alarms, are found in greater quantities in the treated water leaving the state’s wastewater treatment plants – the water returning to streams, rivers and lakes – than in the not-yet-treated water entering the plant, a new Western Michigan University study found. The study highlights the complex cycling of PFAS, which have been tied to cancer and other health problems, through the environment and through human attempts to address it. When PFAS are removed from a contaminated site – either physically excavated or through charcoal filtration – the removed contaminants typically end up in a landfill. When that landfill leaches liquids, they are typically captured and either piped or trucked to a wastewater treatment facility. But such facilities aren’t required to treat for PFAS. The increase in PFAS detection in wastewater treatment plant’s outflow doesn’t mean the plants are introducing more chemicals. Rather, it appears that PFAS chemicals that scientists cannot readily detect in the wastewater entering plants are being transformed into detectable PFAS compounds during the treatment process, said Matt Reeves, lead author of the study, hydrogeologist and associate professor at Western Michigan, who specializes in the fate and transport of contaminants in the environment.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Prosecutors revealed in a hearing Monday evening that they offered plea deals to three former police officers charged with aiding and abetting the murder of George Floyd, but the defendants rejected them. Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill held the hearing mostly to consider whether he has the authority to allow live video coverage of the upcoming trial set to begin in June for former Officers Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng. They’re charged with aiding and abetting both manslaughter and murder when former Officer Derek Chauvin used his knee to pin Floyd, a Black man, to the pavement for 91/ 2 minutes on May 25, 2020. Kueng knelt on Floyd’s back, Lane held his legs, and Thao kept bystanders back. Lead prosecutor Matthew Frank did not disclose details of the plea offers in open court but said they were identical and were made March 22 after a jury convicted the three in a separate trial in February on federal civil rights charges stemming from Floyd’s death, according to pool reports from inside the courtroom. Lane’s attorney, Earl Gray, said it was hard for the defense to negotiate when the three still don’t know what their federal sentences will be. The judge in that case has not set a sentencing date, and all three remain free on bail.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A death row inmate has told a judge under oath that he wants to continue appealing his case, months after saying he wanted to give up his appeals and request an execution date. George County Circuit Court Judge Kathy King Jackson issued an order Monday noting the current wishes of the inmate, Blayde Nathaniel Grayson, who appeared before Jackson on Thursday and said he wants to continue his appeal in federal court. Grayson, 46, was convicted of capital murder in 1997 for the stabbing death the previous year of 78-year-old Minnie Smith during a home burglary in south Mississippi’s George County. He said in a handwritten letter to the state Supreme Court in early December: “I ask to see that my execution should be carried out forthwith.” Grayson also said then that he wanted to end all of his appeals. Grayson’s attorney, David Voisin, submitted a letter days later asking justices to disregard Grayson’s request because Grayson still had an appeal pending in federal court. On Jan. 28, the state Supreme Court ordered that Grayson be put under oath before a circuit judge to say whether he wished to go forward with his request for the state to schedule his lethal injection. That hearing happened Thursday.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner has reached an agreement with the Missouri Office of Disciplinary Counsel in which she acknowledges mistakes in her handling of the prosecution of former Gov. Eric Greitens but won’t face severe penalties for those mistakes. The “joint stipulation” agreement was announced Monday at the outset of a disciplinary hearing before a three-person panel. In the agreement, Gardner concedes she failed to produce documents and mistakenly maintained that all documents had been provided to Greitens’ lawyers in the 2018 criminal case. The agreement says Gardner’s conduct “was negligent or perhaps reckless, but not intentional.” It calls for a written reprimand. A more severe punishment – suspension or disbarment – would likely cost Gardner her job because state law requires elected prosecutors to hold active law licenses. The panel would still need to sign off on the agreement and make a recommendation within 30 days to the Missouri Supreme Court, which ultimately decides punishment. It’s unclear when the court might make a final decision. Gardner is St. Louis’ first Black female circuit attorney and one of several progressive prosecutors elected in recent years with a focus on creating more fairness in the criminal justice system. She told the panel Monday that the mistakes were due to the fast-moving nature of the Greitens case.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: State environmental officials unlawfully approved a large copper mine in central Montana despite worries that mining waste would pollute a river that’s popular among boaters, a state judge ruled. Officials with the Montana Department of Environmental Quality failed to conduct an adequate review of the proposed Black Butte mine north of White Sulphur Springs, Judge Katherine Bidegaray said in Friday’s ruling. Work began last year on the mine along a tributary of the Smith River, a waterway so popular among boaters that the state holds an annual lottery to decide who can float down it. The underground mine sponsored by Vancouver-based Sandfire Resources is on private land and would extract 15.3 million tons of copper-laden rock and waste over 15 years – roughly 440 tons a day. Environmentalists had sued over potential pollution from the mine and asked Bidegaray to reconsider its permit. Her ruling leaves that permit in place for now. She asked the two sides in the case to submit legal briefs within 45 days to address what should happen next. State officials said the mine permit includes requirements that will protect the Smith River. They plan to appeal the ruling, Department of Environmental Quality Director Chris Dorrington said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A bill that would have allowed people in a majority of U.S. states to carry concealed handguns without a permit died Monday when Nebraska lawmakers derailed the proposal after hearing concerns from law enforcement officials. The bill would have made Nebraska the 26th state to adopt so-called constitutional carry legislation. Supporters in Nebraska fell two votes short of the 33-vote supermajority needed to overcome a filibuster led by opponents, which prevents lawmakers from advancing it this year. Permitless concealed carry is already allowed in 25 conservative-leaning states. The Nebraska bill won initial approval last month but stalled Monday on the second of three required votes in the waning days of the legislative session. “To say I’m frustrated is an understatement,” said Sen. Tom Brewer, the bill’s sponsor and a leading gun rights advocate in the Legislature. Nebraska already allows gun owners to carry firearms in public view, as long as they aren’t in a place where it’s prohibited and don’t have a criminal record that bars them from possessing one. To legally conceal the gun, they’re required to submit to a Nebraska State Patrol background check, get fingerprinted and take a gun safety course at their own expense.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: More Nevadans today are pessimistic about financial security and rising inflation than in recent years, a new poll of likely voters found, suggesting a negative shift in public opinion on the Silver State’s economy. The poll conducted last week by Suffolk University for the Reno Gazette Journal shows that Nevadans’ outlook on the economy mirrors how they feel about their elected officials both at the state level and in the White House. Just over 40% said their standard of living is worse now than it was four years ago – before Gov. Steve Sisolak and President Joe Biden assumed their respective offices and replaced Republican incumbents. About half said Nevada is headed down the wrong track. Suffolk surveyed 500 voters across the state, all of whom indicated they will likely vote in the midterm elections later this year. About 43% said their annual household income is less than $75,000, with 13% making less than $20,000 annually. Nevada’s median household income in 2020 was about $62,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. More than half of respondents said they disapprove of the job Biden is doing as president, and 47% said they want their vote in November “to change the direction” Biden is leading the nation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A commission to address domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking will meet again following a ten-year absence, according to an executive order signed Monday by Gov. Chris Sununu. A state task force that examined how the judiciary handles domestic violence cases recommended that the commission be brought back. The original commission was created by Gov. Stephen Merrill and was active from 1993 to 2013. Sununu’s executive order said the state “remains committed to fostering a multidisciplinary approach to both better address the needs of victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, and promote a consistent response to hold offenders accountable for their actions.” It said that combatting and preventing domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking “remains a priority” for Sununu’s administration, and a commitment to reconvene the commission “is an additional measure to ensure victims remain safe and offenders are held accountable.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNorth Haledon: Hundreds of people are signing petitions to keep a 25-foot star shining at High Mountain Park Preserve as the mayor continues to defy an order to take down the solar-powered decoration. Mayor Randy George said Monday that he is prepared to reinforce the public relations onslaught at a special meeting next month at Eastern Christian High School. The agenda, he said, will be to organize more support against The Nature Conservancy, the Virginia-based nonprofit that asked for the star to be permanently removed. “I’m doing everything I can to harass them,” the mayor said. Meanwhile, the borough has backing from an influential source. The township of Wayne is helping the cause, and its mayor said he “does not object” to the star on the mountain. Wayne owns most of the 1,260-acre park, but according to the conservancy, it does not own any portion of the preserve where the star is placed. That part was given directly to the nonprofit by North Haledon in October 2000. Barbara Brummer, the conservancy’s director for New Jersey, wrote in a letter to George that the star is a safety hazard because hikers are climbing on it and visiting the mountain after dark to see it lit up. “Another very important consideration,” she wrote, “is that the star and its accompanying equipment have a negative ecological impact.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Election regulators are resisting efforts by a conservative-backed foundation to post statewide voter registration information on a public website where it can be searched by names or addresses to view whether people voted in past elections and sometimes their party affiliations. The website does not list details of how people voted regarding candidates or initiatives. The Voter Reference Foundation, created by Republican former U.S. Senate candidate Doug Truax of Illinois, announced in December that it would add registered New Mexico voters to its website database VoteRef.com that was established in the wake of the 2020 election and now includes voter rolls from at least 20 states. That move has prompted calls for a state investigation into possible misuse of election records and a preemptive lawsuit by Voter Reference Foundation to ensure its plans to publish the details about New Mexico voters. The foundation has said its goal is to usher in a “new era of American election transparency.” But New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver said in an interview Monday that the foundation’s efforts violate state law that restricts the use of voter registration data to political campaigning or noncommercial government purposes.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The 4-foot bronze Fearless Girl statue that was deposited in front of Lower Manhattan’s Charging Bull in 2017 will remain in its current spot opposite the New York Stock Exchange at least until early next year while city officials wrestle with a permanent disposition for the popular symbol of female empowerment, a city board decided Monday. Members of the Public Design Commission granted an 11-month permit extension and said they would spend the next six months exploring a way for New York City to take ownership of the statue, which is currently the subject of litigation between artist Kristen Visbal and State Street Global Advisors, the Boston-based asset-management firm that commissioned it. “We today, the Public Design Commission, cannot make this a permanent piece of art,” commission president Signe Nielsen said. “We can urge that steps be taken to enable this work to be considered for the public collection.” The statue of a spunky young girl was supposed to be a temporary installation when State Street commissioned it in 2017 to urge higher representation of women on corporate boards, but permits to keep it on display were extended several times once it became a major tourist attraction. Fearless Girl was moved to its current location in December 2018 and has continued to draw selfie-taking visitors. Visbal, meanwhile, began selling replicas of the statue around the world. State Street, which had an ownership contract with the artist, sued Visbal, alleging the replica sales violated the agreement, and Visbal countersued, arguing that the company was infringing on her rights. She has urged the city to take ownership of the piece itself.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: City officials have settled a federal discrimination lawsuit with a former firefighter who said she had endured a hostile work environment in which the fire chief and others inflicted emotional distress. John Hunter, the attorney representing former Asheville firefighter Joy Ponder, confirmed Tuesday that his client will get $155,000 in compensatory damages. She also voluntarily dismissed her claim in U.S. District Court, Hunter said. He said it was unusual for a gender discrimination case to survive summary judgment. “The city didn’t come forward with settlement offers until that happened,” he said. A federal judge ruled in March that the discrimination lawsuit filed by Ponder, one of the highest-ranking women in a North Carolina fire department, could proceed based on a claim of “disparate treatment.” Attorneys for the city of Asheville and Fire Chief Scott Burnette had asked U.S. District Court Judge Martin Reidinger for a pretrial summary judgment throwing out all claims by Ponder. Reidinger dismissed claims against Burnette, writing in his order that he could not be held responsible under the 1964 Civil Rights Act’s Title VII against employment discrimination because the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals said “supervisors are not liable in their individual capacities for Title VII violations.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A group that wants to legalize recreational marijuana in the state submitted paperwork Monday to begin the approval process. If it’s approved by North Dakota’s secretary of state, the group would need to gather 15,582 signatures by July 11 to get the measure on the ballot for the general election in November. The proposed measure would allow any person over the age of 21 to use limited amounts of marijuana and purchase products from registered establishments in North Dakota. The measure would put policies in place to regulate retail stores, cultivators, and other types of marijuana businesses. A similar effort failed in 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic hampered the group’s signature-gathering. Cannabis was a major topic in the Republican-controlled Legislature last year. State representatives brought bills to legalize and tax the drug, but the Senate killed the bills that were passed by the House.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: From X-ray body scanners to anti-drone technology, the state is ramping up efforts to keep contraband out of prisons as drugs and other illicit goods flood inside – even when visitation was curbed during the pandemic. The anti-contraband measures are aimed at anyone who enters prisons, whether inmates returning from an outside assignment, visitors or staff members, said Annette Chambers-Smith, director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. “Every time we solve one thing, we have to build a better mousetrap for the next thing,” Chambers-Smith told the Associated Press. The scope of the problem was underscored last month when federal authorities announced the arrest of a South African woman on suspicion of helping to smuggle hundreds of sheets of drug-soaked paper into at least five Ohio prisons. The woman is accused of soaking papers in legal correspondence, which is exempt from normal inspection routines. The state said it conducted about 1,000 drug seizures a month in state prisons from March through September 2020. Numbers slowly decreased through 2021 and now average just under 500 a month, according to state data.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill into law Tuesday that makes it a felony to perform an abortion, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The bill, which takes effect 90 days after the Legislature adjourns next month, makes an exception only for an abortion performed to save the life of the mother. Abortion rights advocates say the bill signed by the GOP governor is certain to face a legal challenge. “We want to outlaw abortion in the state of Oklahoma,” Stitt said during a signing ceremony for the bill, flanked by anti-abortion lawmakers, clergy and students. “I promised Oklahomans that I would sign every pro-life bill that hits my desk, and that’s what we’re doing here today.” Under the bill, anyone convicted of performing an abortion would face up to 10 years in prison and a $100,000 fine. The measure does not authorize criminal charges against a woman for receiving an abortion. Sen. Nathan Dahm, a Broken Arrow Republican now running for Congress who wrote the bill, called it the “strongest pro-life legislation in the country right now, which effectively eliminates abortion in Oklahoma.” There is no enforcement mechanism for women who order abortion medication online from out-of-state suppliers. Oklahoma lawmakers passed a bill last year to prevent such online purchases, but that measure was blocked by the state Supreme Court.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A recently released report shows an ice storm in 2021 decimated hundreds of acres of trees in the city. The report from Salem Public Works Department says a citywide analysis found a 17.6% tree canopy loss from August 2020 to May 2021. City staff said about 10 acres of tree canopy was lost to development, but the bulk of the loss – more than 1,000 acres – was because of the Feb. 15, 2021, ice storm. The report to the city says thousands of trees fell, and branches buckled under the weight of ice during the storm. Historic and heritage trees, some hundreds of years old, were downed. “Large Oregon white oaks were particularly hard hit by the ice storm as their large diameter branches accumulated heavy loads of ice, resulting in massive limb breakage and whole trees keeling over,” city staff said in the report. Initial reviews found about 10,000 trees were damaged, and 1,000 trees were removed from city property following the storm. The city spent more than $6.3 million on ice storm-related cleanup. New tree growth and new planting projects have helped offset that loss, the city said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Ex-President Donald Trump slammed GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill McSwain on Tuesday, complaining the former federal prosecutor did “absolutely nothing” to investigate Trump’s false claims of widespread election fraud after Democrat Joe Biden won the state in 2020. McSwain, who spent nearly three years as the top federal prosecutor in Philadelphia under Trump, had been seeking his endorsement, calling the presidential election in Pennsylvania a “partisan disgrace” as he sought to curry favor with the former president. McSwain has often touted his connection to Trump while campaigning for the GOP nod in a crowded primary field. Instead, Trump turned on him. “One person in Pennsylvania who I will not be endorsing is Bill McSwain for Governor. He was the U.S. Attorney who did absolutely nothing on the massive Election Fraud that took place in Philadelphia and throughout the commonwealth,” Trump said in a statement. “Do not vote for Bill McSwain, a coward, who let our Country down. He knew what was happening and let it go.” Trump’s false claims of a stolen election have been debunked by the courts, his own Justice Department and numerous recounts, and no prosecutor, judge or election official in Pennsylvania has raised a concern about widespread fraud.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: After years of neglect, the most recognizable feature on the city’s skyline, the Superman Building, will be rescued. Gov. Dan McKee announced Tuesday that the building’s owner is planning to turn the vacant landmark into an apartment building with offices and shops, with help from state and city funding. Officially known as the Industrial Trust Building, at roughly 430 feet high, it is the tallest building in Rhode Island. It has been vacant for nearly a decade. McKee said the $220 million redevelopment project will reinvigorate downtown Providence and bring the Superman Building “back to life.” Opened in 1928, it resembles the Daily Planet headquarters in the old “Adventures of Superman” TV show. McKee said $26 million will come from state housing and economic development programs, and $15 million will come from the city through a loan and a direct contribution. Massachusetts-based High Rock Development committed to providing more than $42 million and will take advantage of federal tax credits and seek a tax stabilization agreement from the city, McKee said. High Rock Development bought the building in 2008. In 2013, the sole tenant, Bank of America, moved out. The value of the building dropped, and it fell into disrepair.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: A unique gold medal celebrating a battle victory that helped turn the tide in the American Revolution brought a world-record $960,000 at auction. An anonymous buyer of the Daniel Morgan at Cowpens Medal won with a bid of $800,000 on April 4. With the 20% buyer’s premium, the final price was $960,000, according to Stack’s Bowers Galleries in Costa Mesa, California. The medal honors Revolutionary War Gen. Daniel Morgan and his victory at the 1781 Battle of Cowpens in South Carolina. It was struck in 1839 at the Philadelphia Mint. “Everyone’s pretty excited,” said numismatist John Kraljevich of Fort Mill, who specializes in rare, early medals and authenticated the anonymously consigned medal. The front of the medal depicts Morgan leading an infantry charge on horseback against a retreating British cavalry. The back features a Native American woman placing a crown of laurels on Morgan’s head. The original medal was struck in Paris in 1789 and given to Morgan in 1790. After his death in 1802, grandson and heir Morgan Neville owned the medal and stored it in a bank vault in Pittsburgh. It was stolen in 1818 during a robbery. In 1836, Congress authorized the strike of a single replacement, and it remained in the family until about 1885. At one point the medal was acquired by famed financier banker J.P. Morgan, who incorrectly believed he was related to Daniel Morgan, Kraljevich said. The medal then disappeared from view and was thought to have been lost or melted. Only in recent months did it reappear when consigned anonymously to the auction house.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state House on Tuesday impeached Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg over a 2020 car crash in which he killed a pedestrian but initially said he might have struck a deer or another large animal. Ravnsborg, a Republican, is the first official to be impeached in South Dakota history. He will at least temporarily be removed from office pending the historic Senate trial, where it takes a two-thirds majority to convict on impeachment charges. Ravnsborg pleaded no contest last year to a pair of traffic misdemeanors in the crash, including making an illegal lane change. He has cast Joseph Boever’s death as a tragic accident. In voting 36-31 to impeach Ranvsborg, the Republican-controlled House charged him with committing crimes that caused someone’s death, making “numerous misrepresentations” to law enforcement officers after the crash and using his office to navigate the criminal investigation. “When we’re dealing with the life of one of your citizens, I think that weighed heavily on everyone,” said GOP Rep. Will Mortenson, who introduced the articles of impeachment. A spokesman for Ravnsborg did not reply to a request for comment after the vote. Tim Bormann, the attorney general’s chief of staff, said his staff would “professionally dedicate ourselves” to their work while Ranvsborg is forced to take a leave.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee will soon decide whether to sign off on adding harsh penalties against public schools in his state that allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports. The GOP-controlled Legislature finished advancing the proposal Monday, with Senate Republicans approving the measure 26-5. The House had previously approved the bill last month. Lee, a Republican, hasn’t said publicly whether he supports the legislation. However, he signed a measure last year mandating that student-athletes must prove their sex matches that listed on the student’s “original” birth certificate. If a birth certificate is unavailable, then the parents must provide another form of evidence “indicating the student’s sex at the time of birth.” This year, lawmakers decided to add penalties to that ban, which is in effect even as a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality makes it way through court. A trial has been tentatively set for March 2023. “What this bill does is put teeth in that legislation,” said Republican state Sen. Joey Hensley. Under the legislation headed to Lee’s desk, Tennessee’s Department of Education would withhold a portion of a state funds from local school districts that fail to determine a student’s gender for participation in middle or high school sports.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Many of the state’s cattle ranchers are culling herds because of rising costs for feed and fuel, along with the looming prospect that ongoing drought conditions could worsen this summer. Consolidation of the meatpacking industry in recent years also has reduced the market power of ranchers, who sit at the very beginning of a lengthy line of processors, packers, wholesalers and retailers in bringing beef to consumers.“I tell (people) the packers are making all the money,” said Shelby Horn, general manager of Abell Livestock. Cattle prices have been climbing along with increased consumer demand for beef as the broad economy continues recovering from its pandemic-induced downturn. But they haven’t yet risen enough to offset the multiple headwinds facing many ranchers, Horn and other experts say. Texas is by far the largest producer of beef cattle in the country, with a herd that totals about 4.5 million animals – 2.3 million more than Oklahoma, the second-largest producer, according to figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Sales of beef cattle and calves in Texas generate about $8.5 billion annually and constitute the state’s top agricultural commodity. But the Texas herd shrunk 3.5% last year – or by about 160,000 head – outpacing a 2.3% decline in the U.S. beef cattle herd overall.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The state’s increasingly popular national parks will offer free entrance Saturday to kick off National Park Week. The nationwide celebration, lasting through April 24, aims to “boost awareness of the value and availability of recreational areas, encouraging people across the country to spend time in America’s treasured national parks,” according to a U.S. Senate press release. In celebration, entrance into all national parks will be free April 16. That includes Zion, Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands and Capitol Reef.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The number of opioid-related overdose deaths in the state increased by 33% in 2021 to a record number of 210 fatalities, the Vermont Health Department reported. The report released last week found that fentanyl was involved in 93% of last year’s opioid deaths, while the percentage of deaths that involved heroin dropped from 25% in 2020 to 10% last year. Cocaine was involved in 48% of all opioid-related overdose deaths, according to the report. The study also found that use of methamphetamine and the drug xylazine, a veterinary sedative, were increasingly contributing to opioid-related fatal overdoses among Vermont residents. The 2021 figure of 210 was up from 158 in 2020. The report lists opioid fatalities going back to 2010, when there were 37. Chittenden County had the highest number of opioid-related overdose deaths last year at 38, while Rutland County had the highest rate of opioid deaths per 100,000 residents at 48, according to the report.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Glenn Youngkin has proposed substantial changes to a hemp bill aimed at reining in the retail sales of products containing a psychoactive form of THC, including amendments that would create new misdemeanor penalties for marijuana possession. The bill is among more than 100 pieces of legislation the Republican governor is seeking to amend, his office announced late Monday, just ahead of a deadline Youngkin faced to take action on bills sent to his desk. Lawmakers will meet April 27 to consider the governor’s proposed amendments and will also have the chance to override his vetoes. The hemp measure rewrote the definition of marijuana in state code in a way industry players said would have severely curtailed the sale of CBD products that don’t produce a high, in addition to ending the retail sales of delta-8, a chemical cousin of pot’s main intoxicating ingredient, sales of which have proliferated around the country. Youngkin’s amendments would also create a Class 2 misdemeanor offense for possession of more than 2 and less than 6 ounces of marijuana and a Class 1 misdemeanor for possession of more than 6 ounces and less than 1 pound. A 2021 law passed when Democrats were in full control of state government laid out a years­long pathway toward retail sales and legalized the possession of up to an ounce of marijuana. Anyone possessing an amount between an ounce and a pound is currently subject to a small civil fine.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A new law could reshape the way child dependency cases are handled in the state, potentially leading to more children staying with family members without those relatives being required to adopt them. Under the current practice, Washington state forces relatives to adopt children when neither parent can take care of the child. If family members don’t wish to adopt, the Department of Children, Youth and Families removes children from those placements, even if those relatives still want permanent kinship guardianship, and places the child up for adoption. “We’re removing children out of relatives’ homes, loving relatives’ homes, because they’re unwilling to adopt,” said Shrounda Selivanoff, director of public policy for the Children’s Home Society of Washington and a proponent and writer of the legislation. Children’s Home Society said the state currently “prioritizes termination” of parental rights instead of using other options, the News Tribune reports. Termination of parental rights is not required when a dependency case ends, they said. Under the new law, the state won’t be allowed to move children from their relatives’ care if those relatives don’t want to adopt. Financial assistance also has been expanded for relatives who are eligible.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Free tire collection events are scheduled around the state this month. The events are 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. April 23 behind the Go-Mart in the Cabin Creek community in Kanawha County, 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. April 23 at Clay County High School, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. April 23 at the Old Oak Ridge Trucking Lot in Elkins and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. April 30 at the HL Wilson Trucking Lot in Moorefield, the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection said. Each person may dispose of up to 10 tires. The tires must be off the rims. Only car and light truck tires are accepted, the agency said. Ongoing tire collections are held regularly in Boone, Brooke, Calhoun, Fayette, Hancock, Mason, Mercer, Monroe, Pocahontas, Putnam, Tucker, Wayne and Wyoming counties. Upcoming tire collection events are listed on the department’s website.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: New data shows a sharp increase in Type 2 diabetes among children in the state, and doctors think COVID-19 could be a factor. Figures from UW Health Kids shows a nearly 200% increase in the number of cases over the past several years. Dr. Elizabeth Mann, a pediatric endocrinologist and director of the Type 2 Diabetes Program at UW Health Kids, said it’s a trend medical experts have noticed for years, but it’s taken a worrisome turn recently. “Since the beginning of the pandemic, we’ve just seen a sharp increase beyond what we had expected,” Mann said. In 2018, 5.8% of pediatric patients with new onset diabetes at Madison’s American Family Children’s Hospital had Type 2, a disease that primarily affects adults. In 2021, that number grew to 16.4%. And so far in 2022, 1 in 6 pediatric patients at the children’s hospital with new onset diabetes has Type 2, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. “In kids, this Type 2 diabetes just acts a little bit more aggressively,” Mann said. “So it’s not only that we’re seeing Type 2 diabetes at younger ages, but it also seems to be a more severe form where kids are needing more medications and have more significant complications from it.” In Type 2 diabetes, the most prevalent form overall, the pancreas produces insulin, but the body has developed a resistance to it. Mann said it’s a common misconception that Type 2 diabetes is purely a result of diet and activity levels.

SpaceX had been waiting for the past several days for weather to improve off the Florida coast, where the crew will splash down on the sixth day of the mission.\n\nSpaceX also had delayed the launch for preflight checks and again when a helium leak was detected on a piece a equipment designed to detach from the rocket during takeoff.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration then briefly grounded the company's Falcon 9 after an uncrewed landing mishap. Fortunately for SpaceX – and the Polaris Dawn crew – federal regulators cleared the rocket to resume launches within a couple of days.\n\nPolaris Dawn crew to pass through Van Allen radiation belts\n\nIn the predawn hours, spectators gathered along the Florida coast to watch the daring mission lift off from launch Complex 39A.\n\nAfter soaring skyward along a northeasterly trajectory, the rocket's first-stage booster detached from the spacecraft within 10 minutes of launching, guided itself back to Earth and landed as planned aboard a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. By 5:40 a.m., the Dragon spacecraft broke away from the Falcon 9's upper stage and began using its own thrusters to power on, SpaceX said on the social media site X.\n\nDuring the crew's first day in orbit, they will reach altitudes higher than any human has traveled since NASA’s Apollo lunar program came to an end in the 1970s. Climbing to a height of 870 miles – or more than three times higher than the International Space Station – will take the crew through the treacherous inner regions of Earth's Van Allen radiation belts.\n\nThe Van Allen belts pose one of the largest hazards to spacefarers venturing deep into the cosmos. For future expeditions to the moon and Mars, astronauts will have to be able to safely traverse them.\n\nWhen the Polaris Dawn crew travels through the radiation belts, their SpaceX craft’s nose will be oriented to minimize astronauts’ exposure to harmful radiation.\n\nThe crew will spend five days in orbit testing space technology on behalf of SpaceX that could prove crucial as NASA and other space agencies set their sights on destinations like Mars. On the sixth day of the mission, the SpaceX vehicle will reenter Earth's atmosphere and splash down at one of seven sites off Florida.\n\nWho are the crew of Polaris Dawn?\n\nIsaacman, himself an experienced aviator, is the only member of the Polaris Dawn crew to have flown to space before.\n\nThe billionaire founder of internet company Shift4 Payments is mission commander for the rest of the crew: pilot Scott “Kidd” Poteet and mission specialists Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon, who is also the medical officer. Poteet, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who flew with the Thunderbirds, was mission director for Inspiration4, the world’s first all-civilian mission to space that introduced commercial space tourism to the world.\n\nGillis and Menon, both lead space operations engineers at SpaceX, have now become the first employees at the company to become part of a human spaceflight crew, according to SpaceX. Gillis also trained the Inspiration4 astronauts.\n\nWhile in orbit, Menon, of Houston, plans to read a children's book she co-wrote, \"Kisses from Space\" – inspired by her experience preparing for the Polaris Dawn mission – to her two children.\n\nA risky spacewalk and testing SpaceX tech\n\nThe crew will complete about 40 experiments, many of which aim to understand the human body's reaction to long spaceflights. They'll also test a new laser-based satellite communication system using Starlink.\n\nBut without a doubt, the highlight of the mission will be the spacewalk as the astronauts seek to become the first private citizens to carry out the daring maneuver.\n\nThe maneuver, expected on the third day of the mission, will require only Isaacman and Gillis to exit the Dragon. But doing so still exposes Poteet and Menon to considerable risk as well.\n\nUntil now, spacewalks have been done only by government astronauts. What's more, the maneuvers most often take place in craft with airlocks.\n\nBecause the Dragon does not have an airlock, the entire spacecraft will have to be depressurized when the hatch is opened, exposing the entire crew to the vacuum of space. For this reason, all four astronauts will be wearing Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) suits designed by SpaceX to receive oxygen through tethers.\n\n\"There's been a tremendous amount of preparation that’s gone into this by the SpaceX team,\" Menon told USA TODAY in a phone interview from the Kennedy Space Center in late August.\n\nThe purpose of the operation, which should take about two hours, is to test the suit's capabilities for SpaceX.\n\nWhat's next for the Polaris Program?\n\nPolaris Dawn is the first of three human spaceflights under the Polaris Program, all of which are intended to test SpaceX technologies needed to carry humans deep into the cosmos.\n\nThe second mission \"will continue to expand the boundaries of future human spaceflight missions, in-space communications, and scientific research,\" according to the program's website. Additional details, including a launch date, have not yet been announced.\n\nWhen the day comes that the third and final Polaris Program mission launches, it's intended to be the first human spaceflight on the SpaceX Starship rocket. The gargantuan rocket, which has so far been tested only with no crew, will as early as 2026 be used to ferry NASA astronauts to the moon's surface as part of the space agency's Artemis program.\n\nContributing: Brooke Edwards and Rick Neale, Florida Today\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Because Polaris Dawn is not docking with the International Space Station, a favorable weather forecast is crucial not just for the launch, but also for the crew's water landing five days later off the Florida coast.\n\nThe launch had also previously been delayed to provide more time for preflight checks, and also when a helium leak – since fixed – was detected.\n\nFortunately, the mission was not threatened when the Federal Aviation Administration briefly grounded Falcon 9 rockets last week following a landing mishap.\n\nWhat are the Van Allen radiation belts?\n\nThe Van Allen belts pose one of the largest hazards to future spacefarers venturing deep into the cosmos.\n\nAccording to NASA, the belts are two areas of trapped cosmic radiation in the magnetosphere surrounding Earth like \"an enormous donut.\" The outer belt is made up of billions of high-energy particles that originate from the sun, whereas the inner belt results from interactions of cosmic rays with Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nThe International Space Station's orbit keeps the outpost safely below the radiation belts, but future astronauts will have to fly through them to reach the moon and eventually Mars.\n\nWhen the Polaris Dawn crew travels through the radiation belts, their SpaceX craft’s nose will be oriented to minimize the astronauts’ exposure to harmful radiation.\n\n\"In the future, if we are going to have (SpaceX) Starships regularly going to the moon or Mars, we are going to have to fly through the Van Allen belts regularly,\" Isaacman told Florida Today in an email.\n\nWhy is it called the Polaris Program?\n\nThe space program is named after Polaris, a constellation of three stars more commonly known as the North Star – a guiding navigational light throughout human history.\n\nWho is Jared Isaacman, billionaire behind Polaris Dawn?\n\nIsaacman, a billionaire who helped bankroll the Polaris Dawn mission, won't be watching from the ground when it takes off: The experienced aviator and adventurer from Pennsylvania will be aboard the Dragon capsule and will serve as the mission commander.\n\nIsaacman famously dropped out of high school at 16 years old to start his internet company Shift4 Payments and in recent years has become something of an avid spacefarer.\n\nIn 2021, he served as mission commander of Inspiration4, the world’s first all-civilian mission to space that introduced commercial space tourism to the world. The mission, which Isaacman self-funded, saw four civilians head to space for three days in orbit, raising more than $250 million for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\n\nWith more than 7,000 flight hours of aviation experience, Isaacman is also an aviation enthusiast who is qualified to fly military fighter jets.\n\nIsaacman said in his email to Florida Today that he didn't expect to go to space again after the Inspiration4 mission.\n\n\"I was not planning to go back until after visiting Elon at Starbase in October of 2021,\" Isaacman said in an email to the outlet. \"At that point, we discussed possibilities for test and development missions that would help move the needle on SpaceX's bigger vision to make life multi-planetary.\"\n\nMeet the rest of the Polaris Dawn crew\n\nIsaacman will lead a crew that includes a pilot and two mission specialists.\n\nPilot Scott “Kidd” Poteet ,\n\nMission specialist Sarah Gillis, a Colorado native who is a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX, where she is responsible for overseeing the company’s astronaut training program.

Crews prepare for June 1 liftoff", "text": "The Boeing Starliner is set to launch Saturday afternoon from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nThe mission has been delayed nearly a month due to an oxygen leak on the rocket and then a helium leak on part of the spacecraft.\n\nThe two NASA astronauts flying the commercial crew mission are Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams.\n\nThe highly-anticipated first crewed mission of Boeing’s Starliner appears poised to finally take off on Saturday afternoon as the aeronautics company seeks to prove the spacecraft's capabilities to NASA.\n\nA series of technical issues waylaid the launch of the CST-100 Starliner, which was initially fueled up and ready for liftoff on May 6 before the mission was scrubbed. The Starliner's crew, Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, were even aboard the capsule before they had no choice but to exit and head back to their quarters.\n\nWilmore and Williams, both former Navy pilots before they joined NASA, returned to Houston on May 10 to spend extra time with their families as mission engineers worked to fix the issues ailing Starliner.\n\nThe launch was delayed again later in May as a result of a helium leak from the capsule's propulsion system. But at long last, the spacecraft is apparently ready to head to the International Space Station for about a week before the crew returns to Earth.\n\nHere's what to know about the launch and Starliner, which Boeing hopes will soon compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX capsule for NASA missions to low-Earth orbit.\n\nGraphics:Starliner joins Dragon in expanding American space access\n\nWhy were past launches scrubbed, delayed?\n\nThe mission has been delayed nearly a month due first to an oxygen leak on the rocket and then a helium leak on part of the spacecraft.\n\nThe United Launch Alliance, which manufactured the rocket, said in a statement that trouble with a valve in the rocket's upper stage prompted engineers to scrub the initial launch on May 6. Mission programmers initially requested a delay to May 17 to have time to replace a pressure regulation valve on the rocket's liquid oxygen tank, NASA said.\n\nThe team was able to replace the valve and re-pressurize the system, but then engineers encountered another obstacle: a small helium leak in Starliner's service module. The issue required the launch date to be pushed back once again, according to an update from Boeing.\n\nHelium, which is not combustible or toxic, is used in spacecraft thruster systems to allow the thrusters to fire.\n\nCrews investigated and created a workaround to ensure the safe return of astronauts even in the most extreme scenarios, Florida Today reported.\n\nAs of this week, NASA and the space station both decided to continue with the launch without repairing the helium leak.\n\nWhile the fix would require replacing a patch only roughly the size of a button, it would be a complicated process for a leak that impacts only one of 28 thrusters, reported AFP.\n\n\"We can handle this particular leak if that leak rate were to grow even up to 100 times,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, reported AFP. Instead, teams will simply monitor the leak upon launch.\n\nWhat is the Boeing Starliner?\n\nStarliner is intended to be a vehicle that can ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station as NASA pivots to more partnerships with private industry.\n\nAs part of NASA’s commercial crew program, Boeing was awarded $4.8 billion, while its competitor, SpaceX, was awarded $3.1 billion in 2014 to develop their respective spacecraft, Florida Today reported. Under NASA's more ambitious commercial lunar program, it's also paid SpaceX $2.9 billion to develop the first commercial human lander for the agency's Artemis moon missions and eventually trips to Mars.\n\nSpaceX, whose Dragon spacecraft flew its first human mission in 2020, recently saw its Crew-7 return to Earth after nearly 200 days aboard the International Space Station. The eighth crew comprised of three NASA astronauts and one cosmonaut launched on March 3 and docked on March 5 to await the arrival of Boeing's Starliner capsule.\n\nThe Starliner was designed to accommodate no more than seven passengers for missions to low-Earth orbit. For NASA, the capsule is intended to carry four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the space station.\n\nIf the mission is a success, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station, according to the U.S. space agency.\n\nWho are the NASA astronauts crewing the Starliner?\n\nThe two NASA astronauts flying the commercial crew mission are Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams. Both are Navy test pilots who have flown in space twice, according to Florida Today, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\n◾ Williams, 58, is a former Naval test pilot with experience flying over 30 different aircraft. Selected as an astronaut in 1998, she has logged 322 days in space over two missions since her first flight in 2007.\n\n◾ Wilmore, 61, is a retired Navy captain who completed 21 combat missions during Operation Desert Storm before joining NASA in 200. Since then, he has logged 178 days in space after his first trip to orbit in 2009.\n\nOnce the Starliner launches and reaches the International Space Station, the astronauts are scheduled to spend a little more than a week testing the spacecraft and its subsystems before they board the capsule for a return trip to Earth. The craft will then land in the American Southwest using parachutes that will slow it down to 4 mph before inflating large airbags.\n\nHow to watch the Boeing Starliner launch\n\nBoeing and NASA are targeting 12:25 p.m. EDT Saturday for Starliner's launch from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The capsule will fly to space on top of an Atlas V rocket manufactured by the United Launch Alliance.\n\nNASA will provide live coverage beginning at 8:15 a.m. EDT on NASA+, NASA Television, the NASA app, the agency's YouTube page and its website. A postlaunch news conference is also planned.\n\nExpect more coverage when the Starliner is expected to dock at the forward-facing port of the International Space Station's Harmony module at approximately 1:50 p.m. Sunday.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Following the spacecraft's landing at 5:47 a.m. ET, a recovery vessel transported the crew to shore before they were to be flown to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, the space agency said.\n\nTheir return caps a 199-day mission that saw explorers from Russian, Europe, the United States and Japan launch in late August on a Falcon 9 rocket bound for the famed space station. The Crew-7 members spent their stint in low-Earth orbit contributing to a variety of science experiments, some of which were to help prepare NASA for future crewed lunar missions under its Artemis program as it sets the stage for expeditions to Mars.\n\nOne of the crew's members, NASA astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli, was even part of a rare all-female spacewalk.\n\nTotal solar eclipse:With one month to go, here's everything to know about the total solar eclipse on April 8\n\nWho was part of SpaceX Crew-7?\n\nMoghbeli was the sole American who was part of the four-member Crew-7 who launched Aug. 26 from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nAlso part of the crew were Roscosmos cosmonaut Konstantin Borisov, Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen with the European Space Agency, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Satoshi Furukawa.\n\nIt took the crew about 30 hours after lift-off to dock to the International Space Station's Harmony module’s port.\n\nDuring the course of their stay, the four spacefarers traveled more than 84.4 million miles, completing 3,184 orbits around Earth, NASA said. While Mogensen has now logged 209 days in space in two flights and Furukawa has logged 366 days, the mission marked the first spaceflight for Moghbeli and Borisov.\n\nThe Crew-7 flight was part of NASA’s commercial crew program in which the space agency is partnering with private companies like SpaceX to ferry trained astronauts to the space station for scientific missions. The eighth crew comprised of three NASA astronauts and one cosmonaut launched March 3 and docked March 5 just days before their predecessors prepared to depart on Monday.\n\nThe partnership with private industry is meant to free up NASA to focus on building spacecrafts and rockets for deep space missions.\n\n\"This international crew showed that space unites us all,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. \"It’s clear that we can do more – we can learn more – when we work together.\"\n\nWhat did the crew do aboard the International Space Station?\n\nThe crew were able to conduct hundreds of experiments during the science and research mission, including the first study of the human response to different spaceflight durations.\n\nThey also experimented with growing food on the space station, a critical capability needed for future deep-space flights and long-term crewed missions, NASA said.\n\nIn November, Moghbeli conducted a spacewalk with fellow NASA astronaut Loral O’Hara, making for a rare moment when two women exited the station to complete maintenance activities in the void of space. Together, the astronauts replaced one of the 12 trundle bearing assemblies on a solar alpha rotary joint, which allows them to rotate properly and generate electricity to power the orbital complex.\n\nAs NASA eyes future crewed missions to the moon and beyond, Nelson said the experiments will contribute to the knowledge needed to send humans into the cosmos.\n\nIf NASA is able to launch its delayed Artemis II mission to circumnavigate the moon by the projected end of 2025, it would make for the first crewed lunar mission since the space agency's Apollo program came to an end in 1972. Ultimately, the U.S. agency hopes to send astronauts back to the lunar surface itself in 2026 for Artemis III to establish a base of operations ahead of trips to Mars.\n\n\"The science experiments conducted during their time in space will help prepare for NASA’s bold missions at the moon, Mars, and beyond,\" Nelson said, \"all while benefitting humanity here on Earth.”\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Odysseus aced a crucial engine firing test Friday and succeeded in orienting itself in the direction of the moon as it powered ahead.\n\nAfter entering lunar orbit Wednesday, Odysseus remains about 57 miles above the moon's surface, according to Intuitive Machines.\n\nThe spacecraft will attempt a landing near the moon's south polar region, an area long intriguing to scientists due to the suspected presence of water ice thought to be abundant within its craters.\n\nColumbus Sportswear takes over Vegas sphere\n\nIntuitive Machines built the Odysseus spacecraft to carry cargo for NASA and other customers to the lunar surface for its IM-1 mission.\n\nAs the primary customer for the Odysseus mission, NASA paid Intuitive Machines $118 million to take its scientific payloads to the moon as it prepares to send astronauts back to the lunar surface for its since-delayed Artemis program\n\nThe U.S. space agency has a budget of $2.6 billion in contracts available through 2028 to pay private companies to place scientific payloads on private robotic landers like Odysseus bound for the lunar surface. If Intuitive Machines can pull off the mission, it would open the door for NASA to work with more commercial entities on future space endeavors.\n\nBut Intuitive Machines also is serving customers like Columbia Sportswear, which is testing a metallic jacket fabric as a thermal insulator on the lander. Ahead of the landing attempt, Columbia Sportswear took over the exterior of the Las Vegas sphere on Monday to advertise the partnership and their products, according to a press release.\n\n“Columbia is focused on developing and testing new technologies in challenging environments and our ongoing partnership with Intuitive Machines has the potential to drive even more innovation for our brand,\" the company's Brand President Joe Boyle said in a statement.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

SpaceX, which is operating the mission and designed the suits specially for the maneuver, provided live coverage on social media site X.\n\nThe entire operation, which began around 6 a.m., took about two hours.\n\nThe Polaris Dawn crew began preparing for the daring maneuver almost immediately after arriving in orbit for a five-day mission to test SpaceX technology needed for future crewed missions to the moon and Mars.\n\nPolaris Dawn:SpaceX Dragon takes crew to highest orbit in 50 years\n\nBillionaire Jared Isaacman leading mission\n\nBillionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman – the commander of the mission – and SpaceX employee Sarah Gillis both exited the SpaceX Dragon to spend about 12 minutes each to perform suit mobility checks.\n\nWhile mission specialist Anna Menon and pilot Scott “Kidd” Poteet did not exit the spacecraft, they were still exposed to the vacuum of space because the Dragon does not have an airlock. For that reason, the entire cabin was depressurized and all four astronauts were suited up in extravehicular activity (EVA) suits designed by SpaceX to receive oxygen through tethers.\n\nThe hatch was opened within 38 minutes of beginning the operation and Isaacman was the first to emerge from the capsule.\n\n\"Back at home we have a lot of work to do, but from here Earth sure looks like a perfect world,\" Isaacman said as the ground crew on the livestream burst into applause.\n\nGillis followed him shortly after, where she wiggled around in the dark expanse to test the spacesuit before returning to the cabin and closing the hatch.\n\nCrew make 1st private spacewalk\n\nUntil now, spacewalks have only ever been the purview of government spacefarers such as NASA astronauts and Russian cosmonauts. What's more, the maneuvers most often take place in craft with airlocks.\n\nNot only have spacewalks historically not been commercial endeavors, but those who have taken part have done so in spacesuits regulated by a government space agency.\n\nThis time it is all being done by SpaceX. The purpose of the operation was to test the suit's capabilities, which the rocket company developed for this flight.\n\nWhat is Polaris Dawn?\n\nPolaris Dawn is the first of three human spaceflights under the Polaris Program, all of which are intended to test SpaceX technologies needed to carry humans deep into the cosmos.\n\nOn the day of Tuesday's launch, the SpaceX Dragon capsule traveled further into space than any spacecraft has gone in more than 50 years, surpassing the height reached by NASA's Gemini 11 in the 1970s, SpaceX said.\n\nIsaacman, founder of internet company Shift4 Payment, is the only member of the Polaris Dawn crew to have been to outer space before. Menon and Gillis are also now not only the the first SpaceX employees to travel to space, but have traveled higher than any other women in history.\n\nBefore and after the spacewalk, the crew is conducting nearly 40 scientific experiments – many of which aim to understand the human body's reaction to long spaceflights as NASA and other space agencies set their sights on destinations like Mars. They are scheduled to return to Earth Sunday.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Because Polaris Dawn is not docking with the International Space Station, a favorable weather forecast is crucial not just for the launch, but also for the crew's water landing five days later off the Florida coast.\n\nThe launch had also previously been delayed to provide more time for preflight checks, and also when a helium leak – since fixed – was detected.\n\nFortunately, the mission was not threatened when the Federal Aviation Administration briefly grounded Falcon 9 rockets last week following a landing mishap.\n\nWhat are the Van Allen radiation belts?\n\nThe Van Allen belts pose one of the largest hazards to future spacefarers venturing deep into the cosmos.\n\nAccording to NASA, the belts are two areas of trapped cosmic radiation in the magnetosphere surrounding Earth like \"an enormous donut.\" The outer belt is made up of billions of high-energy particles that originate from the sun, whereas the inner belt results from interactions of cosmic rays with Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nThe International Space Station's orbit keeps the outpost safely below the radiation belts, but future astronauts will have to fly through them to reach the moon and eventually Mars.\n\nWhen the Polaris Dawn crew travels through the radiation belts, their SpaceX craft’s nose will be oriented to minimize the astronauts’ exposure to harmful radiation.\n\n\"In the future, if we are going to have (SpaceX) Starships regularly going to the moon or Mars, we are going to have to fly through the Van Allen belts regularly,\" Isaacman told Florida Today in an email.\n\nWhy is it called the Polaris Program?\n\nThe space program is named after Polaris, a constellation of three stars more commonly known as the North Star – a guiding navigational light throughout human history.\n\nWho is Jared Isaacman, billionaire behind Polaris Dawn?\n\nIsaacman, a billionaire who helped bankroll the Polaris Dawn mission, won't be watching from the ground when it takes off: The experienced aviator and adventurer from Pennsylvania will be aboard the Dragon capsule and will serve as the mission commander.\n\nIsaacman famously dropped out of high school at 16 years old to start his internet company Shift4 Payments and in recent years has become something of an avid spacefarer.\n\nIn 2021, he served as mission commander of Inspiration4, the world’s first all-civilian mission to space that introduced commercial space tourism to the world. The mission, which Isaacman self-funded, saw four civilians head to space for three days in orbit, raising more than $250 million for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\n\nWith more than 7,000 flight hours of aviation experience, Isaacman is also an aviation enthusiast who is qualified to fly military fighter jets.\n\nIsaacman said in his email to Florida Today that he didn't expect to go to space again after the Inspiration4 mission.\n\n\"I was not planning to go back until after visiting Elon at Starbase in October of 2021,\" Isaacman said in an email to the outlet. \"At that point, we discussed possibilities for test and development missions that would help move the needle on SpaceX's bigger vision to make life multi-planetary.\"\n\nMeet the rest of the Polaris Dawn crew\n\nIsaacman will lead a crew that includes a pilot and two mission specialists.\n\nPilot Scott “Kidd” Poteet ,\n\nMission specialist Sarah Gillis, a Colorado native who is a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX, where she is responsible for overseeing the company’s astronaut training program.

But now the mission – slated to be the first ever to feature a spacewalk conducted by nongovernment astronauts – won't be happening until Tuesday at the earliest, SpaceX said.\n\nWhen the SpaceX Dragon carrying the crew does liftoff atop a Falcon 9 rocket, the spacecraft will ascend to 870 miles above Earth's surface before descending to a cruising orbit about 435 miles above Earth. On board the craft will be a pilot and two mission specialists under the command of billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman.\n\nIsaacman, who was also behind Inspiration4 – another historic commercial mission in 2021 that marked the first time an all-civilian crew went to space – helped to fund the mission along with SpaceX. Elon Musk's aerospace company also designed spacesuits specially for the Polaris Dawn crew.\n\nThe ambitious spacewalk and the slew of scientific tests Isaacman and his crew intend to make during their five days in orbit could set the stage for future deep space exploration.\n\nPolaris Dawn delayed 24 hours, SpaceX says\n\nNews of the 24-hour delay, which SpaceX announced Wednesday on X, came two days after the Polaris Dawn crew arrived at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida to prepare for the imminent launch.\n\nSpaceX said on X, formerly Twitter, that the delay was needed to give teams time to complete preflight checkouts.\n\nSpaceX is now targeting a 3:38 a.m. liftoff Tuesday though the launch window lasts until 7 a.m. If needed, backup launch times are available at the same times on Wednesday.\n\nDuring the crew's first day in orbit, they will reach altitudes higher than any human has traveled since NASA’s Apollo lunar program came to an end in the 1970s. Climbing to a height of 870 miles above the surface – or more than three times higher than the International Space Station – will take the crew through the treacherous inner regions of Earth's Van Allen radiation belts.\n\nThe Van Allen belts pose one of the largest hazards to future spacefarers venturing deep into the cosmos. But for future expeditions to the moon and Mars to be possible, astronauts will have to be able to safely fly through them.\n\nWhen the Polaris Dawn crew travels through the radiation belts, their SpaceX craft’s nose will be oriented to minimize the astronauts’ exposure to harmful radiation.\n\nThe crew will spend five days in orbit testing space technology on behalf of SpaceX that could prove crucial as NASA and other space agencies set their sights on destinations like Mars. On the sixth day of the mission, the SpaceX vehicle will reenter Earth's atmosphere and splash down at one of seven sites off the Florida coast.\n\nConducting a risky spacewalk\n\nIsaacman, himself an experienced aviator, will serve as mission commander – leading a crew that includes pilot Scott “Kidd” Poteet as well as mission specialists Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon, who is also the medical officer.\n\nMenon, of Houston, plans to read a children's book she co-authored, \"Kisses from Space\" – inspired by her experience preparing for the Polaris Dawn mission – to her two young children while in orbit.\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew will complete some 40 scientific experiments – many of which are to understand the human body's reaction to long spaceflights – and test a new laser-based satellite communication system using Starlink.\n\nThe crew will also attempt to become the first-ever private citizens to conduct a spacewalk.\n\nUntil now, spacewalks have only ever been conducted by government astronauts. And because most spacecraft have airlocks, conducting one does not typically require depressurizing the entire capsule.\n\nBut because the Dragon does not have an airlock, the entire spacecraft will have to be depressurized before the hatch is opened, exposing all four crew members to the vacuum of space. For this reason, all four astronauts will be wearing Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) suits designed by SpaceX to receive oxygen through tethers.\n\nWhat's next for the Polaris Program?\n\nPolaris Dawn is the first of three human spaceflights under the Polaris Program, all of which are intended to test SpaceX technologies needed to carry humans deep into the cosmos.\n\nThe second mission \"will continue to expand the boundaries of future human spaceflight missions, in-space communications, and scientific research,\" according to the program's website. Additional details, including a launch date, have not yet been announced.\n\nWhen the day comes that the third and final Polaris Program mission launches, it's intended to be the first human spaceflight on the SpaceX Starship rocket. The gargantuan rocket, which has so far only undergone uncrewed tests, will one day ferry NASA astronauts from lunar orbit to the moon's surface as part of the space agency's Artemis program.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Now they aren't expected to make the trip back to Earth until at least early July, following two scheduled spacewalks and continued assessments of reported issues on the spacecraft, Boeing announced in a June 21 update.\n\nThe space organizations have not announced a new return date after most recently saying the astronuats might come back Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nHere's what we know.\n\nStarliner's return delayed for spacewalks, review of spacecraft issues\n\nMoving the Starliner's undocking and landing from Wednesday deconflicts with \"a series of planned (ISS) spacewalks while allowing mission teams time to review propulsion system data,\" the aerospace company said in the update.\n\nThe spacewalks were scheduled for Monday and July 2, NASA and Boeing said, meaning the astronauts wouldn't return until after those were complete. The spacewalk that was supposed to happen Monday was canceled following a spacesuit issue. NASA has not yet said how that will impact the planned spacewalk schedule or if it will further delay the astronauts' return.\n\nUSA TODAY contacted Boeing, who referred questions to be asked to NASA. USA TODAY contacted NASA on Monday morning but has not yet received a response.\n\nThe crew is also reviewing some issues with the Starliner spacecraft.\n\n“We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process,” Steve Stich, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program manager, said in the update. “We are letting the data drive our decision making relative to managing the small helium system leaks and thruster performance we observed during rendezvous and docking.\"\n\nStitch also said an \"agency-level review\" would be necessary due to the duration of the mission. He compared it to what was done ahead of NASA's SpaceX Demo-2 return after it spent two months in orbit.\n\nUS spacewalk 90 canceled\n\nAlthough NASA and Boeing moved the Starliner's return to accommodate the spacewalks, U.S. spacewalk 90 was scrapped Monday morning due to \"a water leak in the service and cooling umbilical unit on NASA astronaut Tracy C. Dyson’s spacesuit,\" according to NASA.\n\nThe water leak was noticed after Dyson and astronaut Mike Barratt set their suits to battery power Monday morning, NASA said.\n\nThe spacewalk was initially scheduled for June 14, but that attempt was delayed due to a \"spacesuit discomfort issue.\"\n\nThe spacewalk is planned to \"remove a faulty electronics box from a communications antenna on the starboard truss of the space station,\" NASA said. The astronauts also would have collected samples for analysis to \"understand the ability of microorganisms to survive and reproduce on the exterior of the orbiting laboratory,\" according to the government agency.\n\nAre the astronauts stuck in space?\n\nWhile Wilmore and Williams' return home continues to be delayed, Boeing said plenty of supplies remain for the astronauts and the station's schedule is \"relatively open through mid-August.\" In case of an emergency on the ISS, the Starliner is cleared to leave orbit and return to Earth, the company added.\n\nBoeing added the crew is \"not pressed for time to leave\" as the astronauts continue to help with station operations as needed and are completing NASA's add-on in-flight objectives.\n\n“The crew’s feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and they know that every bit of learning we do on the Crew Flight Test will improve and sharpen our experience for future crews,” Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing’s Starliner Program, said in the June 21 release.\n\n“Starliner is performing well in orbit while docked to the space station,” Stich said. “We are strategically using the extra time to clear a path for some critical station activities while completing readiness for Butch and Suni’s return on Starliner and gaining valuable insight into the system upgrades we will want to make for post-certification missions.”\n\nBoeing Starliner issues, including helium leaks\n\nHelium leaks and a malfunctioning thruster valve hampered the Starliner's launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida on June 5. These same issues seem to be still affecting the spacecraft weeks later.\n\nThere's been a series of helium leaks in the Starliner's propulsion system, Stich said during a media teleconference on June 18. So far, five leaks have been found since the Starliner has been docked at the ISS, he added.\n\n\"The path going forward is to continue to look at the helium system to try to understand what's happening, again look at simulations for the remainder of the flight… and then the operational techniques to manage the helium system,\" Stich said.\n\nThe defective thruster valve, which is still offline as of June 15, is another problem but Stich said the crew did not plan to use it during the return flight \"out of an abundance of caution.\" The belief is that the valve went offline due to the extreme heat generated while the thruster system was firing \"in rapid succession\" to keep the Starliner on course with the space station, according to Stich.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/24"}]}

Meanwhile, severe weather is set to wreak more havoc in the Southeast, bringing a risk of hail, damaging wind, and tornadoes to the area over the weekend.\n\nOn Friday evening, the National Weather Service issued tornado watches for parts of southern Georgia, southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle and confirmed three tornado touchdowns in the Pittsburgh area.\n\nNWS also issued flash flood warnings Friday night for parts of Texas, Georgia, Alabama, Ohio and Florida. Up to 3.5 inches of rain had already fallen in some areas, the weather service said, and more was on the way.\n\nThe latest round of severe weather comes after Houston woke up to scenes of destruction. Severe storms with winds of up to 100 mph spewed debris across roads and littered the ground downtown with broken glass.\n\nHarris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez confirmed three additional storm-related deaths in a social media post Friday evening. Earlier, authorities reported at least four deaths were caused by the storm.\n\n\"We're in recovery mode,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed one EF-1 tornado touched down Thursday night near Cypress, about 30 miles northwest of Houston, with winds reaching 110 mph. It was also investigating reports of an unconfirmed tornado in Galena Park, about 11 miles east of downtown, NWS meteorologist Jeff Evans said Friday. \"The majority of this damage is straight-line winds,\" he said.\n\nAt least 4 dead in Texas storm\n\nMary Benton, spokesperson for the mayor, told USA TODAY the Harris County medical examiner's office would identify those killed and determine the causes of death.\n\nHouston Fire Chief Samuel Peña said Thursday that two of the deaths there were caused by falling trees. Another person died in a crane accident.\n\nOn Friday, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said it would take time to assess impacts from the storm, which she said knocked out the power for 740,000 customers, most of them residents of Harris County.\n\n\"This kind of wind is something we have not seen in Harris County since Hurricane Alicia in 1983,\" she said.\n\nAlicia, a Category 3 hurricane, swept across the state in August of 1983, bringing winds of up to 110 mph, according to the NWS. It caused more than $7 billion in damage.\n\nPower restoration could take weeks in some areas, officials warn\n\nHidalgo said she had signed a disaster declaration on Friday morning and Houston's government was in contact with the White House.\n\nAt a news briefing Friday afternoon, Hidalgo warned that power restoration could take weeks in some areas.\n\nMost of the storm damage appeared to be around Cypress, Hidalgo said. A helicopter scan of the impacted area showed the destruction was not as widespread as she expected.\n\nThe storms come weeks after the Houston area faced floods after a bout of heavy rain and thunderstorms earlier this month. In late April, Groveton and Trinity X — two towns around 100 miles north of Houston — received a respective 10 and 9 inches of rain.\n\nAbbott issued a disaster proclamation late last month in response to severe storms that hit the state weeks ago with flooding, hail, and hazardous wind. In a letter on Tuesday, he asked President Joe Biden to declare a major disaster for the state.\n\nAs of Friday morning, debris had been cleared from freeways but was still scattered over individual neighborhoods, Hidalgo said.\n\n'Downtown is a mess'\n\nOn Thursday night, Whitmire urged residents to stay home amid the dangerous road conditions. Widespread power outages had also knocked out traffic lights across the city, posing traffic control hazards for morning commuters. Whitmire said officials were also \"concerned\" about the dangers of broken glass on roadways.\n\n\"Downtown is a mess. It's dangerous due to the glass and the lack of traffic lights,\" he said. \"So stay at home. I can't emphasize that, repeat that enough.\"\n\nMore:How do thunderstorms form? Here's what's actually happening during severe weather.\n\nFire Chief Peña said the majority of emergency calls to the fire department were to report downed wires and gas leaks. \"If you're smelling gas inside your home, it could be potentially hazardous. So please call 911 if there is a smell of gas, but do so outside of that building,\" he said.\n\nMore than 900 customers of the utility company CenterPoint Energy had lost their power, he said. Power restoration would take up to 48 hours for some residents. The company said on X that restoring full power would be a \"days-long restoration effort.\"\n\nMore than 420,000 outages, or 20% of all power accounts, were reported in the Houston area as of Friday morning, according to USA TODAY's national power outage tracker.\n\nHouston's metro service said on Friday that shuttles would service the Purple and Green train lines due to power outages and debris on the tracks. Morning commuters should expect travel delays.\n\nSchools throughout the area shuttered their doors in response to the severe weather. Whitmire also asked employers in the downtown area to allow their employees to work from home.\n\nBy Friday morning, the risk of severe weather in Houston was marginal, with cloudy skies and a few showers expected in the afternoon, according to the Weather Channel.\n\nMore:Four dead after severe storms lash Texas; tornadoes, floods loom in Southeast U.S.\n\nStorms to bring hail, rain, possible tornadoes to Southeast\n\nBut the storm system is set to bring severe thunderstorms and excessive rainfall to the lower Mississippi Valley and Alabama on Friday and through the weekend.\n\n\"If you like rain and storms the next 2 days are for you,\" the National Weather Service in Birmingham posted on X on Friday morning. Southern Alabama, including Montgomery and Selma, could see a few tornadoes as the area is hit with hail and \"damaging winds\" of up to 60 mph.\n\nAs the storm moves eastward, northeastern Texas and parts of Alabama and Florida could be inundated with up to 8 inches of rain, potentially triggering serious flooding, according to AccuWeather.\n\nThrough that night, areas in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama could be at risk of flash flooding, the Weather Channel reported. Amid damaging winds on Saturday, the area faces an isolated tornado threat.\n\n\"Gusty winds and hail\" would be the main threats in strong storms expected to hit parts of Southeast Mississippi, according to the weather service in Mobile.\n\nParts of Florida also endured heavy wind on Friday morning – the southern coast near Tallahassee was hit with wind gusts of up to 70 mph, the weather service reported.\n\nFurther south, temperatures hit record highs earlier this week. On Wednesday, a heat index of 115 degrees in Key West tied the area's all-time record, AccuWeather reported.\n\nThe same day, Miami temperatures hit 96 degrees, just two degrees below its record high for the month.

For the latest, view our story for Thursday, Sept. 12.\n\nFrancine made landfall along the Louisiana coast as a Category 2 hurricane on Wednesday, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands and threatening the region with widespread flooding as cities became inundated with rainfall.\n\nFrancine made landfall in the Parish of Terrebonne, about 30 miles south-southwest of Morgan City, the National Hurricane Center announced at 5 p.m. CDT. Maximum sustained winds were estimated to be near 100 mph.\n\nLouisiana residents had braced for the storm's impact after Francine strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane, threatening the area with heavy rains and hurricane-force winds, according to the hurricane center. At around 1 a.m. CDT, the center of Francine was passing northwest of New Orleans.\n\nFrancine was later downgraded to a tropical storm Wednesday night as is currently moving with sustained winds of 50 mph, according to the hurricane center's 1 a.m. CDT forecast discussion. Up to 12 inches of rain was possible in parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle through Thursday night.\n\nThe storm swiftly knocked out power along the Louisiana coast with nearly 339,000 outages reported by late Wednesday, according to USA TODAY's power outage tracker.\n\nFootage from television stations and social media showed water flooding streets amid heavy rainfall; high winds bringing down trees and utility poles; and damaged roofs.\n\nLouisana Gov. Jeff Landry said the National Guard had been mobilized and had almost 400 high-water vehicles, 87 boats, and 50 helicopters ready to aid rescue and recovery efforts. He urged residents to follow instructions of local officials, including evacuation if necessary.\n\nSome good news: The hurricane center said Francine was expected to rapidly weaken after making landfall. Francine was forecast to move into Mississippi and then northward into the Mississippi Valley as a tropical depression, reaching Memphis by Thursday night.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ High wind gusts were reported in several areas, including 96 mph gusts that were reported at 5:29 p.m. in Dulac in Terrebonne Parish and 70 mph gusts reported at 7 p.m. about 5 miles east-southeast of New Orleans.\n\n∎ Metairie, Louisiana had received 8.04 inches of rain and the official site at the New Orleans International Airport recorded 7.32 inches, the weather service said.\n\n∎ The Mississippi Department of Education reported numerous school district closures on Wednesday and Thursday due to severe weather. Several Louisiana universities, including Louisiana State University and Tulane University, announced campuses will be closed through Thursday and moved to remote instruction.\n\n∎ President Joe Biden late Tuesday approved Louisiana's emergency declaration after state officials delivered a letter urging him to approve the request.

Greg Abbott cited a \"high probability \"of a life-threatening storm surge and urged residents along the Gulf Coast to follow the advice of local officials, including possible evacuations.\n\nStories about our planet, explained. Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter.\n\nLouisiana braces for landfall:Francine strengthens into a hurricane:\n\nSignificant flooding in New Orleans area, coastal parishes\n\nSignificant flooding was unfolding in the New Orleans area, forecasters warned. The National Weather Service declared a flash flood emergency on Wednesday night for the I-10 corridor in the New Orleans area, including parts of four parishes.\n\nThe agency warned that between 5 to 7 inches of rain had fallen and another 2 to 3 inches was possible. The weather service called it a \"catastrophic\" damage threat and warned people to seek higher ground.\n\n\"Francine is slowly lifting northward so rain will taper off. However, roads are still flooded! Do NOT go out,\" the weather service in New Orleans said on X at 9:25 p.m. \"It’s not safe! Shelter in place in the lowest non flooded floor. Heavy rainfall will be reaching the Northshore in the next 1-2 hrs. Please continue to shelter!\"\n\nThe weather service in New Orleans said during a 9 p.m. briefing that water was entering homes and businesses across St. Charles Parish, getting close to that in St. John the Baptist Parish, and entering buildings in Kenner.\n\nVideos from local television stations and on social media showed major flooding in Metairie in Jefferson Parish as streets were overflowing with water. Some residents in Thibodaux — about 31 miles northeast of Morgan City and 58 miles southwest of New Orleans — reported water entering their homes and flooding living rooms.\n\nA band of storms had set up and was dumping excessive rainfall over the same area, and the water in Lake Pontchartrain was rising, which meant the rain had nowhere to drain.\n\nIn Morgan City and Jefferson Parish, police asked residents to stay inside due to \"severe\" and \"unusual amounts of flooding.\"\n\n\"Please allow city crews to manage the pumping station and push flood waters out the city,\" the Morgan City Police Department said on Facebook Wednesday night. \"Please do not drive on flooded streets, this will increase the chances of homes taking on water damage.\"\n\nStorm surge risk along Gulf Coast\n\nStorm surge risks would continue across an area to the north and east of New Orleans for another couple of hours, weather service meteorologist Christopher Bannan said during a briefing around 9 p.m. Storm surge was expected across the northwestern portion of Lake Pontchartrain, with a rise of up to 6 feet possible, the hurricane center said.\n\nIn Bay St. Louis and Waveland, Mississippi, the storm surge was expected to rapidly rise for a few hours in the evening, Bannan said. That area is not new to storm surges. It was battered by a wall of water during Hurricane Camille in 1969 and again by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nThe water level at a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide gauge in Waveland had already been inching higher throughout the day on Wednesday.\n\nResidents urged to 'hunker down'\n\nThe National Weather Service office in New Orleans said the storm's impact could last through Thursday morning with coastal flooding, high winds, drenching rain and even tornadoes. The office warned that areas along and west of the Pearl River should prepare for damaging winds while some bayou and lower river parishes should prepare for hurricane-force winds. Other likely issues will include power outages and damage to trees, mobile homes and roofs.\n\n\"Conditions will be deteriorating throughout the day! Make sure you have all preparations rushed to completion ASAP!\" the office tweeted. \"Then, prepare to hunker down & shelter in place through the overnight hours!\"\n\nSeveral parishes on or near the Louisiana coast earlier issued mandatory evacuation orders, and the state transportation department issued evacuation maps. In the Parish of Terrebonne, where Francine made landfall, a parish-wide curfew will remain in effect until the storm has subsided and the roads are clear.\n\nThe city of New Orleans was distributing sandbags at five sites. After distributing tarps, fuel cans, and canned food to about 300 families on Tuesday, New Orleans charity Below Sea Level Aid paused efforts on Wednesday as Francine approached Louisiana, according to the group's executive director Jack Waguespack.\n\n\"We expect to open up again tomorrow after the storm passes and we'll go where the need is,\" Waguespack told Reuters.\n\nParish in Greater New Orleans area faces sewage issues amid storm\n\nOfficials in Jefferson Parish, a parish in the Greater New Orleans area, urged residents to limit water usage during the storm due to the \"aging sewer system,\" according to President Cynthia Lee Sheng.\n\n“The system is getting overwhelmed,” Sheng said at a Wednesday news conference. “The water has nowhere else to go and it’s getting backed up.”\n\nLee Sheng said the parish received numerous reports on Wednesday about residents who were unable to flush their toilets and manhole covers that were bubbling up.\n\nParish officials advised residents to avoid activities such as washing dishes and doing laundry in an effort to minimize overloading the sewerage system. Officials added that the parish has over 500 lift stations with more than 1,800 pumps working to keep the system down.\n\n“Crews are working diligently and out investigating sewer backups now; however, they will be off the streets once the winds reach 35 mph,” the parish said.\n\nMorgan City business booms as storm nears\n\nPolice in the coastal community of Morgan City, in the projected landfall area of the storm, issued a curfew from 11 a.m. Wednesday to 6 a.m. Thursday. Residents were asked to shelter in place.\n\nTrenton Ho, who lives and works in Morgan City, says he's not worried. Ho, a cashier at the Fifth Street Store, said business was brisk Wednesday morning because most stores in the city of 12,000 people were closed ahead of Francine. His own preparations included freezing a case of water so it stays cold if power goes out.\n\n\"I'm not the least bit concerned about this storm,\" Ho, 32, told USA TODAY on Wednesday. \"I was born and raised here. When you have lived here your whole life, you are used to this stuff.\"\n\nFrancine may pose a similar threat as it moves across the southeastern United States. Tornadoes are likely on Wednesday in southeastern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, and southern Alabama. The tornado risk is expected to expand to a larger area on Thursday.\n\nFrancine brings tornado threat to Southeast\n\nTornadoes are likely on Wednesday in southeastern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, and southern Alabama as Francine makes its way inland, AccuWeather warned. The tornado risk is expected to expand to a larger area Thursday and could linger into Friday.\n\n“Because some dry air has become entrained into Francine’s circulation, itmay increase the number and intensity of severe thunderstorms, which could boost the number of tornadoes,” AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said.\n\nMobile, Birmingham, Montgomery, and Huntsville in Alabama; Tallahassee, Florida, and Tupelo, Mississippi, are some of the biggest population centers that face a tornado threat, AccuWeather said, adding that tropical downpours may make the tornadoes difficult to see, raising the danger to lives and property.\n\nStorm tracker:See path of Hurricane Francine\n\nFrancine third hurricane to make landfall on Gulf Coast this year\n\nFrancine is the third hurricane this year to make landfall on the Gulf Coast — Debby made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida; and Beryl made landfall near Matagorda Bay, Texas.\n\nIt was also the 10th hurricane to make landfall in Louisiana since 2000. Francine is the eighth hurricane since then to make landfall at Category 2 strength or higher, according to Phil Klotzbach, senior research scientist at Colorado State University.\n\nThose other landfalling hurricanes include:\n\n2002, Lili, Cat. 1, Vermilion Bay, Iberia/Vermilion parishes\n\n2005, Katrina, Cat. 3, mouth of the Mississippi River, Plaquemines Parish\n\n2005, Rita, Cat. 3, Johnson’s Bayou, Cameron Parish\n\n2008, Gustav, Cat. 2, near Cocodrie, Terrebonne Parish\n\n2012, Isaac, Cat 1, Shell Beach, St. Bernard Parish\n\n2020, Laura, Cat. 4, Cameron, Cameron Parish\n\n2020, Delta, Cat. 2, Creole, Cameron Parish\n\n2020, Zeta, Cat. 3, Cocodrie, Terrebonne Parish\n\n2021, Ida, Cat. 4, Port Fourchon, LaFourche Parish\n\nFrancine is the third hurricane to make landfall in Terrebonne Parish since 2000.\n\nHurricane season may be heating up\n\nFrancine isn't the only storm on the map: Forecasters are also tracking four other disturbances across the Atlantic, which now appears to have fully woken up from its recent slumber.\n\nThis isn't surprising, as this week is the typical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nWhile none of the systems are an immediate threat to land, all bear watching for potential tropical development, the National Hurricane Center said Wednesday.\n\nThe four systems range in location from a system just off the U.S. coast to a tropical depression far out to sea near Africa.

The system was activated Sunday morning for just the second time.\n\nThe floodwaters overtopped some levees, while some did experience failures Sunday as the storm crossed the state.\n\nHere's what we know about levee conditions so far.\n\nHurricane Ida Aftermath:Louisiana holds through the night after storm delivers fast-rising water, punishing winds\n\nPhotos:See the damage in New Orleans caused by Hurricane Ida\n\nJean Lafitte, Lafitte levee fails in Jefferson Parish\n\nAt 10:48 p.m. Sunday, the National Weather Service said local law enforcement in central Jefferson Parish reported a levee failing around Lafitte and Jean Lafitte, with more than 200 people in imminent danger. \"Heavy rain and surge are leading to a failure of the levee,\" the Weather Service stated in its flash flooding emergency advisory.\n\nMayor Tom Kenner, Jr. told WLL-TV the unprecedented flooding led to “total devastation in the town.”\n\nAlliance floodgate in Plaquemines Parish fails\n\nShortly after 11 p.m. Sunday, Plaquemines Parish posted on Facebook that the Alliance to Oakville floodgate had failed near Highway 23 in alliance.\n\nArea residents were urged to evacuate immediately, with the Belle Chasse Auditorium noted as a shelter for those in need.\n\nPower Outages:See where power outages are in Louisiana after Hurricane Ida tears through state\n\nText updates:Stay updated on Hurricane Ida updates in Louisiana: Send us a text message\n\nWhite Ditch levee in Plaquemines Parish overtops, but holds\n\nThose in the Braithwaite area, between the Parish Line and White Ditch on the Eastbank, were warned to seek higher ground immediately by the Plaquemines Parish Government just before 5 p.m. Sunday\n\n“We have received reports of the levee overtopping at White Ditch,” a tweet shared by the New Orleans National Weather Service stated.\n\nMelissa Brown, William Taylor Potter, Greg Hillburn, Ashley White contributed to this report", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/09/15/tropical-storm-nicholas-rain-flooding-louisiana-texas-power-outages/8345362002/", "title": "Nicholas damage: Rain, flooding in Louisiana; Texas power outages", "text": "Tornado warnings were issued in parts of southern Louisiana early Wednesday.\n\nNicholas was downgraded to a tropical depression.\n\nSome areas could get 10 more inches of rain.\n\nMore than 100,000 Texas homes and businesses remained without power for a second day Wednesday as the remnants of Hurricane Nicholas slid across the Gulf Coast from the Lone Star State into Louisiana, drenching a region still staggering from Hurricane Ida's wrath less than three weeks ago.\n\nNicholas, downgraded to a tropical depression with sustained winds of 30 mph, was centered about 30 miles northeast of Lake Charles, Louisiana, early Wednesday. The storm was inching east-northeast at 5 mph.\n\n\"Much of South & Central Louisiana are under flood watch today as #Nicholas moves through the state,\" Gov. John Bel Edwards tweeted Wednesday. \"Stay aware of conditions in your local area.\"\n\nEarlier, Edwards warned the state's residents to \"take this storm seriously and put yourself in a position to weather it safely.\"\n\nAlmost 80,000 utility customers remained without power in the state, where the lights went out for more than 1 million homes and businesses during Ida's peak fury.\n\nLake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter said city crews had scoured the drainage system to keep it free from debris that might cause clogs and flooding. Hurricane Laura struck the city a little more than a year ago. Then came Hurricane Delta, then a January freeze that shattered pipes across the city of nearly 80,000 residents just 60 miles east of Beaumont, Texas. A rainstorm in May swamped houses and businesses yet again.\n\n“With what people have gone through over the last 16 months here in Lake Charles, they are very, understandably despondent, emotional,\" Hunter said. \"Any time we have even a hint of a weather event approaching, people get scared.\"\n\nIn Pointe-aux-Chenes, 70 miles southwest of New Orleans, Ida tore the tin roof off Terry and Patti Dardar’s home, leaving them without power and water. Rains from Nicholas have now soaked the top floor of their home – but it also provided badly needed water their family collected in jugs. They poured the water into a large plastic container through a strainer, and a pump powered by a generator brought the water inside.\n\n“We ain’t got no other place,” Patti Dardar said. “This is our home.”\n\nThe National Weather Center warned that Nicholas, which already dumped more than a foot of rain on parts of Texas and several inches on areas of Louisiana, was expected to generate an additional 3 to 6 inches across the central Gulf Coast in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle through Friday, with isolated totals of 10 more inches possible in some areas.\n\n\"Life-threatening flash flooding impacts, especially in urban areas, are possible across these regions,\" said Alex Lamers, a National Weather Service warning coordination meteorologist.\n\nNicholas hits Texas coast, but weakens in strength: 'Life-threatening' flash flooding likely across the South\n\nTornado warnings were issued in parts of southern Louisiana early Wednesday. The storm was forecast to gradually dissipate over central Louisiana on Thursday.\n\nHurricane Nicholas made landfall early Tuesday along the Matagorda Peninsula with torrential rains and storm surge. The cleanup was in full swing in Texas, where more than 14 inches of rain fell on parts of the Galveston area. Houston was hit with 6 inches, and the city set up cooling and phone charging centers in areas where power outages dragged on.\n\nEarlier, first responders joined with members of the National Guard in rescuing people from flooded homes.\n\n\"Texas has deployed swift-water boats, helicopters and high profile vehicles to help local authorities with rescue efforts arising from flooding and high winds,\" Gov. Greg Abbot said Tuesday. \"Emergency shelters have been set up for residents who might be displaced.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nMore:Ida is among strongest hurricanes to ever hit the US.

On Monday, the western side of the city Los Angeles and the Santa Monica Mountains were under a flash flood warning until 6 p.m.\n\nFlood warnings were also issued for the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys and the Eastern Santa Monica mountains.\n\n\"The main flood threat is going to be today and tomorrow,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Joseph Bauer told USA TODAY on Monday.\n\nThe storm could bring up to 5 inches of rain and \"damaging\" winds of up to 60 mph, the weather service said. Mountainous areas could see several feet of snow and up to 8 inches of rain.\n\nThe rainstorm descended on the Central Valley late Sunday and stretched south to soak San Diego, according to AccuWeather. Bauer said Monday's rain would cover the region northwest of the L.A. basin, and the heaviest rainfall will hit Santa Barbara and Ventura County.\n\n\"They've already picked up a couple inches around Santa Barbara and even produced some flash flood reports in Santa Barbara itself and into the hills,\" Bauer said.\n\nThe California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services activated its operations center over the weekend and positioned personnel and equipment in areas most at risk.\n\nSeveral rescues done, flooding closes Santa Barbara airport\n\nThe storm led to a number of rescues from northern to central California.\n\nIn Sloughhouse, a community about 20 miles southeast of Sacramento, firefighters rescued two people from the top of their vehicle that had stalled in flood waters, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District said.\n\nAnd hours earlier, a man was rescued along a creek in El Dorado Hills, just northeast of Sacramento. The man, who had been camping in the area, was trapped in a tree as floodwaters rose, El Dorado Hills Deputy Fire Chief Dave Brady told KCRA-TV.\n\nIn San Luis Obispo County, on the state's central coast, crews helped three people out of the rising Salinas River in the city of Paso Robles. Firefighters were already planning to train on swift-water rescues when they received word that someone was stranded on an island in the river, Paso Robles Fire and Emergency Services Battalion Chief Scott Hallett told KSBY-TV.\n\nThe Santa Barbara airport closed Monday after as much as 10 inches of rain had fallen in the area by noon, covering the runways with water. All commercial flights were canceled and airport officials paused general aviation operations.\n\n\"Santa Barbara Airport remains closed until further notice,\" airport officials said in a statement late Monday afternoon. \"The airfield experienced significant flooding due to the storm and water is not expected to recede enough to open for the reminder of today.\"\n\nFlooding, mudslides, power outages all possible\n\nThe storm would then move south down the coast on Tuesday, centering on the L.A. basin and bringing \"concerns for flooding and mudslides\" in the area, he said. Metro areas in Los Angeles and San Diego are at risk of \"ponding water,\" Bauer said.\n\nThe weather service warned residents of all four counties in Southwest California to look out for rock and mudslides caused by the torrential rain.\n\nBauer said the heavy rainfall could also trigger power outages. \"You've got a more elevated risk for downed power lines and trees falling into power infrastructure there because of the saturated ground,\" Bauer said.\n\nHigh surf and coastal flooding are also expected through Tuesday on the beaches of Los Angeles and Malibu, and Santa Barbara County could see waves of up to 20 feet, the weather service said. The agency advised residents to avoid flooded roadways and dangerously large waves on the coast.\n\nNorthern California was not out of the woods. Bauer said San Francisco and the Central Inner Valley could also face some severe weather on Monday. \"We're portraying some risk of severe weather today, which includes the risk for downpours and even some isolated tornadoes in that corridor as well,\" Bauer said.\n\nDramatic photos:Flooding makes fourth wettest day in San Diego\n\nA 'level down' from severe storm in early February\n\nThe new bout of rain comes just two weeks after a severe storm, dubbed the \"Pineapple Express,\" soaked California in the heaviest rain of the season and triggered widespread, dangerous flooding throughout the area. In response to the extreme weather, eight counties in Southern California declared a state of emergency.\n\nLos Angeles recorded more than 4 inches of rain on Feb. 4, breaking the day's record by more than an inch and totaling the most rain in one day in more than 20 years. Some areas in Southern California saw up to 8 inches of rain.\n\nThe rainfall and mudslides created up to $11 billion worth in damage to infrastructure and economic loss, according to preliminary reports from AccuWeather.\n\nBauer said this week's rainfall would be a \"level down\" from the last storm.\n\n\"That was a historic event,\" he said. \"This one is not going to quite produce that much rainfall.\"\n\nAtmospheric rivers are fueling these storms\n\nAtmospheric rivers are behind both this week's rainfall and early February's storm. The threads of water vapor, which spread from the tropics and stretch hundreds of miles across, cause around half of all annual precipitation on the West Coast.\n\n\"If you look at the satellite this morning, you can see a stream of moisture along the tail end of this cold front here that really stretches all the way from the area east of Hawaii, pulling up all that tropical moisture toward Southern California,\" Bauer said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nCybele Mayes-Osterman is a breaking news reporter for USA Today.

Authorities deployed high-water rescue vehicles throughout the city and erected barricades at more than 40 locations that tend to flood, Mayor Sylvester Turner said.\n\n“This city is very resilient. We know what we need to do. We know about preparing,” said Turner, referencing four major flood events that have hit the Houston area in recent years, including devastating damage from Harvey, which flooded more than 150,000 homes in the Houston area.\n\nTurner and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo asked residents to stay off the roads Monday evening to avoid risking their lives or the lives of first responders who might be called to rescue them from flooded roadways.\n\n“What I need each resident to do is get where you need to be by 6 p.m. and stay there,” said Hidalgo, the top elected official in Harris County, which includes Houston.\n\nTropical Storm Nicholas nears Texas: NHC monitoring 3 other systems in Atlantic\n\nEmergency declared:Louisiana declares state of emergency as Tropical Storm Nicholas targets battered region\n\nLouisiana, where more than 100,000 homes and businesses remain without power two weeks after the devastation of Hurricane Ida, was under a state of emergency.

Over the past two weeks, eastern Texas and parts of Louisiana have \"seen over 600% of their normal rainfall,\" only increasing the chances of flooding as the new storms sweep through the Gulf Coast.\n\n\"Soils are not expected to retain any of the rainfall expected today,\" the weather service warned, adding that the rain will \"re-raise levels in smaller creeks and streams, while the major rivers already in flood stage will also see rises.\"\n\nAt least 4 dead after storms in Texas, Louisiana this month\n\nSince late April, Texas and Louisiana have faced recent rounds of severe and deadly weather. This month, hundreds of people had to be evacuated from eastern Texas in a deluge that took the life of a 4-year-old boy and led to historic river flooding. In Louisiana, three people, including an unborn baby, were killed when potent storms kicked up tornadoes and ravaged communities across the state on Monday.\n\nMore:Maps: 2024 tornado season is ramping up to set records\n\nOn Wednesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott requested a presidential disaster declaration for assistance programs for 26 counties that were impacted by storms since April 26.

The storm was expected to dump potentially damaging hail, and cause fierce wind gusts up to 80 mph in some areas, the National Weather Service said.\n\nAt least three tornadoes were reported in Oklahoma on Monday evening, according to AccuWeather. Several tornado warnings were issued as a line of storms moved across the state.\n\nCities such as Oklahoma City; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Wichita Falls, Texas, faced the largest threat of tornadoes. Portions of Oklahoma and Texas were placed under a \"moderate\" risk at level 4 on the weather service's 1 to 5 scale of severe storm severity.\n\nShowers and thunderstorms were also expected Monday over parts of the mid-Atlantic region, hitting mainly Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia, the weather service noted. Several inches of rain could batter localized areas. Urban spots, roadways, and small streams would be most vulnerable to flash flooding.\n\nThe severe weather threat will continue into Tuesday night, and extend from northern parts of Indiana and Ohio to the Chesapeake Bay region, according to AccuWeather.\n\nOver the weekend, the system fueled storms that drenched Southern California, dropped tennis ball-size hail over parts of Illinois, and flooded low-lying areas throughout the Midwest.\n\nHigh winds, large hail hit Texas\n\nHail as large as grapefruits or baseballs fell in parts of central Texas as wind gusts near 90 mph were reported in the state, AccuWeather said. A wind advisory was issued in portions of southwest and western Texas.\n\n\"Gusty winds may blow around unsecured objects,\" the weather service warned. \"Winds this strong can make driving difficult.\"\n\nThe weather service urged motorists to use caution when driving in west Texas due to high winds and blowing dust that could reduce visibility to \"as low as 1/2 mile as this front moves through.\"\n\nLow visibility at an intersection south of Odessa and Midland, Texas, caused multiple accidents on Monday afternoon, according to the Upton County Sheriff's Department. The Texas Department of Public Safety said the accidents involved 30 cars and caused multiple injuries, CBS7 reported.\n\nTuesday may bring extreme weather east\n\nThe large system \"will be quasi-stationary through Tuesday morning,\" which prompted the weather service to extend a moderate risk of storms for much of the state of Ohio. An enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms was in place for parts of the Midwest and Ohio Valley regions.\n\nBeginning Tuesday morning and continuing throughout the day, the Ohio and Tennessee valleys as well as the central Gulf Coast states including Louisiana, Alabama and northern Florida – a vast area encompassing more than 50 million people – will be at risk of severe weather, according to the weather service.\n\n\"Wind damage and isolated large hail will be possible across a broad area,\" the weather service said. \"The tornado threat is expected to be greatest from middle Tennessee north-northeastward into central and northern Kentucky.\"\n\nStorm bringing snow, cold weather to Northeast later this week\n\nThe large storm system making its way across the country is threatening the Midwest and Northeast with an \"all-out winter storm,\" according to AccuWeather.\n\nBeginning Tuesday, snow is expected across parts of Wisconsin and Illinois before conditions intensify, and several inches of snow are expected in parts of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, AccuWeather said.\n\nPowerful wind gusts may snarl traffic and disrupt travel across the Atlantic Coast, AccuWeather said, adding that the combination of snow and wind is expected to last through Friday.\n\nRain damages section of Highway 1 in California, prompting closure\n\nA section of Highway 1 in California remains closed because of a partial collapse of the road that occurred Saturday amid a storm that drenched a large area of Southern California in several inches of rain, according to the state's Department of Transportation.\n\nThe collapse was reported as heavy rain fell. By noon on Sunday, Caltrans crews were able to lead drivers through a single lane in the area, around the damaged section. The agency said on X on Sunday evening that the highway remained closed on the Big Sur Coast.\n\nThough it didn't qualify as an atmospheric river because it lacks a strong link to tropical moisture, the area of low pressure that moved through Southern California represented a powerful final charge from the rainy season before the full-fledged transition to spring and the state’s dry months.\n\nContributing: Jorge L.

The 90-minute debate took place in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center and was moderated by \"World News Tonight\" anchor and managing editor David Muir and ABC News Live \"Prime\" anchor Linsey Davis.\n\nBelow is a partial transcript of the exchange between the two presidential nominees, and will be updated.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Tonight, the high-stakes showdown here in Philadelphia between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump. Their first face-to-face meeting in this presidential election. Their first face-to-face meeting ever.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: A historic race for president upended just weeks ago. President Biden withdrawing after his last debate. Donald Trump is now up against a new opponent.\n\nDAVID MUIR: The candidates separated by the smallest of margins. Essentially tied in the polls nationally. And in the key battlegrounds, including right here in Pennsylvania, all still very much in play. The ABC News Presidential Debate starts right now.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Good evening, I'm David Muir. And thank you for joining us for tonight's ABC News Presidential Debate. We want to welcome viewers watching on ABC and around the world tonight. Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump are just moments away from taking the stage in this unprecedented race for president.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: And I'm Linsey Davis. Tonight's meeting could be the most consequential event of their campaigns, with Election Day now less than two months away. For Vice President Kamala Harris, this is her first debate since President Biden withdrew from the race on July 21st. Of course, that decision followed his debate against President Donald Trump in June. Since then, this race has taken on an entirely new dynamic.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And that brings us to the rules of tonight's debate: 90 minutes with two commercial breaks. No topics or questions have been shared with the campaigns. The candidates will have two minutes to answer questions. And this is the clock. That's what they'll be seeing. Two minutes for rebuttals and one minute for follow-ups, clarifications or responses. Their microphones will only be turned on when it's their turn to speak. No prewritten notes allowed. There is no audience here tonight in this hall at the National Constitution Center. This is an intimate setting for two candidates who have never met.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump won the coin toss. He chose to deliver the final closing statement of the evening. Vice President Harris selected the podium to the right.\n\nDAVID MUIR: So let's now welcome the candidates to the stage. Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Kamala Harris. Let's have a good debate.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Nice to see you. Have fun.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Welcome to you both. It's wonderful to have you. It's an honor to have you both here tonight.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Good evening, we are looking forward to a spirited and thoughtful debate.\n\nDAVID MUIR: So let's get started. I want to begin tonight with the issue voters repeatedly say is their number one issue, and that is the economy and the cost of living in this country. Vice President Harris, you and President Trump were elected four years ago and your opponent on the stage here tonight often asks his supporters, are you better off than you were four years ago? When it comes to the economy, do you believe Americans are better off than they were four years ago?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So, I was raised as a middle-class kid. And I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America. I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people. And that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy. Because here's the thing. We know that we have a shortage of homes and housing, and the cost of housing is too expensive for far too many people. We know that young families need support to raise their children. And I intend on extending a tax cut for those families of $6,000, which is the largest child tax credit that we have given in a long time. So that those young families can afford to buy a crib, buy a car seat, buy clothes for their children. My passion, one of them, is small businesses. I was actually -- my mother raised my sister and me but there was a woman who helped raise us. We call her our second mother. She was a small business owner. I love our small businesses. My plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction to start-up small businesses, knowing they are part of the backbone of America's economy. My opponent, on the other hand, his plan is to do what he has done before, which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations, which will result in $5 trillion to America's deficit. My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump sales tax, which would be a 20% tax on everyday goods that you rely on to get through the month. Economists have said that Trump's sales tax would actually result for middle-class families in about $4,000 more a year because of his policies and his ideas about what should be the backs of middle-class people paying for tax cuts for billionaires.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, I'll give you two minutes.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: First of all, I have no sales tax. That's an incorrect statement. She knows that. We're doing tariffs on other countries. Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've done for the world. And the tariff will be substantial in some cases. I took in billions and billions of dollars, as you know, from China. In fact, they never took the tariff off because it was so much money, they can't. It would totally destroy everything that they've set out to do. They've taken in billions of dollars from China and other places. They've left the tariffs on. When I had it, I had tariffs and yet I had no inflation. Look, we've had a terrible economy because inflation has -- which is really known as a country buster. It breaks up countries. We have inflation like very few people have ever seen before. Probably the worst in our nation's history. We were at 21%. But that's being generous because many things are 50, 60, 70, and 80% higher than they were just a few years ago. This has been a disaster for people, for the middle class, but for every class. On top of that, we have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums. And they're coming in and they're taking jobs that are occupied right now by African Americans and Hispanics and also unions. Unions are going to be affected very soon. And you see what's happening. You see what's happening with towns throughout the United States. You look at Springfield, Ohio. You look at Aurora in Colorado. They are taking over the towns. They're taking over buildings. They're going in violently. These are the people that she and Biden let into our country. And they're destroying our country. They're dangerous. They're at the highest level of criminality. And we have to get them out. We have to get them out fast. I created one of the greatest economies in the history of our country. I'll do it again and even better.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We are going to get to immigration and border security during this debate. But I would like to let Vice President Harris respond on the economy here.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, I would love to. Let's talk about what Donald Trump left us. Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression. Donald Trump left us the worst public health epidemic in a century. Donald Trump left us the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. And what we have done is clean up Donald Trump's mess. What we have done and what I intend to do is build on what we know are the aspirations and the hopes of the American people. But I'm going to tell you all, in this debate tonight, you're going to hear from the same old, tired playbook, a bunch of lies, grievances and name-calling. What you're going to hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again. I believe very strongly that the American people want a president who understands the importance of bringing us together knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. And I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, I'll give you a minute here to respond.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Number one, I have nothing to do, as you know and as she knows better than anyone, I have nothing to do with Project 2025. That's out there. I haven't read it. I don't want to read it, purposely. I'm not going to read it. This was a group of people that got together, they came up with some ideas. I guess some good, some bad. But it makes no difference. I have nothing to do -- everybody knows I'm an open book. Everybody knows what I'm going to do. Cut taxes very substantially. And create a great economy like I did before. We had the greatest economy. We got hit with a pandemic. And the pandemic was, not since 1917 where 100 million people died has there been anything like it? We did a phenomenal job with the pandemic. We handed them over a country where the economy and where the stock market was higher than it was before the pandemic came in. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. We made ventilators for the entire world. We got gowns. We got masks. We did things that nobody thought possible. And people give me credit for rebuilding the military. They give me credit for a lot of things. But not enough credit for the great job we did with the pandemic. But the only jobs they got were bounce-back jobs. These were jobs, bounce back. And it bounced back and it went to their benefit. But I was the one that created them. They know it and so does everybody else.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, I'll let you respond.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So, Donald Trump has no plan for you. And when you look at his economic plan, it's all about tax breaks for the richest people. I am offering what I describe as an opportunity economy, and the best economists in our country, if not the world, have reviewed our relative plans for the future of America. What Goldman Sachs has said is that Donald Trump's plan would make the economy worse. Mine would strengthen the economy. What the Wharton School has said is Donald Trump's plan would actually explode the deficit. Sixteen Nobel laureates have described his economic plan as something that would increase inflation and by the middle of next year would invite a recession. You just have to look at where we are and where we stand on the issues. And I'd invite you to know that Donald Trump actually has no plan for you, because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's just a sound bite. They gave her that to say. Look, I went to the Wharton School of Finance and many of those professors, the top professors, think my plan is a brilliant plan, it's a great plan. It's a plan that's going to bring up our worth, our value as a country. It's going to make people want to be able to go and work and create jobs and create a lot of good, solid money for our -- for our country. And just to finish off, she doesn't have a plan. She copied Biden's plan. And it's like four sentences, like run-Spot-run. Four sentences that are just oh, we'll try and lower taxes. She doesn't have a plan. Take a look at her plan. She doesn't have a plan.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President, I do want to drill down on something you both brought up. The vice president brought up your tariffs you responded and let's drill down on this because your plan is what she calls is a essentially a national sales tax. Your proposal calls for tariffs as you pointed out here, on foreign imports across the board. You recently said that you might double your plan, imposing tariffs up to 20% on good coming into this country. As you know many economists say that with tariffs at that level costs are then passed onto the consumer. Vice President Harris has argued it’ll mean higher prices on gas, food, clothing medication arguing it costs the typical family nearly four thousand dollars a year. Do you believe Americans can afford higher prices because of tariffs.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They aren’t gonna have higher prices what’s gonna have and who’s gonna have higher prices is China and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years. I charge, I was the only president ever China was paying us hundreds of billions of dollars and so were other countries and you know if she doesn’t like ‘em they should have gone out and they should have immediately cut the tariffs but those tariffs are there three and a half years now under their administration. We are gonna take in billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars. I had no inflation, virtually no inflation, they had the highest inflation, perhaps in the history of our country because I’ve never seen a worse period of time. People can’t go out and buy cereal bacon or eggs or anything else. These the people of our country are absolutely dying with what they’ve done. They’ve destroyed the economy and all you have to do it look at a poll. The polls say 80 and 85 and even 90% that the Trump economy was great that their economy was terrible.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris I do want to ask for your response and you heard what the president said there because the Biden administration did keep a number of the Trump tariffs in place so how do you respond?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, let’s be clear that the Trump administration resulted in a trade deficit, one of the highest we’ve ever seen in the history of America. He invited trade wars, you wanna talk about his deal with China what he ended up doing is under Donald Trump’s presidency he ended up selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernize their military basically sold us out when a policy about China should be in making sure the United States of America wins the competition for the 21st century. Which means focusing on the details of what that requires, focusing on relationships with our allies, focusing on investing in American based technology so that we win the race on A.I. and quantum computing, focusing on what we need to do to support America’s work force, so that we don’t end up having the on the short end of the stick in terms of workers' rights. But what Donald Trump did let’s talk about this with COVID, is he actually thanked President XI for what he did during COVID. Look at his tweet. \"Thank you, President XI,\" exclamation point. When we know that XI was responsible for lacking and not giving us transparency about the origins of COVID.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, I’ll let you respond.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: First of all, they bought their chips from Taiwan. We hardly make chips anymore because of philosophies like they have and policies like they have. I don't say her because she has no policy. Everything that she believed three years ago and four years ago is out the window. She's going to my philosophy now. In fact, I was going to send her a MAGA hat. She's gone to my philosophy. But if she ever got elected, she'd change it. And it will be the end of our country. She's a Marxist. Everybody knows she's a Marxist. Her father's a Marxist professor in economics. And he taught her well. But when you look at what she's done to our country and when you look at these millions and millions of people that are pouring into our country monthly where it's I believe 21 million people, not the 15 that people say, and I think it's a lot higher than the 21. That's bigger than New York state. Pouring in. And just look at what they're doing to our country. They're criminals. Many of these people coming in are criminals. And that's bad for our economy too. You mentioned before, we'll talk about immigration later.\n\nWell, bad immigration is the worst thing that can happen to our economy. They have and she has destroyed our country with policy that's insane. Almost policy that you'd say they have to hate our country.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President trump, thank you. Linsey?\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: I want to turn to the issue of abortion. President Trump, you've often touted that you were able to kill Roe V. Wade. Last year, you said that you were proud to be the most pro-life president in American history. Then last month you said that your administration would be great for women and their reproductive rights. In your home state of Florida, you surprised many with regard to your six-week abortion ban because you initially had said that it was too short and you said, \"I'm going to be voting that we need more than six weeks.\" But then the very next day, you reversed course and said you would vote to support the six-week ban. Vice President Harris says that women shouldn’t trust you on the issue of abortion because you’ve changed your position so many times. Therefore, why should they trust you?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, the reason I'm doing that vote is because the plan is, as you know, the vote is, they have abortion in the ninth month. They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia, not the current governor, who's doing an excellent job, but the governor before. He said the baby will be born and we will decide what to do with the baby. In other words, we'll execute the baby.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And that's why I did that, because that predominates. Because they're radical. The Democrats are radical in that. And her vice presidential pick, which I think was a horrible pick, by the way for our country, because he is really out of it. But her vice presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says execution after birth, it's execution, no longer abortion, because the baby is born, is okay. And that's not okay with me. Hence the vote. But what I did is something for 52 years they've been trying to get Roe V. Wade into the states.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And through the genius and heart and strength of six supreme court justices we were able to do that. Now, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. 85% of Republicans do. Exceptions. Very important. But we were able to get it. And now states are voting on it. And for the first time you're going to see -- look, this is an issue that's torn our country apart for 52 years. Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote. And that's what happened, happened. Now, Ohio, the vote was somewhat liberal. Kansas the vote was somewhat liberal. Much more liberal than people would have thought. But each individual state is voting. It's the vote of the people now. It's not tied up in the federal government. I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it. And the supreme court had great courage in doing it. And I give tremendous credit to those six justices.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born. Madam vice president, I want to get your response to President Trump.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, as I said, you're going to hear a bunch of lies. And that’s not actually a surprising fact. Let's understand how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe V. Wade. And they did exactly as he intended. And now in over 20 states there are Trump abortion bans which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide health care. In one state it provides prison for life. Trump abortion bans that make no exception even for rape and incest. Which understand what that means. A survivor of a crime, a violation to their body, does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That is immoral. And one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government, and Donald Trump certainly, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I have talked with women around our country. You want to talk about this is what people wanted? Pregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term suffering from a miscarriage, being denied care in an emergency room because the health care providers are afraid they might go to jail and she's bleeding out in a car in the parking lot? She didn't want that. Her husband didn't want that. A 12 or 13-year-old survivor of incest being forced to carry a pregnancy to term? They don't want that. And I pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe V. Wade as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. But understand, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign a national abortion ban. Understand in his project 2025 there would be a national abortion ban. Understand in his project 2025 there would be a national abortion -- a monitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages. I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, in particular the freedom to make decisions about one's own body, should not be made by the government.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Thank you, Vice President Harris.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, there she goes again. It's a lie. I'm not signing a ban. And there's no reason to sign a ban. Because we've gotten what everybody wanted. Democrats, Republicans and everybody else and every legal scholar wanted it to be brought back into the states. And the states are voting. And it may take a little time, but for 52 years this issue has torn our country apart. And they've wanted it back in the states. And I did something that nobody thought was possible. The states are now voting. What she says is an absolute lie. And as far as the abortion ban, no, I'm not in favor of abortion ban. But it doesn't matter because this issue has now been taken over by the states.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Would you veto a national abortion ban if it came to --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I won't have to because again -- two things. Number one, she said she'll go back to congress. She'll never get the vote. It's impossible for her to get the vote. Especially now with a 50-50 --essentially 50-50 in both senate and the house. She's not going to get the vote. She can't get the vote. She won't even come close to it. So it's just talk. You know what it reminds me of? When they said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe. The student loans -- and then her I think probably her boss, if you call him a boss, he spends all his time on the beach, but look, her boss went out and said we'll do it again, we'll do it a different way. He went out, got rejected again by the supreme court. So all these students got taunted with this whole thing about -- this whole idea. And how unfair that would have been. Part of the reason they lost. To the millions and millions of people that had to pay off their student loans. They didn't get it for free. But they were saying -- it's the same way that they talked about that, that they talk about abortion.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: But if I could just get a yes or no. Because your running mate J.D. Vance has said that you would veto if it did come to your desk.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I didn't discuss it with J.D. In all fairness. J.D. -- And I don't mind if he has a certain view but I think he was speaking for me but I really didn't. Look, we don't have to discuss it because she'd never be able to get it just like she couldn't get student loans. They couldn't get -- they didn't even come close to getting student loans. They didn't even come close to getting student loans. They taunted young people and a lot of other people that had loans. They can never get this approved. So it doesn't matter what she says about going to congress. Wonderful. Let's go to congress. Do it. But the fact is that for years they wanted to get it out of congress and out of the federal government and we did something that everybody said couldn't be done. And now you have a vote of the people on abortion.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, I want to give you your time to respond. But I do want to ask, would you support any restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I absolutely support reinstating the protections of Roe V. Wade. And as you rightly mentioned, nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That is not happening. It's insulting to the women of America. And understand what has been happening under Donald Trump's abortion bans. Couples who pray and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments. What is happening in our country, working people, working women who are working one or two jobs, who can barely afford childcare as it is, have to travel to another state to get on a plane sitting next to strangers, to go and get the health care she needs. Barely can afford to do it. And what you are putting her through is unconscionable. And the people of America have not -- the majority of Americans believe in a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. And that is why in every state where this issue has been on the ballot, in red and blue states both, the people of America have voted for freedom.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice president Harris --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, I have to respond. Another lie. It's another lie. I have been a leader on IVF which is fertilization. The IVF -- I have been a leader. In fact, when they got a very negative decision on IVF from the Alabama courts, I saw the people of Alabama and the legislature two days later voted it in. I've been a leader on it. They know that and everybody else knows it. I have been a leader on fertilization, IVF. And the other thing, they -- you should ask, will she allow abortion in the eighth month, ninth month, seventh month?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Come on.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Would you do that? Why don't you ask her that question --\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Why don't you answer the question would you veto –\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That’s the problem. Because under Roe v. Wade.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Answer the question, would you veto--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You could do abortions in the seventh month, the eighth month, the ninth month -\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: That's not true.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And probably after birth. Just look at the governor, former governor of Virginia. The governor of Virginia said we put the baby aside and then we determine what we want to do with the baby.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, thank you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We're going to turn now to immigration and border security. We know it's an issue that's important to Republicans, Democrats, voters across the board in this country. Vice President Harris, you were tasked by President Biden with getting to the root causes of migration from Central America. We know that illegal border crossings reached a record high in the Biden administration. This past June, President Biden imposed tough new asylum restrictions. We know the numbers since then have dropped significantly. But my question to you tonight is why did the administration wait until six months before the election to act and would you have done anything differently from President Biden on this?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So I'm the only person on this stage who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. And let me say that the United States Congress, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, came up with a border security bill which I supported. And that bill would have put 1,500 more border agents on the border to help those folks who are working there right now over time trying to do their job. It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States. I know there are so many families watching tonight who have been personally affected by the surge of fentanyl in our country. That bill would have put more resources to allow us to prosecute transnational criminal organizations for trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings. But you know what happened to that bill? Donald Trump got on the phone, called up some folks in Congress, and said kill the bill. And you know why? Because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And understand, this comes at a time where the people of our country actually need a leader who engages in solutions, who actually addresses the problems at hand. But what we have in the former president is someone who would prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And I'll tell you something, he's going to talk about immigration a lot tonight even when it's not the subject that is being raised. And I'm going to actually do something really unusual and I'm going to invite you to attend one of Donald Trump's rallies because it's a really interesting thing to watch. You will see during the course of his rallies he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. He will talk about windmills cause cancer. And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom. And I will tell you the one thing you will not hear him talk about is you. You will not hear him talk about your needs, your dreams, and your, your desires. And I'll tell you, I believe you deserve a president who actually puts you first. And I pledge to you that I will.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you. President Trump, on that point I want to get your response.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I would like to respond.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let me just ask, though, why did you try to kill that bill and successfully so? That would have put thousands of additional agents and officers on the border.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: First let me respond as to the rallies. She said people start leaving. People don't go to her rallies. There's no reason to go. And the people that do go, she's busing them in and paying them to be there. And then showing them in a different light. So, she can't talk about that. People don't leave my rallies. We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics. That's because people want to take their country back. Our country is being lost. We're a failing nation. And it happened three and a half years ago. And what, what's going on here, you're going to end up in World War 3, just to go into another subject. What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to come into our country. And look at what's happening to the towns all over the United States. And a lot of towns don't want to talk -- not going to be Aurora or Springfield. A lot of towns don't want to talk about it because they're so embarrassed by it. In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in. They're eating the cats. They're eating -- they're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country. And it's a shame. As far as rallies are concerned, as far -- the reason they go is they like what I say. They want to bring our country back. They want to make America great again. It's a very simple phrase. Make America great again. She's destroying this country. And if she becomes president, this country doesn't have a chance of success. Not only success. We'll end up being Venezuela on steroids.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I just want to clarify here, you bring up Springfield, Ohio. And ABC News did reach out to the city manager there. He told us there have been no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I’ve seen people on television\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let me just say here this ...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The people on television say my dog was taken and used for food. So maybe he said that and maybe that's a good thing to say for a city manager.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I’m not taking this from television. I'm taking it from the city manager.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But the people on television say their dog was eaten by the people that went there.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Again, the Springfield city manager says there's no evidence of that.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We’ll find out\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, I'll let you respond to the rest of what you heard.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Talk about extreme. Um, you know, this is I think one of the reasons why in this election I actually have the endorsement of 200 Republicans who have formally worked with President Bush, Mitt Romney, and John McCain including the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney and Congressmember Liz Cheney. And if you want to really know the inside track on who the former president is, if he didn't make it clear already, just ask people who have worked with him. His former chief of staff, a four-star general, has said he has contempt for the constitution of the United States. His former national security adviser has said he is dangerous and unfit. His former secretary of defense has said the nation, the republic would never survive another Trump term. And when we listen to this kind of rhetoric, when the issues that affect the American people are not being addressed, I think the choice is clear in this election.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, I'll give you a quick minute to respond.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah. Thank you. Because when I hear that -- see, I'm a different kind of a person. I fired most of those people. Not so graciously. They did bad things or a bad job. I fired them. They never fired one person. They didn't fire anybody having to do with Afghanistan and the Taliban and the 13 people whose, whose, were just killed viciously and violently killed and I got to know the parents and the family. They should have fired all those generals, all those top people because that was one of the most incompetently handled situations anybody has ever seen. So when somebody does a bad job I fire them. And you take a guy like Esper. He was no good, I fired him. So he writes a book. Another one writes a book. Because with me they can write books. With nobody else can they. But they have done such a poor job. And they never fire anybody. Look at the economy. Look at the inflation. They didn't fire any of their economists. They have the same people. That's a good way not to have books written about you. But just to finish, I got more votes than any Republican in history by far. In fact, I got more votes than any president, sitting president in history by far.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let me continue on immigration. It was what you wanted to talk about earlier. So let's get back to your deportation proposal that the vice president has reacted to as well. President Trump, you called this the largest domestic deportation operation in the history of our country. You say you would use the National Guard. You say if things get out of control you'd have no problem using the U.S. military.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: With local police.\n\nDAVID MUIR: You also said you would use local police. How would you deport 11 million undocumented immigrants? I know you believe that number is much higher. Take us through this. What does this look like? Will authorities be going door to door in this country?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. It is much higher because of them. They allowed criminals. Many, many, millions of criminals. They allowed terrorists. They allowed common street criminals. They allowed people to come in, drug dealers, to come into our country, and they're now in the United States. And told by their countries like Venezuela don't ever come back or we're going to kill you. Do you know that crime in Venezuela and crime in countries all over the world is way down? You know why? Because they've taken their criminals off the street and they've given them to her to put into our country. And this will be one of the greatest mistakes in history for them to allow -- and I think they probably did it because they think they're going to get votes. But it's not worth it. Because they're destroying the fabric of our country by what they've done. There's never been anything done like this at all. They've destroyed the fabric of our country. Millions of people let in. And all over the world crime is down. All over the world except here. Crime here is up and through the roof. Despite their fraudulent statements that they made. Crime in this country is through the roof. And we have a new form of crime. It's called migrant crime. And it's happening at levels that nobody thought possible.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country, but Vice President the...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: use me, the FBI -- they were defrauding statements. They didn't include the worst cities. They didn't include the cities with the worst crime. It was a fraud. Just like their number of 818,000 jobs that they said they created turned out to be a fraud.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. I'll let you respond, Vice President Harris.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, I think this is so rich. Coming from someone who has been prosecuted for national security crimes, economic crimes, election interference, has been found liable for sexual assault and his next big court appearance is in November at his own criminal sentencing. And let's be clear where each person stands on the issue of what is important about respect for the rule of law and respect for law enforcement. The former vice president called for defunding, federal law enforcement, 45,000 agents, get this, on the day after he was arraigned on 34 felony counts. So let's talk about what is important in this race. It is important that we move forward, that we turn the page on this same old tired rhetoric. And address the needs of the American people, address what we\n\nneed to do about the housing shortage, which I have a plan for. Address what we must do to support our small businesses. Address bringing down the price of groceries. But frankly, the American people are exhausted with the same old tired playbook.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. Every one of those cases was started by them against their political opponent. And I'm winning most of them and I'll win the rest on appeal. And you saw that with the decision that came down just recently from the Supreme Court. I'm winning most of them. But those are cases, it's called weaponization. Never happened in this country. They weaponized the justice department. Every one of those cases was involved with the DOJ, from Atlanta and Fani Willis -- to the attorney general of New York and the D.A. In New York. Every one of those cases. And then they say oh, he was -- he's a criminal. They're the ones that made them go after me. By the way, Joe Biden was found essentially guilty on the documents case. And what happened in my documents case? They said oh, that's the toughest of them all. A complete and total victory. Two months ago it was thrown out. It's weaponization. And they used it. And it's never happened in this country. They used it to try and win an election. They're fake cases.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. A really quick response here, Vice President Harris, on this notion of weaponization of the justice department.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well let's talk about extreme. And understand the context in which this election in 2024 is taking place. The United States Supreme Court recently ruled that the former president would essentially be immune from any misconduct if he were to enter the white house again. Understand, this is someone who has openly said he would terminate, I'm quoting, terminate the constitution of the United States. That he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. Someone who has openly expressed disdain for members of our military. Understand what it would mean if Donald Trump were back in the white house with no guardrails. Because certainly, we know now the court won't stop him. We know J.D. Vance is not going to stop him. It's up to the American people to stop him.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you. Linsey?\n\nLINDSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, in your last run for president...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This is the one that weaponized. Not me. She weaponized. I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me. They talk about democracy. I'm a threat to democracy. They're the threat to democracy – With the fake Russia Russia Russia investigation that went nowhere.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We have a lot to get to. Linsey?\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, in your last run for president you said you wanted to ban fracking. Now you don't. You wanted mandatory government buyback programs for assault weapons. Now your campaign says you don't. You supported decriminalizing border crossings. Now you're taking a harder line. I know you say that your values have not changed. So then why have so many of your policy positions changed?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So my values have not changed. And I'm going to discuss every one -- at least every point that you've made. But in particular, let's talk about fracking because we're here in Pennsylvania. I made that very clear in 2020. I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as Vice President of the United States. And, in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking. My position is that we have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil. We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil. As it relates to my values, let me tell you, I grew up a middle-class kid raised by a hard-working mother who worked and saved and was able to buy our first home when I was a teenager. The values I bring to the importance of home ownership knowing not everybody got handed $400 million on a silver platter and then filed bankruptcy six times, is a value that I bring to my work to say we are going to work with the private sector and home builders to increase 3 million homes, increase by 3 million homes by the end of my first term. My work that is related to having a friend when I was in high school who was sexually assaulted by her stepfather. And my focus then, on protecting women and children from violent crime, is based on a value that is deeply grounded in the importance of standing up for those who are most vulnerable. My work that is about protecting social security and Medicare is based on long-standing work that I have done. Protecting seniors from scams. My values have not changed. And what is important is that there is a president who actually brings values and a perspective that is about lifting people up and not beating people down and name-calling. The true measure of the leader is the leader who actually understands that strength is not in beating people down, it's in lifting people up. I intend to be that president.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, your response.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, I wasn't given $400 million. I wish I was. My father was a Brooklyn builder. Brooklyn, Queens. And a great father and I learned a lot from him. But I was given a fraction of that, a tiny fraction, and I built it into many, many billions of dollars. Many, many billions. And when people see it, they are even surprised. So, we don't have to talk about that. Fracking? She's been against it for 12 years. Uh, defund the police. She's been against that forever. She gave all that stuff up, very wrongly, very horribly. And everybody's laughing at it, okay? They're all laughing at it. She gave up at least 12 and probably 14 or 15 different policies. Like, she was big on defund the police.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: That’s not true. [mouthed, not audible]\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In Minnesota, she went out -- wait a minute. I'm talking now. If you don't mind. Please. Does that sound familiar?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Don’t lie. [lie is audible]\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She went out -- she went out in Minnesota and wanted to let criminals that killed people, that burned down Minneapolis, she went out and raised money to get them out of jail. She did things that nobody would ever think of. Now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison. This is a radical left liberal that would do this. She wants to confiscate your guns and she will never allow fracking in Pennsylvania. If she won the election, fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one. Just to finish one thing, so important in my opinion, so, I got the oil business going like nobody has ever done before. They took, when they took over, they got rid of it, started getting rid of it, and the prices were going up the roof. They immediately let these guys go to where they were. I would have been five times, four times, five times higher because you're talking about 3 1/2 years ago. They got it up to where I was because they had no choice. Because the prices of energy were quadrupling and doubling. You saw what happened to gasoline. So, they said let's go back to Trump. But if she won the election, the day after that election, they'll go back to destroying our country and oil will be dead, fossil fuel will be dead. We'll go back to windmills and we'll go back to solar, where they need a whole desert to get some energy to come out. You ever see a solar plant? By the way, I'm a big fan of solar. But they take 400, 500 acres of desert soil--\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These are not good things for the environment that she understands.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, we have a lot of issues that we have to get to. We're out of time. Thank you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Linsey, thank you. We have an election in just 56 days. I want to talk about the peaceful transfer of power, which of course we all know was a cornerstone of our democracy and the role of a president in a moment of crisis. Mr. President, on January 6th you told your supporters to march to the Capitol. You said you would be right there with them. The country and the world saw what played out at the Capitol that day. The officers coming under attack. Aides in the West Wing say you watched it unfold on television off the Oval Office. You did send out tweets, but it was more than two hours before you sent out that video message telling your supporters to go home. Is there anything you regret about what you did on that day?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You just said a thing that isn't covered. Peacefully and patriotically, I said during my speech. Not later on. Peacefully and patriotically. And nobody on the other side was killed. Ashli Babbitt was shot by an out-of-control police officer that should have never, ever shot her. It's a disgrace. But we didn't do -- this group of people that have been treated so badly. I ask, what about all the people that are pouring into our country and killing people? That she allowed to pour in. She was the border czar. Remember that. She was the border czar. She doesn't want to be called the border czar because she's embarrassed by the border. In fact, she said at the beginning, I'm surprised you're not talking about the border yet. That's because she knows what a bad job they've done. What about those people? What’s, when are they going to be prosecuted -- when are these people from countries all over the world, not just South America, they're coming in from all over the world, David, all over the world. And crime rates are down all over the world because of it --\n\nDAVID MUIR: But let me just ask you--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But when are those, David, when are those people going to be prosecuted? When are the people that burned down Minneapolis going to be prosecuted or in Seattle? They went into Seattle, they took over a big percentage of the city of Seattle. When are those people going to be prosecuted?\n\nDAVID MUIR: But let me just ask you--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You might ask her that question.\n\nDAVID MUIR: You were the president. You were watching it unfold on television. It's a very simple question as we move forward toward another election. Is there anything you regret about what you did on that day? Yes or no.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I had nothing to do with that other than they asked me to make a speech. I showed up for a speech. I said, I think it's going to be big. I went to Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington, D.C. And the mayor put it back in writing, as you know. I said, you know, this is going to be a very big rally or whatever you want to call it. And again, it wasn't done by me. It was done by others. I said I'd like to give you 10,000 National Guard or soldiers. They rejected me. Nancy Pelosi rejected me. It was just two weeks ago, her daughter has a tape of her saying she is fully responsible for what happened. They want to get rid of that tape. It would have never happened if Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington did their jobs. I wasn't responsible for security. Nancy Pelosi was responsible. She didn't do her job.\n\nDAVID MUIR: The question was about you as president, not about Former Speaker Pelosi. But I do want Vice President Harris to respond here.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I was at the Capitol on January 6th. I was the Vice President-Elect. I was also an acting senator. I was there. And on that day, the president of the United States incited a violent mob to attack our nation's Capitol, to desecrate our nation's Capitol. On that day, 140 law enforcement officers were injured. And some died. And understand, the former president has been indicted and impeached for exactly that reason. But this is not an isolated situation. Let's remember Charlottesville, where there was a mob of people carrying tiki torches, spewing antisemitic hate, and what did the president then at the time say? There were fine people on each side. Let's remember that when it came to the Proud Boys, a militia, the president said, the former president said, \"Stand back and stand by.\" So for everyone watching who remembers what January 6th was, I say we don't have to go back. Let's not go back. We're not going back. It's time to turn the page. And if that was a bridge too far for you, well, there is a place in our campaign for you. To stand for country. To stand for our democracy. To stand for rule of law. And to end the chaos. And to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our democracy ‘cause you don't like the outcome. And be clear on that point. Donald Trump the candidate has said in this election there will be a bloodbath, if this -- and the outcome of this election is not to his liking. Let's turn the page on this. Let's not go back. Let's chart a course for the future and not go backwards to the past.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let me just follow up here--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have said blood bash, bath. It was a different term, and it was a term that related to energy, because they have destroyed our energy business. That was where bloodbath was. Also, on Charlottesville, that story has been as you would say, debunked. Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity, Jesse -- all of these people, they covered it. If they go an extra sentence, they will see it was perfect. It was debunked in almost every newspaper. But they still bring it up just like they bring 2025 up. They bring all of this stuff up. I ask you this. You talk about the Capitol. Why are we allowing these millions of people to come through on the southern border? How come she's not doing -- and I'll tell you what I would do. And I would be very proud to do it. I would say we would both leave this debate right now, I'd like to see her go down to Washington, D.C. during this debate ‘cause we're wasting a lot of time. Go down to -- because she's been so bad, it's so ridiculous. Go down to Washington, D.C. And let her sign a bill to close up the border. Because they have the right to do it. They don't need bills. They have the right to do it. The President of the United States, you'll get him out of bed. You'll wake him up at 4:00 in the afternoon, you'll say come on. Come on down to the office, let's sign a bill. If he ... if he signs a bill that the border is closed, all he has to do is say it to the border patrol, who are phenomenal. If they do that, the border is closed.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Those people are killing many people, unlike J-6.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We talked immigration here tonight. I do want to focus on this next issue to both of you. Because it really brings us, this into focus. Truth in these times that we're living in. Mr. President, for 3 and a half years after you lost the 2020 election you repeatedly falsely claimed that you won, many times saying you won in a landslide. In the past couple of weeks leading up to this debate, you have said, quote, you lost by a whisker, that you, quote, didn't quite make it, that you came up a little bit short.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I said that?\n\nDAVID MUIR: Are you now acknowledging that you lost in 2020?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I don't acknowledge that at all.\n\nDAVID MUIR: But you did say that.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I said that sarcastically. You know that. It was said, oh we lost by a whisker. That was said sarcastically. Look, there's so much proof. All you have to do is look at it. And they should have sent it back to the legislatures for approval. I got almost 75 million votes. The most votes any sitting president has ever gotten. I was told if I got 63, which was what I got in 2016, you can't be beaten. The election, people should never be thinking about an election as fraudulent. We need two things. We need walls. We need -- and we have to have it. We have to have borders. And we have to have good elections.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our elections are bad. And a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they're trying to get them to vote. They can't even speak English. They don't even know what country they're in practically. And these people are trying to get them to vote. And that's why they're allowing them to come into our country.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I did watch all of these pieces of video. I didn't detect the sarcasm, lost by a whisker, we didn't quite make it, and we should just point out as clarification, and you know this, you and your allies, 60 cases in front of many judges. Many of them --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No judge looked at it.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And said there was no widespread fraud.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They said we didn't have standing. That's the other thing. They said we didn't have standing. A technicality. Can you imagine a system where a person in an election doesn't have standing, the President of the United States doesn't have standing? That's how we lost. If you look at the facts, and I'd love to have you -- you'll do a special on it. I'll show you Georgia and I'll show you Wisconsin and I'll show you Pennsylvania and I'll show you -- we have so many facts and statistics. But you know what? That doesn't matter. Because we have to solve the problem that we have right now. That's old news. And the problem that we have right now is we have a nation in decline and they have put it into decline. We have a nation that is dying, David.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President, thank you. Vice President Harris, you heard the president there tonight. He said he didn't say that he lost by a whisker. So he still believes he did not lose the election. That was won by President Biden and yourself. But I do want to ask you about something that's come up in the last couple of days. This was a post from President Trump about this upcoming election just weeks away. He said, \"When I win, those people who cheated,\" and then he lists donors, voters, election officials, he says \"Will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, which will include long-term prison sentences.\" One of your campaign's top lawyers responded saying, \"We won't let Donald Trump intimidate us. We won't let him suppress the vote.\" Is that what you believe he's trying to do here?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people. So, let's be clear about that. And clearly, he is having a very difficult time processing that. But we cannot afford to have a president of the United States who attempts as he did in the past to upend the will of the voters in a free and fair election. And I'm going to tell you that I have traveled the world as vice president of the United States. And world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump. I have talked with military leaders, some of whom worked with you. And they say you're a disgrace. And when you then talk in this way in a presidential debate and deny what over and over again are court cases you have lost, because you did in fact lose that election, it leads one to believe that perhaps we do not have in the candidate to my right the temperament or the ability to not be confused about fact. That's deeply troubling. And the American people deserve better.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I'll give you one minute to respond, Mr. President.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let me just tell you about world leaders. Viktor Orban, one of the most respected men -- they call him a strong man. He's a tough person. Smart. Prime Minister of Hungary. They said why is the whole world blowing up? Three years ago it wasn't. Why is it blowing up? He said because you need Trump back as president. They were afraid of him. China was afraid. And I don't like to use the word afraid but I'm just quoting him. China was afraid of him. North Korea was afraid of him. Look at what's going on with North Korea, by the way. He said Russia was afraid of him. I ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and Biden put it back on day one but he ended the XL pipeline. The XL pipeline in our country. He ended that. But he let the Russians build a pipeline going all over Europe and heading into Germany. The biggest pipeline in the world. Look, Viktor Orban said it. He said the most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was president. But when this weak pathetic man that you saw at a debate just a few months ago that if he weren't in that debate he'd be running instead of her, she got no votes, he got 14 million votes, what you did, you talk about a threat to democracy. He got 14 million votes and they threw him out of office. And you know what? I'll give you a little secret. He hates her. He can't stand her.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP: But he had 14 million votes. They threw them out. She got zero votes. And when she ran, she was the first one to leave because she failed. And now she's running. I don't understand it but I'm okay with it – because I think we’re going to do pretty well.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President, your time is up. We've got a lot more to get to.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Turning now to the Israel-Hamas war and the hostages who are still being held, Americans among them. Vice President Harris, in December you said, \"Israel has a right to defend itself\" but you added, \"It matters how.\" Saying international humanitarian law must be respected, Israel must do more to protect innocent civilians. You said that nine months ago. Now an estimated 40,000 Palestinians are dead. Nearly 100 hostages remain. Just last week Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there's not a deal in the making. President Biden has not been able to break through the stalemate. How would you do it?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, let's understand how we got here. On Oct. 7, Hamas, a terrorist organization, slaughtered 1,200 Israelis. Many of them young people who were simply attending a concert. Women were horribly raped. And so absolutely, I said then, I say now, Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Because it is also true far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Children, mothers. What we know is that this war must end. It must when, end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal and we need the hostages out. And so we will continue to work around the clock on that. Work around the clock also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution. And in that solution, there must be security for the Israeli people and Israel and in equal measure for the Palestinians. But the one thing I will assure you always, I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel. But we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination and the dignity they so rightly deserve.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, how would you negotiate with Netanyahu and also Hamas in order to get the hostages out and prevent the killing of more innocent civilians in Gaza?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I were president it would have never started. If I were president Russia would have never, ever -- I know Putin very well. He would have never -- and there was no threat of it either, by the way, for four years. Have gone into Ukraine and killed millions of people when you add it up. Far worse than people understand what's going on over there. But when she mentions about Israel all of a sudden -- she hates Israel. She wouldn't even meet with Netanyahu when he went to Congress to make a very important speech. She refused to be there because she was at a sorority party of hers. She wanted to go to the sorority party. She hates Israel. If she's president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now. And I've been pretty good at predictions. And I hope I'm wrong about that one. She hates Israel. At the same time in her own way she hates the Arab population because the whole place is going to get blown up, Arabs, Jewish people, Israel. Israel will be gone. It would have never happened. Iran was broke under Donald Trump. Now Iran has $300 billion because they took off all the sanctions that I had. Iran had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah or any of the 28 different spheres of terror. And they are spheres of terror. Horrible terror. They had no money. It was a big story, and you know it. You covered it. Very well, actually. They had no money for terror. They were broke. Now they're a rich nation. And now what they're doing is spreading that money around. Look at what's happening with the Houthis and Yemen. Look at what's going on in the Middle East. This would have never happened. I will get that settled and fast. And I'll get the war with Ukraine and Russia ended. If I'm President-Elect, I'll get it done before even becoming president.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, he says you hate Israel.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: That's absolutely not true. I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people. He knows that. He's trying to again divide and distract from the reality, which is it is very well known that Donald Trump is weak and wrong on national security and foreign policy. It is well known that he admires dictators, wants to be a dictator on day one according to himself. It is well known that he said of Putin that he can do whatever the hell he wants and go into Ukraine. It is well known when that he said when Russia went into Ukraine it was brilliant. It is well known he exchanged love letters with Kim Jong un. And it is absolutely well known that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again because they're so clear, they can manipulate you with flattery and favors. And that is why so many military leaders who you have worked with have told me you are a disgrace. That is why we understand that we have to have a president who is not consistently weak and wrong on national security including the importance of upholding and respecting in highest regard our military.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They're the ones -- and she's the one that caused it, that's weak on national security by allowing every nation last month for the year, 168 different countries sending people into our country. Their crime rates are way down. Putin endorsed her last week. Said I hope she wins. And I think he meant it. Because what he's gotten away with is absolutely incredible. It wouldn't have happened with me. The leaders of other countries think that they're weak and incompetent. And they are. They're grossly incompetent. And I just ask one question. Why does Biden go in and kill the Keystone pipeline and approve the single biggest deal that Russia's ever made, Nordstream 2, the biggest pipeline anywhere in the world going to Germany and all over Europe? Because they're weak and they're ineffective. And Biden, by the way --\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Gets paid a lot of money --\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Thank you. We have a lot of issues to get to.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We'll be right back with much more of this historic ABC News presidential debate from the National Constitution Center right here in Philadelphia. Back in a moment.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And I want to turn to the war in Ukraine. We're now 2 1/2 years into this conflict. Mr. President, it has been the position of the Biden administration that we must defend Ukraine from Russia, from Vladimir Putin, to defend their sovereignty, their democracy, that it's in America's best interest to do so, arguing that if Putin wins he may be emboldened to move even further into other countries. You have said you would solve this war in 24 hours. You said so just before the break tonight. How exactly would you do that? And I want to ask you a very simple question tonight. Do you want Ukraine to win this war?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I want the war to stop. I want to save lives that are being uselessly -- people being killed by the millions. It's the millions. It's so much worse than the numbers that you're getting, which are fake numbers. Look, we're in for 250 billion or more because they don't ask Europe, which is a much bigger beneficiary to getting this thing done than we are. They're in for $150 billion less because Biden and you don't have the courage to ask Europe like I did with nato. They paid billions and billions, hundreds of billions of dollars when I said either you pay up or we're not going to protect you anymore. So that may be one of the reasons they don't like me as much as they like weak people. But you take a look at what's happening. We're in for 250 to 275 billion. They're into 100 to 150. They should be forced to equalize. With that being said, I want to get the war settled. I know Zelenskyy very well and I know Putin very well. I have a good relationship. And they respect your president. Okay? They respect me. They don't respect Biden. How would you respect him? Why? For what reason? He hasn't even made a phone call in two years to Putin. Hasn't spoken to anybody. They don't even try and get it. That is a war that's dying to be settled. I will get it settled before I even become president. If I win, when I'm President-Elect, and what I'll do is I'll speak to one, I'll speak to the other, I'll get them together. That war would have never happened. And in fact when I saw Putin after I left, unfortunately left because our country has gone to hell, but after I left when I saw him building up soldiers, he did it after I left, I said oh, he must be negotiating. It must be a good strong point of negotiation. Well, it wasn't because Biden had no idea how to talk to him. He had no idea how to stop it. And now you have millions of people dead and it's only getting worse and it could lead to World War 3. Don't kid yourself, David. We're playing with World War 3. And we have a president that we don't even know if he's -- where is our president? We don't even know if he's a president.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And just to clarify here.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They threw him out of a campaign like a dog. We don't even know, is he our president? But we have a president...\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President,\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: ...that doesn't know he's alive.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Your time is up. Just to clarify the question, do you believe it's in the U.S. best interests for Ukraine to win this war? Yes or no?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think it's in the U.S. best interest to get this war finished and just get it done. All right. Negotiate a deal. Because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I want to take this to Vice President Harris. I want to get your thoughts on support for Ukraine in this moment. But also as commander in chief if elected how would you deal with Vladimir Putin and would it be any different from what we're seeing from President Biden?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, first of all, it's important to remind the former president you're not running against Joe Biden, you're running against me. I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up. And that's not who we are as Americans. Let's understand what happened here. I actually met with Zelenskyy a few days before Russia invaded, tried through force to change territorial boundaries to defy one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity. And I met with President Zelenskyy. I shared with him American intelligence about how he could defend himself. Days later I went to NATO's eastern flank, to Poland and Romania. And through the work that I and others did we brought 50 countries together to support Ukraine in its righteous defense. And because of our support, because of the air defense, the ammunition, the artillery, the javelins, the Abrams tanks that we have provided, Ukraine stands as an independent and free country. If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. And understand what that would mean. Because Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine. Understand why the European allies and our NATO allies are so thankful that you are no longer president and that we understand the importance of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known, which is NATO. And what we have done to preserve the ability of Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians to fight for their Independence. Otherwise, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe. Starting with Poland. And why don't you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris Thank you. We heard from both of you on Ukraine tonight. Afghanistan came up in the last hour -- I wanted her to respond to something you said earlier.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have to respond.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Please I'll give you a minute here.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Putin would be sitting in Moscow and he wouldn't have lost 300,000 men and women. But he would have been sitting in Moscow\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: (inaudible)\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Quiet, please. He would have been sitting in Moscow much happier than he is right now. But eventually, you know, he's got a thing that other people don't have. He's got nuclear weapons. They don't ever talk about that. He's got nuclear weapons. Nobody ever thinks about that. And eventually uh maybe he'll use them. Maybe he hasn't been that threatening. But he does have that. Something we don't even like to talk about. Nobody likes to talk about it. But just so you understand, they sent her to negotiate peace before this war started. Three days later he went in and he started the war because everything they said was weak and stupid. They said the wrong things. That war should have never started. She was the emissary. They sent her in to negotiate with Zelenskyy and Putin. And she did and the war started three days later.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And that's the kind of talent we have with her. She's worse than Biden. In my opinion, I think he's the worst president in the history of our country. She goes down as the worst vice president in the history of our country. But let me tell you something. She is a horrible negotiator. They sent her in to negotiate. As soon as they left Putin did the invasion.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. You did bring up something, you said she went to negotiate with Vladimir Putin. Vice President Harris, have you ever met Vladimir Putin, can you clarify tonight?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Yet again, I said it at the beginning of this debate, you're going to hear a bunch of lies coming from this fella. And that is another one. When I went to meet with President Zelenskyy, I've now met with him over five times. The reality is, it has been about standing as America always should, as a leader upholding international rules and norms. As a leader who shows strength, understanding that the alliances we have around the world are dependent on our ability to look out for our friends and not favor our enemies because you adore strongmen instead of caring about democracy. And that is very much what is at stake here. The President of the United States is commander-in-chief. And the American people have a right to rely on a president who understands the significance of America's role and responsibility in terms of ensuring that there is stability and ensuring we stand up for our principles and not sell them for the benefit of personal flattery.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We've talked about Ukraine and Vladimir Putin. I do want to talk about Afghanistan. It came up in the first hour of this debate.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: David, one thing.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I want to move on to Afghanistan.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Secretary General Stoltenberg said Trump did the most amazing thing I've ever seen, he got these countries, the 28 countries at the time, to pay up. He said I've never seen -- he's the head of NATO. He said I've never seen -- for years we were paying almost all of NATO. We were being ripped off by European nations both on trade and on NATO. I got them to pay up by saying one of the statements you made before, if you don't pay we're not going to protect you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Otherwise we would've never gotten it. He said it was one of the most incredible jobs that he's ever seen done.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Thank you. I want to turn to Afghanistan. We witnessed a poignant moment today on Capitol Hill honoring the soldiers who died in the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. I do want to ask the vice president, do you believe you bear any responsibility in the way that withdrawal played out?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, I will tell you, I agreed with President Biden's decision to pull out of Afghanistan. Four presidents said they would, and Joe Biden did. And as a result, America's taxpayers are not paying the $300 million a day we were paying for that endless war. And as of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century. But let's understand how we got to where we are. Donald Trump when he was president negotiated one of the weakest deals you can imagine. He calls himself a dealmaker. Even his national security adviser said it was a weak, terrible deal. And here's how it went down. He bypassed the Afghan government. He negotiated directly with a terrorist organization called the Taliban. The negotiation involved the Taliban getting 5,000 terrorists, Taliban terrorists released.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: And get this -- no, get this. And the president at the time invited the Taliban to Camp David. A place of storied significance for us as Americans, a place where we honor the importance of American diplomacy, where we invite and receive respected world leaders. And this former president as president invited them to Camp David because he does not again appreciate the role and responsibility of the President of the United States to be commander in chief with a level of respect. And this gets back to the point of how he has consistently disparaged and demeaned members of our military, fallen soldiers, and the work that we must do to uphold the strength and the respect of the United States of America around the world.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you. President Trump, your response to her saying that you began the negotiations with the Taliban.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, thank you. So if you take a look at that period of time, the Taliban was killing our soldiers, a lot of them, with snipers. And I got involved with the Taliban because the Taliban was doing the killing. That's the fighting force within Afghanistan. They don't bother doing that because you know, they deal with the wrong people all the time. But I got involved. And Abdul is the head of the Taliban. He is still the head of the Taliban. And I told Abdul don't do it anymore, you do it anymore you're going to have problems. And he said why do you send me a picture of my house? I said you're going to have to figure that out, Abdul. And for 18 months we had nobody killed. We did have an agreement negotiated by Mike Pompeo. It was a very good agreement. The reason it was good, it was -- we were getting out. We would have been out faster than them, but we wouldn't have lost the soldiers. We wouldn't have left many Americans behind. And we wouldn't have left -- we wouldn't have left $85 billion worth of brand new beautiful military equipment behind. And just to finish, they blew it. The agreement said you have to do this, this, this, this, this, and they didn't do it. They didn't do it. The agreement was, was terminated by us because they didn't do what they were supposed to do.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I want to move on.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And these people did the worst withdrawal and in my opinion the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. And by the way, that's why Russia attacked Ukraine. Because they saw how incompetent she and her boss are.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. I want to move on now to race and politics in this country. Mr. President, you recently said of Vice President Harris, \"I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.\" I want to ask a bigger-picture question here tonight. Why do you believe it's appropriate to weigh in on the racial identity of your opponent?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't. And I don't care. I don't care what she is. I don't care. You make a big deal out of something. I couldn't care less. Whatever she wants to be is okay with me.\n\nDAVID MUIR: But those were your words. So, I'm asking --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. I don't know. All I can say is I read where she was not Black, that she put out. And, I'll say that. And then I read that she was black. And that's okay. Either one was okay with me. That's up to her. That's up to her.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, your thoughts on this?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I think it's – I mean honestly, I think it's a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people. You know, I do believe that the vast majority of us know that we have so much more in common than what separates us. And we don't want this kind of approach that is just constantly trying to divide us, and especially by race. And let's remember how Donald Trump started. He was a, a, a—land, he owned land, he owned buildings, and he was investigated because he refused to rent property to Black families. Let's remember, this is the same individual who took out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the execution of five young Black and Latino boys who were innocent, the Central Park Five. Took out a full-page ad calling for their execution. This is the same individual who spread birther lies about the first Black President of the United States. And I think the American people want better than that. Want better than this. Want someone who understands as I do, I travel our country, we see in each other a friend. We see in each other a neighbor. We don't want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other. I meet with people all the time who tell me \"Can we please just have discourse about how we're going to invest in the aspirations and the ambitions and the dreams of the American people?\" Knowing that regardless of people's color or the language their grandmother speaks we all have the same dreams and aspirations and want a president who invests in those, not in hate and division.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris thank you. Linsey?\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, this is now your third time --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP: This is the most divisive presidency in the history of our country. There's never been anything like it. They're destroying our country. And they come up with things like what she just said going back many, many years when a lot of people including Mayor Bloomberg agreed with me on the Central Park Five. They admitted -- they said, they pled guilty. And I said, \"Well if they pled guilty they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately. And if they pled guilty -- then they pled we're not guilty.\" But this is a person that has to stretch back years, 40, 50 years ago because there's nothing now. I built one of the greatest economies in the history of the world and I'm going to build it again. It's going to be bigger, better, and stronger. But they're destroying our economy. They have no idea what a good economy is. Their oil policies -- every single policy -- and remember this. She is Biden. She's trying to get away from Biden. I don't know the gentleman, she says. She is Biden. The worst inflation we've ever had. A horrible economy because inflation has made it so bad – and she can't get away with that.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President, thank you, your time is up. Linsey ..\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I want to respond to that, though. I want to just respond briefly. Clearly, I am not Joe Biden, and I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country. One who believes in what is possible, one who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do instead of always disparaging the American people. I believe in what we can do to strengthen our small businesses, which is why I have a plan. Let's talk about our plans. And let's compare the plans. I have a plan to give startup businesses $50,000 tax deduction, to pursue their ambitions, their innovation, their ideas, their hard work. I have a plan. $6,000 for young families for the first year of your child's life. To help you in that most critical stage of your child's development. I have a plan that is about allowing people to be able to pursue what has been fleeting in terms of the American dream by offering a ... help with down payment of $25,000, down payment assistance for first-time home buyers. That's the kind of conversation I believe, David, that people really want tonight as opposed to a conversation that is constantly about belittling and name-calling. Let's turn the page and move forward.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you. Let's turn to policy – let's turn to policy\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump we have to move on.

They walked through their proposals − and criticized their opponent − all while trying to win over pivotal swing voters who could ultimately decide the election.\n\nWhile Trump and Harris went back and forth on the issues, they also took personal jabs. Harris zeroed in on the crowd sizes at Trump's rallies, and the former president joked that he was going to send the vice president one of his well-known red hats based on her current stances.\n\nCatch up with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage of the Trump-Harris debate.\n\nWhat's true?

Harris' aggressive performance rattles a defensive Trump.\n\nDonald Trump knocked Joe Biden out of the 2024 presidential race in the last debate, but the Republican found himself repeatedly knocked on his heels Tuesday night when squaring off against his new opponent: Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump was on the defensive over his legal problems, election denialism, opposition from former allies and incitement of an attack on the U.S. Capitol. Even his beloved rallies become debate fodder, with Harris mocking them as full of odd digressions and so boring his supporters often leave early.\n\nHarris came in trying to rattle and bait Trump, and often succeeded, leading to defensive, angry and rambling responses as the vice president had the upper hand throughout much of the contest. Trump repeatedly turned to immigration, his signature issue, but struggled to sustain a consistent line of attack and often leaned on familiar and false claims that drew corrections from the moderators.\n\n− Zac Anderson\n\nTaylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris for president: 'She is a steady-handed, gifted leader'\n\nTaylor Swift is endorsing Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election, the pop star revealed Tuesday night following the presidential debate between Harris and former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn an Instagram post shared following the debate, Swift wrote in a caption of a photo of her with her cat that she \"will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\"\n\n\"Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country,\" Swift wrote.\n\n− Anika Reed and Bryan West\n\nTrump's closing statement: 'Why hasn't she done it?'\n\nTrump, who got to go last because he won a coin flip before the debate, used his closing statement to attack Harris for not already accomplishing her goals during the three-and-a-half years of the Biden-Harris administration.\n\n\"Why hasn't she done it?\" Trump said at one point.\n\nHe continued in a negative vein, saying the U.S. is \"a failing nation\" that is in \"decline\" because of Biden and Harris.He didn't delve deeply into his own policy proposals.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nWill there be a second Trump-Harris debate? Harris campaign calls for second showdown\n\nIt's not clear whether Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will debate again, but the vice president's campaign called for a second debate against Trump moments after Tuesday's showdown ended.\n\n“Under the bright lights, the American people got to see the choice they will face this fall at the ballot box: between moving forward with Kamala Harris, or going backwards with Trump. That’s what they saw tonight and what they should see at a second debate in October. Vice President Harris is ready for a second debate. Is Donald Trump?” Harris-Walz Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement.\n\n− Rebecca Morin and Marina Pitofsky\n\nHarris’ closing message: I’ll be a president for all Americans\n\nHarris’ final message to viewers of the debate: we can chart “a new way forward” for the country together. In her closing remarks, Harris argued that she is focused on the future, and Trump is focused on the past.\n\nHer vision for the country includes an economy that helps families, small businesses, seniors and working-class Americans, Harris said. Harris added that she would protect Americans' rights and freedoms and be a president for everyone, regardless of their political affiliation.\n\n“And that’s the kind of president we need right now. Someone who cares about you and is not putting themselves first,” Harris said.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris to Trump: 'Clearly, I’m not Joe Biden'\n\nTrump sought to drag down Harris by arguing that she and President Joe Biden are one in the same.\n\n“She is Biden,” he said. “She’s trying to get away from Biden. I don’t know the gentleman, she says.”\n\nHarris has never claimed that she does not know Biden. But she stressed in a rebuttal that they have different approaches. “Clearly I am not Joe Biden. And I am certainly not Donald Trump.\n\n“And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country, one who believes in what is possible, one who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do, instead of always disparaging the American people,” she said, turning to Trump.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump pressed on his comments about Harris' biracial identity\n\nWhen questioned about why he thought it was appropriate to question Harris' biracial identity, Trump said he doesn't care.\n\n\"I don't care. You make a big deal out of something, I couldn't care less. Whatever she wants to be is okay with me.\"\n\nThe former president's July appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists' convention sparked backlash after he accused Harris of becoming Black after he claimed she had only identified as Indian-American up until recently. Harris' father is Black and her mother was Indian-American.\n\n\"I mean all I can say is, I read when she was not Black, that she put out, and, I'll say that, and then I read that she was Black, and that's okay, either one was okay with me,\" he said. \"That's up to her, that's up to her.\" In response, Harris called Trump's comments a \"tragedy.\"\n\n− Sam Woodward\n\nKamala Harris says she's a gun owner\n\nAfter Donald Trump criticized Kamala Harris' stance on gun control, she noted that she and her running mate, Tim Walz, are both gun owners.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump and Harris argue about Afghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump sought to tag Harris with the botched 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, during which 13 American service members were killed in a bombing.\n\n\"They never fired one person,\" Trump said, calling it \"the most embarrassing moment\" in the nation's history.\n\nHarris wasn't having it, saying the problems with the withdrawal resulted from a weak deal with the Taliban negotiated by President Donald Trump.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nTrump says Harris 'hates Israel'; VP says it’s 'not true'\n\nHarris said the war between Israel and Hamas “must end immediately” with a cease-fire deal and hostage release. She recommitted to giving Israel the ability to defend itself – especially from Iran – but she said there must be a solution that establishes an independent Palestinian state.\n\nTrump insisted that if he were president, Hamas would not have launched a vicious attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\n“She hates Israel,” Trump charged.\n\nHe knocked Harris for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to Congress over the summer to deliver a speech to a historically Black sorority. He repeated a claim\n\n“At the same time, in her own way, she hates the Arab population,” he added, “because the whole place is going to get blown up. Arabs, Jewish people, Israel, Israel will be gone.” Harris said “that’s absolutely not true” and that Trump is “trying to divide and distract” from his “weak and wrong” on national security and foreign policy.\n\n“It is well known that he admires dictators, wants to be a dictator on day one,” she said, hammering Trump for a comment he made about Russian President Vladimir Putin doing “whatever the hell” he wants in Ukraine.\n\nTrump fired back that Putin wants Harris to win the election.\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris to disaffected Republicans: There's a place for you in our campaign\n\nHarris leaned into her background as a prosecutor to establish a pattern of behavior from Trump that she hopes will win over disaffected Republicans.\n\nJanuary 6 was “not an isolated” incident, she said. His statement that there were “very fine people” on both sides of a clash with white supremacists in Charlottesville and a directive to the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by,” preceded the Capitol riot.\n\n“If that was a bridge too far for you, well there is a place in our campaign for you, to stand for country, to stand for our democracy, to stand for rule of law, and to end the chaos and to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our democracy, because you don’t like the outcome,” Harris said.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris says ‘world leaders are laughing’ at Trump; Trump references Viktor Orbán\n\nFollowing Trump’s false claim that the 2020 election was corrupt, Harris said leaders across the world are “laughing” at the former president.\n\n“I'm going to tell you that I have traveled the world as vice president of the United States and world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump,” she said. “I have talked with military leaders, some of whom work with you, and they say you are a disgrace.”\n\nTrump pushed back on Harris’ claim, saying that Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orbán said the United States’ “need Trump back as president.”\n\n“Viktor Orbán said, he said, ‘the most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was president,’” Trump said, calling Biden a “weak, pathetic man.”\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump uses the term 'we' when discussing Jan. 6 rioters\n\nTrump said he had nothing to do with the violence perpetrated by the insurrectionist rioters of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHe may have undercut his case when he used the term \"we\" while talking about the events surrounding the attack on the Capitol.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nTrump insists he 'won' in 2020 (despite past comments to the contrary)\n\nTrump insisted he still believes he \"won\" the 2020 election, even though he said in recent days that he lost by a \"whisker\" because of voter turnout. Trump's explanation for the \"whisker\" comment: \"That was said sarcastically.\"\n\nHarris, meanwhile, said there is not doubt he lost: \"Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people.\"\n\n−David Jackson\n\nHarris harnesses prosecutor vs. felon rhetoric\n\nWhen answering a question about immigration rates and crime, Harris took a dig at Trump's own criminal record.\n\n\"I think this is so rich coming from someone who has been prosecuted for national security crimes, economic crimes, election interference, has been found liable for sexual assault, and his next big court appearance is in November at his own criminal sentencing,\" Harris said.\n\nLast week, New York Judge Juan Merchan granted Trump's request for a delay in his sentencing for his 34 felony convictions regarding hush money payments paid to former porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\n\"The former vice president called for defunding federal law enforcement, 45,000 agents, get this, on the day after he was arraigned for 34 felony counts,\" she said.\n\n− Sam Woodward\n\n'Does that sound familiar?'\n\nBoth candidates are getting their pre-planned zingers. When Harris started to interrupt Trump, he shot back \"I'm talking now\" - similar to the line she used on Mike Pence in the 2020 vice presidential debate.\n\n\"Does that sound familiar?\" Trump said to Harris.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, has twice said that voters are sick of Trump's \"tired, old playbook.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nTrump falsely claims he was prosecuted by Democrats, efforts fueled assassination attempt\n\nTrump on Tuesday falsely said Harris was involved in the four criminal cases against him. There is no evidence Harris had involvement in the charges the former president faces.\n\nTrump also claimed that he \"probably took a bullet to the heat\" due to Democratic lies about him. There is no evidence the man who attempted to assassinate Trump was motivated by his criminal cases.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nHarris claims no flip-flop on fracking\n\nHarris said she made it clear in 2020 that she does not support banning fracking.\n\n“I have not banned fracking as Vice President of the United States, and in fact, I was the tie breaking vote on the inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking,” Harris said.\n\nIn 2019 when she was first running for president, Harris said she was in favor of banning fracking, as well as sponsored the Green New Deal as Senator. But in the 2024 election, Harris’ campaign has said she is no longer in favor.\n\nHarris said at the debate that her position is to invest in diverse sources of energy and reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil: “We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil,” Harris said.\n\n−Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump makes false comments about people eating dogs and cats\n\nTrump on Tuesday mentioned a false claim that there have been reports of immigrants eating dogs and cats in Springfield, Ohio. There are no credible reports of that happening.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nHarris: A lot of Republicans prefer me over Trump\n\nHarris seized the opportunity to talk about all the Republicans who have condemned him and endorsed her, a list that runs from former Vice President Dick Cheney to members of the Trump administration.\n\nShe said people who know Trump the best don't like him.\n\nTrump did not respond about Cheney; as for his former aides, he said: \"I fired most of those people.\"\n\n−David Jackson\n\nHarris hits Trump's rallies\n\nKamala Harris set out to get under Donald Trump’s skin. It appeared to work. Harris mocked Trump’s references at his rallies to Hannibal Lector and his false claims that windmills cause cancer.\n\nThen she went in for the kill. “And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom,” Harris said. Moderator David Muir sought to steer the conversation back to policy. Trump wasn’t having it.\n\n“I’d like to respond,” Trump said. “First let me respond, as to the rallies,” he insisted. “She said people start leaving. People don’t go to her rallies. There’s no reason to go.”\n\nHe claimed without evidence that Harris is busing in attendees of her rallies and paying them to be here.\n\n“People don’t leave my rallies,” he continued.” We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics.”\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris criticizes Trump for role in killing bipartisan immigration bill\n\nWhen asked why the Biden administration waited six months before the election to bring down border crossings at the U.S-Mexico border, Harris pointed the finger to Trump.\n\nHarris said Trump killed a bipartisan immigration bill that would have put 1,500 more border agents and resources to the border.\n\n“Donald Trump got on the phone, called up some folks in Congress and said, ‘kill the bill,’” Harris said. “And you know why? Because he preferred a run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.”\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nAre the mics muted? Not always\n\nIt doesn't sound like the other candidate's microphone is being muted, at least not all the time.\n\nBoth Trump and Harris could be heard arguing with each other on the abortion issue.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nTrump brags about overturning Roe v. Wade\n\nTrump’s recent contortions on the abortion issue were addressed early in the debate, with the moderators asking about his position on Florida’s abortion rights ballot measure.\n\nTrump came out against the constitutional amendment a day after indicating he might support it. In explaining his position Tuesday, Trump said “the reason I’m doing that vote” and then alleged that Democrats want extreme late-term abortion policies, including “probably after birth.” The moderator interjected, noting no state allows a baby to be killed after birth.\n\nTrump bragged about overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision guaranteeing a constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nRoe v. Wade was overturned “through the genius and heart and strength of six Supreme Court justices,” he said.\n\n“I did a great service in doing it, it took courage to do it,” Trump said.\n\n−Zac Anderson\n\n'Insulting to the women of America'\n\nKamala Harris criticized Donald Trump for falsely claiming that there are states that allow people to give birth to children and then have an abortion, killing a child that has already been born.\n\nIt's \"insulting to the women of America,\" Harris said. She also said people do not have to abandon their \"faith and deeply held beliefs\" to support abortion access.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump denies that tariffs would spike costs for Americans\n\nDonald Trump denied Tuesday that his proposed tariffs on foreign countries would hit average Americans’ pocketbooks.\n\n“They’re not going to have higher prices,” Trump insisted, saying that it’s China that would pay more.\n\nHe had pledged to slap a tariff of at least 10% on imported goods. He said in August that he could increase the across the board rate to as much as 20%. Trump says he’ll put a 60% tariff on China, the United States’ largest economic competitor.\n\nHarris has repeatedly said that Trump’s plan is tantamount to a national sales tax on average Americans. At the debate, Trump said that if Harris “doesn’t like them” then she should have gotten rid of them, referring to the Biden administration’s decision to keep Trump’s previous tariffs on China in place.\n\n−Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump jabs Harris, says he almost bought her a MAGA hat\n\nTrump on Harris accused Harris of picking up some of his economic proposals, flip-flopping on approaches to inflation and other debates. He joked that he almost bought her one of one of his signature red Make America Great Again hat.\n\nHarris visibly laughed as Trump targeted her economic positions.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nHarris quickly links Trump to Project 2025\n\nHarris used the economy question to link Trump to Project 2025, an uber-conservative government plan filled with economic and social ideas opposed by many voters.\n\nTrump said he knows nothing about Project 2025 - even though many of its authors are former Trump administration officials.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHarris touts ‘opportunity economy’ plan, child tax credit\n\nKamala Harris kicked off the debate Tuesday on an issue that’s top of mind for voters: the economy.\n\nHarris touted her plan that would address housing costs and give a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses.\n\n“I was raised as a middle class kid, and I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America,” she said. “I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people, and that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy.”\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nHarris walks over to Trump, offers handshake\n\nVice President Kamala Harris walked over to former President Donald Trump and extended her hand as the only scheduled debate between the candidates began.\n\nHarris and Trump had never met before. He skipped her inauguration on his final morning at the White House.\n\nIn the election in which Trump has hurled personal insults at Harris, and Harris has characterized him as a threat to American democracy it was an unexpected and intentional sign of respect for the former president.\n\n−Francesca Chambers\n\nAttending and 'spinning' for Vice President Kamala Harris\n\nSeveral prominent Democrats are expected to attend the debate and boast about their presidential candidate Kamala Harris. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a list of several Democratic governors, senators and representatives who will be in the \"spin room\" addressing the media.\n\nThose include:\n\nPresident Joe Biden and running mate Tim Walz are not in Philadelphia for the debate.\n\n− Kinsey Crowley\n\nVibe-check: Dems in Atlanta are excited to feel excited again\n\nMore than 30 minutes before the debate, Manuels Tavern − the Democratic-leaning bar where former President Jimmy Carter announced his 1970 gubernatorial campaign − is packed with a standing room only crowd.\n\nMost in the bar say they feel a huge difference between this debate and the one between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nBlake Bradburn, 33, watched the last one from home out of fear. This time? He wasn’t going to miss the party.\n\n“The energy is back, that’s what makes this fun.”\n\n− Karissa Waddick\n\nHow to watch Trump, Harris debate\n\nABC News will host the debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Tuesday. However, multiple channels, including NBC and CNN, will broadcast the event as well.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nJD Vance, RFK Jr. will be spinning for Donald Trump at the debate\n\nTrump running mate JD Vance is in Philadelphia, part of a large group of debate \"spinners\" who will promote the former president's cause with the media. The Trump spinner list also includes Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the former independent candidate who dropped out and endorsed Trump.\n\nDaughter-in-law Lara Trump, a co-chair of the Republican National Committee, will also be spinning tonight.\n\nSo will at least ten more Republican governors and members of Congress.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhat is Project 2025?\n\nYou probably won't hear very much about policy documents during Tuesday's debate, but you're likely to hear about Project 2025.\n\nThe detailed plan to dismantle and reconstruct the government laid out by conservative groups known as the 2025 Presidential Transition Project has critics up in arms over its \"apocalyptic\" and \"authoritarian\" nature.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C., led an effort to create the more than 900-page \"Mandate for Leadership,\" published in April 2023, reimagining the executive branch and presented a plan to overhaul several federal government agencies, including the FBI, for the country's next conservative president to follow.\n\nMore:What is Project 2025?

She called the protest “a distraction from the real issues” and believes Trump can bring peace to Ukraine and Gaza.Her dog, Nelley, a cocker-poodle mix, was wearing a pro-Trump outfit.“She’s a Trumper, too,” Naulty said.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nPro-Palestinian protests swell to hundreds of people\n\nRabiul Chowdhury, a demonstrator in Philadelphia on Thursday, said Abandon Harris was officially launching Tuesday –an effort to force the Harris campaign to broker a cease-fire in Gaza or lose crucial votes in battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania.The Harris Campaign “doesn’t care about us,” said Chowdhury. The group is not advocating for Donald Trump, he added, and instead urging voters toward third party candidates like Jill Stein and Cornel West.Harris \"acts like we owe her our votes. “ he added. Asked if they worried about a Trump presidency, he said: “We can’t blame Trump for what Biden and Harris did.”\n\n– Phaedra Trethan\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz won't be present at debate\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz won't be in Philadelphia with his running mate, but will instead be campaigning in the Sun Belt on Tuesday night.\n\nThe VP nominee made his first solo visit to the crucial battleground state of Arizona Tuesday. He is set to speak at an event in Phoenix at 5:30 p.m. local time, just thirty minutes before Harris will take on Trump.\n\n– Sam Woodward\n\nInside Trump's and Harris' starkly different visions for the economy\n\nIf the economic visions of Joe Biden and Donald Trump were starkly divergent, the contrast between Trump and Kamala Harris is nearly blinding.\n\nTrump’s and Harris’ blueprints for the economy are expected to be spotlighted in their first and possibly only debate Tuesday evening, hosted by ABC News.\n\nWhat does Kamala Harris support?

Harris and Trump “are part of the same political class, and we need more voices of working people to demand what we deserve.”\n\n– Phaedra Trethan\n\nBiden isn't attending debate, says Harris is ‘going to do great’\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he spoke with a “calm” Vice President Kamala Harris hours ahead of the debate.\n\nSpeaking with reporters outside the White House, Biden said Harris seems “calm, cool and collected” in his call with the vice president.\n\n“I think she's going to do great. And I'm not going to tell you what advice I gave her,” Biden said.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\n7 things to watch at the Kamala Harris-Donald Trump debate\n\nKamala Harris and Donald Trump's showdown in Philadelphia on Tuesday will be a major test – and opportunity – in a presidential campaign that has already been defined by a debate.\n\nDemocrats and their progressive allies are fully aware of the stakes after the last head-to-head showdown led to weeks of internal party turmoil culminating in 81-year-old President Joe Biden's dramatic exit from the race.\n\nMany are eager for Harris, known for her resume and reputation as a prosecutor, to take her Republican opponent to task over his unprecedented criminal record and to draw a contrast on critical issues facing the country in front of a national audience.\n\nRead more here\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWhere do Harris and Trump stand in the polls?\n\nHarris seems to have national momentum on her side heading into the presidential debate, a USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll found. The poll of 1,000 likely voters taken after the Democratic National Convention showed Harris leading Trump 48%-43%. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nHowever, a New York Times/Sienna Poll of 1,695 likely voters taken last week found Trump leading Harris, 48%-47%, within the poll’s three-percentage-point margin of error.\n\nThe race appears tighter in key swing states that could determine the election’s outcome. Other polls show the candidates are neck and neck in crucial battlegrounds including Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Georgia.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWelcome to Philly from the Harris campaign?\n\nElectronic signs at the intersection of 12th and Market streets in Philadelphia are flashing Philly-centric signs to Donald Trump.\n\n“Philly is Wit Harris”—a reference to how Philly natives take their cheesesteak (“wit” or “witout” onions, to the rest of youse)—and messages referencing crowd size and Project 2025 greet visitors, pedestrians and the media and dignitaries out to grab a bite at the nearby Reading Terminal Market and a Hard Rock Cafe.\n\n– Phaedra Trethan\n\nScaramucci: Harris appeals to ‘normal Republicans’\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, who served briefly as Donald Trump’s White House communication’s director, suggested Harris’ economic agenda and national security ideas would appeal to “normal Republicans.”\n\n“There’s nothing radical about it,” Scaramucci told reporters ahead of the debate.\n\nScaramucci, a Trump critic who is attending the debate as a Harris surrogate, said Harris’ endorsement by former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney “gives space and comfort to normal Republicans, not Trumpish Republicans, but normal Republicans and independent moderates” that she is the right choice in this election.\n\nScaramucci, who was fired from the Trump White House after less than two weeks on the job, introduced himself to reporters by joking, “I'm Anthony Scaramucci, and I lasted one Scaramucci in the White House, which is 11 days.\"\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nDebate in Philly? Cue the theme from 'Rocky'\n\nBoth campaigns are referencing one of Philadelphia's claims to fame: The setting of the 1976 Oscar-winning boxing film \"Rocky,\" the story of scrappy underdog Rocky Balboa and his challenge to world champion Apollo Creed.\n\n\"Fight Night in Philly!\" tweeted Trump aide Steven Cheung as the Republican candidate's plane took off from South Florida. The Harris campaign, meanwhile, is planning a pre-debate \"drone show\" above the \"Rocky steps\" at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The odds are good that the sound system will play the musical theme from the movie, \"Gonna Fly Now.\"\n\nA word of caution may be in order, however: In the first Rocky film, Balboa actually lost a split decision to Creed in the championship bout; it wasn't until the first sequel that Rocky became champion.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHow to stream the debate, watch the debate without cable\n\nOn Tuesday, Sept. 10, at 9 p.m. EDT, USA TODAY Network will stream The ABC News Presidential Debate Simulcast on the USA TODAY channel, available on most smart televisions and devices.\n\n– USA TODAY Staff\n\nFormer Trump official Olivia Troye senses ‘sea change’ against ex-president\n\nOlivia Troye, who worked as a national security adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence, said she’s hearing from other Republicans who believe Donald Trump is too extreme and don’t want him to return to the White House.\n\nTroye, who quit her job in the administration after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, is serving as a surrogate for Kamala Harris and is attending the debate as Harris’ guest.\n\n“I think I’m seeing a sea change,” Troye told reporters ahead of the debate. “I’m hearing from Republicans across the country. I’m traveling to the swing states. I’m talking to them directly, and they’re saying, ‘I don’t identify with that.’”\n\nTroye said her values haven’t changed and that she doesn’t agree with everything Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, support. But, “I believe there is a better future for our country getting away from the extremism that Donald Trump and MAGA represent,” she said.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nMelania Trump raises questions about attempted assassination of her husband\n\nDonald Trump hasn't complained much about his security before the July 13 attempt on his life, but some of his allies have including former first lady Melania Trump.

Kennedy Jr. in Glendale, Arizona, \"and if they were, they would not have granted it.\"\n\nThe representative added that \"any royalties received as a result of this use will be donated\" to Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.\n\n– Brendan Morrow\n\nTrump calls for government shutdown without voting legislation\n\nWhile preparing for the debate, Trump took time Tuesday to urge Republican lawmakers to shut down the government if Congress does not approve voting policies he wants. Trump wants to bar migrants who are in the country illegally from voting – but that is already illegal. His proposal would require new voters to submit more documentary proof of citizenship.\n\nStill, in a Truth Social post, Trump said Republicans in Congress should not approve a new spending plan without his voting plan. Congress' deadline to keep the government's doors open is Sept. 30.\n\n\"If Republicans in the House, and Senate, don’t get absolute assurances on Election Security, THEY SHOULD, IN NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, GO FORWARD WITH A CONTINUING RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET,\" he said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTwo former Trump officials, Anthony Scaramucci and Olivia Troye, will be guests of Harris campaign\n\nTwo former officials in Donald Trump’s administration will be at the presidential debate for the Harris campaign on Thursday.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, a former Trump White House communications director, and Olivia Troye, Homeland Security advisor to Vice President Mike Pence, will serve as surrogates for the campaign and warn what a second Trump presidency would look like.\n\n“Listen, don’t take it from us: Take it from the ones who know Donald Trump the best and who are telling the American people exactly how unfit Trump is to serve as president,” said Harris communications director Michael Tyler.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump will knock Harris on immigration at debate\n\nOne of the top issues Trump will hammer Harris on is immigration. Trump and his allies have labeled Harris as a “border czar,” claiming that she was put in charge of the border and millions have crossed the border under her watch. Immigration experts previously debunked the claim, saying that Joe Biden tasked Harris with leading the administration's diplomatic efforts addressing the \"root causes\" of migration in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\n\nTrump will likely compare his immigration record with that of the Biden-Harris administration’s at the debate.\n\nAlong the U.S.-Mexico border, migrant apprehensions plunged in July from a year ago, to the lowest level of the Biden era, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics provided to USA TODAY.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi, Andre Byik and Lauren Villagran\n\nTrump: 'You don't know what to expect' ahead of debate\n\nExpect Donald Trump to harp on Kamala Harris' change of position on various issues – an allegation she's repeatedly rejected.\n\n\"You don't know what to expect - she's changed all of her policies over the years,\" Trump told NBC News in a phone interview on Tuesday. Harris and aides, meanwhile, plan to stress Trump's personal attacks on the vice president and other prominent Democrats.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhere do Trump and Harris stand on the wars in Israel, Ukraine?\n\nBoth Trump and Harris view Israel as a pivotal U.S. ally and have supported the country in the wake of Hamas’ devastating attack on Oct. 7.\n\nStill, both nominees have split from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at times. Trump earlier this year earlier this year called on Israel to “finish up your war.” Harris has said Israeli leaders \"must do more to protect civilian life\" in Gaza.\n\nTrump has said without evidence that, if elected, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would be settled within 24 hours, though it’s not clear how he would negotiate with the countries. Harris has widely criticized Russia’s invasion. In a major shift, the Biden administration earlier this year authorized Ukraine to use U.S. weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBottoms up: Drinking games for tonight's debate\n\nTonight’s debate is high stakes for both candidates, and millions of Americans are expected to tune in.

He has long attacked undocumented immigrants, promising wide-reaching deportations if he’s elected to a second term. The Trump administration also faced major criticism over immigration officials separating children and parents or other family at the border with Mexico.\n\nHarris opposed the construction of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border as a 2020 presidential candidate, but she backed bipartisan border legislation pushed by the Biden administration that would have allocated unspent dollars to continue the construction of a border wall, among a host of other measures.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky and Joey Garrison\n\nWhen is the vice presidential debate? Will Tim Walz and JD Vance debate?\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance are gearing up to take the stage for a vice presidential debate after both accepted an Oct. 1 invitation from CBS News.\n\nThe outlet also offered the candidates the chance to debate on Sept. 17, Sept. 24, and Oct. 8, but neither accepted those invitations. Vance suggested they also debate Sept. 18, but Walz has not agreed to that date.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHarris, Trump to meet – for the first time\n\nHarris and Trump have had much to say about one another while campaigning for president. But tonight’s debate marks the first time that the pair will actually meet face-to-face.\n\nWhile both have been in politics and the public eye for decades now, the candidates have yet to cross paths.\n\nHarris was present as a senator for Trump’s State of the Union addresses, but the two did not interact then. And Trump did not attend her vice presidential inauguration after refusing to accept the 2020 election results.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar and Phillip Bailey\n\nAdvocates urge prioritizing abortion discussion\n\nAbortion rights activists are calling for tonight’s debate moderators to prioritize the issue in their questions to candidates.\n\nA petition by the progressive advocacy group MoveOn has garnered over 40,000 signatures, including support from actress Busy Philipps, and activists Amanda Zurwaski and Kaitlyn Joshua, who shared their personal abortion stories on stage at the Democratic National Convention last month.\n\nAbortion is likely to come up tonight as a top concern in this year’s election. Harris, who has long been a leading voice in the Biden administration on the issue, has made reproductive rights a cornerstone of her presidential campaign.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow long is the debate tonight?\n\nPresidential debates are typically 90 minutes long, including the one tonight.\n\nThe Biden-Trump debate in June hosted by CNN went from 9 p.m. to about 10:30 p.m.\n\nIn 2020, the first presidential debate between Biden and Trump was also about 90 minutes. It was moderated by former Fox News journalist Chris Wallace.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow old are the candidates?\n\nAge was at the center of discussion about the 2024 election after the June debate between Biden and Trump.\n\nBiden, 81, had a stumbling debate performance that night that ultimately led to him stepping aside and endorsing Harris to become the Democratic nominee.\n\nMembers of Congress, voters, and pundits wrung their hands publicly about it in the month after the debate while Trump sought to capitalize on Biden’s poor performance. He mocked the president at a rally in Virginia the day after the debate and accused Biden of being a \"part-time president\" at a rally in Miami in July after Biden struggled to articulate his pitch to Americans on the debate stage.\n\nSo, how old is Trump, and how old is Harris?\n\nTrump turned 78 years old in June and would be 82 by the end of his term if he were to win in November.\n\nHarris will turn 60 in October and would be 64 years old by the end of her term if she were to win in November.\n\n– Elizabeth Beyer, David Jackson and Charles Trepany\n\nAre there more presidential debates?\n\nTonight’s debate is currently the only face-off between Harris and Trump scheduled.\n\nTrump had proposed two other dates in September for additional debates, while the Harris campaign said in a statement the vice president would agree to another meeting between the candidates in October.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar and Marina Pitofsky\n\nHarris, Trump polling neck-and-neck in swing states\n\nHarris and Trump head into debate night Tuesday essentially neck-and-neck in the 2024 swing states.\n\nTrump had enjoyed a lead in these seven battlegrounds earlier this year when Biden was still in the race.\n\nShortly after taking over the ticket, though, Harris gained a slight advantage in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina and Arizona, and tied Trump in Georgia, according to a Cook Political Report survey last month. Trump continued to lead in Nevada by 5 points.\n\nAnd a Detroit Free Press survey late last month found Trump ahead again by one point in Michigan.\n\nEssentially, the race could not be tighter, and both candidates will be vying tonight for support from voters in these key states.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar, Joey Garrison, and Todd Spangler\n\nWhat are the debate rules and who are the moderators?\n\nThe debate will be 90 minutes long with two commercial breaks. There will be no props or pre-written notes allowed onstage, and candidates will be given a pen, pad of paper and a water bottle. Candidates' microphones will be live only for the candidate whose turn it is to speak and muted when the time belongs to another candidate.\n\nThe two moderators for the debate are ABC journalists Linsey Davis and David Muir. Muir is a broadcast journalist who is the host and managing editor of \"ABC World News Tonight with David Muir.\" Muir interviewed Biden earlier this year as a part of D-Day coverage and was Trump's first White House interview as president in 2017.\n\nDavis hosts \"ABC News Live Prime,\" ABC News' streaming evening newscast, and weekend \"World News Tonight\" on Sundays. She is also a correspondent for \"World News Tonight,\" \"Good Morning America,\" \"20/20\" and \"Nightline.\"\n\n– Saman Shafiq, Gabe Hauari, and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho won which states in 2020?\n\nIn the 2020 presidential race, Biden won 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232. Of the 538 votes in the Electoral College up for grabs, a candidate must receive 270 of those votes to win.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won six of the seven states deemed battlegrounds in this year’s election: Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Nevada. Trump won one of this year's battleground states in 2020: North Carolina.\n\nBattleground, or swing states, are those that flipped parties in the presidential election between 2016 and 2020.\n\nAs Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump prepare to face off on the debate stage in Philadelphia later this evening, take a look at how the 2020 race shook out along with some background on the Electoral College.\n\n– Elizabeth Beyer\n\nWhere is the debate?\n\nThe debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will take place in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center.\n\nPennsylvania is one of a handful of battleground states that could be key in deciding the outcome of this year’s presidential election.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow candidates are approaching the debate\n\nCatch up on the dynamics going into the debate tonight with these USA TODAY stories:\n\n– USA TODAY Staff\n\nWhat time will Trump and Harris debate?\n\nTuesday's debate is set to begin at 9 p.m. ET.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/10/kamala-harris-rally-schedule-this-week/75144108007/", "title": "Kamala Harris' schedule this week includes debate, 9/11 memorial ...", "text": "It's a big week for the 2024 presidential campaigns, with the second Presidential debate coming up on Tuesday in Philadelphia.\n\nThe debate will see Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, face off for the first time since Harris announced her bid for the election.\n\nThe stakes are high for both candidates, with polls showing a close race with just two months left until Election Day.

The debate will not have a live audience in the room and there will be no opening statements from the two candidates, who will be introduced by moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis.\n\nSept. 11: New York, Pennsylvania\n\nHarris, along with President Joe Biden are expected to visit the World Trade Center site in New York City on Sept. 11 to commemorate the 23rd anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks, the New York Times reported, quoting White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nThe two will also attend the annual 9/11 Moment of Remembrance hosted by the National Park Service at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the Daily American, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK, reported.

This had been a bone of contention between the Harris and Trump campaigns, with Harris’ team preferring unmuted mics, which allow for quicker counterpoints to be made.\n\nBut the ABC debate will mimic CNN’s format, which muted microphones in a June debate between Trump and President Joe Biden. Biden in July ended his reelection campaign in the wake of a disastrous debate performance and calls for him to step aside. He endorsed his vice president, Harris, for the presidential nomination, which she secured in relatively short order.\n\nOther rules of note, according to ABC News and other sources:\n\nThere will not be a studio audience, which again is the same as the CNN debate.\n\nNo topics or questions will be shared with the candidates beforehand.\n\nEach candidate will be given two minutes to answer a question; the opponent will get a two-minute rebuttal, and the candidate will have an additional minute for follow-up or to respond.\n\nCandidates are expected to stand behind the podium for the 90-minute debate and will have a pen, a pad and a bottle of water.\n\nWill vice presidential candidates Vance and Walz debate?\n\nU.S. Sen. J.D. Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee, have both agreed to an Oct. 1 debate. It will likely be the only vice presidential debate if history is a guide.\n\nThat contest is scheduled for New York City and will air on CBS News. It will be moderated by Norah O’Donnell, anchor and managing editor of “CBS Evening News,” and Margaret Brennan, moderator of “Face the Nation,” and the network’s chief foreign affairs correspondent.\n\nWhat are the stakes in this presidential debate?\n\nThe stakes of the debate could be high, as Harris’ early momentum — which pushed her ahead of Trump in most national polls — has cooled and the race has tightened. She leads Trump by +1.2 points in an average of head-to-head polls and just under 2 points in polls that include third-party candidates.\n\nThere could be particular interest in the debate here in North Carolina, one of seven swing states that will decide the Nov. 5 general election. After the debate, Harris is scheduled to hold rallies in both Charlotte and Greensboro on Thursday. Trump campaigned in Charlotte for a rally last week.\n\nOpinion Editor Myron B.

Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence will have an outsize impact on the election just one month away. The presidential debate in Cleveland was marred by continual interruptions and personal insults, which the American public found disheartening. President Donald Trump's positive coronavirus diagnosis, revealed early Friday, threw the campaign and remaining presidential debate schedule into doubt.\n\nThe most recent national polls following these tumultuous events are ominous for Trump's reelection prospects, and Pence will have to try to stop the bleeding at the vice presidential debate Wednesday in Salt Lake City.\n\nThere is unusual interest and anticipation surrounding the Pence-Harris debate for a multitude of reasons. Undecided voters want to be confident that it's still possible to conduct a civil and substantive political debate during such a watershed election. Given the age and health of the two presidential nominees, it's essential for Harris and Pence to reassure voters they are capable of stepping into the role of commander in chief at a moment's notice. Joe Biden would be the oldest president ever elected and has not formally committed to running for a second term in office.\n\nHigh stakes for both sides\n\nThe debate will be divided into nine segments by moderator Susan Page of USA TODAY, and there is no doubt coronavirus will be front and center. The candidates will be sitting on stage, but distanced 12 feet apart and separated by plexiglass. The audience will consist of fewer than 200 people, and anyone not wearing a face mask will be asked to leave the venue, according to the Commission on Presidential Debates. The safe and responsible execution of a vice presidential debate at this trying time is important for the country to witness.\n\nThe contrasting backgrounds, styles and personalities of the two nominees also guarantee a fascinating matchup. Harris is a first-term senator who previously served as California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney. She has used her prosecutorial background and position on the Senate Judiciary Committee to grill high-profile witnesses like attorney general nominee William Barr and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nHarris participated in five Democratic presidential primary debates this cycle and briefly reached top-tier status in the race after a viral and personal exchange with Biden over school desegregation in California. But she quickly faded, in part due to inconsistent positions on health care reform as she vacillated between the left and center of the ideological spectrum.\n\nTrump-Biden debate in Cleveland: Once is enough. Please make it stop.\n\nHawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard surprisingly ended up being Harris' most formidable foe during the Detroit and Atlanta debates. Gabbard got under her skin by attacking her prosecutorial history and raising questions about her national security qualifications.\n\nHarris, who arrived in Salt Lake City late Friday, is preparing for the debate with help from another primary rival: former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is standing in for Pence, a fellow Hoosier.\n\nPence in the 2016 VP debate\n\nBefore becoming vice president, Pence was governor of Indiana and an Indiana congressman, as well as a conservative talk-radio show host. His performances in the Indiana gubernatorial debates were inconsistent. Pence has a measured debate delivery style and was a wild card heading into his matchup with Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine in 2016. He relentlessly attacked Hillary Clinton's private email server, while defending Trump's tax returns. Pence discussed his Midwestern values, but had no trouble delivering punishing attack lines with a smile.\n\nPolling showed that Pence narrowly emerged victorious in the vice presidential debate, in part due to low expectations. He was described as feisty and benefited from Kaine's numerous interruptions throughout the evening. Pence will certainly attack Harris’ liberal Senate voting record, while also aiming barbs at Biden and defending President Trump's record.\n\nIn an ironic twist, Pence now finds himself in the same position as Biden in 2012, after Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had prevailed over a curiously passive President Barack Obama in their first debate. Amid flagging poll numbers, Biden was tasked with righting the ship and providing a jolt of momentum in his debate with Romney running mate Paul Ryan.\n\nThe Backstory: We fact-checked the presidential debate in real time. How we did it and what we found.\n\nThe stakes are even greater for Pence in 2020, given Trump’s health and the many other obstacles facing the campaign. There are reasons to believe that Pence can replicate Biden's debate success story from 2012. He will again benefit from low expectations given Harris' high-profile record and experience. And she will be constrained from delivering a full throttle attack against Trump as he continues recovering from COVID, also a potential advantage for Pence.\n\nAs in 2012, an unexpectedly dynamic debate performance by a vice presidential nominee could provide much needed energy to the troubled Trump-Pence campaign at the most crucial time. It would be a mistake to again underestimate Mike Pence. And surely no one understands the potential for this role reversal better than Joe Biden himself.\n\nAaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan, is editor/co-author of \"Debating The Donald.\" Follow him on Twitter: @michigandebate", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/09/10/live-debate-updates-what-channel-is-the-presidential-debate-on/75165948007/", "title": "Who won the debate last night?

That’s what they saw tonight and what they should see at a second debate in October. Vice President Harris is ready for a second debate. Is Donald Trump?” Harris-Walz Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement.\n\n− Rebecca Morin and Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump dismisses criticism for questioning Harris' biracial identity\n\nWhen questioned about why he thought it was appropriate to question Harris' biracial identity, Trump said he doesn't care.\n\n\"I don't care. You make a big deal out of something, I couldn't care less. Whatever she wants to be is okay with me.\"\n\nThe former president's July appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists' convention sparked backlash after he accused Harris of becoming Black after he claimed she had only identified as Indian-American up until recently. Harris' father is Black and her mother was Indian-American.\n\n\"I mean all I can say is, I read when she was not Black, that she put out, and, I'll say that, and then I read that she was Black, and that's okay, either one was okay with me,\" he said. \"That's up to her, that's up to her.\" In response, Harris called Trump's comments a \"tragedy.\"\n\n− Sam Woodward\n\nKamala Harris says she's a gun owner\n\nAfter Donald Trump criticized Kamala Harris' stance on gun control, she said she and her running mate, Tim Walz, are both gun owners.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump says Harris 'hates Israel'; VP says it’s 'not true'\n\nHarris said the war between Israel and Hamas “must end immediately” with a cease-fire deal and hostage release. She recommitted to giving Israel the ability to defend itself – especially from Iran – but she said there must be a solution that establishes an independent Palestinian state.\n\nTrump insisted that if he were president, Hamas would not have launched a vicious attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\n“She hates Israel,” Trump charged.\n\n“At the same time, in her own way, she hates the Arab population,” he added, “because the whole place is going to get blown up. Arabs, Jewish people, Israel, Israel will be gone.” Harris said “that’s absolutely not true” and that Trump is “trying to divide and distract” from his “weak and wrong” on national security and foreign policy.\n\n“It is well known that he admires dictators, wants to be a dictator on day one,” she said, hammering Trump for a comment he made about Russian President Vladimir Putin doing “whatever the hell” he wants in Ukraine.\n\nTrump fired back that Putin wants Harris to win the election.\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nDebate reaction from Trump running mate\n\nSenator JD Vance of Ohio was posting to 'X' during the duration of the debate, restating Trump's claim criminals, specifically from Venezuela, are being sent to the United States.\n\nVance also pointed out Harris introducing herself by shaking Trump's hand and saying her name at the beginning of the debate.\n\n\"Did she really just say \"Kamala Harris\"? I think he knows who you are,\" he wrote.\n\n–Natassia Paloma\n\nHarris: ‘World leaders are laughing’ at Trump\n\nFollowing Trump’s false claim that the 2020 election was corrupt, Harris said leaders across the world are “laughing” at the former president.\n\n“I'm going to tell you that I have traveled the world as vice president of the United States and world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump,” she said. “I have talked with military leaders, some of whom work with you, and they say you are a disgrace.”\n\nTrump pushed back on Harris’ claim, saying that Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orbán said the United States’ “need Trump back as president.”\n\n“Viktor Orbán said, he said, ‘the most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was president,’” Trump said, calling Biden a “weak, pathetic man.”\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nKamala Harris fracking\n\nHarris said she made it clear in 2020 that she does not support banning fracking.\n\n“I have not banned fracking as Vice President of the United States, and in fact, I was the tie breaking vote on the inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking,” Harris said.\n\nIn 2019 when she was first running for president, Harris said she was in favor of banning fracking, as well as sponsored the Green New Deal as Senator. But in the 2024 election, Harris’ campaign has said she is no longer in favor.\n\nHarris said at the debate that her position is to invest in diverse sources of energy and reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil: “We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil,” Harris said.\n\n−Rebecca Morin\n\nDonald Trump claim: Immigrants in the country illegally have highest rate of ‘criminality’\n\n“(Immigrants in the country illegally are) destroying our country.

The debate will be especially high stakes. With Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis and the quandary that surrounded the first presidential debate, voters may view the contest as a better chance to understand the issues. Though Pence has been through a vice presidential debate, this is a first for Harris. While she can rely on her prosecutorial skills, the rising Democratic star hasn’t debated a Republican since her 2010 race for California attorney general.

The former vice president, who gave a speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on Tuesday, told reporters he and Trump \"shouldn't have a debate\" as long as the president remains positive for the coronavirus. Trump hasn't been seen since Monday when he returned to the White House from his stint at Walter Reed Military Medical Center to get treated for COVID-19. But he was active on Twitter Tuesday despite not having any events on his official schedule — and that included saying he will take part in the second presidential debate, scheduled for Oct. 15.\n\n'Rapid intensification': Delta, now a Category 3 'major' hurricane\n\nHurricane Delta was rushing toward landfall in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Wednesday with \"life-threatening storm surge\" and \"significant flash flooding.\" The National Hurricane Center said Delta, which intensified into a powerful Category 3 \"major\" hurricane with winds up to 145 mph, is going through \"a very impressive rapid intensification episode.\" Delta intensified from 40 to 110 mph in the first 24 hours since it became a named storm, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.

The crowd was a sea of blue and white as FDNY and NYPD officers wore their dress uniforms to honor those lost in service. Some attendees donned shirts printed with their lost loved ones’ faces while others held up laminated signs.\n\nWhere the towers once stood are now two reflection pools − their walls engraved with the names of the fallen. On Wednesday the dark slabs of stone were adorned with fresh bouquets and countless American flags, some baring thin red stripes to represent firefighters. About 343 firefighters died on 9/11 which, at the time, amounted to nearly half the number of on-duty deaths in the New York City Fire Department’s entire 100-year history.\n\nTheir names, along with the other New York victims, were read at Wednesday’s ceremony by family members. At the end of each list was a personal speech about one of the victims. Many of the readers were young children who spoke about family members they never got to meet.\n\nAfter Ground Zero, Trump and Vance visited a nearby New York fire station.\n\nThe former president's entourage included Trump family members as well as conservative activist Laura Loomer, who has voiced unfounded conspiracy theories about alleged U.S. government involvement in 9/11. Loomer also flew with Trump to Tuesday night's debate in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris, Biden, and Trump later traveled to Shanksville to the field where a hijacked plane crashed amid a battle between passengers and 9/11 hijackers.\n\nThe current president and vice president laid a wreath at the crash site memorial. They also visited the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Department, where Biden tried on a red Trump hat as a gesture of 9/11 umity.\n\n\"At the Shanksville Fire Station, @POTUS spoke about the country's bipartisan unity after 9/11 and said we needed to get back to that,\" said White House spokesman Andrew Bates, speaking on the social media site X. \"As a gesture, he gave a hat to a Trump supporter who then said that in the same spirit, POTUS should put on his Trump cap. He briefly wore it.\"\n\nTrump toured the Shanksville 9/11 memorial shortly after Harris and Biden departed. He also visited the same firehouse.\n\nHarris and Biden also attended a memorial service at the Pentagon, another target on 9/11.\n\n\"Today is a day of solemn remembrance as we mourn the souls we lost in a heinous terrorist attack on September 11, 2001,\" Harris said in her statement before the ceremonies. \"We stand in solidarity with their families and loved ones.\"\n\nTrump, in an early morning phone interview with Fox News, called 9/11 a \"very, very sad, horrible day, horrible day. There's never been anything like it, just a horrible day.\"\n\nWhile Vance accompanied Trump in New York, Harris' running mate – Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz – attended a 9/11 memorial service in his home state.\n\nDuring the day, Trump also spoke about politics. He continued to criticize Harris and repeatedly suggested there would not be a second debate, despite ongoing talks with television networks about sponsoring more contests.\n\n“I would do NBC, I’d do Fox, too ... but right now we have to determine whether or not we want to do it,\" Trump told reporters in Shanksville.\n\nPolitical tensions remained high during the 9/11 events.\n\nAt one point during the New York ceremony, a woman yelled at Trump: \"Where were you for (the) 20 years I've been here? Where were you?\"\n\nThe 23rd anniversary of 9/11 came the morning after a debate in which Harris pounded Trump for his volatility and his conservative economic and military plans while Trump angrily denounced the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nTrump's rants also highlighted the debate, including discredited conspiracy theories that migrants in an Ohio city are killing and eating dogs and cats.\n\nAccording to a CNN \"flash poll,\" most registered voters who watched the debate said Harris outperformed Trump; the margin was 63%-37%.\n\nWhile the candidates took a pause from politics for 9/11, their campaigns moved forward with the presidential race.\n\nIn his Fox interview, Trump complained about the debate moderators but still claimed success. \"I thought I did a great job,\" he said.\n\nHarris appeared to throw Trump off stride during the debate by attacking him on a variety of issues, from his position on abortion to mocking the size and lack of enthusiasm of his rally crowds.\n\nThe morning after, the Harris team sent out fundraising solicitations celebrating her performance but reminding supporters that \"debates don't win elections.\"\n\n\"This race will be very close,\" Harris said in a fundraising e-mail.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/08/vice-presidential-debate-full-transcript-mike-pence-and-kamala-harris/5920773002/", "title": "Vice presidential debate: Full transcript of Mike Pence and Kamala ...", "text": "This is a transcript of the 90-minute debate between Vice President Mike Pence and vice presidential nominee Sen.

From the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2020, sponsored by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. I’m Susan Page of USA TODAY. It is my honor to moderate this debate, an important part of our democracy. In Kingsbury Hall tonight we have a small and socially distant audience and we've taken extra precautions during this pandemic. Among other things, everyone in the audience is required to wear a face mask and the candidates will be seated 12 feet apart. The audience is enthusiastic about their candidates, but they've agreed to express that enthusiasm, only twice. At the end of the debate and now when I introduce the candidates. Please welcome California Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nPENCE\n\nThank you.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n01:05 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris and Vice President Pence thank you for being here. We're meeting as President Trump and the First Lady continue to undergo treatment in Washington after testing positive for COVID-19. We send our thoughts and prayers to them for their rapid and complete recovery and for the recovery of everyone afflicted by the coronavirus. The two campaigns in the Commission on Presidential Debates have agreed to the ground rules for tonight. I'm here to enforce them on behalf of the millions of Americans who are watching. One note, no one in either campaign, or at the commission or anywhere else has been told in advance what topics will raise or what questions I’ll ask. This ninety-minute debate will be divided into nine segments of about 10 minutes each. I'll begin the segment by posing a question to each of you, sometimes the same question, sometimes a different question on the same topic. You will then have two minutes to answer, without interruption by me or the other candidate. Then we'll take six minutes or so to discuss the issue. At that point, although there will always be more to say, we'll move on to the next topic. We want a debate that is lively, but Americans also deserve a discussion that is civil. These are tumultuous times, but we can and will have a respectable exchange about the big issues facing our nation. Let's begin with the ongoing pandemic that has caused our country so much. Senator Harris, the coronavirus is not under control. Over the past week, Johns Hopkins reports that 39 states have had more COVID cases over the past seven days than in the week before. Nine states have set new records. Even if a vaccine is released soon, the next administration will face hard choices. What would a Biden administration do in January and February that a Trump administration wouldn't do? Would you impose new lockdowns for businesses and schools in hotspots? A federal mandate to wear masks? You have two minutes to respond, without interruption.\n\n03:15 HARRIS\n\nThank you Susan. Well, the American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country. And here are the facts. 210,000 dead people in our country in just the last several months. Over 7 million people who have contracted this disease. One in five businesses closed. We're looking at frontline workers who have been treated like sacrificial workers. We are looking at over 30 million people who in the last several months had to file for unemployment. And here's the thing, on January 28, the vice president and the president were informed about the nature of this pandemic. They were informed that it's lethal in consequence, that it is airborne, that it will affect young people and that it would be contracted because it is airborne. And they knew what was happening, and they didn't tell you. Can you imagine if you knew on January 28, as opposed to March 13, what they knew what you might have done to prepare? They knew and they covered it up. The president said it was a hoax. They minimized the seriousness of it. The president said you're on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask, you’re on the other side of his ledger if you don't. And in spite of all of that, today they still don't have a plan. They still don't have a plan. Well, Joe Biden does. And our plan is about what we need to do around a national strategy for contact tracing, for testing, for administration of the vaccine and making sure that it will be free for all. That is the plan that Joe Biden has and that I have, knowing that we have to get a hold of what has been going on and we need to save our country. And Joe Biden is the best leader to do that and frankly, this administration has forfeited their right to reelection, based on this.\n\n05:21 PAGE\n\nThank you- Thank you, Senator Harris. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, more than 210,000 Americans have died of COVID-19 since February. The US death toll as a percentage of our population is higher than that of almost every other wealthy nation on Earth. For instance, our death rate is two and a half times that of Canada, next door. You head the administration's Coronavirus Task Force. Why is the U.S. death toll, as a percentage of our population, higher than that of almost every other wealthy country? And you have two minutes to respond, without interruption.\n\n05:55 PENCE\n\nSusan Thank you. And I want to thank the Commission and the University of Utah for hosting this event. And Senator Harris, it's a privilege to be on the stage with you. Our nation has gone through a very challenging time this year. But I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of Americans first. Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done. And that was he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Senator Joe Biden, Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical, but I can tell you, having led the White House Coronavirus Task Force, that that decision alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. And I believe it’s saved hundreds of thousands of American lives. Because with that time we were able to reinvent testing. More than 115 million tests have been done to date. We were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies so our doctors and nurses had the resources and support they needed. And we began, really before the month of February it was hard to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines and therapeutics that’ve been saving lives all along the way. And under President Trump's leadership, Operation Warp Speed, we believe, will have literally 10s of millions of doses of a vaccine before the end of this year. The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way. And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine, umm, it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about. I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health of America first and the American people, I believe with my heart, can be proud of the sacrifices they have made. It’s saved countless American lives.\n\n08:05 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice Pres- Thank you Vice President Pence- Thank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris, would you like to respond?\n\n08:11 HARRIS\n\nOh, absolutely. Whatever the Vice President's claiming the administration has done, clearly it hasn't worked when you're looking at over 210,000 dead bodies in our country, American lives that have been lost, families that are grieving that loss. And you know, the vice president is the head of the task force and knew, on January 28, how serious this was. And then, big thanks to Bob Woodward, we learned that they knew about it. And then when that was exposed, the vice president said when asked ‘Well, why didn’t y'all tell anybody?’, he said ‘Because the president wanted people to remain calm’.\n\nPAGE\n\nWell, let's go –\n\nHARRIS\n\nNo, I – Susan, I – This is important –\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan, I have to weigh in here –\n\n08:53 HARRIS\n\nMr. Vice President, I’m speaking.\n\nPENCE\n\nI have to weigh in –\n\nHARRIS\n\nI'm speaking. I wanna –\n\n08:58 PAGE\n\nYou have 15 more more seconds and then we'll give the vice president a chance to respond.\n\n09:01 HARRIS\n\nThank you. So I want to ask the American people, how calm were you when you were panicked about where you're going to get your next roll of toilet paper? How calm were you when your kids were sent home from school and you didn't know when they could go back?\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you. Thank you, Sen Harris –\n\nHARRIS\n\nHow calm were you when your children couldn't see your parents because you were afraid they could kill them?\n\n09:19 PAGE\n\nLet’s give Vice President Pence a chance to respond. Vice President Pence, you have one minute to respond.\n\n09:22 PENCE\n\nYou know there's not a day gone by that I haven’t thought of every American family that’s lost a loved one. And I want all of you to know that you'll always be in our hearts and in our prayers. But when you say what the American people have done over these last eight months hasn't worked, that's a great disservice to the sacrifices the American people have made.\n\nHARRIS\n\nI’m referring to your president.\n\nPENCE\n\nThe reality – If I may, if I may finish, Senator. The reality is Dr. Fauci said everything that he told the President in the Oval Office, the president told the American people. Now President Trump I will tell you his boundless confidence in the American people and he always spoke with confidence that we'll get through this together. But when you say it hasn't worked- When Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birks and our medical experts came to us in the second week of March, they said if the President didn't take the unprecedented step of shutting down roughly half of the American economy that we could lose 2.2 million Americans. But that's the reality.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you. Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\nThey also said to us if we did everything right, Susan, we could still lose more than 200,000 Americans.\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\nNow, one life lost is too many, Susan.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you –\n\nPENCE\n\nBut the American people, I believe, deserve credit for the sacrifices that they have made, putting the health of their family and their neighbors first, our doctors our nurses, our first responders –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– and I'm going to speak up on behalf of what the American people have done.\n\n10:43 PAGE\n\nVice President Pence, you in the front row in a Rose Garden event 11 days ago, at what seems to have been a super-spreader event for senior administration and congressional officials, no social distancing, few masks, and now a cluster of coronavirus cases among those who were there. How can you expect Americans to follow the administration safety guidelines to protect themselves from COVID when you were at the White House have not been doing so?\n\n11:10 PENCE\n\nWell, the American people have demonstrated over the last eight months that when given the facts they're willing to put the health of their families, and their neighbors and people they don't even know first. President Trump and I have great confidence in the American people and their ability to take that information and put it into practice. In the height of the epidemic, when we were losing a heartbreaking number of 2,500 Americans a day, we surged resources to New Jersey, and New York, and New Orleans and Detroit. We told the American people what needed to be done and the American people made the sacrifices. When the outbreak in the Sunbelt happened this summer, again, Americans stepped forward. But the reality is the work of the President of the United States goes on. A vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States has come upon us and the president introduced Judge Amy Coney Barrett –\n\nPAGE\n\nYes, thank you- Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\n12:05 PENCE\n\nAt that- If I may say, that Rose Garden Event, there’s been a great deal of speculation about it. My wife Karen and I were there and honored to be there. Many of the people who were at that event, Susan, actually were tested for coronavirus. And it was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise, the difference here is President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris consistently talk about mandates, and not not just mandates with the coronavirus but a government takeover of health, the Green New Deal –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you- Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– all government control. We're about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people.\n\n12:46 HARRIS\n\nLet's talk about respecting the American people. You respect the American people when you tell them the truth. You respect the American people when you have the courage to be a leader –\n\nPENCE\n\nWhich we’ve always done –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– speaking of those things that you may not want people to hear but they need to hear so they can protect themselves. But this administration stood on information that if you had as a parent, if you had as a worker knowing you didn't have enough money saved up, and now you're standing in a food line because of the ineptitude of administration that was unwilling to speak the truth to the American people. So let's talk about caring about the American people. The American people who have had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration. It is asking too much of the people –\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan, we talked about the American people –\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– It is asking too much of the people that they would not be equipped with the information they need to help themselves to protect their parents and their children.\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan, the president –\n\n13:39 PAGE\n\nNo, I’m sorry. Kamala Harris – Senator Harris, I mean. I'm sorry.\n\nHARRIS\n\nIt’s fine. I’m Kamala.\n\nPAGE\n\nNo, no, you’re Senator Harris to me. For life to get back to normal Dr. Anthony Fauci and other experts say that most of the people who can be vaccinated need to be vaccinated, but half of Americans now say they wouldn't take a vaccine if it was released now. If the Trump administration approves a vaccine, before after the election, should Americans take it and would you take it?\n\n14:10 HARRIS\n\nIf the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I'll be the first in line to take it. Absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I'm not taking it.\n\n14:21 PAGE\n\nVice President Pence, there have been a lot of repercussions from this pandemic. In recent days, the president's diagnosis of COVID-19 has underscored the importance of the job that you hold, and that you are seeking. That's our second topic tonight, it's the role of the vice president. One of you will make history on January 20, you will be the vice president to the oldest president the United States has ever had. Donald Trump will be 74-years-old on Inauguration Day. Joe Biden will be 78-years-old. That already has raised concerns among some voters, concerns that have been sharpened by President Trump's hospitalization in recent days. Vice President Pence, have you had a conversation or reached an agreement with President Trump about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, do you think you should? You have two minutes without interruption.\n\n15:17 PENCE\n\nWell, Susan, thank you. Although I would like to go back –\n\n15:20 PAGE\n\nWe should move on to the issue of the vice presidency –\n\n15:22 PENCE\n\nWell, thank you but, I would like to go back. Because the reality is that we're going to have a vaccine, Senator, in record time, in unheard of time, in less than a year. We have five companies in phase three clinical trials. And we're right now producing 10s of millions of doses. So, the fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable. And Senator, I just asked you, stop playing politics with people's lives. The reality is that we will have a vaccine, we believe, before the end of this year, and it will have the capacity to save countless American lives. And your continuous undermining of confidence in a vaccine is just, it's just unacceptable. And let me also say, you know the reality is when you talk about, about failure in this administration, we actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic. It was 2009. The Swine Flu arrived in the United States. Thankfully, it was, ended up not being as lethal as the coronavirus. But before the end of the year, when Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, not seven and a half million people contracted the swine flu, 60 million Americans contracted the swine flu. If the swine flu had been as lethal as the coronavirus in 2009 when Joe Biden was vice president, we would have lost 2 million American lives. His own Chief of Staff Ron Klain would say last year that it was pure luck. That they did “everything possible wrong”. And we learned from that. They left the Strategic National Stockpile empty. They left an empty and hollow plan, but we still learned from it. And I think –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence – Vice President Pence, your time is up –\n\n17:19 PENCE\n\n– the American people, I’m gonna say again, can be proud of what we done--\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence, I’m sorry. Your time is up-- Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– and, Senator, please stop undermining confidence in a vaccine.\n\n17:26 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris, let me ask you the same question that I asked Vice President Pence, which is have you had a conversation, or reached an agreement with Vice President Biden, about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, and if you win the election next month, do you think you should? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n17:47 HARRIS\n\nSo let me tell you first of all, on the day I got the call from Joe Biden, it was actually a Zoom call, asking me to serve with him on this ticket was probably one of the most memorable, memorable days in my life. I, you know, I thought about my mother, who came to the United States at the age of 19, gave birth to me at the age of 25 at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California. And the thought that I'd be sitting here right now I know would make her proud and she must be looking down on this. You know Joe and I were raised in a very similar way. We were raised with values that are about hard work, about the value and the dignity of public service and about the importance of fighting for the dignity of all people. And I think Joe asked me to serve with him because I have a career that included being elected the first woman District Attorney of San Francisco, where I created models of innovation for law enforcement, in terms of reform of the criminal justice system. I was elected the first woman of color, and black woman, to be elected Attorney General of the state of California, where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice. There I took on everything from transnational criminal organizations, to the big banks that were taking advantage of homeowners, to for profit colleges that were taking advantage of veterans. And then, of course, now I serve in the United States Senate as only the second black woman ever elected to the United States Senate. I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee where I've been in regular receipt of classified information about threats to our nation and hotspots around the world. I've traveled the world. I've met with our soldiers in our, in war zones. And I think Joe has asked me to serve with him because he knows that we share, we share a purpose, which is about lifting up the American people. And after the four years that we have seen of Donald Trump, unifying our country around our common values and principles.\n\n19:51 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris. You know neither, neither President Trump nor Vice President Biden has released the sort of detailed health information that had become the modern norm until the 2016 election. And in recent days, President Trump's doctors have given misleading answers or refused to answer basic questions about his health. And my question to each of you, in turn, is, is this information voters deserve to know? Vice President Pence, would you like to go first?\n\n20:18 PENCE\n\nWell, Susan, thank you. And let me, let me say on behalf of the president and the First Lady, how moved we've all been by the outpouring of prayers and concern for the President. And I do believe it's emblematic of the prayers and the concern that have ushered forth for every American impacted by the coronavirus. But the care the president received at Walter Reed, White House doctors, was exceptional. And the transparency that they practiced all along, they will continue because the American people have a right to know about the health and well-being of their President. And we'll continue to do that. But I'm just extremely grateful and was more than, more than a little moved by the broad and bipartisan support. And, Senator, I want to thank you and Joe Biden for your expressions and genuine concern. And I also want to congratulate you, as I did on that phone call, on the historic nature of your nomination.\n\nHARRIS\n\nThank you.\n\nPENCE\n\nI never expected to be on this stage four years ago so I know the feeling. But the reality is, we've got an election before the American people, in the midst of this challenging year, and the stakes have never been higher.\n\n21:35 PAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence. I wanna give Senator Harris a chance to respond to the same question I asked, which is do voters have a right to know more detailed health information about presidential candidates, and especially about presidents, especially when they're facing some kind of challenge?\n\n21:50 HARRIS\n\nAbsolutely. And that's why Joe Biden has been so incredibly transparent. And certainly, by contrast, the President has not, both in terms of health records, but also let's look at taxes. We now know because of great investigative journalism that Donald Trump paid $750 in taxes. When I first heard about it, I literally said “You mean $750,000?”. And it was like no, $750. We now know Donald Trump owes and is in debt for $400 million. And just so everyone is clear, when we say in debt it means you owe money to somebody. And i'd be really good to know who the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief, owes money to because the American people have a right to know what is influencing the president's decisions. And is he making those decisions on the best interest of the American people, of you, or self interest. So, Susan, I'm glad you asked about transparency, because it has to be across the board. Joe has been incredibly transparent over many, many years. The one thing we all know about Joe, he puts it all out there. He, he is honest. He is forthright. But Donald Trump on the other hand, has been about covering up everything.\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan –\n\n23:09 PENCE\n\nThank – Thanks – Thank you, Senator Harris. I want to give you a chance to respond, Vice President.\n\n23:13 PENCE\n\nWell, look, I respect the fact that Joe Biden spent 47 years in public life. I respect your public service as well.\n\nHARRIS\n\nThank you.\n\nPENCE\n\nBut the American people have a president who is a businessman, he’s a job-creator. He’s paid 10s of millions of dollars in taxes, payroll taxes, property taxes. He's created 10s of thousands of American jobs. The president said those public reports are not accurate. And the President also released, literally, stacks of financial disclosures the American people can review just as the law allows. But the distinction here is that Joe Biden, 47 years in public service, compared to President Donald Trump, who brought all of that experience four years ago--\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President –\n\nPENCE\n\n– and turned this economy around by cutting taxes, rolling back regulation, unleashing American energy-\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\n24:04 PENCE\n\n– fighting for free and fair trade, and all of the is on the line –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\n24:08 PENCE\n\n– if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are in the White House.\n\nPAGE\n\nYou know, that's a good segue into our third topic--\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat’s a great segue.\n\nPAGE\n\n– which is about the economy. This has been another aspect of life for Americans that's been so affected by this coronavirus. We have a jobs crisis brewing. On Friday, we learned that the unemployment rate had declined to 7.9% in September, but the job growth had stalled, and that was before the latest round of layoffs and furloughs in the airline industry, at Disney and elsewhere. Hundreds of thousands of discouraged workers have stopped looking to work. Nearly 11 million jobs that existed at the beginning of the year, haven't been replaced. Those hardest hit include latinos, blacks and women. Senator Harris, the Biden Harris campaign has proposed new programs to boost the economy and you would pay for that new spending by raising $4 trillion in taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations. Some economists warn that could curb entrepreneurial ventures that fuel growth and create jobs. Would raising taxes for the recovery at risk? And you have two minutes to answer, uninterrupted.\n\n25:16 HARRIS\n\nThank you. On the issue of the economy, I think there couldn't be a more fundamental difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of America's economy based on the health, and the strength of the American worker and the American family. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who measures the strength of the economy based on how rich people are doing. Which is why he passed a tax bill benefitting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America, leading to a $2 trillion deficit that the American people are gonna have to pay for. On day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill. He'll get rid of it. And what he'll do with the money is invested in the American people. And through a plan that is about investing in infrastructure, something that Donald Trump said he would do. I remember hearing about some infrastructure week. I don't think it ever happened. But Joe Biden will do that. He'll invest in infrastructure. It's about upgrading our roads and bridges, but also investing in clean energy and renewable energy. Joe is gonna invest that money in what we need to do around innovation. There was a time when our country believed in science and invested in research and development so that we were an innovation leader on the globe. Joe Biden will use that money to invest in education. So for example, for folks who want to go to a two year Community College, it will be free. If you come from a family that makes less than $125,000, you'll go to a public university for free. And across the board, we'll make sure that if you have student loan debt it's cut by $10,000. That's how Joe Biden thinks about the economy, which is it’s about investing in the people of our country, as opposed to passing a tax bill, which had the benefit of letting American corporations go offshore to do their business.\n\n27:09 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris.\n\nHARRIS\n\nYou're welcome\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence, your administration has been predicting a rapid and robust recovery, but the latest economic report suggests that's not happening. Should Americans be braced for an economic comeback that is going to take not months, but a year or more? You have two minutes to answer, uninterrupted.\n\n27:27 PENCE\n\nWhen President Trump and I took office, America had gone through the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. When Joe Biden was vice president they tried to tax, and spend, and regulate, and bail our way back to a growing economy. President Trump cut taxes, across the board. Despite what Senator Harris says, the average American family of four had $2,000 in savings in taxes. And with the rise in wages that occurred, most predominantly for blue-collar, hard working Americans, the average household income for a family of four increased by $4,000 following President Trump's tax cuts. But America, you just heard Senator Harris tell you, on day one Joe Biden's gonna raise your taxes. It's really remarkable to think, Susan –\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat’s not what I said.\n\nPENCE\n\n– I mean, right after a time where we're going through a pandemic that lost 22 million jobs at the height, we've already added back 11.6 million jobs because we had a president who cut taxes, rollback regulation, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade, and secured $4 trillion from the Congress of the United States to give direct payments to families, saved 50 million jobs through the paycheck protection program. We literally have spared no expense to help the American people and the American worker through this. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to raise taxes. They want to bury our economy under a $2 trillion Green New Deal, which you were one of the original co-sponsors of in the United States Senate. They want to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking, which would cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs all across the Heartland. And Joe Biden wants to go back to the economic surrender to China that when we took office, half of our international trade deficit was with China alone. And Joe Biden wants to repeal all of the tariffs that President Trump put into effect to fight for American jobs and American workers. Joe Biden says democracy's on the ballot. Make no mistake about it, Susan. The American economy, the American comeback is on the ballot with four more years of growth and opportunity –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– with four more years of President Donald Trump. 2020 economic year in the history of this country.\n\n29:36 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence – Thank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris?\n\n29:41 HARRIS\n\nWell, I mean, I thought we saw enough of it in last week's debate, but I think this is supposed to be a debate based on fact and truth. And the truth of the fact is, Joe Biden has been very clear. He will not raise taxes on anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year –\n\nPENCE\n\nHe said he’s gonna appeal the Trump tax cuts –\n\nHARRIS\n\nMr. Vice President I’m speaking.\n\nPENCE\n\nWell –\n\n29:57 HARRIS\n\nI’m speaking.\n\n29:59 PENCE\n\n– it’d be important if you said the truth. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that he's going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. That was tax cuts that gave the average working family $2,000 in a tax break every single year –\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat is – That is absolutely not true –\n\nPENCE\n\n– Senator, that’s the math –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– that tax bill –\n\nPENCE\n\nIs he only gonna repeal part of the Trump tax cuts?\n\n30:19 HARRIS\n\nIf you don't mind letting me finish –\n\nPENCE\n\nPlease\n\nHARRIS\n\nWe can then have a conversation. Okay?\n\nPENCE\n\nPlease\n\nHARRIS\n\nOkay. Joe Biden will not raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden is the one who during the Great Recession was responsible for the Recovery Act that brought America back. And now the Trump Pence Administration wants to take credit when they ran when they rode the coattails of Joe Biden's success for the economy that they had at the beginning of their term. Of course now the economy is a complete disaster, but Joe Biden on the one hand, did that. On the other hand you have Donald Trump, who has reigned over a recession that is being compared to the Great Depression. On the one hand you have Joe Biden, who was responsible with President Barack Obama for the Affordable Care Act, which brought health care to over 20 million Americans and protected people with pre existing conditions and what it also did is it saved those families, who otherwise were going bankrupt because of hospital bills they could not afford. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who is in court right now trying to get rid of –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which means that you will lose protections, if you have pre-existing conditions. And I just, this is very important, Susan –\n\nPAGE\n\nYes, well we need to give – We need to give Vice President –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– and it's just – He interrupted me and I'd like to just finish, please. If you have a pre-existing condition, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they're coming for you. If you love someone who has a pre existing condition –\n\nPENCE\n\nNonsense\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Senator Harris –\n\nPENCE\n\nThat’s nonsense\n\nHARRIS\n\n– they’re coming for you. If you are under the age of 26 on your parents coverage, they're coming for you.\n\n32:09 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris, thank you.\n\nHARRIS\n\nYour welcome\n\nPAGE\n\nLet me give you a chance to respond.\n\n32:12 PENCE\n\nWell I hope we have a chance to talk about health care because Obamacare was a disaster and the American people remember it well. President Trump and I have plans to improve health care and to protect, protect pre-existing conditions for every American. But look, Senator Harris, you're entitled to your own opinion but you're not entitled to your own facts –\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat’s a good line\n\nPENCE\n\nYou yourself said on multiple occasions when you were running for president that you would ban fracking. Joe Biden looked his supporter in the eye and pointed and said “I guarantee, I guarantee that we will abolish fossil fuels”. We have a $2 trillion version of the Green New Deal, Susan, that your newspaper USA TODAY said really wasn't that very different from the original Green New Deal. More taxes, more regulation, banning fracking, abolishing fossil fuel, crushing American energy and economic surrender to China is a prescription for economic decline. President Trump and I will keep America growing. The V-shape recovery that's underway right now will continue with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.\n\n33:20 PAGE\n\nThank you very, very much, Vice President Pence. Once again you provided the perfect segue to a new topic, which is climate change. And Vice President Pence, I'd like to pose the first question to you. This year we've seen record-setting hurricanes in the south. Another one, Hurricane Delta is now threatening the gulf. And we have seen record-setting wildfires in the West. Do you believe, as the scientific community has concluded, that man-made climate change has made wildfires bigger, hotter and more deadly? And it made hurricanes wetter, slower and more damaging? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n33:57 PENCE\n\nThank you Susan. Well first, I'm very proud of our record on the environment and on conservation. According to all of the best estimates, our, our air and land are cleaner than any time ever recorded. And our water is among the cleanest in the world. Just a little while ago, the president signed the Outdoors Act, the largest investment in our public lands and public parks in 100 years. So, President Trump has made a commitment to conservation and to the environment. Now with regard to climate change, the climate is changing. But the issue is, what's the cause and what do we do about it. President Trump has made it clear that we're going to continue to listen to the science. Now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, would put us back in the Paris Climate Accord. They'd impose the Green New Deal, which would crush American energy, would increase the energy cost of American families in their homes and literally would crush American jobs. President Trump and I believe that the progress that we have made in a cleaner environment has been happening precisely because we have a strong free market economy. You know what's remarkable is the United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries that are still in the Paris Climate Accord, but we've done it through innovation. And we've done it through natural gas and fracking, which, Senator, the American people can go look at the record. I know Joe Biden says otherwise now, as you do, but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning fracking.\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat’s not true\n\nPENCE\n\nAnd so by creating the kind of American innovation, we're actually steering toward a stronger and better environment. With regard to wildfires, President Trump and I believe that forest management has to be front and center, and even governor Gavin Newsome from your state has agreed we've got to work on forest management. And with regard to hurricanes, the National Oceanic Administration tells us that actually as, as difficult as they are –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President –\n\nPENCE\n\n– there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you –\n\nPENCE\n\n– but many of the climate alarmists use hurricanes and wildfires to try and –\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence, I’m sorry ,your time is up – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– sell the good of a Green New Deal. And President Trump and I are gonna always put American jobs and American workers first.\n\n36:14 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris, as the Vice President mentioned, you co-sponsored the Green New Deal in Congress, but Vice President Biden said in last week's debate that he does not support the Green New Deal. But if you look at the Biden Harris campaign website it describes the Green New Deal as a crucial framework. What exactly would be the stance of a Biden Harris Administration toward the green New Deal? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n36:43 HARRIS\n\nAlright, so first of all, I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact. I will repeat that Joe Biden has been very clear that he thinks about growing jobs, which is why he will not increase taxes for anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. Joe Biden's economic plan Moody's, which is a reputable Wall Street firm, has said will create 7 million more jobs than Donald Trump's. And part of those jobs, that will be created by Joe Biden, are going to be about clean energy and renewable energy. Because you see, Joe understands that the West Coast of our country is burning, including my home state of California. Joe sees what is happening on the Gulf states, which are being battered by storms. Joe has seen and talked with the farmers in Iowa, whose entire crops have been destroyed because of floods. And so Joe believes, again, in science. I'll tell you something, Susan, I served, when I first got to the Senate, on the committee that's responsible for the environment. Do you know this administration took the word science off the website? And then took the phrase climate change off the website? This-- We have seen a pattern with this administration which is they don't believe in science. And Joe's plan is about saying we're going to deal with it, but we're also going to create jobs. Donald Trump, when asked about the wildfires in California and the question was, you know, the science is telling us this ,you know what Donald Trump said? Science doesn't know. So, let's talk about who is prepared to lead our country over the course of the next four years on what is an existential threat to us as human beings. Joe is about saying we're going to invest that in renewable energy, we're going to be about the creation of millions of jobs, we will achieve net zero emissions by 2050, carbon neutral by 2035-- Joe has a plan. This has been a lot of talk from the Trump administration, and really it has been to go backward instead of forward. We will also reenter the climate agreement with pride.\n\n38:57 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris just said that climate change is an existential threat. Vice President Pence, do you believe that climate change poses an existential threat?\n\n39:07 PENCE\n\nAs I said, Susan, the climate is changing. We’ll follow the science, but, once again, Senator Harris is denying the fact that they're gonna raise taxes on every American. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that on day one he was going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. Those tax cuts delivered $2,000 in tax relief to the average family of four across America. And with regard to banning fracking, I just recommend that people look at the record. You yourself said repeatedly that you would ban fracking. You were the first senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. And while Joe Biden denied the Green New Deal, Susan, thank you for pointing out, the Green New Deal is on their campaign website. And as USA TODAY said, it's essentially the same plan as you co-sponsored with AOC when she submitted it in the Senate. And you just heard the senator say that she's going to resubmit America to the Paris Climate Accord. Look, the American people have always cherished our environment. We will continue to cherish it. We've made great progress reducing CO2 emissions through American innovation and the development of natural gas and fracking. We don't need a massive, $2 trillion Green New Deal that would oppose all new mandates American businesses and American families, Joe Biden wants to retrofit 4 million--\n\n40:31 PAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\n40:32 PENCE\n\n– American business buildings. It makes no sense. It will cost jobs. President Trump –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– he’s gonna put America first. He's going to put jobs first and take care of our environment and follow the science.\n\n40:45 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nHARRIS\n\nOn the issue of jobs –\n\nPAGE\n\nSenator Harris\n\nHARRIS\n\nLet's talk about that. You, the Vice President earlier referred to, as part of what he thinks is an accomplishment, the President's trade war with China. You lost that trade war. You lost it. What ended up happening is, because of a so called trade war with China, America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. Farmers have experienced bankruptcy, because of it. We are in a manufacturing recession, because of it. And when we look at this administration has been, there are estimates that by the end of the term of this administration, they will have lost more jobs than almost any other presidential administration –\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– And the American people know what I'm talking about. You know. I think about 20-year-olds, you know we have a 20-year-old, 20-something-year-old, who are coming out of high school and college right now and you're wondering, “Is there going to be a job there for me?”. We're looking at people who are trying to figure out how they're going to pay rent by the end of the month. Almost half of American renters are worried about whether they're going to be able to pay rent by the end of the month. This is where the economy is in America right now and it is because of the catastrophe and the failure of leadership of this administration.\n\n42:10 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me give you just 15 seconds to respond because then I want to move on.\n\n42:15 PENCE\n\nWell, I'd love to respond. Lose the trade war with China? Joe Biden never fought it. Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for Communist China through over the last several decades. And, and again, Senator Harris, you're entitled to your opinion, you're not entitled to your own facts. When Joe Biden was vice president, we lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs and President Obama said they were never coming back. He said we needed a magic wand to bring them back. In our first three years, after we cut taxes, rolled back regulation –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– unleashed American energy, this administration saw 500,000 jobs created –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– And that's exactly the kind of growth we're going to continue to see as we bring our nation through this pandemic –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– your Green New Deal, your massive new mandates, your Paris Climate Accord, it's gonna kill jobs this time just like it killed jobs in the last administration.\n\n43:05 HARRIS\n\nSusan, I just need to respond very briefly, please.\n\nPAGE\n\n15 seconds and then we’ll move on.\n\nHARRIS\n\nThank you. Thank you. Joe Biden is responsible for saving America's auto industry and you voted against it. So let's set the record straight. Thank you.\n\n43:19 PAGE\n\nI'd like to talk about China. We have, as our next topic, we have no more complicated or consequential foreign relationship than the one with China. It is a huge market for American agricultural goods. It’s a potential partner in dealing with climate change and North Korea. And in a video tonight, President Trump again blamed it for the coronavirus, saying “China will pay.” Vice President Pence, how would you describe our, our fundamental relationship with China? Competitors? Adversaries? Enemies? You have two minutes.\n\n43:53\n\nThank you Susan. Well let me, before I leave that, let me, let me speak to voting records, if I can. You know, everybody knows that NAFTA costs literally thousands of American factories to close. We saw automotive jobs going south of the border. President Trump fought to renegotiate NAFTA, and the United States, Mexico, Canada agreement is now the law of the land. American people deserve to know Senator Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against the USMCA. It was a huge win for American auto workers. It was a huge win for American farmers, especially dairy in the upper Midwest. But, Senator, you said it didn't go far enough on climate change, that you put your, your radical environmental agenda ahead of American auto workers and ahead of American jobs. I think the American people deserve to know that. It's probably why Newsweek magazine said that, that Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019, more liberal than Bernie Sanders, more, more liberal than any of the others in the United States Senate. So, now with regard to China, Susan, first and foremost -- China is to blame for the coronavirus. And President Trump is not happy about it. He's made that very clear. He made it clear again today. China and the World Health Organization did not play straight with the American people. They did not let our personnel into China to get information on the coronavirus until the middle of February. Fortunately, President Trump, in dealing with China from the outset of this administration -- standing up to China, that had been taking advantage of America for decades -- in the wake of Joe Biden's cheerleading for China, President Trump made that decision before the end of January to suspend all travel from China. And again, the American people deserve to know, Joe Biden opposed President Trump's decision to suspend all travel to China. He said it was hysterical, he said it was xenophobic –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence – Vice President Pence, your time is up –\n\n45:56 PENCE\n\n– but President Trump has stood up to China and will continue to stand strong.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\nWe want to improve the relationship, but we're going to level the playing field and we’re going to hold China accountable for what they did to America with the coronavirus\n\n46:09 PAGE\n\nThank you. Senator Harris, I’m going to ask you the same question that I asked the Vice President. How would you describe our fundamental relationship with China? Are we competitors, adversaries, enemies? You'll have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n46:24 HARRIS\n\nSusan, the Trump administration's perspective, and approach to China has resulted in the loss of American lives, American jobs and America's standing. There is a weird obsession that President Trump has had with getting rid of whatever accomplishment was achieved by President Obama and Vice President Biden. For example, they created, within the White House, and office that basically was just responsible for monitoring pandemics. They got away, they got rid of it.\n\n47:04 PENCE\n\nNot true.\n\n47:05 HARRIS\n\nThere was a team of disease experts that President Obama and Vice President Biden dispatched to China to monitor what is now predictable and what might happen. They pulled them out. We now are looking at 210,000 Americans who have lost their lives. Let's look at the job situation we mentioned before, the trade deal – the trade war, they wanted to call it – with China. It resulted in the loss of over 300 manufacturing jobs, and a manufacturing recession, and the American consumer paying thousands of dollars more for goods, because of that failed war, that they called it. And let's talk about standing. Pew, a reputable research firm, has done an analysis that shows that leaders of all of our formerly allied countries have now decided that they hold a greater esteem and respect Xi Jinping, the head of the Chinese Communist Party, than they do Donald Trump, the President of the United States, the commander in chief of the United States. This is where we are today, because of a failure of leadership by this administration.\n\n48:26 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris, we've seen changes in the role of the United States, in terms of global leadership, over the past four years – and of course times do change. What's your definition – we've seen strains with China, of course, as the Vice President mentioned, we’ve seen strains with our traditional allies in NATO and elsewhere. What is your definition of the role of American leadership in 2020?\n\n48:52 HARRIS\n\nSo, you know Joe is – I love talking with Joe about a lot of these issues, and you know, Joe, I think, he said, quite well. He says, you know, ‘Foreign policy: it might sound complicated, but really it's relationships there – just think about it as relationships. And so we know this, in our personal, professional relationships – you guys keep your word to your friends. Got to be loyal to your friends. People who have stood with you, got to stand with them. You got to know who your adversaries are, and keep them in check. But what we have seen with Donald Trump is that he has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world. Let's take for example, Russia. So, Russia – I serve on the Intelligence Committee of the United States Senate. America's intelligence community told us Russia interfered in the election of the President of the United States in 2016 and playing in 2020. Christopher Ray, the director of the FBI, said the same, but Donald Trump the commander in chief of the United States of America prefers to take the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of the American intelligence community. Look at our friends at NATO. He has walked away from agreements – you can look at the Iran nuclear deal, which now has put us in a position where we are less safe, because they are building up what might end up being a significant nuclear arsenal. We were in that deal, guys, we were in the Iran nuclear deal with friends and allies around the country, and because of Donald Trump's unilateral approach to foreign policy, coupled with his isolationism, he pulled us out and has made America less safe. So Susan, it's about relationships. And the thing that has always been part of the strength of our nation, in addition to our great military, has been that we keep our word. But Donald Trump doesn't understand that, because he doesn't understand what it means to be honest.\n\n50:54 PAGE\n\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President, you’ll have a chance to respond.\n\n50:59 PENCE\n\nWell, thank you. Well, President Trump kept his word when we moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel. When Joe Biden was vice president, they promised to do that and never did. We stood strong with our allies, but we've been demanding. NATO is now contributing more to our common defense than ever before. Thanks to President Trump's leadership, we strengthen our alliances across the Asia Pacific. And we've stood strong against those who would do us harm. You know when President Trump came into office, ISIS had captured an area of the Middle East, the size of Pennsylvania. President Trump unleashed the American military, and our armed forces destroyed the ISIS Caliphate and took down their leader al Baghdadi without one American casualty. al Baghdadi was responsible for the deaths of thousands. But notably, America's hearts today are with the family of Kayla Mueller, the parents of which are here with us tonight in Salt Lake City. Today, two of the ISIS killers responsible for Kayla Mueller's murder, were brought to justice in the United States. Jihadi John was killed on the battlefield, along with the other few. The reality is that when Joe Biden was vice president, we had an opportunity to save Kayla Mueller. Breaks my heart to reflect on it, but the military came into the Oval Office presented a plan. They said they knew where Kayla was. Baghdadi had held her for 18 months, abused her mercilessly before they killed her. But when Joe Biden was vice president, they hesitated for a month. And when Armed Forces finally went in, it was clear she’d been moved two days earlier, and her family says -- with a heart that broke the heart of every American -- that of President Donald Trump had been president, they believe Kayla would be alive today.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President.\n\nPENCE\n\nWe destroyed the ISIS caliphate. And you talk about reentering the Iran nuclear deal. I mean, the last administration transferred $1.8 billion to the leading state sponsor of terrorism –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President.\n\nPENCE\n\nPresident Donald Trump got us out of the deal, and when Qasim Soleimani was traveling to Baghdad, to harm two Americans, President Donald Trump took him out. And America is safer, our allies are safer and the Americans should know –\n\n53:27 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President. I would like to give Senator Harris a chance to respond, but not at such great length because of course there are other topics we want to talk about.\n\nHARRIS\n\nBut I would like equal time.\n\n53:36 PENCE\n\nYes. Please go ahead.\n\n53:41 HARRIS\n\nFirst of all, to the Mueller family, I know about your daughter's case, and I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. What happened to her is awful. And it should have never happened. And I know Joe feels the same way. And I know that President Obama feels the same way. But you mentioned Soleimani. Let’s start there. So, after the strike on Soleimani, there was a counter strike on our troops in Iraq. And they suffered serious brain injuries, and you know what Donald Trump dismissed them as? Headaches. And this is about a pattern of Donald Trump's, where he has referred to our men who are serving in our military, as suckers and losers. Donald Trump, who went to Arlington Cemetery, and stood above the graves of our fallen heroes and said, ‘What's in it for them?’ Because, of course, you know he only thinks about what's in it for him. Let's take what he said about John McCain. A great American hero. And Donald Trump says he doesn't deserve to be called a hero because he was a prisoner of war. Take – and this is, this is very important. When you want to talk about who is the current commander in chief, and what they care about and what they don't care about. Public reporting that Russia had bounties on the heads of American soldiers, and you know what a bounty is? Somebody puts a price on your head, and they will pay it if you are killed. And Donald Trump has talked at least six times to Vladmir Putin, and never brought up the subject. Joe Biden would never do that. Joe Biden – Joe Biden would hold Russia to account for any threat to our nation's security or to our troops who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of our democracy and our safety.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris. This is such an important issue, but we have other important issues as well and I want to make sure we have a chance.\n\nPENCE\n\nI really have to respond to that. She has –\n\n56:03 PAGE\n\nFifteen seconds, because –\n\n56:07 PENCE\n\nWell, I’ve got to have more than that.\n\nPAGE\n\nI'm sure, Mr. Vice President, that you had more time that she’s had, so far –\n\n56:11 PENCE\n\nThe slanders against President Donald Trump regarding men and women of our armed forces are absurd.\n\n56:18 PAGE\n\nI'm sorry, Vice President Pence –\n\n56:20 PENCE\n\nMy son is a captain in the United States Marine Corps, my son in law is deployed in the United States Navy. I can assure all of you with sons and daughters serving in our military, President Donald Trump not only respects but reveres all of those who served in our armed forces, and any suggestion otherwise it's ridiculous. Let me also say –\n\n56:47 PAGE\n\nVice President Pence. Vice President Pence. I didn’t – Vice President Pence – I did not create the rules for tonight. Your campaigns agreed to the rules for tonight’s debate,\n\nwith the Commission on Presidential Debates. I'm here to enforce them, which involves moving from one topic to another, giving roughly equal time to both of you, which is what I'm trying very hard to do. So I want to go ahead and move to the next topic, which is an important one, as the last topic was, and that is the Supreme Court. On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to open hearings on Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court. Senator Harris, you'll be there as a member of the committee. A confirmation would cement the court’s conservative majority, and make it likely open to more abortion restrictions, even to overturning the landmark Roe v Wade ruling. Access to abortion would then be up to the states. Vice President Pence, you're the former governor of Indiana. If Roe v Wade is overturned, what would you want Indiana to do? Would you want your home state to ban all abortions? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n57:49 PENCE\n\nThank you for the question, but I'll use a little bit of my time to respond to that very important key before. The American people deserve to know, Quasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, was responsible for the death of hundreds of American servicemembers. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans, President Trump didn't hesitate and Quasem Soleimani is gone. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out on Quasem Soleimani. It's really inexplicable, but with regard to Joe Biden it's explainable, because history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden. It's absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American servicemembers, and that's what you have in President Donald Trump. Now with regard to the Supreme Court of the United States. Let me say, President Trump and I could not be more enthusiastic about the opportunity to see Amy Coney Barrett become Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She's a brilliant woman, and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizable American family, to the Supreme Court of the United States. And our hope is, in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others. We hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we don't see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. Democratic Chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed to the Court of Appeals, expressed concern that the “dogma of her faith lived loudly in her.” Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees, you actually attacked because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you. Thank you, Vice President, your time is up.\n\nPENCE\n\nMy hope is that when the hearing takes place, that Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be respected –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you Vice President.\n\n59:58 PENCE\n\n– treated respectfully and voted and confirmed to the Supreme Court of United States.\n\nPAGE\n\nSenator Harris, you're the senator from and former Attorney General of California. So let me ask you a parallel question to the one I posed to the vice president. If Roe v Wade is overturned, what would you want California to do? Would you want your home state to enact no restrictions on access to abortion? And you have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n1:00:21\n\nThank you, Susan. First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And it's insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination – Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will it be, the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know it's been about an election year or election time. We're literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we'll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldn't be more serious. There's the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman's right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But let's also look at what else is before the court. It's the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic – when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because if you contracted the virus – Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I've said it before and it bears repeating: That means that there will be no protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose their coverage. It means that if you're under the age of 26, you can’t be on your parents coverage anymore. And here's the thing. The contrast couldn't be more clear. They're trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden’s saying let’s expand coverage, let's give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, let's bring down premiums, let’s lower Medicare eligibility to 60. That's true leadership.\n\n1:02:42 PAGE\n\nYou know, you mentioned earlier, Vice President Pence, that the President was committed to maintaining protections for people with pre-existing conditions and -- but you do have this court case that you are supporting, your administration is supporting, that would strike down the Affordable Care Act. The president says, President Trump says, that he's going to protect people with pre-existing conditions, but he has not explained how he will do that. So, tell us, specifically – how will your administration protect Americans with pre-existing conditions and give access to affordable insurance if the Affordable Care Act is struck down.\n\n1:03:23 PENCE\n\nWell, thank you, Susan. Let me just say, addressing your very first question, I couldn't be more proud to serve as vice president to a President who stands on a policy for the sanctity of human life. I'm pro-life. I don't apologize for it. And this is another one of those cases where there's such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion, all the way up to the moment of birth, late-term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. Now for our part, I would never presume how Jamie Kony Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States but we’ll continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden gonna pack the court if judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? There have been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases. But your party is actually openly advocating adding seats to the Supreme Court, which has had nine seats for 150 years, if you don't get your way. This is a classic case of if you can't win by the rules, you're going to change the rules. Now you've refused to answer that question, Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. I think the American people would really like to know. If Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?\n\n1:04:58 HARRIS\n\nI'm so glad to have a little history lesson. Let's do that a little more. In 1860 –\n\n1:05:05\n\nWell, I'd like you to answer the question.\n\n1:05:06 HARRIS\n\nMr. Vice President, I’m speaking. I’m speaking. In 1864, one of the, I think, political heroes – certainly the president, and I assume to you as well, Mr. Vice President – is Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection, and it was 27 days before the election, and a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln's party was in charge, not only in the White House, but the Senate. But honest Abe said it's not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next president of the United States, and then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land. And so Joe and I are very clear: the American people are voting right now. And it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime.\n\n1:06:09 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris and –\n\n1:06:11 PENCE\n\nWell, Susan. People are voting right now. They'd like to know if you and Joe Biden are gonna pack the Supreme Court of you don't get your way in this nomination.\n\n1:06:19 HARRIS\n\nLet's talk about that –\n\n1:06:21 PENCE\n\nOnce again, you gave a non-answer, Joe Biden gave a non-answer.\n\n1:06:25 HARRIS\n\nI’m answering now.\n\nPENCE\n\nThe people deserve a straight answer. And if you haven't figured it out yet, the straight answer is they are going to pack the Supreme Court if they somehow win this election. To the many people across this country: If you cherish our Supreme Court, if you cherish the separation of powers, you need to reject the Biden-Harris ticket come November the third and reelect President Donald Trump. We will stand by the separation powers and nine seats on the Supreme Court.\n\n1:06:51 HARRIS\n\nLet’s talk about packing the court then. Let's talk about.\n\nPENCE\n\nPlease –\n\nHARRIS\n\nYeah, I’m about to. So, the Trump-Pence administration has been – because I sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Susan, as you mentioned. And I've witnessed the appointments, for lifetime appointments to the federal courts, district courts, Courts of Appeal -- people who are purely ideological people who have been reviewed by legal professional organizations and found to be not competent, are substandard. And do you know that of the 50 people who President Trump appointed to the Court of Appeals for lifetime appointments, not one is Black? This is what they've been doing. You want to talk about packing a court? Let's have that discussion.\n\n1:07:38 PAGE\n\nAll right, thank you. Thank you, Senator. Let's go on to talk about the issue of racial justice.\n\n1:07:43 PENCE\n\nI just want the record to reflect, she never answered the question. Perhaps at the next debate Joe Biden will answer the question. And I think the American people know the answer.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President. In March, Breonna Taylor a 26-year-old emergency room technician in Louisville, was shot and killed after police officers executing a search warrant on a narcotics investigation broke into her apartment. The police said they identified themselves. Taylor's boyfriend said he didn't hear them do that. He used a gun registered to him to fire a shot, which wounded an officer. The officers then fired more than 20 rounds into the apartment. They say they were acting in self defense. None of them have been indicted in connection with her death. Senator Harris, in the case of Breonna Taylor, was justice done? You have two minutes.\n\n1:08:32 HARRIS\n\nI don't believe so, and I've talked with Breonna’s mother, Tamika Palmer, and her family, and she deserves justice. She was a beautiful young woman. She had as her life goal to become a nurse, and she wanted to become an EMT to first learn what's going on out on the street, so she could then become a nurse and save lives. And her life was taken, unjustifiably and tragically and violently. And it just, it brings me to, you know, the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed, during which an American man was tortured and killed under the knee of an armed, uniformed police officer. And people around our country, of every race, of every age, of every gender – perfect strangers to each other – marched shoulder to shoulder, arm and arm, fighting for us to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law. And I was a part of those peaceful protests. And I believe strongly that, first of all, we are never going to condone violence, but we always must fight for the values that we hold dear, including the sight to achieve our ideals. And that's why Joe Biden and I have said on this subject, look, and I'm a prosecutor. I know what I'm talking about. Bad cops are bad for good cops. We need reform of our policing in America and our criminal justice system, which is why Joe and I will immediately ban chokeholds and carotid holds. George Ford would be alive today if we did that. We will require a national registry for police officers who break the law, we will – on the issue of criminal justice reform – get rid of private prisons and cash bail and we will decriminalize marijuana, and we will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me pose the same question to you. In the case of Breonna Taylor, was justice done? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n1:11:00 PENCE\n\nWell our heart breaks for the loss of any innocent American lives, and the family of Breonna Taylor has our sympathies. But I trust our justice system, a grand jury that reviews the evidence. And it really is remarkable, that as a former prosecutor, you would assume that in a panel grand jury, looking at all the evidence, got it all wrong. But you're entitled to your opinion, Senator. And with regard to George Floyd, there's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. Justice will be served. But there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed. I mean, it really is astonishing. Flora Westbrook is with us here tonight in Salt Lake City. Just a few weeks ago, I stood at what used to be her salon, was burned to the ground. By rioters and looters. And Flora is still trying to put her life back together. And I must say this, this presumption that you hear consistently from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that America is systemically racist. That asJoe Biden said, that he believes that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities, is a great insult to the men and women who serve in law enforcement. And I want everyone to know, who puts on the uniform of law enforcement every day, that President Trump and I stand with you. It is remarkable that Senator Tim Scott tried to pass a police reform bill, brought together a group of Republicans and Democrats – Senator Harris, you got up and walked out of the room. And then you filibustered Senator Tim Scott's bill on the Senate floor that would have provided new accountability, new resources. But we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement, providing public safety, and supporting our African American neighbors and all other minorities. Under President Trump's leadership –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Mr. Vice President\n\nPENCE\n\n– we will always stand with law enforcement and we'll do what we can -- we have improved the lives of African Americans. Record unemployment, record –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Mr. Vice President.\n\n1:13:18 PENCE\n\n– Fight for school choice, for –\n\n1:13:22 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris.\n\n1:13:24 HARRIS\n\nI will not sit here and be lectured by the Vice President on what it means to enforce the laws of our country. I'm the only one on this stage who has personally prosecuted everything from child sexual assaults to homicide. I'm the only one on the stage who has prosecuted the big banks for taking advantage of American families. I am the only one on this stage who prosecuted for-profit colleges for taking advantage of our veterans. And the reality of this is, that we are talking about an election in 27 days where last week, the President of the United States took the debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists. And –\n\nPENCE\n\nNot true.\n\nHARRIS\n\n– it wasn't like he didn't have a chance. He didn't do it, and then he doubled down. And then he said, when pressed, ‘Stand back. Stand by.’ And this is a part of a pattern of Donald Trump. He was – he called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He instituted as his first act a Muslim ban. He, on the issue of Charlottesville, where people were peacefully protesting the need for racial justice, where a young woman was killed and on the other side there were neo-Nazis carrying tiki torches shouting racial epithets, anti semitic slurs. And Donald Trump, when asked about it, said there were fine people on both sides. This is who we have as the President of the United States. And America, you deserve better. Joe Biden will be a president who brings our country together.\n\nPAGE\n\nSenator Harris –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– and recognizes the beauty in our diversity and the fact that we all spend so much more in common than what separates us.\n\n1:15:19 PAGE\n\nVice President, I’m going to give you a minute to respond.\n\n1:15:21 PENCE\n\nThank you, Susan. I appreciate that very much. I think that's one of the things that makes people dislike the media so much in this country. That you selectively edited, like Senator Harris did, a promise that President Trump and I, and others on our side of the aisle make. Senator Harris conveniently omitted, after the President made comments about people on either side of the debate over monuments, he condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and has done so repeatedly. Your concern that he doesn't condemn neo-Nazis – President Trump has Jewish grandchildren. This is a president who respects and cherishes all of the American people. But you talk about having personally prosecuted – glad you brought up your records.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you.\n\nPENCE\n\nI really need to make this point. When you were DA in San Francisco, when you held that office, African Americans were 19 times more likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offenses than whites and Hispanics. When you were Attorney General of California, you increased the disproportionate incarceration of Blacks in California. You did nothing on criminal justice reform in California. You didn't lift a finger to pass the first step back on Capitol Hill. The reality is, you're representing yourself. President Trump and I have fought for criminal justice, for –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence\n\nPENCE\n\n– for for educational choice and opportunities for African Americans –\n\n1:16:53 PAGE\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nPENCE\n\nAnd we'll do it for four more.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you. You know there is no more important issue than the final issue that we're going to talk about tonight, and that is the issue of the election itself.\n\n1:17:03 HARRIS\n\nListen, he attacked my record. I would like the opportunity to respond.\n\n1:17:06 PAGE\n\nLet me give you 30 seconds because we're running out of time.\n\n1:17:09 HARRIS\n\nI appreciate that. First of all, having served as the Attorney General of the State of California, the work that I did is a model of what our nation needs to do and we will be able to do under a Joe Biden presidency. Our agenda includes what this administration has failed to do. It will be about not only instituting a ban on chokeholds and carotid holes.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you.\n\nHARRIS\n\nI don't think, I would like to go through –\n\n1:17:38 PAGE\n\nThese are points that you made earlier in the hour and I want to talk about the election itself before we have to –\n\n1:17:43 HARRIS\n\nBut I want to talk about the connection between what Joe and I will do and my record, which includes – I was the first statewide officer to institute a requirement that my agents would wear body cameras and keep them on full time. We were the first to initiate a requirement that there would be a training for law enforcement on implicit bias, because yes, Joe Biden I recognize that implicit bias does exist, Mr. Vice President, contrary to what you may believe. We did the work of instituting reforms that were about investing in reentry. This is the work that we have done and the work we will do going forward and, again, I will not be lectured by the Vice President, on our record of what we have done in terms of law enforcement and keeping our community safe and a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system of America.\n\n1:18:32 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris, and I'd like to pose the – I'd like you to respond first to the question on our final topic, the election itself. President Trump has, several times, refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If your ticket wins and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what steps would you and Vice President Biden then take? What would happen next? You have two minutes.\n\n1:19:00 HARRIS\n\nSo, I'll tell you. Joe and I are particularly proud of the coalition we've built around our campaign. We probably have one of the broadest coalition's of folks that you've ever seen in a presidential race. Of course we have the support of Democrats, but also independents and Republicans, in fact, seven members of President George W Bush's cabinet are supporting our ticket. We have the support of Colin Powell, Cindy McCain, John Kasich, over 500 generals, retired generals, and former national security experts and advisors are supporting our campaign. And I believe they are doing that because they know that Joe Biden has a deep, deep seated commitment to fight for our democracy, and to fight for the integrity of our democracy, and to bring integrity back to the White House. And so, we believe in the American people. We believe in our democracy. And here's what I'd like to say to everybody: vote. Please vote, vote early, come up with a plan to vote, go to IWillVote.com. You can also go to Joe Biden.com. We have it within our power in these next 27 days to make the decision about what will be the course of our country for the next four years. And it is within our power, and if we use our vote, and we use our voice, we will win. And we will not let anyone subvert our democracy, with what Donald Trump has been doing as he did on the debate stage last week, when again in front of 70 million people, he openly attempted to suppress the vote. Joe Biden, on the other hand, on that same debate stage – because clearly Donald Trump doesn't think he can run on a record because it's a failed record – Joe Biden said on that stage, said, ‘Hey, just please vote.’ So I'll repeat what Joe said. Please vote.\n\n1:20:58 PAGE\n\nPlease vote. Thank you, Senator. Vice President Pence, President Trump has several times refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If Vice President Biden is declared the winner and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what would be your role and responsibility as Vice President? What would you personally do? You have two minutes.\n\n1:21:22 PENCE\n\nWell, Susan, first and foremost, I think we're gonna win this election. Because while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany, the establishment in Washington DC and the establishments Joe Biden's been a part of for 47 years. President Donald Trump has launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And I have every confidence that the same Americans that delivered that historic victory in 2016, they see this President's record, where we rebuild our military, we revived our economy through tax cuts and rolling back regulation, fighting for fair trade, unleashing American energy. We appointed conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And we stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day, and I think, I think that movement of Americans has only grown stronger in the last four years. When you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election. It's amazing. When Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, the FBI actually spied on President Trump and my campaign. I mean there were documents released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign, and of course, we've all seen the avalanche with the -- what, what country’s been through for, for the better part of three years, until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion, case closed. And then Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the president of the United States, over a phone call. And now Hillary Clinton has actually said to Joe Biden that under, in her words, under no circumstances should he concede election. So let me just say, I think we're gonna win this election. President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail-in voting, they'll create a massive opportunity for voter fraud. We have a free and fair election; we know we're going to have confidence in it. And I believe in all my heart that President Donald Trump's gonna be reelected for four more years.\n\n1:23:33 PAGE\n\nYou know I've, I've asked – I've written all the questions that I've asked tonight, but for the final question of the debate, I'd like to read a question that someone else wrote. The Utah Debate Commission asked students in the state to write essays about what they would like to ask. And I want to close tonight's debate with the question posed by Brecklyn Brown. She's an eighth grader at Springville Junior High in Springville, Utah, and here's what she wrote. Quote – “When I watch the news, all I see is arguing between Democrats and Republicans. When I watch the news, all I see is citizen fighting against citizen. When I watch the news, all I see are two candidate parties, trying to tear each other down. If our leaders can't get along, how are the citizens supposed to get along?” And then she added, “Your examples could make all the difference to bring us together” – end quote. So for each of you, in turn, I’d like you to take one minute, and respond to Brecklyn. Vice President Pence.\n\n1:24:37 PENCE\n\nBrecklyn, it's a wonderful question. And let me just commend you for your interest in in public. I started following the news when I was very young. And in America, we believe in a free and open exchange of debate. And we celebrate that as how we could, literally, the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. And I will tell you that –don't assume that what you're saying on your local news networks is synonymous with the American people. You know, I looked at the relationship between Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the late justice who we just lost from the Supreme Court, and the late Justice Antonin Scalia. They were on polar opposites, on the Supreme Court of the United States – one very liberal, one very conservative. But what's been learned since her passing was the two of them and their families were the very closest of friends. And here in America, we can disagree we can debate vigorously as Senator Harris and I have on the stage tonight. But when the debate is over, we come together as Americans. That's what people do in big cities and small towns all across this country, so I just want to encourage you, Brecklyn, I want to tell you that we're going to work every day to have a government as good as our people, the American people, each and every day. We love a good debate. We love a good argument. We always come together and are always there for one another. And we've especially learned that during the difficulties of this year.\n\n1:26:17 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President. Senator Harris, what would you say to Brecklyn.\n\n1:26:20 HARRIS\n\nFirst of all, I love to hear from our young leaders, and when I hear her words, when I hear your words, Brecklyn, I know our future is bright, because it is that perspective on who we are and who we should be – that is a sign of leadership and it's something we should all aspire to be.\n\nAnd that you know that brings me to Joe. Joe Biden – one of the reasons that Joe decided to run for president, is after Charlottesville, which we talked about earlier, it so troubled him and upset him, like it did all of us, that there was that kind of hate and division. What propelled Joe to run for president was to see that, over the course of the last four years, what Brecklyn described has been happening. Joe has a long standing reputation of working across the aisle and working in a bipartisan way. And that's what he's going to do as President. Joe Biden has a history of lifting people up and fighting for their dignity. You mean you have to know Joe's story to know that Joe has known pain, he has known suffering, and he has known love. And so, Brecklyn, when you think about the future, I do believe the future is bright. And it will be because of your leadership, and it will be, because we fight for each person's voice through their vote. And we get engaged in this election, because you have the ability through your work, and through, eventually, your vote. To determine the future of our country, and what its leadership looks like.\n\n1:27:58 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris, thank you, Vice President Pence, and thank you so much for being with us tonight. We want to thank, also, the University of Utah for its hospitality, and most of all our thanks to all the Americans who watched this debate tonight. Again, our best wishes for a quick recovery to President Trump, the First Lady and everyone who is battling COVID-19. The second presidential debate is next week on October 15, a town hall style debate in Miami. We hope you'll join us then.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/08/kamala-harris-debate-style-donald-trump/74740048007/", "title": "Kamala Harris has some debate moves. I know. I moderated her last ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Donald Trump seemed so confident he'd rout Kamala Harris in a televised debate that last month he proposed holding three of them.\n\nWe'll find out Tuesday if he was right.\n\nIn the vice-presidential debate on Oct. 7, 2020, facing off against Mike Pence, Harris held her own. She displayed her command as a prosecutor in demanding that Pence stop interrupting her, potentially useful practice when Trump is her opponent on the debate stage. She showed the discipline to stick to her talking points even when, or maybe especially when, she was dodging the actual question that had been asked.\n\nI know. I was the moderator for Harris' last turn on the debate stage.\n\nSponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, it was held in Salt Lake City before an audience that generally heeded my entreaties beforehand to stay out of the way, to avoid cheering or booing until it was over.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThis time, ABC News is sponsoring Tuesday's debate between Trump and Harris, with anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis as moderators.\n\nWhen Trump and President Joe Biden debated in June on CNN, Biden's performance was so faltering that the ensuing furor led him to withdraw from the 2024 election altogether. That may have fed Trump's confidence about prevailing in debates.\n\nNow Trump is comparing Harris unfavorably even with the president. \"She's actually not as smart as he is,\" he said in early August during a news conference at Mar-a-Lago, expressing his eagerness to debate by accepting invitations from Fox News and NBC, too. \"I don't think he's very smart either, by the way.\"\n\nDuring some of the Democratic primary debates in the 2020 election cycle, Harris didn't seem certain what she thought about Medicare-for-all and other big issues − stumbles that contributed to the departure of the California senator from the nominating contest even before the Iowa caucuses had been held.\n\nSince becoming her party's presumptive presidential nominee this time, though, Harris has been sharper and more energetic at campaign rallies than Biden, with an ability to needle Trump with humor. (\"I know his type,\" she says in an oft-repeated riff that resonates with her crowds.)\n\nDebates demand different skills than rallies, of course, which typically follow a script and often use teleprompters. Backstage before the 2020 debate, both Harris and Pence seemed wound pretty tight, and understandably so.\n\nHere are some of my takeaways from what happened next.\n\n'Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking'\n\nWhile Pence had a reputation as a polite Hoosier who played by the rules, for the vice-presidential debate he seemed to have taken lessons from Trump. He bulldozed past the time limits that had been agreed to beforehand by the two campaigns and repeatedly interrupted Harris.\n\nOr tried to.\n\n\"Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking,\" she said at the nine-minute mark when he interrupted her answer about the Trump administration's response to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n\"Well, I have to weigh in − \" he began.\n\n\"I'm speaking,\" she repeated with more force. It was an effective and presumably preplanned tactic. The \"Mr. Vice President\" honorific made her sound respectful. The \"I'm speaking\" follow-up made him risk seeming disrespectful if he continued talking.\n\nThe ground rules are different this time, with the candidates' microphones muted when they aren't supposed to be speaking. Still, a similar standoff might do more to unnerve Trump, who has struggled to find the comfortable footing in challenging Harris that he had shown against Biden. Among other things, Trump drew criticism for questioning Harris' racial identity before an audience of Black journalists.\n\nIn the 2020 debate, Pence interjected comments again at the 30-minute mark, when Harris was talking about taxes.\n\n\"Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking,\" she said.\n\n\"Well −\" he began.\n\n\"I'm speaking,\" she repeated, with a don't-test-me glare in his direction.\n\n\"It'd be important if you said the truth,\" he replied, sparking a word-salad of mutual protests over what, exactly, Biden would do about taxes if elected.\n\n\"If you don't mind letting me finish ...\" Harris finally said.\n\n\"Please,\" Pence replied with a sarcastic edge.\n\n\"We can then have a conversation,\" she finished.\n\nFinally, Pence tried again at the 65-minute mark as she was about to answer a question about the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking,\" she said. \"I'm speaking.\"\n\nPence finally stopped speaking out of turn. It's just possible she was more successful than I was in enforcing that rule.\n\nThe discipline of the dodge\n\nThe value of debates is their spontaneity, their ability to force candidates to address issues they choose to avoid in the campaign events they control.\n\nThat spontaneity is also the danger for the candidates.\n\nHence, the debate dodge.\n\nI asked Harris four years ago if she had discussed with Biden \"safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability,\" given his age. Did she think she should?\n\n\"So let me tell you first of all, on the call from Joe Biden, it was actually a Zoom call, asking me to serve with him on this ticket was probably one of the most memorable, memorable days in my life,\" she began, then filled her two-minute time period with a tribute to Biden's willingness to choose a groundbreaking running mate and a fond reminisce about her mother.\n\nShe \"came to the United States at the age of 19, gave birth to me at the age of 25 at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California,\" she said, though it was Biden's date of birth that would have been more relevant. Biden was 77 at the time of the Harris-Pence debate, while Trump was 74 and just days removed from a COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\nBy the way, when I asked Pence the same question, he went even further afield, touting instead the record-setting development of a COVID vaccine by the Trump administration.\n\nAt the time, the Supreme Court was considering the case challenging Roe v. Wade. If the high court did eliminate the access to abortion enshrined in that decision − as it later did − I asked Harris if she would want her home state of California to enact abortion rights with no restrictions.\n\n\"I will always fight for a woman's right to make a decision about her own body,\" she replied after some warm-up words, never addressing whether she would back any restrictions. Then she attacked the Republicans for trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a separate issue entirely.\n\nRemember the fly?\n\nThe plexiglass barriers between Pence and Harris, designed as protection during the pandemic, looked a little peculiar on stage.\n\nBut nothing was stranger than the fly that somehow breached security, flew into the middle of the University of Utah stage and landed on Pence's head, where it took up residence for a time. The vice president's silvery white hair made it hard to miss − at least for the millions of viewers watching on television.\n\nNot to me. I couldn't see it. Pence didn't know it was there, either, he told me afterwards. I heard that Harris could see it but decided against mentioning it. After all, what exactly could she have said? \"Mr. Vice President, there's a fly on your head\"?\n\nThat was not an issue strategists had presumably discussed during debate prep, so her restraint showed good judgment on the fly. So to speak.\n\nAnd the winner was. . .\n\nWhen the debate ended and the TV cameras stopped, both candidates looked as though they were more relieved that they had survived than confident they had won. As arranged beforehand, Pence exited stage right and Harris stage left, where family members were waiting.\n\nThat was pretty much what the polls afterwards indicated. Harris had a good night, but Pence didn't have a bad one − and neither performance had a meaningful impact on the outcome of the election.\n\nAn Ipsos poll of respondents taken before and again afterwards showed Harris improved her favorability ratings a bit, to 51% from 45%, while Pence's favorability edged up a whisker, to 39% from 37%. A CNN poll found by 59%-38% respondents said Harris did a better job than Pence.\n\nBut the head-to-head presidential race in the Ipsos poll didn't budge, and a majority in the CNN poll said the debate had no effect on their vote.\n\nThat's not surprising, given that it was a debate between the vice-presidential contenders.\n\nThe stakes will be higher, and the impact almost certainly greater, with the debate this time between the candidates at the top of the ticket.\n\nSusan Page is the Washington Bureau chief of USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/08"}]}

The duo earned nominations by winning the Orpheum High School Musical Theatre Awards, making them the Memphis regional representatives. Top performers at the the Jimmy Awards received scholarships ranging from $2,000 to $10,000.\n\n“Just one week (earlier), we were 80 high school theater lovers, and now we were going to make our Broadway debut on one of the most beautiful stages in New York,” said Beckham, who will attend Baldwin Wallace University in Ohio this fall. “I think that being on the same stage as 'The Lion King' cast made us not only grateful for this opportunity, but also added an extra layer of determination.”\n\nYoung said the experience motivated him to make his dreams of becoming a Broadway performer a reality.\n\n“At times, I couldn’t even fathom that I was there on the stage,” Young said. “It felt like (hopefully) a glimpse into the near future, and it definitely inspired me to work hard to put myself into a position where a stage like that becomes home, not just a one-time opportunity.”\n\nDuring the show, Young performed a solo rendition of “Memphis Lives in Me” from \"Memphis.\" The Hernando High graduate channeled thoughts of his late grandfather, who passed away earlier in the week, to “drive the passion in the song.\"\n\n“When I stepped out there to sing, it felt unreal,” Young said. “I already had a connection to the piece because I am from the Memphis area and I’m going to the University of Memphis. Just like in my coaching during the week, I pictured the city of Memphis out in the crowd as I sang.”\n\nYoung’s performance helped him finish the awards show as one of eight finalists and the winner of a $3,000 scholarship.\n\nBeckham, an Evangelical Christian School graduate, was awarded a $2,000 scholarship as one of six Special Recognition Scholars.\n\nThe 80 participants underwent a grueling professional training intensive at NYU Tisch School of the Arts during the week leading up to the Jimmy Awards. They received mentoring from several highly-decorated industry professionals including Tony Award nominee Howard McGillin and Adam Kantor, a current Broadway performer in the Tony Award-winning \"The Band’s Visit.\"\n\n“We had to be mentally and physically prepared for 14-hour rehearsal days,” Beckham said. “The days would start with some early-morning yoga instructed by one of Broadway’s best. After we stretched and warmed up, we would alternate reviewing choreography, learning new music and singing in coaching sessions with current Broadway professionals.”\n\nDespite long hours and intense instruction, Young and Beckham left New York with dozens of new friends, newfound confidence and a sense of pride for representing Memphis and the Orpheum Theatre.\n\n\"It was incredible meeting people my age from all over the country who love theater just as much as me,\" Beckham said. \"When I told the other nominees I was from Memphis, they all smiled because they thought it was amazing that I got to represent a city so rich in music history.\"\n\n\"My biggest takeaways (from my experience) are that I do have what it takes to succeed in this business — you have to love yourself foremost to succeed, and that everyone has very specific special talents,\" Young said. \"Believing in your abilities and who you are tops all.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/theater/2023/03/10/broadway-plays-musicals-opening-new-york/69857959007/", "title": "Broadway: plays and musicals opening soon in New York", "text": "Start spreading the news, the spring Broadway season is underway, with 17 shows opening through Thursday, April 27.\n\nThere are some big productions coming, including \"New York, New York,\" inspired by the MGM movie, featuring music and lyrics by John Kander and Fred Ebb.

But coming off the most crowded spring in recent memory, no consensus has formed around any of the five vastly different shows nominated for best musical, which include an Alicia Keys passion project and a suffragist history lesson produced by Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt’s also the most star-studded Tonys in a while, with Rachel McAdams (“Mary Jane”), Eddie Redmayne (\"Cabaret”) and Jim Parsons (\"Mother Play\") all vying for top trophies. Here’s everything you need to know going into this weekend’s ceremony:\n\nInterview:'Merrily We Roll Along' made them old friends. Now, the cast is 'dreading' saying goodbye.\n\nWhen are the Tonys this year?\n\nThe Tonys will take place Sunday, June 16, at the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center in New York. It’s the first time Lincoln Center will host the awards, which have long been held at Radio City Music Hall. (Last year, the telecast moved to Washington Heights’ United Palace.)\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nHow can I watch the Tony Awards?\n\nThe ceremony will air live on Sunday, June 16, on CBS (8 EST/PST) and stream on Paramount + for subscribers. Julianne Hough (“Dancing with the Stars”) and Utkarsh Ambudkar (“Ghosts”) will also host a pre-show streaming free on Pluto TV (6:30 EST / 3:30 PST), during which the first round of awards will be handed out.\n\nWho is hosting the 2024 Tonys?\n\nOscar winner Ariana DeBose is returning to host the show for a third consecutive year. The “West Side Story” star (and “Hamilton” Broadway vet) teased her opening number on Instagram with a series of rehearsal snaps. DeBose memorably opened the 2022 telecast with an earnest mashup of dozens of showtunes. And last year, due to the Hollywood writers’ strike, she opted for a lively, wordless dance performance to kick off the proceedings.\n\nWho is presenting at the Tony Awards?\n\nPrevious Tony winners Cynthia Erivo, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Ben Platt, Idina Menzel, Adrienne Warren, Jennifer Hudson, Jeffrey Wright, and Sean Hayes are all lined up to present during Sunday’s show, as are “Gutenberg” musical stars Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells. Angelina Jolie, a producer on “The Outsiders,” is also set to present, along with Nick Jonas, Ashley Park and “After Midnight” host Taylor Tomlinson.\n\nBest of Broadway:10 new shows you need to see this summer, including 'Illinoise'\n\nWho is performing at the Tonys? Watch out for ‘Stereophonic.'\n\nWith the exception of “Gutenberg,” which closed early this year, all the nominees for best musical and best musical revival will be performing on the telecast, including “The Who’s Tommy” and “Cabaret.”\n\n“Stereophonic,” this year’s buzzy new play partly inspired by Fleetwood Mac, was also added to the lineup Wednesday. The announcement was made following days of outcry from theater fans, after playwright David Adjmi revealed on social media that the Tonys initially rejected the rock drama’s request to perform.\n\nWhich shows are nominated for best musical at the 2024 Tonys?\n\nUnlike past years, where critical darlings “Kimberly Akimbo” and “A Strange Loop” were presumed frontrunners all season long, this year’s winner is anybody’s guess. Alicia Keys’ feel-good “Hell’s Kitchen” leads the pack with 13 nominations, but the Tonys’ biggest prize has rarely gone to a jukebox show. “Illinoise,” a dance piece set to the songs of Sufjan Stevens, is breathtaking and beloved by critics. Although, some voters may hesitate to call it a musical, given that it’s dialogue-free and movement-driven.\n\n“Suffs,” about women’s fight to vote, is certainly the timeliest offering, while “Water for Elephants” may hoodwink folks with its dazzling circus spectacle. But we’re placing money on “The Outsiders” to eke out a victory. Adapted from S.E. Hinton’s 1967 novel, the new musical is already a box-office hit among youngsters and their parents. More importantly, its artful staging and affecting performances make it just highbrow enough to appease snootier voters. Stay gold indeed.\n\nWhat are our other 2024 Tony predictions?\n\nIn addition to best musical, there are plenty of other races that are seemingly too close to call. Jessica Lange (“Mother Play”) and Sarah Paulson (“Appropriate”) are neck and neck for best leading actress in a play, although we give the edge to Paulson, whose family melodrama is expected to pick up an armful of trophies throughout the night. Jeremy Strong (“An Enemy of the People”) and Leslie Odom Jr. (“Purlie Victorious\") are similarly a toss up in leading actor, while Odom’s castmate Kara Young should earn a well-deserved Tony after three consecutive nominations. But look out for a featured actress spoiler in Sarah Pidgeon, whose “Stereophonic” has huge momentum as the most Tony-nominated play in history.\n\nThe musical acting races are also up for grabs, with veteran Kelli O’Hara (“Days of Wine and Roses”) squaring off against newcomer Maleah Joi Moon (“Hell’s Kitchen”) in best leading actress. If there are any sure things going into Sunday’s ceremony, “Merrily We Roll Along” co-stars Jonathan Groff and Daniel Radcliffe are all but assured to scoop up their first Tony wins for leading and featured actor, respectively.

By flipping the \"P\" to \"b,\" the restaurant generated some buzz to promote a new line-up of beef patties.\n\nReverting to the original name is aimed to draw diners back to its core breakfast business -- in particular, a 60-cent pancakes promotion on July 17 celebrating IHOP's 60th birthday.\n\n\"We knew we had a very tough job to do to convince people that we take our burgers as seriously as we take our pancakes,\" said Stephanie Peterson, IHOP’s executive director of communications. \"So, we went bold with the campaign.\"\n\nThe chain originally hinted at a name change on Twitter at the beginning of June, as it first revealed the \"IHOb\" name. One week later, on June 11, the company officially announced the change.\n\nThe name-change move accomplished what appears to have been its core goal: It got people talking. IHOP's Word of Mouth Score rose in the week following its announcement, according to YouGov, which tracks the perception of more than 1,500 brands daily through its BrandIndex.\n\nHowever, IHOP's rebranding effort did not create a significant increase in the company's purchase consideration, which measures the likelihood of consumers eating at a particular restaurant chain, YouGov found.\n\nJust as reactions were mixed to IHOP's original name change, there has also been a variety of comments with this switch back, ranging from appreciation to sass.\n\nThough the company has officially changed its name back to IHOP, it confirmed on Twitter that it will still be selling its new burger line.\n\nFollow USA TODAY intern Ben Tobin on Twitter: @TobinBen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump announces a White House bid for 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered.\n\nSurrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office.Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign.

In terms of layoffs, Minnis said it’s too soon to tell who or how many, but he said there will be duplications and some employees will be impacted.\n\nNtelos stockholders will receive approximately $208 million in cash, or $9.25 per share. That’s a roughly 60-percent premium over the 30-day volume weighted average price of Ntelos' stock as of Aug. 7, according to an Ntelos release.\n\n\"Ntelos is a long standing corporate citizen and major employer in Waynesboro, with just under 200 employees,\" Greg Hitchin, Waynesboro Economic Development Director said in an email. \"While it is too early to state what affect the sale will have on Waynesboro, we are looking forward to working with Shentel during this transition.”\n\nCustomers under contract will be transitioned to Sprint at the same rate plan. Minnis said, “Our customers would not have to do anything throughout this process… Their bill will stop saying nTelos and start saying Sprint.”\n\nShentel will assume Ntelos' net debt, which, when adjusted for the ongoing sale of its eastern Virginia markets, stood at approximately $431 million as of June 30. Shentel will finance the acquisition with a new, expanded credit facility.\n\nShentel will expand its relationship with Sprint. Ntelos provided regional Sprint customers with their connectivity and used Sprint’s network outside of the region to service its customers. The Ntelos name will disappear. Ntelos’ retail stores will convert into Sprint-branded stores that will be managed by Shentel.\n\nThe Ntelos name was born in 2000 as a rebranding of CFW Communications, which had expanded through purchases and wanted to put its products under a single name. The CFW name was originally a nod to the local phone company’s Clifton Forge and Waynesboro roots.\n\nThat new combined, debt-ridden company declared bankruptcy in 2003, with the company’s assets going to creditors and leaving long-time stockholders — some of them local — out in the cold. The reorganized, post-bankruptcy company, again went public in 2006.\n\nSince then, the Ntelos name has remained, despite the spinoff of the company’s digital network and landline phone business into an independent company, Lumos Networks.\n\nNow, with this change, the Ntelos name will vanish just as the CFW name did before it.\n\nThe acquisition of Ntelos by Shentel, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, is expected to close in early 2016, the companies said.\n\nIn a separate release, Shentel said it will pick up about 298,000 Ntelos subscribers, giving it more than 1 million wireless customers overall. It plans to invest $300 million to speed the upgrade of Ntelos’ former network to 4G LTE.\n\nEdinburg-based Shenandoah Telecommunications companies provide local and long distance telephone, Internet and data services, cable television, wireless voice and data services, alarm monitoring, and telecommunications equipment in the mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/10/18/cca-announces-ice-contract-extension/92355068/", "title": "CCA announces ICE contract extension", "text": "Jamie McGee\n\njmcgee@tennessean.com\n\nCorrections Corporation of America, a Nashville-based operator of prisons and detention centers, has extended a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a positive sign for the troubled company.\n\n\n\nThe contract renewal comes weeks after the Department of Homeland Security announced it would be evaluating ICE’s contracts with private operators and the Department of Justice said it would end contracts with private companies running prisons on concerns of safety and security.\n\nCCA shares have tumbled in the aftermath of the announcements, falling 47 percent through Monday, and the company announced a restructuring in September that would include 55 layoffs. CCA shares climbed 1.4 percent Tuesday to $14.55.\n\n“It’s notable with this ongoing review that here we are, the 18th of October, we are announcing this extension of the contract,” CEO Damon Hininger said in a conference call Tuesday. “We think we have a great, great story to show, what we've done historically, and they'll come to the same conclusion that, we've been a really, really good tool for ICE.\"\n\nThe contract, which lasts through 2021, concerns a 2,400-bed South Texas Family Residential Center. As part of the agreement, CCA will drop costs by 40 percent, mainly through staff reductions, CCA officials said. The contract was made originally in 2014, when the country faced an influx of border crossings that reached crisis level, according to the company. The center is now operating in a more normalized environment.\n\nThe Texas center is one of CCA's eight facilities contracting with ICE that will be assessed by an ICE subcommittee. In making the case for an ongoing relationship with ICE, Hininger pointed to its \"high-quality services,\" as well as the cost to replace CCA operations.\n\n\"Building, staffing and operating new facilities to replace all the capacity currently provided by the private sector would cost ICE billions of dollars and result in costly long-term obligations,\" Hininger said. \"By contracting for capacity of services from private providers, like CCA, ICE is able to avoid being committed long-term to these obligations and utilize the flexibility of the private sector to meet its changing needs. We believe we provide these needed solutions at a meaningful cost savings to the American taxpayer and are confident the subcommittee's review will draw similar conclusions.\"\n\nThe South Texas Family Residential Center was the subject of an Aug. 14 Washington Post article that said CCA was paid the same regardless of the number of beds occupied. Fourteen percent of CCA's 2015 revenue came from the center, according to the Washington Post, citing financial documents concerning the deal and interviews with immigration and homeland security officials.\n\nCCA officials said Tuesday that the new ICE contract includes a fixed monthly rate.\n\nWhile its three contracts with the Federal Bureau of Prisons are still a concern for the company, CCA officials said conversations have increased with both state officials and ICE, as the number of border crossings grows.

The franchise did not immediately announce a new name for its team, or when it will finalize its new branding.\n\n\"Dan Snyder and Coach (Ron) Rivera are working closely to develop a new name and design approach that will enhance the standing of our proud, tradition rich franchise and inspire our sponsors, fans and community for the next 100 years,\" the team said in a statement.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThe decision to retire \"Redskins\" comes as the team conducts a formal review of the name, which was announced July 3 amid mounting pressure from key stakeholders — including FedEx, a major sponsor that holds the naming rights at the team's stadium.\n\nIt also follows decades of simmering frustration from many Native Americans and activists, who have criticized the name as either insensitive or downright racist.\n\n\"Today we celebrate the retirement of the Washington NFL football team name that has long perpetuated racism and harm against Native peoples,\" said Crystal Echo Hawk, the executive director of IllumiNative, a nonprofit that has long advocated for name to be changed.\n\n\"We will not rest until the offensive use of Native imagery, logos, and names are eradicated from professional, collegiate, and K-12 sports. The time is now to stand in solidarity and declare that racism will not be tolerated.\"\n\nWashington will be the first NFL franchise to change its team name without moving to a new city in the same year since the Tennessee Oilers became the Tennessee Titans in 1998, less than two years removed from the franchise's relocation from Houston. And it will be the first major professional sports team to make such a change since 2013, when the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats became the Hornets.\n\nAnother team with a Native American mascot, Major League Baseball's Cleveland Indians, also announced earlier this month that it would explore changing its team name. Manager Terry Francona is among those who have expressed support for a change.\n\nFOUNDATION:Dan Snyder's once-touted Native American foundation has gone dark\n\nFor Washington, Monday's change marks the end of an 87-year stretch under the name. The franchise, which was originally based in Boston, switched to \"Redskins\" from Braves in July 1933. Owner George Preston Marshall moved the team to Washington a little less than four years later.\n\nSnyder, 55, purchased the team in 1999 and has defied calls to change the name since.\n\nFor years, the billionaire argued that the \"Redskins\" moniker was a meaningful part of the team's history, one that dates back to the early days of the NFL and includes three Super Bowl titles. He pointed to favorable polls, which he equated to proof that most Native Americans do not find the name offensive. Publicly, he declined to so much as even entertain the idea of rebranding the team.\n\n\"I think that the Redskins fans understand the great tradition and what it's all about and what it means,\" Snyder told USA TODAY Sports in 2013.\n\nMeanwhile, the chorus calling for change has grown, particularly in recent years.\n\nThere was a renewed — and, ultimately, unsuccessful — legal push to revoke the team's trademarks in the past decade, on the grounds that the name is disparaging to Native Americans. Several high schools moved to abandon the name and find new monikers for their sports teams. And well-known figures, including then-President Barack Obama in 2015, have publicly urged Washington to make a change.\n\nThen, in May, the death of George Floyd brought increased attention to issues of racial injustice across American society — including within the NFL.\n\nAs the league took steps to condemn racism, many began to wonder: What about Washington's team name?\n\nWith pressure continuing to swell, Snyder and his associates began having conversations with the league office about the name. FedEx — which holds the naming rights to Washington's home stadium, and counts its CEO among the team's minority owners — released a statement in which it requested the name be changed. Two other top sponsors, Nike and PepsiCo, soon followed.\n\nLess than 24 hours after FedEx first made its stance known, the team announced it would be undergoing a \"thorough review\" of its name and logo. And on Monday, after decades of scrutiny, Washington's NFL franchise took its first official step toward adopting a new moniker.\n\nIt's unclear which potential replacement names for the team are being seriously considered by franchise leadership, though fans and oddsmakers have floated several possibilities. Rivera, whom the team hired earlier this offseason, told The Washington Post earlier this month that he and Snyder had come up with \"a couple of names\" and \"two of them I really like.\" But he declined to specify those preferred names to the newspaper.\n\nA name beginning with the letter \"R\" would allow the team to continue to use \"HTTR,\" a key marketing slogan that previously was short for \"Hail To The Redskins.\" But some fans have also expressed a preference for \"Warriors,\" among other possibilities.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2020/12/15/year-review-covid-19-big-changes-headline-lafayettes-business-news-2020/3857346001/", "title": "Year in Review: COVID-19, big changes headline Lafayette's ...", "text": "Lafayette and Acadiana's business community had an up-and-down year for 2020, which was marked by COVID-19 restrictions.

Saudi Arabia and Russia were engaged in a pricing war, flooding the market with an unprecedented glut of oil. Then, demand plummeted as millions around the worldwide slowed down their normal lives due to COVID-19 precautions.\n\nAs a result, oil prices fell drastically, even becoming negative in April.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been renamed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Republic of Türkiye.\n\nThe Turkish government is now in the process of officially changing its internationally recognised name with the UN, which could be changed with a “simple notification to the UN registry”, Middle East Eye said.\n\nHowever, the letter “Ü”, which isn’t in the nominal Latin alphabet, “could be a problem”, said the news site. A possible solution could be “using ‘U’ instead of ‘Ü’ in the new name”.\n\nErdogan said that the decision to switch names “represents and expresses the culture, civilisation and values of the Turkish nation in the best way”, the BBC reported. But some have said the change is part of an effort to “distance the country’s links to the bird”, reported the Daily Mail, as well as the “dictionary definition of ‘something that fails badly’”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n“The association with the bird genuinely annoys Erdogan and the people around him,” said Selim Koru, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. “It’s not a surprise given the government’s sensitivity to how the country is perceived and fondness for nationalist rhetoric. That is at the centre of this policy as well.”\n\nTurkey is by no means the first country to change its name. Here are a few of the other notable “national rebrands”.\n\nRepublic of Macedonia to Republic of North Macedonia\n\nThis one was not so much a rebrand as a way to end a three-decade diplomatic dispute with Greece. North Macedonia “finally assumed its place on the map of western Balkan nations” in 2019, reported The Guardian.\n\nAs the result of the name change the country could finally join Nato, “a long-held dream for the small, multi-ethnic country which only narrowly escaped civil war in 2001”.\n\nSuccessive Greek governments “insisted the landlocked state’s determination to be known as Macedonia implied territorial ambitions against the Greek region”, leading to Greece vetoing Macedonia’s membership of Nato in 2008.\n\nThe dispute dated back to the break-up of Yugoslavia in 1991 when Macedonia declared its independence, but Greece “objected to its new neighbour’s name”, the BBC said.\n\nBoth Northern Macedonia and northern Greece were part of the Roman province of Macedonia, both of which “claim the heritage of Alexander the Great two millennia earlier”, said the broadcaster.\n\nBut the name change ended the 27-year dispute, ultimately lifting Athens’s veto on the nation’s bid to join Nato, which it joined as the 30th ally in March 2020.\n\nKingdom of Swaziland to Kingdom of Eswatini\n\nTo celebrate the 50th birthday of Africa’s last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, the Kingdom of Swaziland became known as the Kingdom of Eswatini in April 2018.\n\nKing Mswati III had “long complained that people outside of Africa confused his country with Switzerland”, said National Geographic.\n\nAnd there is at least one similarity – Eswatini “is also landlocked and has some mountains”. The southern African nation is “much smaller, smaller than Wales, and located on the eastern border of South Africa, just south of Kruger National Park”.\n\nCzech Republic to Czechia\n\nThe country’s official name is still the Czech Republic, but “Czechia” became its shortened geographical name in July 2016.\n\nThe name was chosen by Czech leaders as a “one-word alternative name of their country” with the purpose of making it “easier for companies, politicians and sportsmen to use on products, name tags and sporting jerseys”, said The Guardian at the time.\n\nBut it’s fair to say that the new name hasn’t really caught on. At the time, critics of the name complained that it sounded “ugly”, while others said it was too close to Chechnya, “making it prone to confusion”, said the paper.\n\nCape Verde to Cabo Verde\n\nIn 2014 the nation made up of ten islands off the Western coast of Africa registered the new name of Cabo Verde with the UN. The move reverted the nation’s official moniker “back to its original Portuguese name”, according to National Geographic.\n\n“Portuguese explorers came upon the peninsula now called Cap-Vert, the westernmost peninsula in Africa and a Senegalese port, in 1444”. They then “christened it ‘Cabo Verde’, which means ‘green cape’”, before using “the same name for the islands to the west, which became the country of Cabo Verde”.\n\nThe name eventually became anglicised, which created problems with “cumbersome” translations when the country sent official diplomatic cables or created tourism brochures, said The Boston Globe.\n\nThe name change was also part of a national rebrand. “When you say United States, people think: powerful, of the economy, the country of invention, of dreams,” said Mario Lucio de Sousa, the minister of culture for Cape Verde in 2014. “When you talk about Cabo Verde, people think of sun, the beach, nice people, smiles, working people, but, as of now, something intangible.”\n\nUpper Volta to Burkina Faso\n\nA former French colony, the landlocked West African nation gained independence under the name Upper Volta in 1960. In 1984 it was renamed Burkina Faso by president Thomas Sankara, becoming one of a host of nations that renamed their country in an attempt to break from its colonial past.\n\n“We changed the name because Upper Volta was a colonial name not from us but from the French Government, and because we are more than just a location on the river Volta,” a spokesperson for the country’s Mission to the UN told The New York Times.​\n\nCorrection, 28 February 2022: An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Czechia as a Balkan nation.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Joel Mathis", "Harriet Marsden", "Austin Chen", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/02/16"}]}

At 16, she was made an honorary colonel of the Grenadier Guards, a British army infantry regiment.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth is pictured in 1945 standing by an Auxiliary Territorial Service first aid truck wearing an officer's uniform. Keystone/Hulton Royals Collection/Getty Images\n\nWartime offered her certain freedoms beyond the traditional constraints of royal life.\n\nIn 1945 she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service and spent four weeks getting her hands covered in oil and grease as she learned to drive and maintain military vehicles.\n\nWhen victory was declared in Europe, a uniformed Elizabeth mingled with jubilant crowds outside Buckingham Palace.\n\nPeacetime brought the return of Lieutenant Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, a handsome young naval officer who had, by all accounts, won her heart when she was just 13. The pair married in Westminster Abbey in 1947. Their first son, Charles, was born just over a year later.\n\nA youthful monarch\n\nWith her father’s health in rapid decline, Elizabeth began accepting more official duties, taking his place at the annual “Trooping the Colour” military parade in 1949.\n\nIn 1952, while Elizabeth and Philip were on an official trip to Kenya, news came of her father’s death.\n\nShe was now Queen.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh wave at the crowds from the balcony at Buckingham Palace after her coronation, on June 2, 1953. Keystone/Hulton Royals Collection/Getty Images\n\nThe next decade saw the young monarch settle into her role. After her coronation in 1953, she embarked on numerous official overseas trips, oversaw state openings of parliament, welcomed visiting leaders such as Dwight Eisenhower, Charles de Gaulle and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, and toured a coal mine.\n\nThese international forays came even as the disintegration of Britain’s empire hastened. India had gained independence from its colonial power in 1947, before Elizabeth became Queen. Dozens more were to follow suit over the following decades, across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. By the time of her death, Elizabeth was head of state in 14 countries besides the UK.\n\nThe Queen meanwhile embraced her role as Head of the Commonwealth, visiting almost all of its member states – starting with a lengthy Commonwealth tour in 1953 and 1954.\n\nIn 1964, the Queen became a mother for the fourth time as new son Edward joined Charles and fellow siblings Anne and Andrew. There was, however, barely any let-up in her busy schedule.\n\nBy the arrival of her third decade on the throne, she was in her element. Prince Charles was embarking on a military career, Princess Anne, an acclaimed horsewoman, was married – drawing huge crowds of well-wishers.\n\nWhile indulging in her own equestrian pursuits, she continued to throw herself into public life, clocking up dozens of overseas tours and official visits around the UK – one of which, in 1976, saw her become one of the first people to send an email.\n\nThere were family problems when her sister’s marriage collapsed, and constitutional issues as debate grew among Commonwealth countries about the role of the monarch, but these failed to dampen celebrations to mark the silver jubilee of her reign in 1977.\n\nAnother royal wedding followed in 1981 when Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer at London’s St Paul’s Cathedral. Millions of people around the world watched the ceremony on television, happily unaware it would usher in the most turbulent period yet of the Queen’s life.\n\nDivorce, fire and Diana’s death\n\nThe Queen’s 40th year on the throne, 1992, marked her lowest moment as three royal marriages fell apart. Princess Anne and Mark Philips divorced, Charles and Diana separated after claims of infidelities while Sarah Ferguson, Prince Andrew’s wife, was photographed topless with an American financial manager.\n\nTo cap it all, a huge fire ripped through Windsor Castle, causing major structural damage. In the wake of the blaze, a furor broke out when it was suggested that public money be used to fund the restoration.\n\nThis year was not one “on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure,” the Queen said in a speech later. “In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an annus horribilis.”\n\nThese problems overshadowed the Queen as she made an historic visit to meet South African President Nelson Mandela in 1995, but criticism reached new heights in the wake of Diana’s tragic death in 1997, when the royals were accused of being aloof and out of touch amid widespread public outpourings of grief.\n\nThis marked a turning point.\n\nAfter days of silence, the Queen returned to London, talked to mourners and admitted there were lessons to be learned from Diana’s life. The gestures struck a chord with the public and criticism ebbed away.\n\nBritain's Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip view the floral tributes to Diana, Princess of Wales, at London's Buckingham Palace, on September 5, 1997. Pool/AP\n\nAfter Diana, the Queen’s popularity rebounded as she presided over what appeared to be a softer, more accessible and thoroughly modern royal family.\n\nThis was evident in 2005 when, to public approval, she assented to the previously unthinkable marriage of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. It was capped eight years later when Britain’s parliament ended the principle of men taking precedence over women in the line of succession to the throne.\n\nShe witnessed two of her grandsons, Princes William and Harry, graduate as military officers in 2006 and five years later oversaw the marriage of William and Catherine, the woman who – as the wife of the now heir to the throne – will one day succeed her as Britain’s Queen. She also attended the wedding of Harry to Meghan Markle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor in May 2018.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry watch a flypast on the balcony of Buckingham Palace as part of events to mark the centenary of the RAF on July 10, 2018 in London. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nIn 2012, the Queen’s diamond jubilee was celebrated around the Commonwealth, culminating in a glittering river pageant on the Thames in London, and a concert showcasing some of the best music from her six decades on the throne.\n\nThree years later, she surpassed Queen Victoria’s 63-year-rule to become the longest-reigning British monarch and, in 2016, she marked her 90th birthday with a series of festivities and goodwill messages from around the world.\n\nIn February 2022, she marked the start of her platinum jubilee year, as she became the first British monarch to reign for 70 years.\n\nFamily upheaval\n\nThe Queen’s final years were punctuated by challenges as well as celebrations, however.\n\nAs the novel coronavirus swept through Britain in 2020, she gave two televised addresses in quick succession, one calling for unity in the face of the pandemic and the other, still amid a national lockdown, to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day.\n\nBut while rallying the nation’s spirits, the Queen was facing upheaval within her own family. Less than two years after their spectacular Windsor Castle wedding, Harry and Meghan announced that they were stepping back from their roles as senior royals and leaving Britain.\n\nThey subsequently set up home with son Archie in California and, in a March 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey, accused “the firm” of leaving Meghan unprotected against racist abuse and unfair media coverage, as well as having neglected her mental health concerns. The couple – whose daughter Lilibet, named in honor of the Queen, was born in June 2021 – also made a damaging allegation of racism by an unnamed member of the royal family, although Winfrey later said they had clarified that this was neither the Queen nor Prince Philip.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Andrew, often referred to as the Queen’s “favorite son,” had been forced to step back from public duties after a disastrous 2019 interview with the BBC over his association with prominent sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022, the Queen sought to distance the royal institution from a civil sex abuse lawsuit brought against Andrew in the United States by stripping him of his HRH status and royal patronages permanently. He subsequently settled the case out of court for an undisclosed figure and continues to reject the allegations against him.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II takes her seat during the funeral of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on April 17, 2021 in Windsor, England.

Pandemic restrictions meant she cut a lonely figure at his funeral, scaled back in terms of guests but still marked with military pomp.\n\nElizabeth returned to her royal duties within days, now a widow but still dedicated to a lifetime of service. She even continued with light duties after testing positive for Covid-19 in February 2022.\n\nBut as the year wore on, the monarch was forced to significantly slim down her diary due to mobility issues. On Tuesday, she met with outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his successor, Liz Truss, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, rather than traveling to Buckingham Palace to do so.\n\nThe nation had come together to mark her platinum jubilee in June 2022 – a crowning achievement in a long and storied life.\n\nBy the time of her death in September, she had reigned for a little over 70 years – a constant, if regally distant, presence in the lives of several generations of Britons.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Barry Neild"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}]}

An alliance of nonprofits, scientists and donors,HBBF,which produced the report, has a stated mission of reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals.\n\nREAD MORE: Manufacturers allowed baby food contaminated with heavy metals to remain on shelves, lawmakers say\n\nResearchers tested 288 foods bought at stores and farmers markets across the United States– including grains, fruits, vegetables, snacks, teething foods, and family items that babies eat, such as cereals and rice cakes – for lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium. Those heavy metals are amongthe World Health Organization’s top 10 chemicals of concernfor infants and children.\n\n“Toxic metal exposure can be harmful to the developing brain. It’s been linked with problems with learning, cognition, and behavior,” according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nResearchers also poredover data from 7,000 additional food tests reported in published studies and by the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nResults showed 94% of manufactured baby foods, family foods and homemade purees made from purchased raw foods contained detectable amounts of one or more heavy metals.\n\nLead was found in 90% of manufactured baby food bought by shoppers for the report and 80% of store-bought family food and homemade purees. There is no safe level of lead, according to the AAP.\n\nArsenic was found in 68% store-bought baby food and 72% of family food either purchased or prepared athome. Cadmium was found in 65% of purchased baby food and 60% of family foods, and mercury was in 7% of store-bought baby food and 10% of family foods. (The highest levels of mercury are found in seafood, which was not tested in this analysis.)\n\nREAD MORE: 95% of tested baby foods in the US contain toxic metals, report says\n\nThe new report is a follow-up to a November 2019 report in which Healthy Babies, Bright Futures tested 168 foods purchased from major baby food manufacturers. That analysis found 95% of store-bought baby food contained lead, 73% contained arsenic, 75% contained cadmium and 32% contained mercury. One-fourthof the foods tested that year contained all four heavy metals.\n\n“After that report we saw so many people saying you can get around this problem by making your own baby food at home, so we decided to check,” Houlihan said. “We suspected we’d find heavy metals in all kinds of food because they’re ubiquitous contaminants in the environment.\n\n“And that is exactly what we found – heavy metals were in foods from every section of the store,” Houlihan said. “What this says is that as the FDA is setting standards for heavy metals in baby food, they need to go beyond the baby food aisle.”\n\nWhat’s a parent or caregiver to do? Feed baby with as many different types of foods as possible, said pediatrician Dr. Mark Corkins, chair of the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“If you spread foods out, and offer a wide variety of options, you’ll have less toxicity,” Corkins said. “And nutritionally that’s always been the right thing to do to get the most micronutrients from the food you eat.”\n\nDoes buying organic help?\n\nThe report found buying organic didn’t lower heavy metal levels either, which was “not shocking or surprising,” said Corkins, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n“It’s the soil and water that’s contaminated with arsenic and other heavy metals, so it doesn’t matter if it’s organic or traditional farming methods,” Corkins said. That would apply to locally grown crops or even backyard gardens, if the soil had not been verified to be metal-free.\n\nHowever, buying organic can help avoid other toxins the new report did not consider, such as herbicides and pesticides, said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“There are other benefits to eating organic food, including a reduction in synthetic pesticides that are known to be as bad for babies, if not even more problematic,” Trasande said.\n\nREAD MORE: Doctors should test levels of PFAS in people at high risk, report says\n\n“We’ve seen multiple studies show significant effects of synthetic pesticides on cognitive function in children as a result of prenatal exposure. We’ve seen images of the brain where certain parts are smaller that are crucial for higher order functioning after exposure,” he added. “A simple step would simply be to say eat organic because regardless of anything we’re talking about in this report, it’s good for you.”\n\nExperts agree that battling toxins in baby foods is a job for government organizations who will need to work with growers, suppliers and manufacturers to institute regulations and safeguards. In the meantime, parents can make a difference.\n\n“Making even one simple choice every day to lower a child’s exposure will make a difference, whether that’s staying away from rice-based snacks and serving a diced apple instead or choosing not to serve carrots and sweet potatoes every day,” Houlihan said.\n\n“With heavy metals and other toxins the risks add up over a lifetime,” she added. “So even if some of these foods had been served to a child up to their second birthday, starting from there to lower exposure to toxins is going to add up. Every choice matters.”\n\nLeast contaminated foods\n\nTested foods with low metal content contain one-eighth as much heavy metal contamination as foods with the highest levels, Houlihan said. These are foods that can be “eaten freely,” the report suggested.\n\nFresh bananas, with heavy metal levels of 1.8 parts per billion, were the least contaminated of foods tested for the report. That’s an “82-fold difference in average level of total heavy metals” from the most contaminated food, rice cakes, which tested at 147 parts per billion,according to the investigation.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Consider chemical hazards’ in the baby foods you sell, FDA warns manufacturers\n\nAfter bananas, the least contaminated foods were grits, manufactured baby food meats, butternut squash, lamb, apples, pork, eggs, oranges and watermelon, in that order. Other foods with lower levels of contamination included green beans, peas, cucumbers, and soft or pureed home-cooked meats, the report found.\n\nInfant formula made with lead-free tap water was recommended. Tap water that has been tested and is free of lead is always a good choice. Milk is also a good choice, but only for babies 12 months and older.\n\nSome healthy lower-metal foods, such as yogurt, unsweetened applesauce, beans, cheese, hard-boiled eggs and grapes that have been cut lengthwise, were good choices for snacks for babies, according to the report.\n\nFresh and frozen fruit – including those used inhomemade purees – were options as well. But don’t use canned fruits if you can avoid it: “Tests find lead 30 times more often in canned fruit than in fresh and frozen fruit,” the report stated.\n\nParents and caregivers can also lower their baby’s exposure to heavy metals by making some smart substitutions, the report said.\n\nUsing a frozen banana for a teething baby instead of a rice-based teething biscuit or rice rusk could lower total intake of heavy metals by 95%, according to the report. Another suggested teething aid: peeled and chilled cucumber spears.\n\nAvoid or limit these foods\n\nThe most heavily contaminated foods eaten by babies were all rice-based: “Rice cakes, rice puffs, crisped rice cereals and brown rice with no cooking water removed are heavily contaminated with inorganic arsenic, which is the more toxic form of arsenic,” Houlihan said.\n\nArsenic is a natural element found in soil, water and air, and because rice is grown in water, it is especially good at absorbing inorganic arsenic. (“Inorganic” is a chemical term and has nothing to do with the method of farming.) Brown and wild rice are the worst offenders, as the bran contains the highest arsenic concentrations.\n\nREAD MORE: New FDA limits on arsenic levels in infant rice cereals don’t adequately protect children, critics say\n\nPrior research has shown that even low levels of inorganic arsenic exposure can impact a baby’s neurodevelopment. A meta-analysis of studies on the topic found a 50% increase in arsenic levels in urine would be associated with a 0.4-point decrease in the IQ of children between the ages of 5 and 15.\n\nTesting by HBBF found rice cakes were the most contaminated with inorganic arsenic, followed by crisped rice cereal, rice-based puffs and brown rice. The report recommended those foods be avoided entirely, unless the brown rice is cooked with extra water that is poured off before consumption (much like pasta). It’s best to do that with all rice, including white and wild rice, the report said, as it can reduce arsenic levels by up to 60%.\n\nRice-based teething biscuits or rusks and white rice came next on the most contaminated list, the report said. White rice is milled to remove the outer layers, but experts say arsenic levels remain high enough to be concerning, especially if rice is a daily staple.\n\n“Inorganic arsenic averaged 100 parts per billion in brown rice infant cereal and 74 parts per billion in white rice infant cereal in our tests,” Houlihan said. “Baby food companies have taken brown rice cereal off the market because of its high arsenic levels.”\n\nREAD MORE: Water- and stain-resistant products contain toxic plastics, study says. Here’s what to do\n\nParents and caregiverscan help by staying away from high-arsenic varieties of white rice grown in Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, or simply “US” and insteadchoosing lower-arsenic basmati rice from California, India and Pakistan, as well as sushi rice from the US, the report said.\n\nServe these foods rarely\n\nAfter rice-based foods, the analysis found the highest levels of heavy metals in raisins, non-rice teething crackers, granola bars with raisins and oat-ring cereals. But those were not the only foods of concern: Dried fruit, grape juice, arrowroot teething crackers and sunflower seed butter all contained high amounts of at least one toxic metal, according to the report.\n\n“Many foods have a kind of unique, heavy metal profile,” Houlihan explained. “For example, we saw very high levels of cadmium in things like spinach, leaf lettuce and peanut butter.”\n\nHowever, the human bodydoesn’t absorb cadmium as easily as other heavy metals, and for that reason “it doesn’t have as high a level of concern,” Houlihan added.\n\n“There’s also not as much evidence that cadmium is neurotoxic to babies, or at least the body of evidence isn’t there at the same levels as lead and arsenic,” she said. “Lead and arsenic damage isn’t reversible – these are permanent impacts on IQ, learning ability and behavior, so it’s a big deal.”\n\nRoot and tuber vegetables may have higher levels of heavy metals like lead and arsenic because they grow underground. In fact, the investigation found that nutritious baby favorites like carrots, sweet potatoes, squash and many types of potatoes did have concerning levels of heavy metals.\n\nREAD MORE: Dangerous chemicals found in food wrappers at major fast-food restaurants and grocery chains, report says\n\nEven the same food could have varying levels of toxic metals, according to the report. For example, a shopper in Raleigh, North Carolina, bought a sweet potato with 60.7 parts per billion of lead – 10 times more than the store-bought sweet potato puree she purchased. A Chicago shopper purchased a fresh carrot with eight times more arsenic than the premade carrot baby food she took home, the investigation found.\n\nYet shoppers in Tennessee and California found the opposite – their fresh produce had minimal levels of heavy metals compared with the manufactured baby food brands they bought.\n\n“As a parent, you don’t know what you’re picking up out of the produce bin,” Houlihan said. “Is it elevated because of the cultivar – the particular type of sweet potato or carrot? Or is it elevated because it’s grown in an area where the soil has naturally high levels of lead?\n\nAnswering these questions will be the responsibility of government regulators and industry, Houlihan said. The FDA has a Closer to Zero campaign, for example, which could take on the issue.\n\nCNN has reached out to the FDA for comment but hasn’t yet received a response.\n\n“And remember, if you’re protecting the basic ingredients that parents are using to make food at home, you’re not only protecting babies and toddlers, you’re protecting pregnant women as well. Babies in utero are particularly vulnerable to toxins while the brain is growing at such a rapid pace.”\n\nWith no way of knowing levels of toxic metals in the soil where produce is grown, parents and caregiversneed to add one more step to their efforts to avoid these substances, Houlihan suggested. In addition to mixing up the variety of foods and not serving the same options each day, parents can “choose different brands or varieties of foods or shop in different stores from week to week to avoid choosing a high-metal source regularly.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2023/12/16/lead-intentionally-added-applesauce-pouches-investigation/71944296007/", "title": "Lead may have been intentionally added to recalled applesauce ...", "text": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is investigating whether recalled cinnamon-flavored applesauce pouches, which had high lead concentrations and have sickened at least 65 children, were intentionally contaminated.\n\nIn late October, the FDA issued a public health alert advising against consuming or buying WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree pouches because they may contain elevated levels of lead.

The spice, supplied to Austrofoods by Ecuador-based Negasmart, had higher levels of lead than allowed by Ecuador and the company is \"currently under an Ecuadorian administrative sanctions process to determine the responsible party for the contamination,\" the FDA said Dec. 5.\n\nThe FDA's Jones told Politico that manufacturers likely \"didn’t think this product was going to end up in a country with a robust regulatory process.\"\n\nHow many have been affected in the applesauce product recall?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has received 125 reports of cases in 22 states in its tracking of the cinnamon applesauce lead poisoning outbreak. Of those cases:\n\n46 are confirmed\n\n68 are probable\n\n11 cases are suspect.\n\nTo be included in those numbers, the person must have high blood levels within three months of eating one of the products after November 2022. (The CDC and FDA can have different case numbers because they gather data differently.)\n\nThe FDA has said that consumers should not eat or buy the WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree pouches, which are sold nationally through Amazon, Dollar Tree, and other online stores, the Schnucks-brand cinnamon-flavored applesauce pouches and variety pack, and Weis-brand cinnamon applesauce pouches.\n\nContributing: Saleen Martin\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

At least six people have died.\n\nThe state is battling about two dozen large complex fires, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Friday. In total, 560 fires are raging in the state.\n\nMajor fires in Southern California are coming under control, and the state is shifting resources to battle massive blazes in Northern California, Newsom said. There, fires have chewed through brushland, rural areas, canyon country and dense forest surrounding San Francisco.\n\nNewsom confirmed 5 deaths have associated with the fires. Separately, a Pacific Gas & Electric utility worker was found dead Wednesday in a vehicle in the Vacaville area.\n\nCalifornia fires: How does a lightning storm start a wildfire?\n\nTrack California fires:Map traces current fires burning across state in real-time\n\nIn the past week alone, fires have charred over 1,200 square miles across the state, according to Cal Fire — a size comparable to Rhode Island.\n\n“We’re putting everything we have on this,” Newsom said, noting the state is seeking aid from the federal government, other states as far away as the East Coast and even Canada and Australia. California firefighters are \"overwhelmed\" by the ongoing fires, he said.\n\nTwo of the fires there are now the 7th and 10th largest fires in state history, having burned as much as 300 square miles each, Newsom said Friday.\n\n“If you are in denial about climate change, come to California,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said, as he addressed the wildfires in a last-minute video recorded for the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night.\n\nMore than 12,000 firefighters are on the front lines, but fire officials in charge of each of the major fire complexes say they are strapped for resources. Some firefighters were working 72-hour shifts instead of the usual 24 hours.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\n6 dead, over 30 injured\n\nThe fires burning throughout Northern California have now claimed at least six lives and injured 33 people and firefighters.\n\nOn Friday, authorities reported three civilian deaths in Napa County and one death in Solano County.\n\nIn central California, a pilot on a water-dropping mission in western Fresno County died Wednesday morning when his helicopter crashed — a fatality confirmed by Newsom Friday.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT: The 2019 USA TODAY analysis that found more than 500 places with wildfire hazard greater than Paradise, California\n\nAdditionally, a utility worker was found dead Wednesday in a vehicle.\n\nAt least two other people were missing and more than 30 civilians and firefighters have been injured, authorities have said.\n\nMore than 100,000 people have evacuated\n\nNewsom pleaded with California residents to take evacuation orders seriously, saying 119,000 people have already evacuated their homes. More than 140,000 people are under evacuation orders.\n\nTens of thousands of homes have been threatened by flames as some fires have doubled in size within 24 hours, according to fire officials.\n\nIn Solano County, evacuation orders were given to thousands of residents — some fled for the first time ever.\n\n“I’ve lived here for 30 years, never had to evacuate before,” resident Tim Lukehart said. “There’s been fires of course, but not like this one.”\n\nWhile some evacuations were lifted in the town of Vacaville, between San Francisco and Sacramento, other areas increased the size of evacuations. The University of California, Santa Cruz was evacuated, and a new fire burning near Yosemite prompted residents to flee.\n\nCalifornia is on fire:What are fire whirls, fire tornadoes, fire clouds and running crown fires?\n\nHow many fires are burning in California right now?\n\nOf the 560 fires burning throughout the state, dozens of fires have collected into major complex fires.\n\nMany were sparked by an unprecedented lightning siege of nearly 12,000 strikes over several days, as a high-pressure area over the West brought a dangerous mix of triple-digit heat and monsoonal moisture pulled from the south.\n\nThe largest fire listed on Cal Fire's website Friday evening was a blaze made up of 20 separate fires burning near San Jose, which has been named the SCU Lightning Complex Fire. The fire had ravaged more than 359 square miles and is 10% contained.\n\nAnother large fire burning in California is the LNU Lightning Complex, which has burned a total of 342 square miles and is 7% contained.\n\nWhat is the air quality and why don't cloth face masks help?\n\nSmoke from the fires is making the air quality in parts of California some of the worst in the world. And people in the area might not be able to smell the dangerous pollutants in the air.\n\nAir quality experts measure the amount of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) in the air. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, those particles come from a variety of sources, including fires.\n\nSmoke from fires can send large amounts of PM 2.5 into the air and over large areas.\n\n“Whenever things burn there’s a mixture of gases and particles,” said University of California, San Francisco pulmonologist Dr. John Balmes, an expert on the respiratory and cardiovascular effects of air pollutants.\n\nN95 or neck gaiter?:Check out how effective different kinds of masks are\n\n“When you smell smoke, you are smelling the gases in the air, not PM 2.5,” Balmes said. “They go hand-in-hand near the fire source, but the particulates travel in the upper atmosphere.”\n\nIt’s possible to have bad air — air high in PM 2.5 — without smelling gases.\n\nYour coronavirus mask may not protect you, unless you have a mask designed to filter PM 2.5, like an N95. Those masks are scarce worldwide because of the pandemic.\n\nHealth experts say limiting outdoor activities, remaining indoors with the windows and doors closed and turning on an air conditioner with a recirculation setting can help reduce your risk if you live in an affected area.\n\nContributing: Jessica Skropanic, Redding Record Searchlight; The Associated Press, Doyle Rice, Elinor Aspegren, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/08/21/california-wildfires-state-seeks-help-canada-australia-560-blazes-burn/3411059001/", "title": "As 560 California wildfires burn, spreading firefighters thin, residents ...", "text": "California firefighters are battling nearly 600 active wildfires that have forced tens of thousands of people from their homes, prompting officials to reach out to other states and countries for additional resources, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Friday.\n\nThe number of fires jumped from 376 a day ago to 560, Newsom said, with roughly two dozen major blazes that require significant resources. They cover a collective 771,000 acres — larger than the size of Rhode Island — and are tapping 96% of Cal Fire engines throughout the state, according to officials.\n\nAmong them are clusters of fires authorities have lumped together in order to consolidate information gathering. They are:\n\nLNU Lightning Complex: Burning near Vacaville, between San Francisco and Sacramento, this blaze was initially dubbed the Hennessey Fire, but there are so many fires burning in the area that firefighters have put them all under one incident — the LNU Lightning Complex. The fire was 7% contained and covered about 219,000 acres, Cal Fire officials said Friday.\n\nSCU Lightning Complex Fire: Another large blaze made up of 20 separate fires burning near San Jose. It had ravaged nearly 230,000 acres and was 10% contained on Friday morning, according to Cal Fire.\n\nCZU August Lightning Complex: The 62-square-mile fire in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties raced through Big Basin Redwoods State Park, California's oldest state park, Santa Cruz County officials confirmed Thursday. As of Friday morning, the fire was at 50,000 acres and 0% contained.\n\nCal Fire Unit Chief Shana Jones said while some progress has been made, there's still much more work to do and homes are being threatened.\n\nShe urged area residents to be prepared to leave and get ready to evacuate when necessary.\n\n\"First-responders have been stretched thin throughout the state, but they continue to work hard, they're getting little rest,\" she said.\n\nWhile more than 12,000 personnel are out fighting the largest of the blazes, officials in charge say some firefighters were working 72-hour shifts instead of the usual 24 hours.\n\nThe governor said he's continuing to utilize a mutual aid network across western states, and reaching out to others on the East Coast, to provide the much-needed backup.\n\n\"We have more people, but it's not enough,\" he said. \"That's why we need the support from our federal partners, and the extraordinary contributions that governors, regardless of their party, have contributed.\"\n\nThe state has requested 375 engines and crew from other states.\n\nTwenty-five engines from Oregon, 10 engines from Arizona, and five engines from Texas, Nevada and New Mexico are arriving in California at noon Friday, Newsom said. There's also surveillance aid coming from Washington state, Newsom said.\n\nNewsom said he is also talking to Canada and Australia about receiving resources and support.\n\nResources are also being shifted away from fires that are getting under control — such as the Apple Fire in Riverside County that is now 95% contained — to address blazes in northern parts of the state, Newsom said.\n\nThe resources are needed in spite of larger allocations for firefighting resources made as part of the state budget this year, including an $85.6 million increase for full-time support for Cal Fire, and a supplemental $72 million for 858 positions, 830 of which have been filled in the past several weeks, Newsom said.\n\nIt's a record amount of support in a state that's seeing a historic level of fires and associated damage.\n\nThe fires even made their way into Newsom's last-minute video recorded for the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night.\n\n“If you are in denial about climate change, come to California,” he said.\n\nTrack California fires:Map traces current fires burning across state in real-time\n\nCalifornia wildfires:See evacuation order map for Sonoma, Napa and Lake counties\n\nAt least 5 dead, 119,000 evacuated, 33 hurt\n\nThe impact of the blazes is widespread: More than 119,000 people have been evacuated statewide. At least five people have died, Newsom said Friday, and 33 are injured.\n\nSeparately, a Pacific Gas & Electric utility worker was found dead in a vehicle in the Vacaville area Wednesday.\n\nNewsom said that while the state has had to battle other large fires in the past and learned from those experiences, the recent blazes are unprecedented.\n\nTwo of the fires — the SCU Lightning Complex Fire and the LNU Lightning Complex Fire — are now the seventh and 10th largest fires in state history, having burned as much as 300 square miles each.\n\n\"We are not naïve by any stretch about how deadly this moment is,\" Newsom said.\n\nHe added that the state is entering a new agreement with the U.S. Forest Service for more forest management. It's going forward, he said, despite President Donald Trump claiming a day earlier that the rash of fires was caused by the state failing to properly maintain its forest.\n\nNewsom said he wasn't convinced Trump knew about the new agreement — and while the president may make public remarks, they have a working relationship in private.\n\n\"Had he been aware of that, I'm not sure he may have made that statement,\" he said.\n\nMore:How to stay safe under River Fire, Carmel Fire, Lightning Complex Fire smoke\n\nMore:California man uses Bud Light to put out fire near Vacaville home\n\nThe governor also praised the work and efforts of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which announced Thursday that it will reimburse California 75% of whatever it spends on battling the LNU Lightning Complex Fire and the CZU Lightning Complex Fire.\n\nThe grants will \"help ensure the availability of vital resources\" while battling the fires, according to Newsom's office.\n\nU.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, a Democrat who represents Napa County and surrounding areas, said during Friday's news briefing that a letter is going out with 30 bipartisan signatures supporting Newsom's request for individual and public assistance.\n\nHe also has legislation prepared that would shift the local cost of the fire response for sheriff's departments from 25% to 10% if a natural disaster is declared.\n\n\"The federal government is here to do everything we possibly can,\" he said.\n\nAssemblymember Cecilia M. Aguiar-Curry said all of the counties in her Northern California district have fires raging. She has half a dozen friends who are without homes — and there's no quick solution, she said.\n\n\"For the past five years we’ve been experiencing this year after year,\" she said. \"I wish there was a real simple way to get around this, but there’s not.\"\n\nFirefighters to civilians: Don't help\n\nWith firefighting resources tight, homes in hard-to-get-to places burn unattended, prompting some residents to take action.\n\nBrothers Robert and Jesse Katz, who have a ranch in Morgan Hill, headed into the Santa Cruz mountains with their own fire truck. On Friday they worked side-by-side with a professional local crew, hosing down a burning redwood next to a popular hiking trail in Henry Cowell State Park.\n\n“The more civilians can do to pitch in, it really will take the burden off of them and it really can make the difference between saving a house or a property or a home, and finding ashes,” Robert Katz said.\n\nKatz said they’re working closely with crews.\n\n“You develop relationships with the people who are actually working the fire, and once you do that you can really work as a great team,” Katz said. “If we’re doing structure protection, they can take the lead and we can do mop up behind them. It frees them up to do areas of firefighting that otherwise would tie them up.”\n\nBut Cal Fire’s Olsen said civilians can put firefighters in danger.\n\n“They don’t have the training, the experience and the education we have about staying safe in fires,” he said.\n\nCalFire Chief Mark Brunton pleaded with residents to quit battling fires on their own, saying that just causes more problems for the professionals.\n\n“We had, last night, three separate rescues that pulled our vital, very few resources away,” he said Friday.\n\nBut Peter Koleckai credits a neighbor, not firefighters, with saving his home.\n\nOff a narrow road a mile from the Katzes, Koleckai wiped tears from his eyes after days of evacuating and re-evacuating his family as one community after another became endangered.\n\nWithin a few blocks, more than a dozen homes lay in ruins, most still smoldering. Summer gardens were roasted, hulls of cars were smoking, and in many homes the only recognizable feature was the chimney.\n\nKoleckai said he had been hosing his property, filming devastation and sharing it with neighbors.\n\n“We were here at about 3 o’clock in the morning and the fire department just left. They just left,” he said.\n\nKoleckai said he ran to a firefighter and told him a brush fire was erupting next to a house.\n\n“They never went up there and it engulfed the whole house, took the house out,” he said.\n\nKoleckai said a neighbor with a high pressure hose, firefighting equipment and a generator saved his home.\n\nNearby, brothers Jeremy and Justin Cote were guarding their parent’s home Friday in Bonny Doon, a forested community near Santa Cruz.\n\n“We got water, we got pumps, we got generators,” said Jeremy Cote, “but it’s gnarly.”\n\n“We’re very confused,” said Justin Cote, pulling up on a small motorcycle. “There’s a fire burning here. Where is everyone? Where are they? I know they need to fight other fires, but what about this one?”\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nMelissa Daniels covers local business, hospitality, and economic development in the Coachella Valley.

About 1.2 million acres of land has been torched. Most of the damage was caused by three clusters of fire “complexes” ripping through 1,175 square miles of forest and rural areas in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe fires have burned about 1,000 homes and other structures, forced tens of thousands to flee, killed six people, blanketed communities with a pall of dangerous smoke and haze, and left residents on edge.\n\n“Tuesday night, when I went to bed, I had a beautiful home on a beautiful ranch,” said Hank Hanson, 81, of Vacaville. “By Wednesday night, I have nothing but a bunch of ashes.”\n\nCalifornia wildfires become a target for looters:A firefighter is among the victims. His wallet was stolen, bank account 'drained.'\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a “red flag” warning through Monday afternoon for the Bay Area and the central coast, meaning extreme fire conditions, including high temperatures, low humidity and wind gusts up to 65 mph, “may result in dangerous and unpredictable fire behavior.”\n\nThere was the potential for scattered \"dry\" thunderstorms over much of Northern California, the weather service said, and lightning could spark new blazes.\n\nMark Brunton, a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), said the winds can blow a fire in any direction, increasing the peril. “There’s a lot of potential for things to really go crazy out there,” he said.\n\nCal Fire unit chief Shana Jones urged residents Sunday to take the red flag warnings seriously. \"What this means, is that any lightning that comes through ... it’s going to likely result in additional fires. We do have a plan in order to immediately attack those fires, but it’s going to take some work.\n\n“I can’t stress enough the importance of being prepared to leave,” Jones said.\n\nTwo blazes ballooned into the second- and third-largest in the state's history, according to Cal Fire. Among the casualties of the fires: ancient redwood trees at California’s oldest state park, Big Basin Redwoods, and the park’s headquarters and campgrounds.\n\nA sixth fatality was reported Sunday night in Santa Cruz County, where the local sheriff's office confirmed the death of a 70-year-old man in the CZU Lightning Complex Fire.\n\nFire crews made small progress over the weekend, and some evacuation orders were lifted. But the ominous weather reports had officials warning residents new orders could be coming.\n\nFires rage:About 600 wildfires burn a million acres in California in a week\n\n“There’s not a feeling of pure optimism, but a feeling of resolve, a feeling of we have resources backing us up,” Sonoma County Supervisor James Gore said.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom announced Saturday that the White House granted the state's request for a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration – despite President Donald Trump publicly chiding California over the wildfires last week.\n\nAbout 14,000 firefighters man the lines, according to Cal Fire, and crews have been working around the clock. Jones said reinforcements have been streaming in. \"I’m pleased to report more resources have been arriving to help fight our fires,\" Jones said. \"The LNU Complex remains the No. 1 priority for immediate resources as they become available from other incidents that were in California and for other resources outside the state.\"\n\nDespite the assistance, \"we are definitely far from getting these fires handled. We’re not out of the woods by far,” Jones said.\n\nLightning danger: This is how a lightning storm can start a wildfire\n\nThe Sonoma County sheriff’s office released dramatic video of a helicopter rescue Friday night of two firefighters trapped on a ridge line at Point Reyes National Seashore. They were pulled to safety as flames raced.\n\n“Had it not been for that helicopter, those firefighters would certainly have perished,” Sheriff Mark Essick said.\n\nOf the two biggest blazes, the SCU Lightning Complex Fire was 10% contained Sunday; the LNU Lightning Complex Fire was 17% contained.\n\nContributing: Joel Shannon and Grace Hauck, USA TODAY; Scott Linesburgh, The Stockton (Calif.)

The Park Fire continued to expand, and Tuesday had burned 600 square miles in Tehama and Butte counties, making it the fifth-largest fire in California history. It was only 14% contained as of the last update Tuesday at 4:17 p.m. Pacific Time by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection − Cal Fire.\n\nThe fire ignited last Wednesday in Upper Bidwell Park, a 3,600-acre municipal park in Chico in Butte County, although the blaze has mostly burned in Tehama County. Additional evacuations in nearby Shasta County were ordered Tuesday.\n\n\"This didn't have to happen,\" Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said at a briefing. He said Stout pulled over to the side of the road but went over a berm and into grass. Ramsey said the fire started when Stout revved his car's engine trying to drive out.\n\nWitnesses said they saw Stout watch his car burn, then push it backward. Ramsey said Stout claims he didn't push the car down the embankment but panicked and left the scene.\n\n\"The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire,\" Ramsey said in statement. The suspect, he said, was \"seen calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.\"\n\nRamsey's office has said Stout has two previous serious felonies on his record, which would make him subject to at least a 25-year prison sentence if convicted of felony arson under California's \"three strikes'' law.\n\nVideo shows a vortex of smoke:Was it a fire tornado?\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ More than 5,000 firefighters were battling the fire, which has burned over 330,000 acres in Tehama County and more than 53,000 acres in Butte County.\n\n∎ The blaze has destroyed at least 165 homes, businesses and other structures, and damaged over a dozen more.\n\n∎ Some evacuations also were ordered in Shasta and Plumas counties. Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson said evacuation orders had been downgraded to warnings in some areas.\n\nHundreds evacuate as Colorado blaze grows, another fire ignites\n\nA second wildfire has ignited in northern Colorado, about 30 miles from where the Alexander Mountain Fire near Loveland quadrupled in size Tuesday, sprawling across nearly 3,600 acres with zero containment by the evening. It was at 900 acres Monday night.\n\nThe Stone Canyon Fire near the town of Lyons prompted Boulder County officials to expand an evacuation area that now includes parts of Larimer County. By 5 p.m. Mountain Time, evacuation orders also applied to parts of Lyons because of \"changing wind conditions,'' according to an alert by Boulder's Office of Disaster Management. Air tankers and 10 firetrucks and other vehicles were contending with the blaze, which was estimated at 85 acres and growing in an earlier alert.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service has taken control of the efforts to contain the Alexander Mountain Fire from Larimer County, but the blaze remained uncontrolled, according to InciWeb. Hundreds fled their homes after mandatory evacuation orders were issued for parts of Larimer County near the Wyoming border.\n\n\"We are still trying to work out our best plan of attack to get around this thing,\" incident commander Mike Smith said in a video update Tuesday. \"There are some challenges directly north.\"\n\nHigh temperatures and low humidity would likely strengthen the blaze, InciWeb warned. \"Significant\" smoke is expected over the next few days. Larimer County Sheriff’s Office Emergency Services Coordinator Justin Whitesell said drawing on firefighting resources from other states was made difficult because of wildfires burning elsewhere.\n\n\"We are doing the best we can with the resources we have,\" he said, adding firefighters were focused on evacuating people and protecting homes.\n\n− Erin Udell and Holly Engelman, Fort Collins Coloradoan\n\nOregon's extreme weather has 'tested our limits'\n\nAlmost 10,000 firefighters were battling 43 large fires across Oregon, the state Forestry Department reported. That does not include \"many of the local and agency government employees, landowners, forestland operators and members of the community who are contributing every day,\" the agency said in an update on the struggle.\n\nOregon's state climatologist, Larry O’Neill, said the state's heat waves will keep getting hotter, contributing to the fires. Deputy Director of Fire Operations Kyle Williams said the extreme weather has \"tested our limits.\" Gov. Tina Kotek has declared a state of emergency, and National Guard teams have been called in to help with the blazes.\n\n“The wildfire situation on the ground is dynamic and challenging, and we need all hands on deck,” Kotek said.\n\nFive years later, couple loses second home to flames\n\nIn California, Butte County resident Rick Pero told KHSL-TV the Park Fire was the second wildfire to destroy his home. Pero and his wife moved to Forest Ranch after losing their previous home to the Camp Fire, which killed 85 people in the Butte County town of Paradise in 2018. After that event, Pero became a fire safety advocate and educated neighbors on maintaining a defensible space around their homes.\n\n“Twenty-eight houses benefited from defensible space and are still standing,\" Pero said. But for his home and a few others, \"it was just too much mother nature,” he said.\n\nFire advisories issued in 6 states\n\nEighty-nine large wildfires are burning nationwide and have scorched more than 3,300 square miles, according to the National Interagency Fire Center report released Tuesday. Fire behavior advisories are in place for parts of California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah and Nevada. Temperatures topping 100 degrees over much of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, combined with breezy southerly winds and low humidity, will promote a \"continued drying trend\" that could bring wildfires to the region, the fire center said.\n\nThere was some good news: \"There are no fire environment concerns in the eastern half of the country, where high humidity and areas of rainfall will continue,\" the fire center said.\n\nFlames 'right by our front door':Wildfires rage across western US\n\nPark Fire fueled by dry vegetation from record heat\n\nThe Park Fire has spread rapidly, fueled by dry vegetation resulting from weeks of record heat. Climate scientist Daniel Swain said that although data is insufficient to confirm claims the weather has been the hottest in thousand of years, \"we can also refute the myriad claims I've been seeing lately that 'it was hot like this all the time when I was a kid!'\" he wrote on social media. \"It most certainly was not.\"\n\nTehama County Sheriff Dave Kain asked evacuees to be patient, saying many areas had appeared ready for residents to return, only to erupt in flames again. \"This fire is extremely unstable and unpredictable,\" Kain said.\n\nPark Fire's massive size:Blaze one of the biggest wildfires in California history\n\nCollapse of 'carbon sink' hastening climate change\n\nForests and other land ecosystems failed to curb climate change in 2023 as intense drought in the Amazon rainforest and record wildfires in Canada hampered absorption of carbon dioxide, according to a study released Monday. A record amount of carbon dioxide entered Earth's atmosphere last year, further feeding global warming, the researchers said.\n\nForests and other land ecosystems on average absorb nearly a third of annual emissions from fossil fuels, industry and other human causes. But in 2023, that \"carbon sink\" collapsed, according to a study from the Laboratory for Climate and Environmental Sciences, a French research organization.\n\n\"The sink is a pump, and we are pumping less carbon from the atmosphere into the land,\" co-author Philippe Ciais said. \"Suddenly the pump is choking, and it's pumping less.\"\n\nWildfire smoke map: Track fires and red flag warnings across the US\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/07/16/oregon-wildfires-record-pace-lightning-shortages-possible/7957980002/", "title": "'Just trying to hang on.' Oregon wildfires on torrid pace, firefighter ...", "text": "Across virtually all of Oregon, wildfire conditions indicate that the calendar should say it's sometime in late August.\n\nThere are multiple fires raging — including one of the largest in state history — and forest fuels are near historic levels for dryness, with plants and trees practically begging for the cooler nights and wetting rains of autumn.\n\nProblem is, it's only mid-July. And those rains are probably months away. That's likely to mean a difficult summer for wildfires, coming on the heels of the most destructive fires in state history.\n\n\"Right now we're just trying to hang on,\" said Eric Wise, a predictive wildfire meteorologist at the Northwest Coordination Center in Portland. \"In some places, we're seeing conditions beyond anything we've seen in the 30-year record. And we're way ahead of schedule.\"\n\nConditions are worst in the south, central and eastern parts of Oregon. Temperatures there are hotter and the drought is extreme or exceptional, as opposed to just moderate or severe, as is the case around the Willamette Valley and Oregon Coast.\n\nBut no matter where you look, any spark could easily ignite a fast-moving fire.\n\n\"The west side of the state is a little better because of the marine influence, and it's worse the farther south you go, but we're expecting to be busy everywhere this summer,\" Wise said.\n\nCurrently, Oregon has burned 260,500 acres — believed to be the second most in recorded history for this date, smaller only than the Long Draw Fire in 2013 that burned more than 500,000 acres of mostly grassland in southeastern Oregon.\n\nThis year's infernos have been more impactful. Southern Oregon's Bootleg Fire, the largest fire in the United States, has torched 227,234 acres of grass and timberland and shows no signs of letting up, all while it degrades air quality, burns homes and uproots lives.\n\nIn addition, wildfires have closed highways in the North Umpqua Canyon and brought evacuations multiple times in Central Oregon.\n\nLimited lightning so far. That could change\n\nThere are a few main concerns moving forward, experts said — both short and long-term.\n\nFirst, despite the numerous fires, Oregon hasn't seen a major lightning burst — the type that ignited 160 wildfires across southwest Oregon in 2018. Many of the large wildfires seen so far this year appear to be human-caused, even if some remain under investigation.\n\nThat could change as early as next week, when monsoons in the south could kick-start dry lightning events in the Pacific Northwest, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\n\"Forecast guidance trending towards chances for dry thunderstorms in portions of California, Pacific Northwest, and Northern Rockies from Sunday to Tuesday,\" a weather outlook said.\n\n\"We're tracking that pretty carefully,\" said Wise.\n\nA shortage of firefighters?\n\nThe number of wildfires burning across the West could mean a shortage of firefighters or resources as the season progresses, but we haven't quite reached that point, National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Jessica Gardetto said.\n\nIronically, the same monsoon system that could bring dry lightning to the West Coast has been a major help for firefighters in Arizona and New Mexico, bringing 2 to 4 inches of rain that's expected to give fire crews a break and free up resources.\n\n\"Given the conditions, we are preparing to have to make those difficult decisions about where we're putting resources, but we haven't had to make them yet,\" Gardetto said. \"Given how hot and dry things are, at some point we do expect to have to prioritize fires that are threatening lives or homes. Those become the fires that get resources quicker than ones that aren't.\"\n\nEven so, fire crews working some smaller local fires hinted at a tight situation on resources. On the Bruler Fire, a 155-acre blaze south of Detroit Lake, fire spokesman Eric Waters said: \"Across most of the Western United States resources are extremely hard to come by.\n\n\"We're using the resources that we have.\"\n\nGardetto said the severity of the season and competition for resources depends on when the fires ignite. Last year, for example, there was a run on resources because all the fires blew up at once around early September. This year it has been a little bit spread out.\n\n\"But at the same time, we're still very early in fire season, we have a long ways to go,\" Gardetto said.\n\nLimited jet fuel from the pandemic impacting Oregon wildfires\n\nA nationwide shortage of jet fuel has impacted firefighting across the nation, including in Oregon. Demand for jet fuel crashed during the pandemic but has ramped up again quickly, straining the supply chain.\n\nThe Lake County Airport and several surrounding airports ran out of Jet A fuel on July 11 for aircraft working the Bootleg Fire.\n\n\"The Airport Manager had put in an order July 5, but because of a national shortage, the Lake County Airport was unable to get fuel until today,\" officials said July 14.\n\nThe jet fuel finally arrived and no further supply chain shortages are expected, but it emphasizes some of the challenges of getting resources into the right places when fires explode in remote locations, officials said.\n\nScary:Jet fuel shortage in U.S. West could ground firefighting aircraft\n\nOverall, whether it's historically dry conditions, a shortage of firefighters or a run on jet fuel, the next two months are expected to be challenging for firefighters and communities.\n\n\"The hope is that we just get lucky and kind of crawl along without a ton of ignitions,\" Wise said. \"But realistically, we're expecting to be very busy.\"\n\nZach Urness has been an outdoors reporter, photographer and videographer in Oregon for 13 years.

Gavin Newsom said firefighters are battling 367 known wildfires across California, including 23 that are considered major fires. Of those 367 fires, \"the prospect of that number going up is very real,\" he said at a press conference Wednesday.\n\nNewsom blamed \"the extraordinary weather we're experiencing and all of these lightning strikes\" for the fires. He said the state has recorded nearly 11,000 lightning strikes in 72 hours.\n\nA helicopter fighting the blaze crashed in Coalinga, California Wednesday morning, killing the pilot and sparking a new wildfire, which then merged into the nearby Hills Fire.\n\nThe blaze burning near Vacaville was dubbed the Hennessey Fire, but there are so many fires burning in the area that firefighters have put them all under one incident – the LNU Lightning Complex – for reporting purposes, Weather.com said. In all, those fires have burned around 72 square miles of land in Napa and Sonoma counties, and are 0% contained.\n\nResidents of Vacaville, a city of about 100,000 between San Francisco and Sacramento, awoke in the darkness Wednesday morning to frantic evacuation orders as an uncontrolled wildfire burned into the western edge of the city and destroyed at least 50 structures.\n\nIn Solano County, a rural area southeast of Vacaville, some residents fled for the first time ever.\n\n“I’ve lived here for 30 years, never had to evacuate before,” resident Tim Lukehart said. “There’s been fires of course, but not like this one.”\n\nThe air had an orange, smoke-filled hue for miles, with ash covering vehicles. Homes were burned down on both sides of Pleasant Valley Road, the street where Lukehart lives with his wife Sarah. Wooden fences were still in flames, and one family was chasing their cattle through a field as they tried to bring the animals home to safety as the grass smoldered.\n\nA rescue effort to save about 125 horses failed as owners could not get trailers to the area or access by foot.\n\nIn an alert issued just after 7 p.m. Wednesday, the Travis Air Force base commander ordered a partial evacuation of “non-mission essential personnel.”\n\nWednesday afternoon, the fire jumped Interstate 80, forcing highway officials to close a five-mile freeway section.\n\nThe LNU Lightning Complex is the second-largest fire burning in California on Wednesday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nThe largest fire burning in California, a blaze made up of 20 separate fires burning near San Jose, has been named the SCU Lightning Complex Fire. The fire ballooned from 54 square miles to burning at least 132 square miles over Tuesday night. It is 5% contained, and threatens more than 1,400 structures, according to the SCU branch of Cal Fire.\n\nAnother group of 30 fires in Chico, called the Butte Lightning Complex fires, has consumed 2 square miles with 10% containment, with Cal Fire, and are not expected to impact residents, according to a Cal Fire-Butte County news release.\n\nWill Powers, a state fire spokesman, said “throughout the state of California right now, we are stretched thin for crews” because of the fires. “Air resources have been stretched thin throughout the whole state.”\n\nMuch of California is enduring a sweltering late summer heat wave that has broken several record highs in recent days, including a 130-degree reading Sunday in Death Valley, Weather.com said. The hot, dry conditions are expected to continue at least into the weekend.\n\nCalifornia fire tracker:Map traces current fires burning across state in real-time\n\nThe extreme heat was being generated by a strong ridge of high pressure over the western U.S., which also produced an onslaught of thunderstorms and lightning that ignited many of the wildfires burning in California.\n\n\"We have a very large area of high pressure over the area,\" National Weather Service meteorologist David Sweet said. \"It's sitting right over us, and it's not moving.\"\n\nThere was \"no relief\" expected Wednesday from the sweltering heat, the Weather Service said, as temperatures were forecast to again soar above 100 degrees across much of the western U.S. In all, some 37 million people were under excessive heat warnings in the West, mainly in California, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nOne of the major consequences of the heat wave over the past several days has been the threat of temporary power outages, also known as rolling blackouts, to conserve electricity usage along the state's power grid.\n\nGrid managers again called for voluntary energy conservation during afternoon and evening hours Wednesday to try to avoid having to order utilities to cut power to selected areas, which happened twice last week but has been narrowly avoided since then.\n\nIn Northern California, police and firefighters went door-to-door before dawn Wednesday in a frantic scramble to warn residents to evacuate as fire encroached on Vacaville. Fire officials said at least 50 structures were destroyed and 50 were damaged and that four people were injured.\n\nTelevision footage showed some homes in flames and thick ash dropping in a rural area near Interstate 80 as the fire appeared to head toward more densely populated areas.\n\nDiane Bustos told KPIX-TV that she and her husband tried to drive out but their vehicle caught on fire and they had to flee on foot. “I got all these flames on me and I lost my shoe, but I made it. God saved me,” she said.\n\nDue to the Hennessey fire, the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District has issued a health caution because of the hazy conditions caused by smoke from the wildfires burning throughout California. Officials are asking Valley residents to reduce their exposure to particulate matter by remaining indoors.\n\nParticulate matter can trigger asthma attacks, aggravate chronic bronchitis and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.

But when Kinateder, a fire ecologist in the Plumas National Forest, surveys a hillside lush with pines, he doesn’t see abundance or the glory of nature’s bounty.\n\nHe sees a disaster-in-waiting.\n\n“It’s a ticking time bomb,” he said, gazing across the dense, green carpet of trees near Quincy, a small community high in the northern Sierra Nevada.\n\nLast year’s wildfires, the worst in modern California history, have put a microscope on the forests that cover a third of the state–in particular, on managing these wooded lands in ways that would reduce the frequency and intensity of such blazes.\n\nCalifornia is grappling with the counterintuitive dilemma of too many trees, packed too closely together, robbed of the space they need to thrive—and with how to clear out more than 100 million dead trees, felled by drought or insects, that provide tinder for the next infernos.\n\nCuring these unhealthy forests is both difficult and expensive, and as with human health, prevention is far less costly than treatment. But these days the state firefighting agency, Cal Fire, spends the bulk of its resources battling fires rather than practicing preventive measures.\n\nAt stake is nothing less than life, property, air quality and the lands that hold most of California’s water. A state commission recently prescribed radical changes to address what it terms the “neglect” of California’s largest forests.\n\nA 19th-century California forest would have held fewer than 50 trees an acre. Today the state’s forests have grown to an unnatural 300 to 500 trees an acre, or more. That doesn’t count the 2 million drought-stressed trees a month lost to bark beetles that have killed entire stands.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown, who in 2014 declared tree mortality a state of emergency, said in his January State of the State address that California needs to manage its forests more intelligently. He vowed to convene a task force “to review thoroughly the way our forests are managed and suggest ways to reduce the threat of devastating fires.”\n\nCalifornia has dozens of agencies attacking problem but still cannot keep up with the work. Crews around the state have been busy clearing trees as fast as funding allows. This wielding of chainsaws they call “whacking and stacking” leaves massive wood piles along highways in some areas. But it amounts to no more than triage: Cal Fire removes trees on fewer than 40,000 acres a year, far short of its goal of clearing a half-million acres annually.\n\nKinateder estimates that removing trees in this way costs as much as $1,400 an acre. By comparison, controlled burns—those set by fire managers to remove vegetation from forests—is a bargain at less than $150 an acre. Fighting a wildfire comes in at just over $800 an acre, according to the report.\n\nFar from the forest floor, California officials are wrestling with the financial and environmental cost of the state’s forest practices. At a hearing in March in Sacramento, legislators listened to lurid descriptions of raging fire and wrenching stories of human misery recounted by a stream of state and local officials: flames rearing up like an enormous beast, residents running for their lives, neighborhoods leveled, fire burning so hot and for so long that soils were rendered sterile.\n\nA portion of the proceedings focused on a recent report about wildfires and forest health from the Little Hoover Commission, an independent state oversight agency that gave its findings to the governor and Legislature in February. The document pulled no punches, calling the state of the Sierra Nevada’s forests “an unprecedented environmental catastrophe.”\n\nIt cited a century of “mismanaging” the 10 million wooded acres in the Sierra, calling out state and federal firefighting agencies for their longstanding policy of aggressively putting out all fires rather than letting those that can safely burn do so, thereby thinning the choked woodlands.\n\nMore:As California oil regulator seeks more money, legislators ask 'Is this working?'\n\nHelge Eng, deputy director of Cal Fire, acknowledged the report was “spot on” in its assessment of the state of the Sierra, adding that the analysis “did an especially good job of recognizing that there are no easy, black-and-white answers to the problems we are facing.”\n\nCal Fire boasts that it stops 95 percent of fires at 10 acres or less, saving lives, property and entire forests from conflagration. Fire experts argue that a negative could be turned into a positive if fire bosses let them burn while still steering them away from people and structures and toward overgrown wildlands in need of clearing.\n\nThat’s an approach sometimes used by the National Park Service, but it’s difficult to defend when forests are ablaze, frightening the public and many elected officials alike.\n\nStill, the report said, “it is not enough for agency leaders, scientists and advocates to recognize the benefits of fire as a tool; the bureaucracy of the state government and public sentiment as a whole must undergo a culture shift to embrace fire as a tool for forest health.”\n\nEng said Cal Fire is considering adopting the managed-burn approach, when appropriate, but noted that federal firefighters are often working in wild settings, away from development.\n\n“Cal Fire’s mission is different; we protect life and property” in areas that may be densely populated, Eng said in a written response to questions. “There is most often not an opportunity to let a fire burn. The risk to human life is just too great.”\n\nThe report also detailed a public safety threat from 129 million dead trees, the crushing cost—up to $1,000 a tree—to private property owners to have trees removed from their land and the enormous burden on rural governments to both recover from fire and prepare their forests to mitigate the intensity of the next one. In no uncertain terms, the commission prescribed dramatically ramping up tree-thinning projects and, as awful as the optics are, creating and controlling some fires to achieve the same result.\n\nEng agreed that the state firefighting agency was far from achieving its “aspirational” goal of clearing a half-million acres of land each year, citing such impediments as “the logistics of capacity of staff and equipment and environmental compliance,” among other factors.\n\nIn a moment notable for its rarity in Sacramento, there was bipartisan agreement in the hearing room this month about the problem, its scope and the appropriate measures to deal with it. Focus more intensely on the problem, they agreed, and throw money at it. The state spent $900 million fighting fires last year. Just one of those late-season blazes caused more than $9 billion in reported property damage.\n\n“We’ve made mistakes, and we’ve created systems that are unwieldy. … It’s all of our fault,” Jim Branham, executive officer of the Sierra Nevada Conservancy, a state agency, told CALmatters. “Money alone won’t solve it, but we won’t solve it without money, either.”\n\nThe mosaic of land ownership in California means the state owns only 2 percent of the forests but has legal responsibility for much more: 31 million acres, including land in rural counties.\n\nCal Fire received more than $200 million for forest health projects last year and has proposed an additional $160 million for the next fiscal year. Those sums are on top of the agency’s current $2.7 billion budget. Cal Fire, in turn, doles out millions of those dollars in grants to local governments and community groups to do some thinning themselves, and it teams with the federal Forest Service to tackle clearing projects.\n\nThe work to improve forest health dovetails with other state priorities—protecting water sources and reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nThe Sierra Nevada range is the headwaters for 60 percent of California’s developed water supply. Burned, denuded hillsides don’t store water efficiently when it rains. Sediment cascades downhill, filling streams, affecting water quality and loading up reservoirs, reducing their storage capacity\n\nThe carbon equation is equally direct: When trees burn or decay, they release greenhouse gases. The 2013 Rim Fire near Yosemite National Park produced emissions equal to those of 2.3 million cars in a year.\n\nPrescribed burns emit less carbon than higher-intensity fires, because managed fire is aimed at smaller trees and shrubs. Cleared forest land may still ignite, but it will burn with less intensity and fewer emissions.\n\nMoreover, when trees die, they stop absorbing carbon from the atmosphere. The state depends on that critical service to help reduce greenhouse gases. Research suggests that severely burned areas regrow with shrubs or grasses, plants that store about 10 percent less carbon than trees do.\n\nJohn Moorlach, a Republican state senator from Costa Mesa, suggests the Democratic governor, a champion of the fight against climate change, has a “gigantic blind spot” when it comes to reducing carbon emissions. Moorlach said in an interview that Brown’s emphasis on electric cars, for example, ignores the role of fire in California’s greenhouse gas inventory.\n\n“We’re being absolute phonies about climate change if we are not dealing with the real driver of greenhouse gas; that’s these wildfires,” said Moorlach. He has proposed that the state dedicate 25 percent of the revenue from its cap and trade greenhouse-gas-reduction system to help counties’ fire mitigation efforts.\n\nCounties would welcome the help. Randy Hanvelt, a supervisor in Tuolumne County, said that where forest management is concerned, there’s a “leadership problem.”\n\n“Talk is cheap,” he said. “We have got ourselves a giant colossal mess. This is a war of sorts. Time is against us. Every available tool has to be applied.”\n\nMore:Data dig: Are foreign investors driving up real estate in your California neighborhood?\n\nOne such tool is carefully designed burns. But the meticulous planning necessary can take two to three years, and the burns require favorable weather, a permit from the local air district and, crucially, buy-in from local communities that must first be educated about the benefits. And controlled doesn’t mean risk-free.\n\nNick Bunch, who plans thinning projects for the Plumas National Forest, pointed to a partly cleared hillside outside of Quincy where one of his extensively planned prescribed burns went awry, undone by a shift in the wind.\n\n“We were about an hour into the burn and the smoke started going into town,” Bunch said, shaking his head at the memory. Even though the burn was going as planned, the smoke was not acceptable to nearby residents, who protested to fire officials. “Phones started ringing. Calls were made, and we shut it down.”\n\nAnother method is used in Florida, which trains and certifies private property owners to burn their overgrown land and provides limited liability coverage in some cases. Florida cleared 2.1 million acres this way last year. Scott Stephens, who heads a wildland fire research lab at the University of California, Berkeley, said the widespread adoption of the policy has educated residents on both its benefits and risks.\n\n“Politically, you have to have the ability to make mistakes and move on,” he said.\n\nBack in Plumas County, a hulking building in a parking lot outside a community health complex may offer the final piece of the forest-health puzzle: creating a market for trees removed from California’s forests.\n\nPart of a project managed by the Sierra Institute for Community and Environment, the unremarkable square structure shows a potential use for California trees. The building is the state’s first to be fully constructed from cross-laminated timber—layers of wood pressed together to make thick sheets and posts—equal to or greater than the strength of steel.\n\nIn addition, the $2.3 million facility will house a large boiler to provide heat for the health center by consuming 500 tons of local wood chips a year.\n\nThe project is the brainchild of the institute, which envisions it as a way to boost the economies of forest communities. It’s the kind of innovation the governor and Legislature hoped to promote by establishing a Wood Products Working Group to develop commercial uses for the piles of trees beside the state’s roads.\n\nThere’s little left in California today of the early 20th century’s timber cutters, sawmills and biomass industry. If the state follows the Little Hoover Commission’s recommendations and accelerates forest thinning, an entire segment of state industry would need to be rejuvenated.\n\nMeanwhile, officials emphasize the need to educate Californians about the role of forests in the ecosystem.\n\n“If you want people to care about something, they have to understand why it matters,” said Pedro Nava, chairman of the Little Hoover Commission. “They need to understand the deep connection between the health of our state and the state of our forests.”\n\nBranham, of the Sierra Nevada Conservancy, said that won’t be easy.\n\n“Some of our messages are counterintuitive: We must cut down healthy living trees to save the forest,” he noted. “It’s a challenge.”\n\nCALmatters.org is a nonprofit, nonpartisan media venture explaining California policies and politics.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/09/15/how-help-california-oregon-fire-victims-firefighters/5806864002/", "title": "How to help California, Oregon fire victims, firefighters", "text": "Ongoing wildfires in western U.S. states including California, Oregon and Washington have burned thousands of homes and are responsible for dozens of deaths, leaving many evacuees in need of help.\n\nMore than 220,000 people have evacuated across California, Oregon and Washington, according to the Red Cross, while millions of others continue to be exposed to harsh, smoky air conditions caused by particulate matter from the fires.\n\nIn a guide to donating amid a disaster, GlobalGiving suggests donating cash, sharing survivors' stories and supporting local charities, among other tips.

She has publicly stated that as County Executive, her main focus would be on core services such as public safety, parks and recreation, libraries, land use and infrastructure.\n\nHartley-Nagle has come under scrutiny from her fellow council members in the past, and was under investigation for hostile work environment claims. As Council President she has focused on uplifting the county’s senior population and attracting business development to the area.\n\nCandidate enters Insurance Commissioner's race\n\nKayode Abegunde, a member of New Castle County's Financial Advisory Council, launched his campaign for insurance commissioner.\n\nAbegunde, a Democrat, previously lost in the primary to incumbent Trinidad Navarro, who has served in the role since 2016. The two will likely face off again in the primary. In his announcement, Abegunde said would \"bring more insurance products\" to Delaware and provide more options to veterans.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/2024/09/08/delaware-governor-candidate-impressions/75079001007/", "title": "Delaware governor candidate impressions", "text": "A News Journal Editorial | USA TODAY Network Delaware Editorial Board\n\nDelaware News Journal\n\nDelaware’s 2024 primary election is upon us.\n\nVoters in both parties have begun the task of selecting their nominees in the race for governor. Voting in the Sept. 10 primary began Wednesday, Aug. 28 and continues this week, running through Sunday, Sept. 8.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Editorial Board of DelawareOnline.com and The News Journal met with five of the six candidates seeking the state’s highest office. Each candidate brings strengths to their campaigns; each offers a different vision for the First State’s future.\n\nIn our conversations, each candidate acknowledged — and in some cases, shared — our ongoing frustrations about the pace at which legislation and change alike move in Dover. Most acknowledged that Delaware can do far better on issues like government transparency. And each of the five candidates we spoke with expressed a strong desire to move the Delaware electorate forward from the political polarization that has defined national politics over the last decade.\n\nWhile we will not endorse in the primary race — most Delawareans in both parties already likely know their own minds, we believe — we do offer undecided readers these impressions of the candidates we interviewed.\n\nMeet the candidates:These 4 statewide races have contested primaries in Delaware\n\nThe Democrats\n\nDelaware Democrats have managed through a summer that has been defined by a highly competitive contest for the top of the state ticket. Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long, the political veteran who enjoys the support of the Delaware state party and many other establishment organizations within the Democratic milieu, faces competitive challengers in New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer and former state environmental secretary Collin O’Mara.\n\nAn August poll, conducted by Citizens for a New Delaware Way PAC, found Meyer leading the race, with the support of 27% of likely Democratic voters. Hall-Long netted the support of 23% and O’Mara followed with 11%. Still, some 31% of voters in the poll, conducted Aug. 8, were undecided. A later poll found Hall-Long's support slipping while O'Mara gained.\n\nThe Democratic race has been bruising, by all accounts. Hall-Long has faced bruising questions about her campaign finance and its history. In addition, developers unions and a New York compant with a longtime grudge have amplified attacks and pressure on all sides. The race has attracted considerable interest from donors — both in Delaware and outside the First State. In all, the campaigns have collectively raised more than $7 million, making the campaign one of the most expensive in state history.\n\nHere are some of our impressions of each candidate:\n\nCollin O’Mara\n\nThe former Delaware Secretary of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, O’Mara is a Bear resident who is now the CEO of the National Wildlife Federation in Washington. He left DNREC in 2014 and has waged an uphill battle with Democratic voters as a relative outsider.\n\nThat said, O’Mara represents a breath of fresh air for a Delaware Democratic Party steeped in custom and power. While Meyer and Hall-Long have gone on the offensive, O’Mara has preferred to position himself as a candidate who would challenge the First State’s long-held political norms.\n\nWe were especially taken with O’Mara’s interest in redefining the so-called Delaware Way. He supports — as do we — a rethinking of the way businesses is conducted in Dover both in terms of speed and transparency.\n\nO’Mara also said he’d use the powers of the Delaware governorship — among the more powerful in the country — to set an agenda that would tackle education funding, increased investment in climate change mitigation and clean energy jobs.\n\nDoing so, he said, would quicken the pace in Dover.\n\n“There’s not a will to get it done here if there’s pushback,” O’Mara said of the dynamic between the General Assembly and the administration of outgoing Gov. John Carney. “We don’t look at the benefits, so everything looks more expensive but that’s weaponized.”\n\nBethany Hall-Long\n\nThe lieutenant governor is always happy to share the story of her Sussex County roots and how they have shaped her perspectives as a leading Delaware Democrat. In our conversation, she cited her long experience as a nurse, educator, research scientist and politician and said her background and her longstanding service to the First State would guide her as governor.\n\nIndeed, Hall-Long’s command of the systems that deliver progress in Dover and Washington are strengths. Again and again, she mentioned collaborative efforts she’s mounted with lawmakers across the state and the nation to point to her capacity for success.\n\nTo her credit, too, she met our questions about the scrutiny she’s faced over questions about the history of her campaign finance. Forward-looking, Hall-Long said there was “no fraud” and expressed her hopes that Democratic voters would join her in an effort to “move forward.”\n\nOn policy, Hall-Long said she would focus on job growth and supporting Delaware’s small business. She spoke of her goal for Delaware to deliver on universal childcare and said she would create a cabinet-level position to address the needs of First State veterans and active-duty military personnel.\n\n“It’s not just about the policy,” Hall-Long told Delaware Online/The News Journal's editorial board members on Wednesday, Aug. 28. “It’s about having the capacity and the leadership to know where to take Delaware next.”\n\nMatt Meyer\n\nThe New Castle County Executive, first elected to office in 2016 as a political newcomer, is now the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for governor.\n\nMeyer’s ambitions for Delaware and for his own potential term as governor, shone through clearly in a conversation with our editorial board. He pledged to tackle education funding, to expand access to child care and affordable housing and discussed his desire to see Delaware become home to a medical school.\n\nMeyer also expressed frustration about the political culture in Dover — which he characterized as overly focused on catering to the needs of special interests rather than to cause of progress for average Delawareans.\n\n“It takes elected leaders who understand that our job, and my job, is to represent the people who don’t have a seat at the table, who don’t have a moneyed special interest in some decision making,” Meyer told us.\n\nAcknowledging that his resume does not include service in Dover, Meyer pointed to his success in building relationships with the New Castle County Council and with key players in county government to deliver progress. If elected, he said he would work quickly to build relationships with leaders in the General Assembly and in state government to build consensus around an agenda to drive progress.\n\nThe Republicans\n\nRepublicans also face a three-way choice as they select a nominee for governor. Members of the Delaware GOP will chose between state House Rep. Mike Ramone, former New York City police officer Jerrold Price and lifelong Bridgeville resident Bobby Williamson.\n\nOur editorial board met with two of the three candidates as voting got underway in the primary: Ramone and Price. Williamson, after repeated inquiry, did not respond for requests for an interview until this week — and cited his campaign’s inability to meet with us virtually due to bad WiFi access, an issue Williamson said was central to his campaign.\n\nGiven the Democratic Party’s longstanding grip on power across statewide office, the Republican race has attracted less attention — and far less financial support. Still, both Ramone and Price expressed their hopes to cool partisan rancor if elected. Neither mentioned former President Donald Trump in our conversations, even when asked about partisan alliances.\n\nHere are some of our impressions of each candidate:\n\nMike Ramone\n\nA veteran legislator in Dover who has long served in the state House of Representatives — he is now the House Minority Leader — Mike Ramone enjoys the endorsement of the Delaware Republican Party.\n\nRamone takes deep pride in his roots as a native Delawarean and said he believed his many — and sometimes controversial — experiences as an entrepreneur, along with his capacity for building relationships his party and across the aisle, would make him an effective governor. Indeed, at times, Ramone openly harkened back to a pre-Trump Delaware in which a socially moderate, fiscally conservative mindset prevailed among Delaware Republicans. Ramone said he believed that truly is still the case, even now.\n\n“I’m not deep blue, and I’m not scarlet red,” Ramone said, echoing stump speeches. “I’m Delaware yellow,” which he explained to be squarely in the middle of the political spectrum.\n\nRamone’s challenge, as we see it, will be to prove himself right — that Delaware Republicans, many in the thrall of the former president for much of the last decade — will accept a turn back to the political center.\n\nRamone made reasonable assertions about the state’s need to rethink its funding for education, investment in youth and in job growth when we talked policy. In addition, Ramone talked about what he characterized as an ongoing need for Delaware: he is committed to making the state more friendly to business at every level by reconsidering tax policy.\n\nJerry Price\n\nA former New York city police officer who retired to Lewes, Jerry Price told us his top priority as governor would be to focus on what he described as an ever-present crisis in public safety.\n\nPrice, who largely veered away from partisanship during our conversation, said that, if elected, he would work to convice Dover lawmakers to make significant investments in public safety and proposed adding police officers in departments across the state in an effort to create a more responsive and collaborative public safety network that could respond situationally to shootings and narcotics-related crimes, especially in Dover and Wilmington.\n\nOn social issues, though, it’s clear that Price is aligned with Republican culture warriors who want to roll back the clock on social issues like transgender rights. Price said he could not support transgender athletes competing in Delaware.\n\nOn policy, Price talked about the need for the First State to significantly reconsider the way it handles education funding and expressed his belief that schools are essential to building public safety. He has supported access to reproductive healthcare and for higher salaries for Delaware teachers.\n\nBobby Williamson\n\nWilliamson, who was unable to meet with our editorial board, has framed his candidacy around his deep roots in the First State. The Bridgeville resident is a fourth-generation Delawarean, according to his campaign website.\n\nAs DelawareOnline.com and The News Journal have reported, he has billed his candidacy around his identity as a political outsider who advocates for parental freedoms, children and small business. He has also said he supports preservation efforts across the state.\n\nWhen is the state primary election day in Delaware?\n\nThe primary election is Tuesday, Sept. 10.\n\nWhen is Election Day 2024?\n\nThe general election day is Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024.\n\nIs there early voting in Delaware?\n\nEarly voting continues until Sunday, Sept. 8.\n\nWhat do I need to vote early in Delaware?\n\nAt the polling site, a worker will ask you for proof of identity.

He picked Nikki Haley for president (who dropped out of the race after qualifying for Indiana's ballot) and Brad Chambers for governor.\n\n— Alexandria Burris\n\n4:45 p.m.: Brad Chambers would help boost Indiana’s industries, former Democratic voter says\n\nAt the Jewish Community Center on the north side, the polling center was nearly empty by late afternoon, with one or two voters walking in every few minutes. Several voters either didn’t want to talk or didn’t want to share their names and voting decisions publicly, citing broad polarization concerns.\n\nBut Andy Helmbock, 42, said he voted for Brad Chambers for governor, saying the Republican candidate’s background in business would boost the state’s industries, including biotechnology, construction and manufacturing. On the campaign trail, Chambers, founder and CEO of Buckingham Companies, described himself as a political outsider and business leader who can grow Indiana’s economy.\n\n“He’s had a thumbprint on a lot of pulse of businesses,” said Helmbock, who said he was a Democrat but now identifies as an Independent. He added that rising costs of living in coastal states would make Indiana, under Chambers’ leadership, an attractive place for businesses.\n\nChris Seigel, 68, didn’t want to share whom he voted for. He did say he believes Mike Braun will be Indiana’s next governor, although he has little confidence in the Republican frontrunner. Seigel also said he cares deeply about female reproductive rights, and the issue dictated how he voted this election. He described himself as pro-choice.\n\n— Kristine Phillips\n\n4:30 p.m.: Join us for a live discussion of some of the primary's marquee races\n\nIndyStar is going live at 6 p.m. for a panel discussion of some of the election's biggest races so far. Hosted by the Star's government and politics editor Kaitlin Lange, the panel will include Statehouse reporters Brittany Carloni and Kayla Dwyer and opinion editor James Briggs.\n\nAlso joining us for the panel are Abdul-Hakim Shabazz, political commentator and publisher of indypolitics.org, and Democratic strategist Lindsay Haake, whose clients include Democratic Attorney General candidate Destiny Wells.\n\n— Holly Hays\n\n4 p.m.: ‘Rain, sleet or shine, I’m ready to go’\n\nThere's only a couple people voting at the IPS Service Center on Walnut Street.\n\nTiera Betts, 36, said she likes candidates from both political parties. She's a veteran, so she said she'll prioritize whoever can benefit veterans the most.\n\n\"It just depends on what I feel when I open the door,\" Betts said, laughing.\n\nSuzanne Crouch stands out to her; Betts said she admires how Crouch handled the pandemic. On the other hand, she likes how U.S. District 7 Rep. André Carson \"makes sure veterans get their benefits.”\n\nRegardless, voting is important, she said.\n\n“I know my grandparents got hosed down trying to vote, got chased by dogs trying to vote,\" Betts said. \"So whenever it’s time to vote, rain, sleet or shine, I’m ready to go.”\n\n— Nadia Scharf\n\n4 p.m.: Turnout slow at Lucas Oil Stadium a few hours before polls close\n\nThere were more construction workers in the parking lot of Lucas Oil Stadium than voters mid-afternoon. At least one of those workers, 52-year-old Phil Rosenkrans, sauntered over and became a voter – the only voter the polling place saw in half an hour.\n\nThough he finds the premise of being restricted to one party's ballot puzzling and stifling, he nonetheless chose a Republican ballot, as he usually does. On the six-way governor's race, there was just one piece of information he knew: He wanted to pick someone other than U.S. Sen. Mike Braun.\n\nHe knew so little about the other candidates, though, that he picked a name at random toward the middle of the list and couldn't recall what the name was.\n\n\"Too many people had too many negative things to say about him,\" he said. \"I just knew I didn't like him.\"\n\nThe last Republican governor he liked, actually, was Mitch Daniels. He remembers that the economy was good and the roads got fixed up. Daniels certainly represents a bygone era of Indiana politics where mudslinging was taboo, unlike this election: \"He was the dude.\"\n\n— Kayla Dwyer\n\n3:30 p.m.: 'We need somebody who's not afraid to represent for Indiana'\n\nCommunity building and hometown pride are important for mother-daughter duo Karyn Lander, 47, and Camille Lander, 20.\n\nThe pair voted at Lawrence North High School today. Camille graduated from the school in 2022, and she said she looks for candidates who have the community’s best interests in mind, just like she does.\n\nHer and her mother kept an especially close eye on the race for Senate, as they’re keen to find someone who will stick up for the Hoosier state.\n\n“We need somebody who’s not afraid to represent for Indiana,” Camille Lander said.\n\nAs to why they decided to show out for the primary election, Karyn Lander said it’s because they’re voting for the people who “decide who’s going to be on the ballot.”\n\nEven if the turnout is smaller than a general election, Camille Landers said, that raises the stakes that much higher.\n\n“The one that’s seen as less important is the one you got to watch out for,” Camille said.\n\n— Jade Thomas\n\n3:15 p.m.: Voter turnout in HamCo already exceeding that of 2022 primary\n\nAccording to Hamilton County officials, more than 25,200 voters had cast ballots by 3 p.m. on Tuesday, exceeding the number of Election Day voters in the 2022 primary. An additional 3,955 absentee ballots and 11,248 early ballots had been received. Hamilton County sits in the state's 5th Congressional District, where incumbent Republican Victoria Spartz faces a challenge from State Rep. Chuck Goodrich, R-Noblesville, and others.\n\nMore:Here's who is running against Spartz and Goodrich in Indiana's 5th Congressional District\n\nIn Marion County, officials reported 46,362 ballots had been cast by Tuesday afternoon.\n\n— Holly Hays\n\n3:05 p.m.: Republican voters say they're looking for candidates that represent their politics\n\nAJ Bucher, 25, said he didn’t think any candidate on the ballot currently represented him very but voted for Curtis Hill in the Republican primary for governor because he seemed like the most right-leaning candidate.\n\n“He feels the least mainstream GOP to me,” Boucher said outside of the Pike Township Fire station 62.\n\nRyan McCroskey, 47, said he likes current Gov. Eric Holcomb and said there were plenty of candidates to choose from for the Republican primary but eventually chose Brad Chambers.\n\n“I’ve actually met him in person and he just seemed the most real and most sincere to me,” McCroskey said.\n\n— Caroline Beck\n\n3 p.m.: 'You never know, one vote might tip the scale'\n\nIn Fishers on Tuesday, voters cast their ballots in an 1800s-era log cabin on the western edge of the city near the White River. Campaign signs for Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, and Max Engling, a 5th Congressional District Republican candidate, greeted voters at a white picket fence in front of the Historic Ambassador House.\n\nIt was a cloudy afternoon, but a steady group of voters quickly moved in and out of the polling location. There were no lines and voters said they had no problems casting their ballots at the Hamilton County polling site. “It was very quick,” one person said.\n\nMost of the voters Tuesday afternoon were interested in the Republican gubernatorial campaign. Maribeth Degyansky said she pulled a Republican ballot and voted for former Indiana Secretary of Commerce Brad Chambers. Degyansky said she liked his business experience and that he was “not a career politician.”\n\n“He just seems like a down-to-Earth, honest person who would represent the middle class,” she said.\n\nRuss Cable, who lives just two miles from the Ambassador House, said he was interested in the governor’s primary and the 5th Congressional District race, where Victoria Spartz is running for reelection against eight other candidates. Cable said he pulled a Republican ballot, but did not share how he voted. The Fishers resident said he has never seen such a crowded primary in the governor’s race before, which especially makes it important to vote this year.\n\n“You never know, one vote might tip the scale,” Cable said.\n\n— Brittany Carloni\n\n2:45 p.m.: 'I think that (Crouch) can make a difference'\n\nIt’s quiet inside IUPUI’s University Library. Still, a few voters are trickling in.\n\nClaire Weaver voted a Democratic ballot, and said she chose Valerie McCray for her progressive policies. She chose to vote today because she “wants to live in a democracy,” she said.\n\nMike Pollard voted for Suzanne Crouch on the Republican ticket. She has the experience, he said.\n\n“I think that she can make a difference,” Pollard said. “Maybe she wants to finish the unfinished business she had when she was lieutenant governor, but at the highest level now.”\n\nPollard doesn’t align himself with either party. This year, he went Republican because of his conservative values, particularly around government finances, but he says his vote depends on the “conversation” surrounding the candidates.\n\n\"What are the needs, who’s talking more about what’s going on, not just personally but collaboratively, some of the subjects we’re dealing with,\" Pollard said. \"Who is talking more about it, and who’s giving answers.”\n\n— Nadia Scharf\n\n2:30 p.m.: Democrats ponder pulling Republican ballots but decide against it\n\nLinda Schussler and her husband Bob, who usually pull Democratic ballots, considered choosing Republican ones today at Lawrence North High School.\n\nLinda said she wanted the opportunity to vote for a candidate for governor who was the most honest. But she didn’t, as she said, “the information that’s gleaned from primaries is necessary for Democratic planning in the future.”\n\nJim and Jan Fuquay had a similar idea, but decided not to pull a Republican ballot. They were also concerned about the race for governor and were unimpressed that candidates didn’t focus heavily on topics like education.\n\n“They don’t really get in-depth about issues in Indiana,” Jan Fuquay said.\n\nThe couple, who tutor third-graders to improve their literacy skills, want a candidate who’s well-educated, honest and cares a lot about education.\n\n— Jade Thomas\n\n2 p.m.: 'It feels like everyone is running for governor'\n\nTim Jedlicka, 61, said he came out to vote in the primary election for the “insane governor race — it feels like everyone is running for governor.”\n\nHe said it was hard to decide whom to vote for because he felt the candidates were too caught up in federal issues. Jedlicka wouldn’t say whom he ultimately voted for in the Republican gubernatorial primary, but said he’d like to hear more talk about school funding.\n\n“I’m from Illinois where a budget surplus is unheard of,” he said at the Roy G. Holland Memorial Park Building.\n\nHe said he would like to see that money put to use.\n\nThe Fishers resident also said he did not vote for U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz or state Rep. Chuck Goodrich for Indiana’s 5th Congressional District in the primary.\n\n“They both can go,” Jedlicka said.\n\n— Sarah Bowman\n\n1:30 p.m.: 'It concerns me seeing money that should go to the public schools going to the vouchers'\n\nGreg Bowes, 64, said he ended up voting for the Pike school referendum question even though he is hesitant to see more state dollars go to charter schools.\n\nHe ultimately voted yes because he said at least the dollars weren’t going to private schools and would be staying in public schools.\n\n“At least charter schools have a little bit more oversight than the voucher schools do, which can basically do whatever they want, and it concerns me seeing money that should go to public schools going to the vouchers,” Bowes, a Pike Township resident, told IndyStar where he voted at Snacks Crossing Elementary School.\n\n— Caroline Beck\n\n1 p.m.: 'Indiana is a red state and only getting redder. All I have is my vote'\n\nA steady stream of people went in to vote at the Delaware Township Government Center over the lunch hour and were able to complete the task in about 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nMonica Shimer, 54 of Fishers, voted a Democrat ballot. She said some people may feel like it’s a lost vote, but she still wants her voice to be heard.\n\n“Indiana is a red state and only getting redder. All I have is my vote, I’m not going to give up,” she said.\n\nShimer said she considered pulling a Republican ballot. She said if there had been a “real” opponent to Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, she would have voted Republican “to be a counterweight and vote for anyone else but him.”\n\nLikewise, Linda Schenk, 75, said she and her husband voted a Democrat ballot.\n\n“That’s probably why we were in and out so fast — not a long ballot,” said Schenk, of Fishers. “We are definitely one of a minority in the area.”\n\nSchenk grew up in Indy but recently moved back to the area after 40 years in Evansville. She said there would be more representation on both sides of the ballot down there and “it’s been an adjustment” being back in the Indy area “where things feel much more one-sided.”\n\n— Sarah Bowman\n\n12:15 p.m.: Gubernatorial primary and 5th congressional district races bring out Fishers voters\n\nAt the Delaware Township Community Center, Nate Salsgiver, 36, said he voted to re-elect U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz to represent Indiana’s 5th District. Salsgiver also said the vote for the Republican gubernatorial candidate was a bit more difficult to decide since there were a few he liked based on what he knows. But he declined to say who ultimately got his primary vote.\n\nJamie Zappala, 31, said she voted for Brad Chambers in the Republican gubernatorial primary. She said he seems likable and the Fishers mayor had endorsed him. She and her family are relatively new to the area, moving to Indiana from Ohio about three years ago.\n\nZappala said she also wants to set a good example for her children about the importance of voting and respecting everyone’s opinions, even if they’re different.\n\n“We’re a young family, and I want to be able to have those conversations about different topics and issues,” she said.\n\n— Sarah Bowman\n\nNoon: Strong feelings about Braun and Pike Township referendum bring voters out\n\nSome voters told IndyStar they pulled Republican ballots — even if they don't usually — especially because they wanted to vote for or against U.S. Sen. Mike Braun for governor.\n\nDarlene Swilik, 61, lives in Indianapolis in the Pike Township area and said she decided to vote for Braun after talking with her neighbors about the governor's race.\n\n“It was general consensus among my neighbors that they went with him because I don't always keep up like I should,” Swilik told IndyStar when she went to vote at Eagle Creek Elementary.\n\nMatthew Smith, 46, said he typically votes Democrat but voted on the Republican ballot because he wanted to vote against Braun. Smith selected Brad Chambers.\n\n“It was quite fun honestly and made me feel like my vote counted more,” Smith said.\n\nVoters had strong opinions about the Pike school referendum, as well. Swilik said she voted no because she didn’t want her taxes raised. Kathy Koehler, 52, said she voted yes because she always wants to support schools.\n\n“If they say they need more support, then I’m willing to help them,” Koehler said.\n\nJeanne Mathews, 56, is a former Pike Township teacher and came out to vote at the same school where she used to teach, Eagle Creek Elementary School, and said she voted in favor of the referendum question.\n\n“As a former teacher, I understand how important it is that our schools are well-funded,” Mathews said.\n\n— Caroline Beck\n\n11:15 a.m.: 'Our teachers deserve to be paid more'\n\nRev. Dr. Richard Curry Jr., senior pastor of True Tried Missionary Baptist Church, said he came out to Jonathan Jennings School 109 because he felt it was his duty to exercise his right to vote.\n\nWhile he wouldn’t say if he pulled a Democratic or Republican ballot, he did say he was closely watching the presidential and governor races.\n\nHe also said while he’s worried about rising tax rates, he did vote in favor of the Pike schools referendum.\n\n“Especially when thinking about our African American children, I think they deserve better schools and our teachers deserve to be paid more,” Curry said.\n\n— Caroline Beck\n\n10:35 a.m.: 'Things need to change'\n\nRoger and Tesha Conrad, 59, see voting as one way to correct the course of government.\n\n“Things need to change,” Tesha said. “Neither of us are happy with where things are going, so we have to step up and do what’s necessary, which is vote.”\n\nBoth Tesha and Roger voted for Brad Chambers in the gubernatorial race because they see him as an outsider, not a career politician.\n\n“I think that’s the way the system started,” Roger said. “We need to get back to having more part-time politicians.”\n\n— Bradley Hohulin\n\n10:30 a.m.: 'I want to make sure we have a voice'\n\nDowntown Westfield was fairly sleepy in the late morning, with songbirds and construction equipment supplying most of the soundtrack. Still, every couple of minutes, someone walked up the steps of Westfield City Hall to cast their vote.Rick Yelle, 59, said he's voting because he often isn’t satisfied with how officials act on behalf of people like him.“I don’t always feel that we’re politically represented by people who stand for us,” Yelle said. “So whatever ‘us’ is, I want to make sure we have a voice.”\n\n— Bradley Hohulin\n\n9:45 a.m.: Voters tout candidates 'willing to be in the middle'\n\nVoters filtered into the Crossroads AME Church slowly on a rainy morning, with about two or three entering every five minutes.\n\nGregory Smith, 72, who voted at Crossroads AME Church, is concerned about the race for governor. He pulled a Democratic ballot but wondered why he’s seen little advertising on that front.\n\nThe governor's race was the main reason Megan Plotner, 36, stepped out to vote as well. Plotner, who pulled a Republican ballot, wouldn’t share which candidate she chose but did say it was not Mike Braun.“I want someone willing to be in the middle,” Plotner said.\n\nGreg Swallow, 48, agreed. He wants to return to having debates about topics like Medicare and free market economics, instead of “cultural warfare.” He pulled a Republican ballot because he said there weren’t as many choices on the Democratic side.“I’m 100% voting against Donald Trump,” Swallow said. “I’m 100% against Mike Braun. And it’s 100% because of January 6.”\n\n— Jade Thomas\n\n8:45 a.m.: Couple opts for candidates who bring positivity\n\nOutside of the occasional school board race, Paul Kropp, 64, and his wife Glenna, 62, seldom miss an election of any kind.\n\n“Given the chance to vote, we vote,” Glenna said.\n\nShe cast her gubernatorial vote for Brad Chambers, while Paul voted for Eric Doden. Glenna said Chambers struck her as a candidate with new ideas.\n\n“He just seemed more like an outsider, businessman type,” she said. “I think (Mike) Braun will probably win, but I just wanted to cast my vote for someone different at this time.”\n\nPaul, who moved to Carmel with Glenna from Kouts three years ago, gravitated toward Doden’s focus on small towns with his Indiana Main Street Initiative.\n\nNeither Glenna nor Paul voted to re-elect Victoria Spartz for Congress. Paul voted for Goodrich, while Glenna voted for speech pathologist Raju Chinthala.\n\nPaul said Spartz’ decision to exit, then re-enter the race was enough to make him vote against her, although he didn’t feel strongly about any of her competitors. Glenna received several of Chinthala’s campaign flyers and appreciated that he emphasized what he planned to do rather than tear down his opponents.\n\n“I felt like Goodrich and Spartz were just negative all the time, every flyer,” Glenna said.\n\nBoth Kropps said they were weary of candidates focusing more on attacking their opponents than promoting their policy.\n\n“And I understand that’s the way you win an election,” Paul said. “You beat everyone else down and you’re the last one left. But I’m tired of it, yeah.”\n\n— Bradley Hohulin\n\n8:30 a.m.: Election Day weather brings the possibility of severe storms\n\nStorms moving across Indiana today have the potential to bring large hail and tornadoes, the National Weather Service said.\n\nThe initial, less severe, wave of storms will move through the area between 9 a.m. and noon.\n\nMore severe storms are expected to roll through between 3-10 p.m. with the highest risk between 6-10 p.m.\n\nThere is a “broader tornado threat across Central Indiana today. This includes a giant hail threat,” a National Weather Service briefing indicates. Storms are expected to continue into Wednesday.\n\nWhat to expect:Large hail, damaging winds, possible tornadoes could hit Indiana soon.\n\n— Jen Guadarrama\n\n8 a.m.: 'The primaries can end up mattering more than the actual election'\n\nCarmel Clay Public Library was mostly quiet early Tuesday morning, with a handful of Hamilton County voters trickling in during the first two hours of polling. But Dan Stamer, 33, wasn’t going to miss the primary.\n\n“As a voter in Indiana, the county-wide or state-wide elections tend to be a bit of a home run for one party,” Stamer said. “So the primaries can end up mattering more than the actual election.”\n\nHe said he filled out a Republican ballot because his choices will ultimately matter more when electing leaders in historically red Indiana.\n\nCara Langford, 55, said she has a responsibility to vote, even in primaries.\n\n“I feel it’s a duty,” she said. “People before us have gone to war and died for our freedoms so we can have a voice.”\n\nLangford and her husband John, 55, both cited their faith as motivation for voting for Eric Doden in the gubernatorial race.\n\n“I’m a Christian, and his beliefs align with mine,” John said.\n\nBoth of the Langfords voted to re-elect Victoria Spartz for Congress in the 5th District. Cara felt Spartz’ most prominent competitor, Chuck Goodrich, wouldn’t represent her values in Congress.\n\n“My understanding of him is that he wasn’t consistently pro-life,” she said.\n\n— Bradley Hohulin\n\n7:50 a.m.: Chambers heads out to the polls early\n\nBrad Chambers, the former commerce Secretary who's on the Republican gubernatorial primary ballot, voted at Second Presbyterian Church, saying he heard about an “incredible candidate on the ballot” for governor. He said he believes this candidate can honestly fix Indiana’s challenges.\n\nThe candidate? Brad Chambers.\n\nCasting a supporting vote at the same place was Mike Fritton, 56, who said he's known Chambers for over 20 years.\n\n“What he has done in his business career will translate well to the political arena,” said Fritton, who lives in Indianapolis.\n\n— Jade Thomas\n\n7:45 a.m.: Appreciating the right to vote brings people out early\n\nProperty taxes in Pike Township were at the top of Breaford Alexander’s list of concerns when he voted this morning at Second Presbyterian Church. Alexander, 50, pulled a Democratic ballot and said that he voted this morning because so many people fought for his right to do so.\n\nLikewise, Jaylen Alexander, 21, encouraged others to come out and vote. He pulled a Democratic ballot, saying that he believes people should be able to do what they want and that he’s seen Republicans try to take people’s rights away.\n\n— Jade Thomas\n\nWhere can I vote in the 2024 primary election?\n\nPolls are open in Indiana from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nIn Marion and Johnson counties, you can vote at any polling location in the county, known as vote centers. A list of Marion County vote centers is available at vote.indy.gov/vote-centers. A list of Johnson County vote centers is available here.\n\nIn Hamilton County, voters have to cast ballots in their assigned precincts. To find your polling location, visit indianavoters.in.gov.\n\nLive somewhere else? Check this list to see if your county uses vote centers. Or visit your county clerk's website.\n\nYou must present a valid photo ID to vote in person. Visit the Secretary of State's website for more information on acceptable forms of ID.\n\n— Kayla Dwyer\n\nHomework to prep for the polls:Everything you need to know about 2024 Indiana primary election\n\nRepublican gubernatorial primary is marquee race\n\nThis is a gubernatorial primary unlike any other: Six candidates, several of them very well funded, have been duking it out for the nomination, with one candidate starting his campaign exactly three years ago.\n\nPolls have shown U.S. Sen. Mike Braun with a comfortable lead over Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch, former commerce Secretary Brad Chambers, Fort Wayne entrepreneur Eric Doden, former Attorney General Curtis Hill and Indianapolis mother Jamie Reitenour. But they've also shown a sizeable contingent of voters undecided ― a large enough portion for the other candidates to hold out hope, especially because one candidate could win with about 20% of the vote.\n\nMore:Read our profiles of all the Republican gubernatorial candidates\n\nThere's only one Democratic candidate for governor: former state schools superintendent Jennifer McCormick. Most observers consider this primary to be the main competition for governor. It would take a significant amount of resources and unique conditions for the Democratic candidate to defeat the Republican nominee in November, given the deep-red demographics in Indiana, and thus far, McCormick hasn't shown signs of amassing such resources.\n\n— Kayla Dwyer\n\nOpen Congressional seats draw major competition\n\nThree Indiana representatives in the U.S. House are giving up their seats this election. One of them, U.S. Rep. Jim Banks, is running for Senate. (That's another race to watch, by the way ― Banks is unopposed for the Republican nomination, but there are two Democrats vying to run against him in the general election.)\n\nTwo congressional districts that are in central Indiana, the 5th and the 6th Congressional Districts, have a lot of competition and a striking amount of self-funding.\n\nIn the 5th district, which includes Hamilton County, many Republicans jumped into the primary because they thought incumbent Rep. Victoria Spartz was not going to run again, as she stated previously. But she changed her mind, and now that race appears to be a head-to-head between Spartz and state Rep. Chuck Goodrich. Goodrich has loaned $4.6 million to his campaign; Spartz, $700,000 as of May 3.\n\nMore:Here's who is running against Spartz and Goodrich in Indiana's 5th Congressional District\n\nMore:With Greg Pence out, 7 Republicans vie for Indy-based 6th Congressional District\n\nIn the 6th district, which includes Johnson and southern Marion counties, seven Republicans are vying to replace retiring Rep. Greg Pence. They include former Indianapolis mayoral candidate Jefferson Shreve, state Rep. Mike Speedy and state Sen. Jeff Raatz, former lawmakers like John Jacob and Bill Frazier, and political newcomers Jamison Carrier and Darin Childress. Several of these candidates, particularly Shreve, also loaned hefty sums to their campaigns.\n\n— Kayla Dwyer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/09/04/delaware-2024-race-lieutenant-governor-kyle-evans-gay-president-joe-biden/70736615007/", "title": "Delaware 2024 elections got more competitive with this ...", "text": "Editor's note: This story has been updated to include the correct date of the 2024 state primary.\n\nWelcome to The Press Room, a weekly roundup of the major stories and happenings in Delaware politics.\n\nThis week’s edition focuses on the 2024 lieutenant governor’s race, nominations made by Gov.

Mike Ramone, former New York City police officer Jerrold Price and lifelong Bridgeville resident Bobby Williamson.\n\nMeyer, whose election to county executive in 2016 was his first foray into elected office, promised to tackle education reform; address affordability in health care, housing and child care; and pursue “big, bold” steps on a state-level, among other efforts.\n\nHere are the takeaways on what a Meyer administration would look like if he’s elected as Delaware governor:\n\nA medical school in Delaware\n\nManaging Delaware’s most populous county during a global pandemic taught Meyer something – areas with medical schools seemed to have a “leg up” in the health crisis, he said.\n\nIt’s why early in his candidacy as governor he proposed creating a medical school in the First State.\n\n“We need a hub to attract and retain medical talent in our area,” Meyer said. “I’m a strong believer in a medical school.”\n\nWhile it’s not something that could be completed “on day one,” Meyer said they’ve priced out what a venture like this would cost and depending on budgetary considerations, the county executive believes, if he’s elected, they could break ground within his first term.\n\nKent, Sussex counties ‘getting a raw deal’\n\nAs New Castle County executive, Meyer said he recognizes the development problems that can arise within a community.\n\nWhile New Castle County has had “growth issues in Middletown,” he said those issues “pale in comparison to what they’re seeing in Kent and especially Sussex County.” He said the southern Delaware counties are “getting a raw deal.”\n\nAs Delaware governor, Meyer said he’d want to develop a “comprehensive plan that’s inclusive of public views” and has “some enforcement mechanism.”\n\nA relatively new political action committee backed by Sussex County developers has popped up in this year’s elections, raising concern that special interests could sway local elections, according to Spotlight Delaware.\n\nSUSSEX COUNTY ELECTIONS:Land use, affordable housing, infrastructure, oh my: Elections to watch in Sussex\n\nThe PAC, called Preserve Sussex, holds about $75,000 in its coffers ahead of the Sept. 10 primary election, which is nearly three times more than the leading county council candidate has raised, Spotlight reported Aug. 26.\n\n“We can't just let the deepest pocketed individuals control the future of our communities,” Meyer said. “We need smart growth.”\n\nNot ‘beholden’ to any one donor\n\nEven though Meyer’s campaign has far surpassed his Democratic opponents with nearly $1.6 million in his war chest, according to the latest campaign finance reports filed with the Delaware Department of Elections, the county executive said he’s not “beholden” to any one donor.\n\nMeyer has faced criticism for receiving donations from local developers and Republicans, but he pointed out that he’s received “nearly 10,000 contributions” with about 80% of them from Delawareans.\n\n“It’s not hard when you have 10,000 contributions to find one or two or three or five people and build a narrative,” he said. “But to say I’m beholden to that person among 10,000 contributions in any way is kind of crazy.”\n\nEasier access to public records\n\nIf elected governor, Meyer said he would also look to expand and provide easier access to public records.\n\nDelaware’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) law outlines how government and public entities must go about providing access to public information, but it also provides several exemptions that Delaware governments are fond of using to block access.\n\nCAMPAIGN FINANCE ISSUES:Audit finds Hall-Long's campaign finances 'incomplete, inaccurate, misleading'\n\n“I think we need a FOIA-type open checkbook,” Meyer said. “I think there’s a certain set of documents we should talk about and say we have an obligation to put (them out) just like meeting minutes.”\n\nThose records could include pertinent emails or letters from other department heads and government agencies, he said.\n\n“It’s something that as a Delawarean really pisses me off,” Meyer said about government transparency. “Like the unavailability of data about lead exposure to our children in schools is absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nGot a tip?

GOP chair drops out of governor race\n\nDelaware congressional race\n\nSince announcing her campaign for Delaware’s open Senate seat last year, the race to win U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester’s vacating congressional seat has changed considerably.\n\nBusinessman Earl Cooper, state Sen. Sarah McBride and financier Elias Weir are competing for the Democratic nomination, while Donyale Hall and John J. Whalen III vie for the Republican nomination.\n\nSarah McBride, Democrat\n\nThe first Democrat to announce her campaign this past spring, McBride intends to secure access to reproductive health care and general health care, enhance further protections for unions, improve access and affordability to child care and increase investment in attainable renewable energy.\n\nIf elected, McBride, who represents Claymont, would become the first trans person elected to federal office. She would also become the youngest elected member of Congress to represent the First State since President Joe Biden won a Senate seat in 1972.\n\nIn addition to an endorsement from the state Democratic Party, McBride has also received the support of several state officials, including Attorney General Kathy Jennings and state Treasurer – and former competitor – Colleen Davis, as well as Blunt-Rochester and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi.\n\nEarl Cooper, Democrat\n\nIn filing his candidacy earlier this summer, Wilmington businessman Earl Cooper has built his platform on committing to social change and development across the First State.\n\nCooper designed and launched the Housing Pilot Program, which helps residents achieve homeownership through “sweat equity,” as well as to improve citywide infrastructure, renovate local neighborhoods and create accessible and affordable living spaces.\n\nElias Weir, Democrat\n\nThe last Democratic candidate to file his bid for the role, Elias Weir, who previously ran for Delaware’s lone congressional seat in 2016.\n\nA former representative of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local No. 3, Weir’s prior experience includes working in finance and public safety.\n\nDonyale Hall, Republican\n\nBusinesswoman and veteran Donyale Hall was the first Republican candidate to file her bid to represent Delaware, with the intent to create more well-paying jobs, help lower costs and inflation, strengthen public safety and fixing the statewide public education system, according to her campaign.\n\nIn addition to her past service in the U.S. Air Force, Hall also serves as the current president of the education and public policy-based organization Frederick Douglas Foundation, and previously served as a board member of the Friends of Delaware Veterans and a member of the City of Dover Police Chief’s Advisory Committee, among other roles.\n\nJohn J. Whalen III, Republican\n\nThe last to file his candidacy, lifelong Delawarean and retired businessman John J. Whalen III seeks to expand national security and lower overall costs.\n\nBefore running a residential construction company, Whalen served in the state Department of Public Safety, Division of State Police, for over two decades.\n\nDelaware governor's race\n\nLt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long, New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer and former secretary of the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Collin O’Mara are vying for the Democratic line for governor. Jerrold R. Price, Delaware House Rep. Mike Ramone and Bridgeville businessman Bobby Williamson are running on the Republican line.\n\nCollin O’Mara, Democrat\n\nO’Mara, CEO of the nonprofit National Wildlife Federation, aims to increase support for working families and older residents, fix the statewide public education system and adopt \"Green Amendment\" cementing every First Stater’s right to clean water, air and land, according to his campaign website.\n\nDespite facing two same-party candidates well known in First State politics, O’Mara told Spotlight Delaware he believes that there is still “opportunity for someone who is outside the system to fill the vacuum.”\n\nO’Mara has received endorsements from several organizations and groups, including the Delaware Working Families Party, League of Conservation Voters Action Fund and the National Resources Defense Council Action Fund, among others.\n\nMatt Meyer, Democrat\n\nMeyer, who has served as New Castle County executive since 2017, wants to focus on increasing access to housing and healthcare, expand public safety and raise funding for public schools across the state.\n\nGUBERNATORIAL DEBATE:Candidates for Delaware governor debate education, infrastructure and integrity\n\nIn an interview with Spotlight Delaware, Meyer’s campaign team said his past experiences both as a businessman and a public school teacher, as well as his “successful track record” of addressing ongoing issues such as housing insecurity, public safety and quality of life as county executive demonstrate what he will bring to the role of governor.\n\nMeyer has received endorsements from the American-Ethiopian Public Affairs Committee, former state chairman of the Delaware Democratic Party Erik Raser-Schramm and, more recently, LGBTQ+ and Democratic Party activist Peter Rosenstein and the editorial board from the newspaper The Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nBethany Hall-Long, Democrat\n\nHall-Long has built her platform on advancing universal child care and early education and expanding the statewide workforce and access to affordable housing.\n\nDespite facing challenges throughout the course of her campaign, Hall-Long said she remains dedicated to helping “continue to move Delaware forward.”\n\nHall-Long has served as the state’s lieutenant governor since 2017, after having spent a decade serving in both the state Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nSince April, Hall-Long has received endorsements from numerous state officials, unions and organizations across the state, including current Gov. John Carney and the state Democratic Party.\n\nJerrold Price, Republican\n\nRetired police officer Jerrold Price was the first Republican to announce his campaign in December 2023, intent on increasing the presence of law enforcement to combat violent crime, expanding rehabilitation programs and advocating for insurance reform.\n\nA resident of Lewes, Price previously served as an officer in the New York Police Department, and has also served in the Rehoboth Beach Police Department.\n\nGOP PRIMARY:Delaware's governor race gets crowded with 3-way primary for Republicans, Democrats\n\nMike Ramone, Republican\n\nHouse Minority Leader Mike Ramone, who represents Pike Creek, has been in office since 2008.\n\nA lifelong Delawarean and entrepreneur, Ramone's commitment as a state official remains \"to help the community.\"\n\nRamone filed his candidacy in May and has been endorsed by the Delaware Republican Party.\n\nBobby Williamson, Republican\n\nA third-generational Delawarean and businessman, Bobby Williamson launched his campaign early last month to promote the growth of small businesses, defend Second Amendment protections and promote alternative opportunities for education.\n\nWilliamson has also been an advocate for rehabilitating local communities and housing across the First State, as well as a proponent of \"a positive 'hands-on' approach in community development,\" according to his campaign website.\n\nLieutenant governor's race\n\nThree Democratic candidates are currently vying for lieutenant governor – all widely familiar across First State politics.\n\nThe candidates include state Sen. Kyle Evans Gay; state House Rep. Sherry Dorsey Walker; and Debbie Harrington, a retired U.S. Army colonel and vice chair of the state Democratic Party.\n\nWhoever wins the lieutenant governor’s race will then face off against Republican and former state Rep. Ruth Briggs King.\n\nSherry Dorsey Walker, Democrat\n\nDorsey Walker, who represents the city of Wilmington, has built her platform on providing further protections for both educators and students, expanding benefits for farmers and increasing economic opportunities for veterans, women and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Color) communities.\n\nDorsey Walker said she believes that her experience in the state General Assembly and in public service have prepared her for taking on any and all challenges head-on.\n\n“When people tell me things can’t be done, I literally show people what can be done through my faith,” she said.\n\nDorsey Walker previously ran for the position in 2016, but lost to Hall-Long in the primary election.\n\nKyle Evans Gay, Democrat\n\nGay, who represents northern Wilmington, then announced her run a few months later, intending to increase funds for early education, criminal justice reform and improve residents’ access to quality healthcare.\n\nGay said she intends to lead the charge in tackling these and other “systemic issues” facing Delaware, and in “ensuring equity underlines all” she and fellow legislators do to better the lives of all First Staters.\n\nGay has also received the state Democratic Party’s endorsement.\n\nDebbie Harrington, Democrat\n\nAnnouncing her campaign a few weeks after Gay, Harrington has prioritized community resources for mental health, building “a responsive system of support” for residents with disabilities and providing further resources to veterans throughout the state.\n\nIf elected, Dorsey Walker or Harrington would become the first Black woman in the state to serve in the role.\n\nInsurance commissioner’s race\n\nThe same two Democrats will again face off for state insurance commissioner in the September primary.\n\nIncumbent Trinidad Navarro has served as the state’s 26th insurance commissioner since 2016, and won reelection 2020 after being challenged by Democrat Kayode Abegunde.\n\nThe two will square off again Sept. 10.\n\nTrinidad Navarro, Democrat\n\nNavarro said his campaign is focused on the future and on further protections for consumers, including providing long-term care and overall assistance with narrowing down – and ultimately determining – insurance benefits.\n\nBefore becoming insurance commissioner, Navarro served for two decades in the New Castle County Police Department and was elected as the New Castle County sherriff in 2010.\n\nNavarro's campaign has also been endorsed by the state Democratic Party.\n\nKayode Abegunde, Democrat\n\nAbegunde hopes to further address the ongoing issue of redlining – when loans and other financial services are denied to residents based on race, ethnicity or place of residence – in insurance coverage across the First State, pledging to “close the gap” and create “equal opportunity for everyone.”\n\nAbegunde is also a member of the New Castle County's Financial Advisory Council, and has previous experience in accounting, finance and social services.\n\nGot a tip?

This particular trip to the polls was special: The 30-year-old voted for herself.\n\n“I’ve never voted for someone like me before,” McBride said.\n\nMcBride overwhelmingly won a two-person Democratic primary for a state Senate seat. And the makeup of her district, with its large base of registered Democratic voters, all but assures that McBride will win the seat in November, making her the nation’s first openly transgender state senator.\n\nMcBride ran a campaign focused on issues like health care, infrastructure and schools. But she recognizes the historic nature of her primary win.\n\n“One thing that I do think about is that in Delaware or North Carolina, or in Texas or Montana, there will be a trans kid who wakes up on Wednesday and … sees that the sky’s the limit for them,” she said. “That their dreams and their identities are not mutually exclusive.”\n\nMcBride is part of a surge of transgender candidates this election cycle. At least 16 trans candidates are running for statehouse seats in 2020, according to a tally by the LGBTQ Victory Fund, an organization that works to increase the number of openly LGBTQ+ candidates in office.\n\nAnnise Parker, president and CEO of Victory Fund, called the number of candidates “eye-popping.”\n\n“Every time we elect someone, it sets a new milestone,” she said. “It’s a big deal.”\n\nJust a few years ago, there were no openly transgender people serving in statehouses. Althea Garrison, a Black woman, was elected to the Massachusetts statehouse as a Republican in 1992, but was outed by the media against her will. In 2012, Stacie Laughton became the first openly trans person to be elected to a statehouse, but the Democrat resigned her New Hampshire House seat before she was sworn into office.\n\nDanica Roem won a delegate seat in 2017 in the Virginia General Assembly, becoming the first openly trans candidate to both be elected and seated to a state legislature. There are now four trans people serving in state legislatures: Lisa Bunker and Gerri Cannon won seats in 2018 to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, and Brianna Titone won a seat in the Colorado House of Representatives the same year.\n\nSoon, those numbers might further increase. Some candidates may have a greater chance at success in November, depending on their respective districts. Ultimately, advocates hope to at least double the number of trans legislators in statehouses, from four to eight.\n\nTaylor Small, a 26-year-old in Vermont, advanced in her Democratic primary on Aug. 11 for a state representative seat. If she wins in November, as she’s expected, she would become the first openly transgender state legislator in Vermont. Small, who is one of three trans candidates who ran for the Vermont statehouse this year, credits Roem and other trans candidates (in Vermont in 2018, Christine Hallquist became the first openly transgender candidate to win a major party’s nominee for governor) for paving the way.\n\n“We have seen openly trans legislators make it into positions of power. So a reality that we have not seen for ourselves before is actually achievable,” Small said. “We have seen history already been made and so therefore, I think of it as a mirror: Reflecting that this is an opportunity that can be presented for trans folks, or folks just generally in the LGBTQ community, that hasn’t been there.”\n\nTransgender candidates are also running for Congress, city council and other local seats. A handful of candidates who identify openly as gender non-conforming, nonbinary or two-spirit are also seeking elected office. There are 28 openly trans people serving at any level of government in the United States. The bulk serve in local government seats.\n\nVictory Fund estimates there are 864 LGBTQ+ people in elected offices nationwide. The organization counted at least 540 LGBTQ+ people who will be on the ballot in November, the most ever (they tallied over 430 candidates in 2018).\n\nVictory Fund is among the organizations that have stepped up training in recent years to support LGBTQ+ candidates. Parker said although the data is limited, transgender candidates win at a rate proportional to their presence on the ballot.\n\n“If you’re a good candidate and you do a good job and you’re a right fit for your district, you have just as good a chance as anybody else of winning. And the trans candidates who are running absolutely know that. They see Danica, they see Brianna, they see Gerri and Lisa … they see themselves. And they know they can do it. It creates a virtuous cycle.”\n\nThe election of President Donald Trump in 2016 has spurred trans people to consider elected office instead of just local community organizing and advocacy, according to Helen Boyd Kramer, an author and instructor of gender studies at Lawrence University in Wisconsin. She said trans people understand the unnecessary politicization of bodies, choice, and medical care “in deep ways.”\n\n“The threat at this point for trans people is pretty direct,” she said, adding: “I think a lot of trans people who find themselves otherwise able to are running in big and small offices all over the place. So having that representation right now seems especially important.”\n\nSeveral trans candidates have expressed outrage at the administration’s policies toward the LGBTQ+ community. Small, in Vermont, said it’s important to recognize the rhetoric coming from the White House “that is constantly denigrating trans people.”\n\n“There is this piece of, no, we are not all of these horrible things that you’re saying, but instead we are leaders,” she said. “We are change makers. We are here to uplift.”\n\nTransgender rights:Supreme Court win propels lower court victories\n\nKramer also noted that though the increase in candidates can seem sudden, trans people have been politically active for decades. The first trans delegation came to the Democratic National Convention in the early 2000s. In 2016, McBride became the first openly transgender person to speak at a major party’s national convention when she spoke during the DNC.\n\nThe jump in candidates is the culmination of what happens when a group of people fight for their civil rights: They seek elected office. And victories like Roem’s make clear what is possible.\n\n“The specific attack on trans people has motivated people,” she said. “And I think that that’s common in a lot of communities, like when you’ve got people basically saying, ‘Hey, we’re gonna take away your rights,’ then people are motivated to actually get themselves into some kind of position where they can have some kind of change.”\n\nMcBride said a lot of candidates have seen their rights and dignity undermined by the Trump administration.\n\n“I think that the attacks … against LGBTQ people, against women, people of color, immigrants, Muslims, I think it has reinforced the need to have more diversity at the table, to have more voices at the table and to have all of our communities reflected and represented in our legislative bodies and in our government,” she said.\n\nThe bulk of openly transgender candidates are Democrats, according to Victory Fund. For Jennifer Williams, that highlights the need for more Republican trans candidates. In 2019, Williams, a Republican, mounted an unsuccessful bid for the New Jersey State Assembly, becoming the first openly transgender person to run for a legislative seat there.\n\nBut Williams, who is considering another run in 2021, recognizes that there is a tension in being a transgender Republican with the Trump administration in office.\n\nWilliams emphasized that she and other Republican trans people do not support those policy decisions — and that’s all the more reason for them to run.\n\n“We need to have more transgender people in this party to step forward and run,” she said. “Because that’s the only way the leaders of the party are going to listen to us.”\n\nOut of the hundreds of LGBTQ+ candidates who are elected officials, only 28 are Republicans, according to Victory Fund. Elliot Imse, Victory Fund’s senior communications director, said the nonpartisan organization endorses candidates who support equality and are viable candidates. That often precludes the limited number of Republican LGBTQ+ candidates from securing a Victory Fund endorsement. Imse added that many of the Trump administration’s policies are homophobic and transphobic.\n\n“The goal is certainly to ensure more LGBTQ people and more trans people run for the Republican Party, because I am a big believer in change from the inside,” he said. “But unfortunately the party’s really moved in the wrong direction over the last four years.”\n\nWith the number of transgender candidates expected to increase in subsequent election cycles, many of the current candidates have talked about the balancing act of running for office while talking about their identity.\n\nMadeline Eden, who won a Democratic primary in March for a seat in the Texas House of Representatives, has tried to focus her campaign on issues like election accessibility and rural broadband. If elected, Eden would become the first openly transgender legislator in the state. She said her identity is not something she’s running on.\n\n\"There’s so many more reasons for running for office here in Texas right now than that. I think it’s important, I think we need equitable trans representation in our state legislature, especially here,” she said. “But, I think that’s not as important as things like health care, or broadband, or the pandemic response, or local control, or just the hundreds of other things that our state has screwed up over the past 20 years.”\n\nMcBride has also tried to focus on issues. She has particularly prioritized accessible and affordable health care after helping her husband, Andrew, as he battled a terminal cancer diagnosis. He died in 2014. McBride thinks about one of their last conversations a lot.\n\n“I can hear him saying, ‘I love you, and I’m proud of you,’ ” she said.\n\nVictory Fund has endorsed a handful statehouse candidates this election, including McBride, Eden, Small and Stephanie Byers, a transgender woman who won her Democratic primary on Aug. 4. Because of the set-up of her district, Byers is on track to become the first out trans person ever elected to public office in Kansas.\n\nJessica Katzenmeyer has also secured an endorsement from Victory Fund. She won her April 7 Democratic primary in Wisconsin and would be the first openly trans state legislator in her state. Katzenmeyer, a first-time candidate, is a ride-share driver who wakes up around 5 a.m. each day to get in a shift before focusing on her mostly virtual campaign. A long-time community organizer, she has tried to focus on health care issues following a medical emergency in 2019.\n\nKatzenmeyer said that trans people, who have been continually marginalized, can provide another level of empathy in the statehouse.\n\n“Representation, it truly matters,” she said. “We need to have a more diverse legislature.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/iowa-mourns/2020/10/12/coronavirus-covid-deaths-in-iowa-lives-remembered/3477467001/", "title": "These are the names of more than 800 of the Iowans who have died ...", "text": "The numbers associated with Iowa’s coronavirus pandemic come regularly.

Among the publics, the Henlopen Conference earned 11 of those championships. The Diamond State Conference nabbed two, and Blue Hen Flight B snagged two. Notably, Blue Hen Flight A – the largest public schools in New Castle County – only earned one state title.\n\nAmong individual schools, Salesianum earned the most championships with four. Padua, Tatnall and Tower Hill each won three, while Smyrna, Ursuline, Milford, Caravel and Caesar Rodney each won two. In all, 19 different schools claimed at least one DIAA title.\n\nSmyrna won its second consecutive Division I football championship, and will tote a 22-game winning streak into next season.\n\nIn Division I boys cross country, Sallies had a seven-year winning streak snapped by Charter of Wilmington last year, but recovered to win this season. The Sals have won 36 of the 42 D-I titles in that sport, and have never lost two years in a row.\n\nIn Division II cross country, Tatnall swept to its 13th consecutive girls title, and eighth straight boys crown. Padua ran to its fourth straight D-I girls cross country win.\n\nSalesianum claimed its seventh straight boys soccer title, its fourth in Division I since the competition was split in 2013. Overall, Sallies soccer has won 12 crowns in the last 13 years.\n\nPHILLIES: Schmidt's comments about Herrera off base\n\nEAGLES:QB Foles taking to mentoring role\n\nTower Hill became the third different school in four years to win in Division II boys soccer. The Hillers’ last overall soccer championship came in 1988.\n\nA couple of Henlopen South schools struck mighty blows during the fall. Woodbridge went 13-0 and won its first football title, in Division II. And Delmar field hockey earned the school’s first state championship by a girls team in any sport.\n\nDelaware Military Academy took its second straight title in girls volleyball. And Newark Charter won its first state championship in Unified Flag Football, in the first year the fledging sport conducted a state tournament.\n\nMoving on to the winter sports, Smyrna swept to the school’s first title in boys basketball. Ursuline fielded perhaps one of its best teams ever and won its third straight girls basketball crown, 17th overall.\n\nSalesianum climbed back to the top in boys swimming, after Charter of Wilmington broke its 10-year title run the previous season. The Sals have won 26 of the 32 boys swimming titles in DIAA history.\n\nUrsuline won its second straight team title in girls swimming.\n\nHoward became the fifth different champion in five years in boys indoor track, as the Wildcats ran to their first title since 1989. Padua tightened its grip in girls indoor track with its fifth straight championship.\n\nSussex Central ended Smyrna’s four-year reign atop Division I dual meet wrestling, earning the Golden Knights’ first title since 2008 in the final year of coach Phil Shultie’s 41-year career. Milford made it four titles in a row in Division II wrestling.\n\nThen came the spring, the busiest of the three seasons with 14 different titles on the line. One of those crowns remained firmly entrenched, as Cape Henlopen rolled to its ninth consecutive girls lacrosse championship and stretched its in-state winning streak to 111 games.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise came last Saturday, when Middletown shocked Padua 1-0 in the Division I girls soccer final for the Cavaliers’ first championship in any girls sport. It ended the Pandas’ five-year reign, and was the only title by a Flight A team in this school year.\n\nCaravel has found Division II girls soccer to its liking, taking its fourth straight title since the sport was split.\n\nSalesianum continued its dominance in boys lacrosse, winning its third consecutive crown and sixth in the last seven years.\n\nTower Hill swept all five brackets on the way to the boys tennis title, and Caesar Rodney repeated as girls tennis champs. The Hillers also rallied during the final round to win back-to-back team titles in golf.\n\nMilford won its first softball title since 2009, and Caravel earned its fifth championship in baseball.\n\nIn outdoor track, Padua won its fourth straight D-I girls title, Dover won in Division I boys, and St. Georges (boys) and Tatnall (girls) repeated in Division II. Caesar Rodney claimed its first Unified track championship.\n\nSpeaking of track, between cross country, indoor and outdoor, Tatnall has won 34 state championships (20 girls, 14 boys) over the last 10 seasons. Padua has racked up 19 girls titles in that same timeframe.\n\nContact Brad Myers at bmyers@delawareonline.com.

I was there to see Crosby, Stills & Nash. Don’t rock bands always begin late? And after dark? But almost on the minute, the lights went down and they began.\n\nStephen Stills is now 69 — David Crosby and Graham Nash, both 72. It has been 45 years since they performed at Woodstock. I suppose there’s a point when even iconic rockers become sensible.\n\nTo me, they are among the most iconic — both because of their music and the role they played in the lives of those a certain age. I was in high school and college between 1966 and 1974, and Crosby, Stills & Nash were a key part of that soundtrack. Yet they were more than just a super-group — they touched something deeper.\n\nPeople talk about “their” era bands, but the truth is, there were categories. The Beatles were the first rock musicians I was aware of, and they matched well the early teen stage of life — their songs were as giddy as the feelings you had when you went to your first dances and noticed the other gender. A lot of the British Invasion was the same — even the slightly darker Stones. It was mostly about fun.\n\nAnd then came the 1960s — by which I mean the real 1960s — the more political ’60s that really began in 1968 and went through the early ’70s. Music became edgier. Some pop groups such as The Beatles evolved and became edgier with it. But to me, there was something about Crosby, Stills & Nash — and Neil Young when he joined them — that made the group even more emblematic of that time.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nPerhaps it began with them playing at Woodstock — and then doing the rendition of the Joni Mitchell song about it. “By the time we got to Woodstock,” they sang, and whether you were there or not, that was an important word, “we.”\n\nEven if you were an upper-middle-class kid — I was — who worried about college and sports and dances — you wanted to be part of that “we,” that culture. It was a culture older folks didn’t understand. They certainly didn’t understand the music. They distrusted it. Which was fine.\n\nBecause that made it ours.\n\nEven more than a band such as The Beatles, Crosby, Stills & Nash were at the heart of “our” music, perhaps because they were neither too pop, nor too edgy. But it was more than that. They had something intangible that you couldn’t explain — you just felt it. I did. And still do.\n\nMaybe it’s that some of their stuff was political, such as “Wooden Ships” about nuclear war with its famous line: “Can you tell me, please, who won?” And there was “Ohio” about Kent State, but just as often they wrote about love and longing, and yet …\n\n… Lyrics alone are never enough to make a band connect with a generation. Only the sound can. And theirs did in a way that, more so than with many other artists, just, well, felt like our era.\n\nJust about everyone owned Crosby, Stills & Nash albums and danced to them at parties. I wasn’t a musical expert but you didn’t have to be one to feel that their instrumentation and harmonizing in songs such as “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” rose to the level of art. And yet still had the kind of beat that made the charts.\n\nThat’s what I was thinking as I watched them perform at PPAC last week. It’s why, even though I rarely go to concerts, I wanted to see Crosby, Stills & Nash.\n\nPerhaps others there felt the same because most faces were from that era. The theater was virtually filled with 1960s types.\n\nBut as I looked around, something hit me. I realized many of us now look like the older corporate folks who didn’t “get” Crosby, Stills & Nash during their ’60s and ’70s prime. Except now it’s 45 years later. And here were thousands of older, corporate types standing in the aisles and dancing.\n\nBut that hardly means the band now has universal appeal. It’s just that the age group who understands them has flipped.\n\nNow it’s younger folks who don’t “get” them. At least I didn’t see many in the theater. I’m sure some do appreciate the group, just as some older folks did in the 1960s.\n\nBut most don’t.\n\nWhich is fine with me.\n\nBecause that’s what partly makes Crosby, Stills & Nash what they are — they reflected our experience. And remain our soundtrack. Others can’t understand that. And them.\n\nBut we do.\n\nFollow Mark on Facebook.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/02/05/eagles-don-henley-says-hotel-california-bands-creative-peak/4622774002/", "title": "Eagles' Don Henley says \"Hotel California\" was band's 'creative peak'", "text": "Bob Doerschuk\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nIt’s been nearly 50 years since four gifted young musicians decided to start a group that they called the Eagles. Much has changed since then, in music and across life’s wider landscape. The band’s lineup evolved, lawsuits ensued. For a while, they called it quits.\n\nYet here they are, on a concert trek that crisscrosses the United States and will even land at London's Wembley Stadium. Kicking off Feb. 7 in Atlanta, the tour marks a first for the iconic rock band, who'll play the epic Hotel California album top to bottom, followed by a two-hour set of their greatest hits. At each show, a full orchestra and, on the final tune, a vocal choir will enhance the music, though it’s the songs, not their adornment, that makes the Hotel California tour essential.\n\n\"Hotel California\" is among the best-selling albums of all time and won the Grammy for record of the year in 1977.\n\n“It’s a big undertaking,” admitted founding member Don Henley, 72. “And there’s a theatrical element. While people are coming into the auditorium, we’re singing ‘Welcome,’ as in ‘Welcome to the Hotel California,’ in a spooky, drawn-out fashion. We have thunder and the sound of wind bouncing around all over the auditorium. Lights are flashing, as if they were lightning bolts.\n\n“Then just as things come to a peak, a tall fellow, dressed in a black, antique European bellman’s costume and a cape, walks across the stage, holding the vinyl album 'Hotel California.' He takes it out of the jacket, blows off the dust – a symbolic gesture – places it carefully on the turntable and puts the stylus down. There’s even a hissing sound, like a needle on vinyl. Then we start the song and the curtain rises.”\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThat “symbolic gesture” nods toward the once fundamental importance of the album.\n\n“The format is good for music because it gives artists a chance to write and record songs that are not necessarily hit singles,” Henley explained. “Albums by their nature are uneven. Some of the songs are catchy and radio-friendly, and some might be more thoughtful or topically oriented. I mourn the loss of that opportunity to artists, when record companies and radio just wants hits.”\n\nThe Hotel California tour has an additional resonance, with Deacon Frey, 26, taking the place of his father Glenn, who died in 2016.\n\n“I’m the one who said ‘Let’s get Deacon into the band,’” Henley said. “That was a surprise to everybody, including him, his mother and his family. But I knew he could do it. It’s a little surreal for me when I’m on the drums and he’s directly in front of me; his hair and his profile are eerily reminiscent of his father’s. But it’s also been a healing thing for him and for those of us in the band who worked with his dad. Actually, he remembers our parts from the records so well that if we’ve let something slip over the years, he’ll say, ‘That’s not what you were doing on the record.’ And we go, ‘Oh, yeah. You’re right!’”\n\nThe Eagles have won six Grammy Awards and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nAsked to reflect on why \"Hotel California\" stands out among the Eagles' classic catalog, Henley answered, “Every band has its creative peak. I think that was ours. We’d become very adept in the studio. We knew a lot about production. We knew more about songwriting. We had the musicianship. We were willing to make some changes and take some risks and try to do something different from anything we’d done before.\n\n\"And you know, the astronauts in the Space Station get a wakeup call every day. A lot of times the folks in the (NASA) control center would play ‘Hotel California.’”\n\nHenley thought for a second, laughed and confessed, “Personally, I don’t know if I would want to start the day with that.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/12/10/central-jerseys-20-most-famous-celebrities/903644001/", "title": "Central Jersey's 20 most famous celebrities", "text": "What is a celebrity? Someone who frequently appears in the tabloids and has millions of Twitter followers?\n\nPerhaps celebrities live up to that name because they are celebrated, meaning they are followed by journalists and pundits, they appear frequently on television, and they have fans.

Are there any original KISS members still in the band? Why does the Cheap Trick show have that name? And when in the world are the country shows?\n\nThose questions, and more, are answered in this list of need-to-know things for music fans heading to Des Moines’ east side for a show.\n\nThe young … and the old\n\nWho’s the youngest artist headlining this year’s Grandstand music? The 22-year-old pop star Meghan Trainor. The oldest? It’s Steven Tyler, who’s 68. In 1993, when Meghan Trainor was born, charting songs included Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You” and Garth Brooks’ “Ain’t Goin Down (Till The Sun Comes Up).” A smash hit in Tyler’s birth year of 1948? “Nature Boy” by Nat King Cole.\n\nGuide to this year's Iowa State Fair Grandstand acts\n\nWhat’s a 'Rock Hall Three For All?'\n\nIt’s the tour package name for the Heart, Joan Jett and The Blackhearts and Cheap Trick show hitting the fair Aug. 16. All three acts were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the last half-decade. But … they’re not the lone Rock Hall acts playing the Grandstand. The “Detroit Rock” City outfit KISS, performing Aug. 19, was inducted in 2014 and Steven Tyler was inducted as a member of Aerosmith in 2001.\n\nGive us some 'Sweet Emotion'\n\nSpeaking of Aerosmith ... will Steve Tyler play any songs from the iconic band's catalog at his Aug. 20 fair appearance? Probably. Tyler has been performing a heavy dose of classic Aerosmith tunes while performing solo this year. An article published by Rolling Stone in May said he performed tracks like “Sweet Emotion,” “Dream On” and “Walk This Way” during a New York City performance earlier this year.\n\nHow many original members of KISS are actually still in KISS?\n\nTwo. Bassists and vocalist Gene Simmons and guitarist Paul Stanley. You wanted the best? Well … you’re getting half of the (original) best. KISS comes to Des Moines as part of the “Freedom to Rock” tour.\n\nAlready in his 'greatest' phase\n\nPop hit machine Jason Derulo hits the Grandstand stage Aug. 14, less than a month after the singer dropped his “platinum hits” collection record. While still relatively young in comparison to others performing at the fair, Derulo has rolled out radio-hyped hit after hit since his self-titled debut dropped in 2010. The “platinum hits” record features tracks like “Ridin’ Solo” and “Want to Want Me,” as well as a new single, “Kiss the Sky.”\n\nUpdated and now on Android: Fair Food Finder and event calendar\n\nWho else has new music?\n\nHere’s a chance to update your Spotify playlists because a number of artists coming to the fair hit the Grandstand stage in support of new tunes. Meghan Trainor dropped her anticipated sophomore LP, “Thank You,” in May. Likewise, Dierks Bentley’s latest studio effort, titled “Black,” hit stores in May. Also, Tyler released his long-awaited solo record, “We’re All Somebody from Somewhere” in July.\n\nGimme some country\n\nNow, now. It wouldn’t be the Iowa State Fair Grandstand without a bit of country music. You can catch a full-on country show on three occasions: Brett Eldredge Aug. 13, Bentley Aug. 15 and Lady Antebellum Aug. 21. There may even be a bit of country during Tyler’s set; the singer’s new solo effort has a bit of a country taste. And, if three nights of the genre aren’t enough, stay glued to the free stages for free country acts throughout the entire fair.\n\nA guide to free music at the Iowa State Fair\n\nWhat’s it going to cost me?\n\nTickets range from as cheap as $30-$45 to see the Newsboys Aug. 11 to higher prices like $50-$85 to see KISS or $45-$60 to see Meghan Trainor. Shows in the middle of those include $35-$47 to see Jason Derulo or $32-$52 to see the “Rock Hall Three for All” bill. Adopting the model used when Garth Brooks visited Wells Fargo Arena earlier this year, every seat at the Bentley show costs the same: $57.

I’d been working for years before that, you know? It was nice having big crowds and all.” Betts pauses for a moment, then adds, “It sure was a lot of fun.”\n\nThe Allman Brothers were one of the biggest, best and hardest partying bands in America in 1973 when a 16-year-old Cameron Crowe joined them on tour that summer to write a Rolling Stone cover story. Crowe would later emerge as a top Hollywood filmmaker and following his blockbuster “Jerry Maguire” made the semi-autobiographical “Almost Famous,” which celebrates its 20th anniversary on Sept. 22. Largely based on Crowe’s experiences on the road with the Allman Brothers – as well as other bands he interviewed on tour during that period, including Led Zeppelin and The Eagles – the film tells the fun, often poignant tale of a young journalist trying to complete a profile of the fictitious rock band Stillwater for Rolling Stone.\n\n“Almost Famous” earned Crowe an Academy Award for his original screenplay and remains a beloved cult classic. While Kate Hudson and Frances McDormand each earned Oscar nominations for best supporting actress, the film’s top-billed star is Billy Crudup, who plays Russell Hammond, the long-haired, mustachioed guitarist for Stillwater. Crudup’s resemblance to Betts is unmistakable. “Crudup’s look, and much more, is a tribute to Dickey,” Crowe told Rolling Stone in 2017. “Dickey seemed like a quiet guy with a huge amount of soul, possible danger and playful recklessness behind his eyes. He was a huge presence.”\n\nThat time Cameron Crowe went on the road with the Allman Brothers\n\nBy late 1972, Betts had emerged as the Allman Brothers’ leader following the premature deaths of Gregg Allman’s older sibling Duane Allman and Berry Oakley, both killed in eerily similar motorcycle accidents about a year apart. After having largely completed their new album “Brothers and Sisters,” the Allman Brothers returned to the road in early ’73 with a new lineup and new fans, having graduated from playing clubs and theaters to sports arenas and stadiums.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe album spent five weeks at No. 1 and produced the chart-topping single “Ramblin’ Man,” written and sung by Betts.\n\nAt the height of their popularity, the Allman Brothers Band was approached about having Crowe join them on the road to write a profile. Problem was, the Allman Brothers weren’t on speaking terms with Rolling Stone after disagreements over a piece published a few weeks after Duane Allman’s death in ’71.\n\n“We had some bad experiences with Rolling Stone,” Betts, 76, says. “So the band was really gun shy about having anyone come on the road with us.\n\nBetts, who had been interviewed by Crowe previously, vouched for him. “And it turned out, he did a good article on us.”\n\nGregg Allman's best quotes: On fame, addiction and living a colorful life\n\nAlmost real? 'Almost Famous' hits theaters\n\nFlash forward to 2000, after Betts' bitter, highly publicized split with the Allman Brothers Band. He rarely goes to movies, but his wife Donna reads about one she thinks they might enjoy, and so they go and see “Almost Famous.” During the opening credits, the camera offers a glimpse of an Allman Brothers Band ticket stub from a show held in Crowe’s hometown of San Diego at the Sports Arena on Aug. 5, 1972. But, it’s not until 20 minutes later that Betts really takes notice: When Billy Crudup walks onscreen as Russell Hammond, the lead guitarist of the band Stillwater and the rock star who becomes closest with William Miller (played by Patrick Fugit), the rock writer based on a teenage Crowe.\n\n“I was pretty shocked, really, it was like watching myself,” Betts says. “It was pretty cool. Billy told me he based the character on me. ... I was pretty flattered.”\n\nThe Allman Brothers’ connections to Stillwater continue throughout the film. Red Dog (Zack Ward), a roadie with long red hair and matching beard, is clearly based on original Allman Brothers Band roadie Joseph “The Legendary Red Dog” Campbell, who died in 2011.\n\nThere’s a poster of Stillwater on William’s wall seemingly modeled on the “At Fillmore East” album cover and later we hear the Allman Brothers’ explosive live version of “One Way Out” followed by a bus scene with Russell playing slide guitar, something Betts recalls doing on the ’73 tour after taking over lead and slide guitar duties following Duane's death.\n\n'Say Anything' sequel?Director Cameron Crowe wishes he made 'two or three more movies'\n\nWhen Crowe’s character William attempts to interview Russell at the various hotels, he keeps getting met by “Do Not Disturb” signs on the door. “ ‘Do not disturb. Don’t ring the phone. Don’t knock on the door.’ I had about seven or eight signs on there,\" Betts remembers. \"Because I was sick of being up all night and by the time I got to sleep, the damn maid would be banging on the door. So I put those signs up. That was funny.”\n\nNot everything about “Almost Famous” rings true for Betts, though. For instance, Kate Hudson plays groupie Penny Lane, who has a relationship with Russell before he trades her to the band Humble Pie for $50 and a case of beer during a game of poker. “Yeah, they kind of overdid the groupies. We never experienced anything like (the beer trade),\" he says, but the relationships were true to life. \"You’d have a relationship and even though it didn’t last very long – there were girls who were a lot of fun, of course – it would keep you going.”\n\nOne of the most memorable scenes in “Almost Famous” takes place at a house party thrown by teenagers in Topeka, Kansas. Russell attends with just William and has a great time with his fans, who give him acid. Russell then climbs to the roof of the house and screams “I’m a golden god,” before jumping into the pool below. “That might have been somebody else, one of the other bands, the Eagles or Led Zeppelin,” Betts says. “I never did anything like that.\n\n\"I was bad about going home with people, though. And the road manager would be more worried about that. But I’d always be there for the bus the next morning or the next day.”\n\nIn the movie, Rolling Stone’s editors are thrilled with William’s profile of Stillwater but when the magazine’s fact checker calls the band, Russell tells her 90% of it has been fabricated and the magazine refuses to run the piece. (Later, Russell verifies the facts and they run it as a cover story.) What actually occurred with the Allman Brothers cover story, though, is that Crowe nearly had his assignment ruined after Gregg Allman confiscated his interview tapes upon fearing he had revealed too much, or perhaps being worried that Crowe was an undercover cop.\n\n“I said, ‘Well, I’ll get ’em for you.’ And I went down and talked Gregg out of them and got his tapes back for him. I took to Cameron Crowe, I liked him. He was a young kid, you know, trying to make a big break for himself.”\n\nWhat Dickey Betts loves most about music\n\nOne of the most touching scenes in “Almost Famous” occurs at the end, when Russell is in William’s bedroom and the young journalist gets out his tape recorder and asks Russell, “What do you love about music?” Betts, who retired a couple of years ago following a mild stroke that affected his right hand, is asked the same question.\n\n“I like the crowds mainly, and what the music did for them,” he says. “They got more out of the music than I did. ... I just really get a kick out of the audience and how they could just kind of drift away to another world in a concert.”\n\nNew in streaming:This essential CREEM documentary gets to the rock magazine's irreverent, outrageous heart\n\nDickey Betts and Gregg Allman were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame together along with the rest of the surviving Allman Brothers Band members in 1995 before going their separate ways in 2000. Today, of the founding six-man Allman Brothers Band lineup, only Betts and drummer Jaimoe are still alive.\n\nOf course, Allman Brothers fans have all the albums to return to, but it’s also nice to know the band’s spirit lives on in Crowe’s smart, heartwarming film.\n\n“It was a pretty accurate movie,” Betts says. “It was entertaining, too. It was just well done all the way around. And it was probably the closest to what the road is like more than any rock movie that I have seen. It was really close.”\n\nWade Tatangelo wrote the liner notes for the Dickey Betts Band’s 2019 CD/DVD “Ramblin’ Man Live at the St. George Theatre.”\n\n10 albums you need to hear this month:Katy Perry, Deep Purple and Glass Animals", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/local/2019/03/24/dickey-betts-on-allman-brothers-50th-anniversary-and-new-allman-betts-band/5614097007/", "title": "Dickey Betts on Allman Brothers' 50th anniversary and new Allman ...", "text": "Wade Tatangelo\n\nwade.tatangelo@heraldtribune.com\n\nIt’s a beautiful March afternoon and Dickey Betts — longtime lead guitarist, songwriter and singer in the Allman Brothers Band — enjoys a cup of coffee at home on Little Sarasota Bay while discussing the legendary group he co-founded 50 years ago.\n\nStories from the past are generously shared but the one topic he really sounds excited about involves a new band that will soon hit the road with the those iconic ABB initials.\n\nTo coincide with the milestone anniversary, the Allman Betts Band featuring second-generation standouts Devon Allman, Dickey's son Duane Betts and Berry Duane Oakley will launch a worldwide tour Wednesday. Their debut LP \"Down to the River\" will be released in the summer.\n\n\"It's good to see those guys together,\" Betts says. \"I suggested they get together years ago but they wanted to do individual things and I think they sound wonderful together. Berry Oakley Jr. is fantastic with them. It's important to have strong partners and I think they're going to do very well.\"\n\nThere's also the June release of the new live CD/DVD \"Rambling Man: The Dickey Betts Band Live at the St George Theater\" featuring Dickey and son Duane performing Betts classics like the title track, \"Blue Sky\" and \"Jessica.\" Devon Allman makes a guest appearance, too, to sing his dad Gregg Allman's song \"Midnight Rider.\"\n\nBetts, who turned 75 in December, says he's feeling OK today. It's been an eventful past year, to say the least. He started touring again last spring with his Dickey Betts Band. Then, an accident occurred here in September that required brain surgery.\n\n\"Two weeks before I went on the road I had a stroke. It was a mild stroke, thank God, but it did impair my right hand some,\" Betts says. \"I went and did those shows and then about halfway through those I was washing my Labrador and she yanked me into the steps trying to get back in the house. I had to have brain surgery so I had to cancel my remaining dates. I don't know if I'm even going to go back out this year. It's not very exciting but it's the truth.\"\n\nLater, though, Betts says, \"I don't count my band completely out.\"\n\nAnyone familiar with the man's life and career knows better than to ever count out Dickey Betts.\n\nMARCH 26, 1969\n\nDuane and sibling Gregg Allman grew up in Daytona while the Betts family has ties to Sarasota-Bradenton dating back to about the time of the Civil War.\n\nAfter years of playing in various bands in many of the same Florida clubs, the Allman Brothers Band came together in Jacksonville with guitarists Duane Allman and Dickey Betts jamming with bassist Berry Oakley and drummers Jai Johanny Johanson (later known as Jaimoe) and Butch Trucks.\n\nBetts remembers how he and the rest of the musicians pleaded with Duane to get Gregg, who was in California at the time, in their new band.\n\n“Yeah, Duane and his brother were having an argument and Duane didn’t want Gregg,” Betts recalls. “We had five of us, and Duane was singing and there was me singing and Berry Oakley singing but we were guitar players; we weren’t really singers. We knew Gregg and we kept trying to get Duane to call him.\n\n“We finally talked Duane into calling Gregg one night and when he came down I think we were in the middle of ‘Don’t Want You No More,’ the instrumental version we did of the Spencer Davis Group song. Gregg walked in on that and he was saying, ‘God, what a band!’ He was just really blown away, which made us all proud. We were real glad to see Gregg.”\n\nGregg Allman sang the band’s arrangement of “Trouble No More,” pretty much exactly as they would on record and then in concert for decades, on March 26, 1969, the birth date of the Allman Brothers Band.\n\n'DREAMS'\n\nFollowing the release of their landmark 1971 live album \"At Fillmore East,\" lead guitarist Duane Allman and then bassist Oakley died in separate motorcycle accidents. The Allman Brothers' ’73 LP \"Brothers and Sisters\" featured the No. 1 hit \"Ramblin'\" Man\" and propelled the band to superstardom but then they split several years later. The Allman Brothers Band reformed in ’78 and then broke up again in ’82.\n\nAfter spending the better part of the 1980s living in the Sarasota area while relegated to playing clubs and bars with their respective solo groups, Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts did it: They resurrected The Allman Brothers Band — again.\n\nThe bestselling 1989 \"Dreams\" box set and subsequent albums of new material starting with \"Seven Turns\" put the Allman Brothers back on top.\n\nBy the early 1990s, they were headlining 10,000- and 20,000-capacity venues across the country.\n\nOlder songs played regularly on classic rock radio while new singles including “Good Clean Fun,” \"End of the Line\" and \"No One to Run With\" were heard on mainstream rock stations with their music videos appearing on MTV. In ’95, the Allman Brothers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\"We had some real tragedies losing Duane and losing Berry Oakley and we had to keep the band together, had to keep it effective, and viable through all that period,\" Betts says. \"We took off the (1980s) and Gregg and I put our little bands together and played clubs. After we got back together a lot of writers from Rolling Stone and stuff were calling us dinosaurs and making fun of bands like us and wondering if we could still play and we were determined. It gave us more drive and we showed we weren't done yet. We made some of our best records and I think that helped put us in the Hall of Fame.\"\n\nThe Allman Brothers’ summer tours of the era were family affairs with Betts initiating a tradition of bringing their sons on stage.\n\nBerry Duane Oakley, who's slightly older than Devon Allman and a few years older than Duane Betts, made his debut with the Allman Brothers Band on Aug. 11, 1989, at Shoreline Amphitheater near San Francisco.\n\n\"I was only 17 at the time and the only kid without a dad and Dickey and (his wife) Donna brought me on the road,\" Oakley says from his home in Venice. \"There, at that particular show, Dickey goes, 'By the way, you're sitting in with us.' He took me backstage and showed me the chords to 'Southbound.' I had my bass for jamming at the hotel but had no idea I'd be sitting in. I think my mom still has the press clipping.\"\n\nA few years later, Duane Betts' teen peers watched him on MTV when he joined the Allman Brothers Band during their triumphant performance at Woodstock ’94. Dickey would continue to encourage Duane the rest of his career, which includes the release last year of his acclaimed debut solo EP \"Sketches of American Music.\"\n\n\"He’s always just told me to 'keep playing guitar,'\" Duane says of his famous father, who raised him in Sarasota. “'Keep playing that guitar and you’ll be OK.' He was always reassuring to my trepidation about how it will all work out in the end, and everything has really turned out the way I dreamed.\"\n\nAt one Allman Brothers show in the 1990s, Betts crouches behind his stack of Marshall amplifiers during a drum solo. He spots Devon Allman watching from the side of the stage and motions over to him.\n\nDevon asks if can get him anything. Betts points to the cheering crowd and tells Devon to look out there.\n\n“Someday that’s going to be you and Duane’s crowd,” Betts says.\n\nIt's a fond memory of Devon's.\n\n\"At the time I was in my early 20s and really just trying to scratch and claw my way into a career and into a sense of comfortability with the genre that I would land in,\" says Devon, whose latest solo album \"Ride or Die\" debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Blues Albums chart. \"I was focused as a musician but I didn't have much focus on the type of music I wanted to play so that hit me really hard but I kind of let it drop away because I had so much work to do to become someone who could make records and tour the world. Those words that Dickey had said to me came back around and reverberated stronger when I started touring with Duane. Dickey was really sweet and he was kind of telling the future there.\"\n\nALLMAN BETTS BAND\n\nThe Allman Betts Band — featuring Devon Allman and Duane Betts on lead guitars and vocals with Berry Oakley Jr. on bass — will kick off its inaugural world tour at The Brooklyn Bowl in New York City on Wednesday. The shows will feature new music from the upcoming debut album “Down to the River,” recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, as well as classic Allman Brothers songs in honor of the band’s 50th anniversary.\n\n\"When my dad passed and, at the same time Dickey had retired, Duane and I came together and just realized it would be weird if we didn't play a few of their songs,\" Devon Allman says from his St. Louis area home. \"It's amazing to see grown men burst into tears after hearing the opening of 'Blue Sky' or 'Midnight Rider.'\n\n\"That music is going to live on and it’s humbling, and we're as serious as we can be to do our part to put our music into that same well. We’re comfortable and honored to play our fathers' music and keep it alive but we must also stay vital and stay real to ourselves. It's really about striking that balance.\"\n\nIt's a special bond shared by Devon, Duane and Berry, who have known each other since meeting as kids 30 years ago on the road with the Allman Brothers Band.\n\n\"There's a closeness there due to the legacies, for sure,\" Devon says. \"We can totally understand each other because we have famous fathers, fathers who were musicians who got famous together for the right reasons: because they did really, really great work. And we know what that body of work means to the fans.\"\n\nAFTER THE ALLMAN BROS.\n\nIn 2000, Betts left the Allman Brothers Band in a much-publicized split after reportedly being told by fax to \"get clean.\" The Allman Brothers continued touring for another 14 years but only released one more studio album. Betts also released another studio album of new material and toured with his Great Southern group, which would feature his son Duane sharing lead guitar duties with him. Dickey Betts decided to retire in 2014 following a hometown charity show here at Robarts Arena that took place shortly after the Allman Brothers Band's final gig.\n\nIn January 2017, Butch Trucks died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. A few months later, Gregg Allman died due to complications from liver cancer.\n\nGregg Allman kept his health problems private but Dickey Betts had been informed and recalls calling him quite a bit during those last months when Allman was frequently in and out of the hospital. Betts has praised Gregg as the best white blues singer and as having a \"golden voice.\" When they spoke, though, Betts couldn't help but be saddened to hear that great voice reduced to a whisper.\n\n\"I was trying to make him feel good and tell him how much he was loved and respected,\" Betts says. \"I would just call and try to make his day a little better.\"\n\nDickey and Duane Betts were with Devon Allman, Berry Oakley Jr. and many more members of the extended Allman Brothers family at Gregg Allman's funeral in Macon, Georgia, where the Allman Brothers were based in the early 1970s. Former President Jimmy Carter, whose election the Allman Brothers Band boosted, attended the private ceremony along with Allman's ex-wife Cher. Gregg Allman was buried near his brother, Duane, and bandmate Berry Oakley.\n\nBetts told a reporter from Rolling Stone he was retired for a story that ran in November of 2017 but soon changed his mind. On his birthday, Dec., 12, 2017, after about a four-year hiatus from performing, Dickey Betts announced he would play select dates in 2018.\n\n“Everywhere I go fans keep saying they want me to get out and play again,” Betts said at the time. “I think the time is right.”\n\nDICKEY BETTS BAND\n\nThe new Dickey Betts Band made its debut last May at White Buffalo Saloon a few miles from Betts' home and in July played the historic St. George Theatre in New York City with the cameras rolling for the upcoming CD/DVD \"Ramblin' Man.\"\n\n\"That was a really special night with a really cool kind of vibe,\" Duane Betts says. \"We were starting to really get into a groove and there was a great exchange between the crowd and the band and Dad. I'm real proud of my dad and the band. He hadn't been playing for four years and so it was a challenge to get everyone in shape but we hit our stride there by the end of the run.\"\n\nAnd then there was the accident at the Betts home, followed by a huge outpouring of support from fans all over the world as Dickey went into surgery.\n\n\"I wasn't worried about it too much; everybody else was, of course, but I was too loaded on Propofol there for about four or five days,\" Betts says with a chuckle. \"From that stroke, I was taking blood thinners so they had to put me in an induced coma. I was just in a dream world, thought I was in a cowboy movie, and when I came to I was just glad to be awake and see somebody.\n\n\"I didn't know that I had so many friends that were praying for me and helping me,\" Betts continues, now somber. \"It made me feel good to still be alive. The fall was more serious than I had realized. It was pretty damn serious because they couldn't stop the bleeding because of the blood thinners I was on after the stroke.\"\n\nDuring a New Year’s Eve show by the Devon Allman Project featuring Duane Betts with special guest Berry Oakley Jr. at the Grand Opera House in in Macon, Dickey Betts sat right in front of Oakley's amplifier and took it all in. Then, after the clock struck midnight, Betts stepped onto the stage to play guitar on his revered instrumental \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed.\" \"It's just such an honor and a privilege to be on stage with him,\" says Devon, who makes a memorable appearance on the upcoming Dickey Betts Band CD/DVD.\n\n\"You know, Dickey was the first one to invite me onto the Allman Brothers' stage,\" Devon says. \"He heard me sing backstage and was like, 'Man, I didn't know you had pipes like that.' He was always very supportive and, yeah, the first one to invite me on the Allman Brothers stage, even before my dad, which was pretty mind-blowing.\n\n\"It's an amazing thing to look over and see Dickey and to make music alongside one of your heroes. I certainly have heroes within the Allman Brothers but then heroes in many, many other bands. I've been lucky to play with Billy Gibbons and Charlie Daniels and Lynyrd Skynyrd and Les Paul but Dickey Betts, obviously, is the closest to home, so that's an amazing feeling.\"\n\nWhile Dickey picks up the guitar occasionally, his only appearance on a public stage since the accident has been the one on New Year's Eve. He has no concert dates booked for 2019.\n\n\"I want to do it because I miss what I call my friends, my fans, but on the other hand, I don't think I put on the show I used to,\" Betts says. \"I'm told no one expects you to do what you did when you were younger but I don't know. I guess there’s always a chance I’ll go back out.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/04/05/kiss-sells-band-catalog-pophouse-entertainment/73218796007/", "title": "KISS sells catalog, band likeness to Pophouse entertainment company", "text": "Some things aren't \"Forever\" for legendary rock band KISS after the quartet announced they sold their catalog, brand name and IP.\n\nThe 2014 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees did the deal with Swedish company Pophouse Entertainment Group.

Panahi believes if the Taliban caught her with stacks of passports belonging to young, educated women planning to flee, she could have been killed.\n\nBut she also felt a huge sense of responsibility to the students, and their futures.\n\n“If I don't take this chance, if I don't do this right now, what if we (are) all stuck here?” she thought. “That's even more dangerous, to stay here.”\n\nThe trip was successful. She hid the passports in her basement when she got home and later returned them to each student.\n\nPanahi’s efforts allowed 148 women to begin what would become a days-long, harrowing escape from Afghanistan. They'd go from the gates of the Kabul airport to Fort McCoy in Wisconsin, leaving their families behind.\n\nThe women since have been placed at universities around the U.S. Most have full-ride scholarships.\n\nPanahi and eight other women are living with host families near the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, forging close bonds with one another as they confront the trauma of their journey and adjust to the shock of American culture.\n\nAs security conditions worsen in Afghanistan, the students are at once anxious for their families and driven to succeed in the U.S. They know how a degree and a paycheck could help everyone at home.\n\nStill, a level of financial unease remains. UWM has said it can't afford to offer the women full rides. Nearby Eastbrook Church is funding the students' first semesters, but future scholarships are uncertain. Two English-language instructors who worked to bring the women to Milwaukee are crowdfunding their tuition.\n\nThe women remain resilient and focused on achieving the dreams they almost lost.\n\n\"The women in Afghanistan, we struggle a lot,\" Panahi said. \"So we are not going to give up. We will try very hard again and again.\"\n\nMore:World-renowned Afghan women's rights activist Maryam Durani and her family begin a new life in Milwaukee\n\nMore:'Kids need kids': Program connects Afghan refugee children with Milwaukee buddies to help ease transition to life in America\n\nEvacuated students attended university designed to develop women leaders\n\nLong before the women boarded a cargo plane out of Kabul, they were fighting for their futures.\n\nPanahi’s family didn’t want her to go to school, and she’d often enroll a month after classes began, having spent the whole month trying to persuade them to let her attend another year.\n\nEven as a child, she had to pay for her own tuition, she said. Half the day, she weaved carpets to earn money, and the other half, she would go to school.\n\n“Education was the only way that I could empower myself, I could raise my voice, I could do things that I want,” Panahi said.\n\nAfter a semester at an Afghan university, and then a year away to work and earn money for her family, she was accepted at a specialized Bangladesh school called the Asian University for Women.\n\nThe school — which the evacuated students attended — is designed to develop women leaders who will return to serve their communities. Many of its students are from poor or rural backgrounds and are the first in their families to attend college.\n\nEntering airport took five days, more than 40 hours on buses\n\nWhen the Taliban took over Kabul, the Asian University for Women arranged a flight for the women to Bangladesh. But the students’ evacuation hinged on getting past the crowds and checkpoints outside the airport gates.\n\nPanahi and some other students became leaders of seven buses that aimed to take everyone inside. The group had to turn back twice, facing threats, gunfire and a bombing.\n\nOn the buses, the students were told to keep quiet, and not to use their cellphones in case the light drew attention from outside.\n\nAlthough they were traveling at night, the students didn’t sleep a minute as they peered from the windows to make sure no one got too close. They worried someone could place bombs under the buses, a common terrorism tactic in Afghanistan, Panahi said.\n\nThe suicide attack outside Abbey Gate that killed 13 U.S. service members and at least 170 Afghans occurred as the women were circling the airport on their second attempt. They were rattled but continued undeterred.\n\nThere was a chance the students would be killed if they got close to the gates, Panahi reasoned at the time. But if she stayed in Afghanistan, where women would be banned from the public sphere, she was certain her life would be over.\n\n“That is, I think, death for me: When you are not able to do anything, and you cannot pursue your education, you cannot pursue your goals and your dreams. That's exactly when you start dying,” Panahi said.\n\nDuring the second attempt, after they'd tried to enter the airport for 30 hours straight, the women were forced to turn back. A Taliban member boarded one of the buses and told the girls to leave or he would kill them. Another bus sustained gunfire.\n\nKhatera, a 20-year-old Afghan student in the UWM cohort, thought, “maybe this is the end, we will die.”\n\nShe read a prayer for dying people. But she hung onto a flicker of hope that she’d live.\n\nIt was as if someone was telling her, “You will get into the airport, and you will have a bright future,” she said.\n\nOn the third and final attempt, Panahi took her 19-year-old sister with her. She was worried that the Taliban would find out she was responsible for coordinating the evacuation and they’d retaliate against her sister.\n\nAfter 10 more hours on the buses, the group passed the airport gates. Everyone was in — except Panahi’s sister and two other women, who were stopped at a Taliban checkpoint.\n\nThis was a gut-wrenching development for Panahi.\n\nShe thought of “how hard I really worked for this group of students to save them. Now it’s (for) my sister that I can do nothing,” Panahi said.\n\nOnce inside, Panahi told an American soldier that three women were left behind. She waited for three hours as he worked to bring them into the airport.\n\nPanahi’s friends said, “Let’s go, and tell your sister to go home.” Panahi refused.\n\nFinally, the women were allowed to enter. Panahi cried with relief. “I saved everyone,” she thought.\n\nThe ordeal, which spanned five days in total, remains a traumatic memory for the women. Every night for two months after the evacuation, Panahi had nightmares that she was back on the bus.\n\nKhatera recalled the journey, and leaving her family behind, as “the hardest thing that I can ever imagine in my life.” It’s also given her nightmares.\n\nShe regrets most that she didn’t get a chance to say goodbye to her siblings in person. She thinks of the phone call she had with her brother, just before she left, and how he cried.\n\nMore:Afghan evacuees in Wisconsin process relief, uncertainty, stress and trauma. A network of helping hands eases the journey.\n\nWomen became 'family of sisters' at Fort McCoy\n\nWhen the women boarded the transport plane at last, they didn’t know where in the world they’d land. They had missed the initial flight to Bangladesh, and the U.S. military was tight-lipped about the aircraft’s final destination.\n\nOnce at Fort McCoy, the students joined more than 12,000 other Afghan evacuees who were placed there temporarily while awaiting resettlement elsewhere in the U.S.\n\nThe most difficult part, Panahi said, was seeing everyone else with their families.\n\nThe women banded together and became a “family of sisters,” she said.\n\nStuck on the base with little to do and no clear timeline for leaving, many of the women became depressed. To combat the boredom and homesickness, Khatera and some other students began providing English classes for children and their mothers.\n\nShe also helped in the sewing center, teaching women how to use the machines.\n\n“It was a tough situation,” Khatera said. “But I'm glad that I was useful for my people.”\n\nPanahi got involved with the English school, too, and began volunteering in the donations warehouse and interpreting for people at the legal clinic on base.\n\nKeeping busy, Panahi said, “was the only way that we could just keep ourselves a little bit happy.”\n\nMore:Here's what you should know about Afghan evacuees as they leave military bases like Fort McCoy and are resettled in Wisconsin, across U.S.\n\nMore:Alan Borsuk: For Afghan 'guests' in Wisconsin, remembering the past is not easy. But on their path to asylum, it's essential.\n\nEnglish instructors led effort to bring students to Milwaukee\n\nShortly after the women arrived at Fort McCoy, UWM English-language instructors Mari Chevako and Brooke Haley heard about their journey from another professor in Delaware.\n\nThey were eager to help.\n\n“I couldn't imagine being in a position to try and do something, and not do it,” said Haley, the director of the university’s English Language Academy.\n\nUWM and nine other schools, including Arizona State, Brown and Cornell universities, would agree to enroll the students.\n\nWhen UWM administrators said they couldn't offer the students full rides, Chevako turned to Eastbrook Church, where she is a member. Church leaders agreed to fund the spring and summer semesters of the intensive English program.\n\nSeveral Eastbrook families also agreed to host the women at their homes, not knowing if it would be a one- or five-year commitment, Haley said.\n\n“They have just swept the students up into their families, like they're their own kids,” Chevako said.\n\nThe students left Fort McCoy and arrived in Milwaukee just four days before Christmas. Haley and Chevako had planned a welcome celebration, but the omicron variant was surging.\n\nSo Haley cut up the big cake she’d made and dropped off pieces at each family’s home, meeting the women through masks and in the cold.\n\nHost families provide support as women confront trauma of escape\n\nNow, the eight students are finishing their first semester of the intensive English program, with goals to study medicine, economics, photography and more. Panahi, who finished her undergraduate degree in 2020, hopes to enroll in grad school.\n\nTwo sisters who initially settled in Utah with extended family will be joining the Milwaukee cohort this summer, bringing the total to 11 women.\n\nAfter years working with international students, the two instructors know the realities of culture shock. But for the Afghan women, who didn’t know they’d end up in the U.S. when they boarded the plane out of Kabul, “you multiply that culture shock exponentially,” Chevako said.\n\nKhatera, who hopes to study medicine, struggled initially with how to keep moving through her new life as she saw Afghanistan face increasingly dire hunger and security issues.\n\nShe has found key support in her host family.\n\n“After leaving my country and my family, my host family was the first people in my life that really helped me to be the Khatera that was in Afghanistan,” she said: strong, courageous, passionate.\n\nCollege graduate Panahi, who didn’t have the daily routine of attending classes, became withdrawn and sad in her first months in Milwaukee. Her 19-year-old sister is in the English-language program at UWM and living with a different host family.\n\nPanahi was nervous for her family and friends back home, and anxious that she couldn’t do much to help them. It’s still difficult to stomach: how she’s safe in the U.S. but almost everyone she’s ever known is in danger.\n\n“I wish I could help others, too, and make a better life for them, too, but I’m not in a position to help them right now. And that is kind of a deep pain for me,” Panahi said.\n\nPanahi's host family has helped her find peace, she said. She told them she wanted to go swimming and play sports, and they enrolled her in a swim class and got her a membership at the UWM gym.\n\nShe said she missed speaking her language, and her host family connected her with a group of Iranians in Milwaukee who also speak Persian.\n\nAnd in recent weeks, she started a job as an administrative coordinator at the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District.\n\nWith so much outside her control, earning money to send to her family was one choice she could make, she said. She does want to continue her education, but right now her family needs her financial support, Panahi said.\n\nPanahi holds a degree in finance and accounting and would study the same in graduate school. She also hopes to build a career in the field, while doing what she can to support Afghan women.\n\n\"I just don't want them to feel like this is the end of their life,\" she said.\n\nLife in the U.S. can be tough, because even the moments of joy remind her of the struggles back home.\n\nOnce, intrigued by nightclubs, she went out for a night of dancing. In the restroom, she listened as the American girls complained about their nails and other “tiny, tiny issues.”\n\nPanahi thought of what she'd been through, and the challenges women and girls in Afghanistan face. It was so different, and so much heavier.\n\nMore:Hmong professor didn't hold a pencil until age 8. Now she uses her talents to lift up and preserve the stories of her people.\n\nGoals to help women, ethnic minorities fuel studies\n\nFor Khatera, aspirations of helping marginalized Afghans, especially women and persecuted Hazaras, motivate her to continue her education in Milwaukee.\n\nA member of the Hazara ethnic group herself, she now hopes to become a doctor and start a foundation for the poor.\n\n“Hazaras’ pain is my pain,” she said.\n\nKhatera feels a duty to serve her community. She wants to teach them about their rights and how to stand up for themselves. She believes many in Afghanistan could harness their talents and make the country successful if they were given the chance to succeed.\n\n“The Afghan young generation just needs an opportunity,” she said.\n\nShe hopes to return to Afghanistan one day, but the current security situation makes it impossible. She also would love to bring her family to the U.S., but a number of logistical challenges prevent it right now.\n\nTuition is main worry for students\n\nOn a recent sunny weekend, the Afghan students got together to take a walk in Doctors Park, and the conversation turned to their uncertain futures, since only two of their semesters are funded.\n\nPanahi listened as one of the women joked that if she couldn’t get a scholarship to continue her education, she’d become a truck driver.\n\n“I felt very broken when I heard that,” Panahi said.\n\nPanahi sternly told the girls not to think about it, and to focus on studying.\n\nHaley and Chevako, the English-language instructors, are leading the fundraising effort to pay for tuition for the remainder of the intensive English program as well as four-year undergraduate degrees.\n\nBy September, the instructors need to raise $92,000, the cost of the 10 students' fall tuition.\n\nThe students cannot apply for federal financial aid yet because they don’t have permanent residency status. Like most Afghan evacuees, they were brought to the U.S. last August under a provision called humanitarian parole that requires them to apply for asylum within a year. The asylum system is heavily backlogged.\n\nThe students are also looking for summer jobs to earn money to send home to their families.\n\nHaley and Chevako have been heartened by the support the students have already received, from gift cards donated by fellow faculty to tuition discounts the university ended up offering.\n\nAnd when they think of the Afghan women and their difficult journeys that led them to Milwaukee, they feel hope.\n\n“I feel really inspired by their ability to keep moving forward,” Haley said.\n\nTo donate to the Afghan students' tuition fund, visit aspom.org. Anyone with leads on summer jobs for the students can email Brooke Haley at haleyb@uwm.edu.\n\nContact reporter Sophie Carson at (414) 223-5512 or scarson@gannett.com.

The Taliban, aware the forces were coming, “left a minefield in their wake in the hopes of inflicting as much harm on us as possible, long after they departed,” Jones writes in his first book, “Unbroken Bonds of Battle,\" published in June.\n\nThen a 24-year-old bomb technician for the Marines, Jones had been clearing streets and buildings for five days, as his two-man team discovered more than 30 bombs.\n\n“It blew up underneath me,” Jones says in a recent interview. “I landed on my back. The dust cloud went away… I felt my face before anything, oddly enough, and so I wasn’t sure if it was still there, as it should be.”\n\nJones lost both legs above the knee due to the explosion. He was hired as a Fox News contributor in 2019, offering opinions on veteran affairs. But his role expanded as a sought-after voice on a variety of topics, including politics and pop culture. Jones has been a substitute host of \"Fox & Friends,\" \"Fox & Friends Weekend,\" and the network's primetime programming.\n\n\"Be thankful for that and go do great things,“ Jones, 37, says. \"We celebrate it like a birthday every year.”\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nJesse Wattersis ready for Fox News 'Primetime' slot: 'I'm not nasty; I'm brutally honest'\n\nHe views Aug. 6, 2010, as his “Alive Day,” a term referring to the day when a veteran nearly dies in action but lives.\n\nJones had a modest upbringing in Dalton, Georgia. His dad was a brick and block mason; his mom cleaned houses. Jones enlisted after being dumped by his high school sweetheart, Meg Garrison. “’Listen,’” he recalls telling her at her house, “’I'm not joining the Marine Corps because of you, but you're the only reason I would stay home.’ She looked at me and smiled and said, ‘Well, have fun.’ She was pretty resolute in her decision making, and it was up to me to prove her wrong.”\n\nGarrison showed Jones that he needed to mature and learn to put others first: “I didn't understand the nuance of what being selfless meant, and the Marine Corps taught that to me.\"\n\nJones learned about Explosive Ordnance Disposal while serving in Iraq in 2007. These specialists were just the epitome of selflessness,” he says. “They're basically saying, ‘These bombs are here to kill us. If somebody has to walk down there and take them apart, let it be me,’ and I love that.”\n\nThe night before his accident, Jones lay beneath his truck on a rack, complaining of mosquito bites and hoping to sleep in before more IEDs were found. But no such luck: Jones’ good friend, Corporal Daniel Greer, woke him, requesting Jones’ help investigating a storage unit. While analyzing a flare, Jones stepped on an IED.\n\nHe noticed his legs were partially missing and went to reach for his tourniquets. But he couldn’t see or feel his left arm.\n\n“I actually was afraid I didn't have one,” Jones says. It was tucked behind his back. He tried to use his right arm, but his forearm was severed. \"The only thing holding it together was the muscle on the back, and so it was useless to me.”\n\nMarines came to retrieve Jones and Greer. As Jones didn’t see any obvious wounds on Greer, he thought he’d only been rendered unconscious. But Greer had suffered a fatal traumatic brain injury.\n\n'They don't frighten us':5 takeaways from Trump town hall with Hannity\n\nWhen Jones woke up on Aug. 8, 2010, at an Army hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, he asked a nurse “Where’s Greer?”\n\n“She looked at me, and she smiled and she said, ‘You've lost both your legs above the knee. But don't worry, hon, you're going to walk again,’” says Jones. For more than a decade Jones has found that response inspiring. \"She understood the fragility of that moment and how important it was that the first thing I hear in assessing myself is something positive,\" he says. \"If she would’ve just answered that question, ‘Daniel Greer’s three doors down (and clinically brain dead)' ... that could have set a trajectory to where I didn't want to walk again. That could have put me in a really bad place.”\n\nGreer’s wife Stacy writes about her husband in Jones’ book.\n\nJones was transferred to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. It took him about 10 months to physically recover. He learned to walk again. Doctors had “reattached muscles in new places. So that creates all this frustration.\n\n“I was never resentful that I didn't have my legs,” he continues. “The hardest part was taking what I had and getting through the frustration and the pain to use it. But I had so much to get me out of bed and make me want to do it. I had a brand new son, I had a family that loved me, and at some point, I knew I owed it to Daniel Greer to make something of it.”\n\nJones graduated from Georgetown University with a Bachelor of Arts degree. In addition to being a Fox News contributor, he also currently hosts Fox Nation Outdoors on the network’s streaming service.\n\nJones says what he most enjoys most about his job is spotlighting people without a platform.\n\n“I live in a small town (in Georgia) that has more cows than people,” Jones says. “And when I go home or I go to these towns (that) I like to hunt in or do speaking engagements in, they look at me and they may talk with the same twang I do and they go, ‘Man, thank you for saying that, because that's what I think and nobody else says it that way.'”\n\nJones also sits on the board of directors for Boot Campaign, a civilian-founded organization that provides veterans with treatment for post-traumatic stress, traumatic brain injuries, chronic pain, insomnia, and substance abuse. This weekend, he’ll be spending part of his Alive Day at a Warrior Bonfire Program event in Madison, Mississippi. The nonprofit organizes retreats for Purple Heart recipients.\n\n“I try to work on my Alive Day, because I think that's the ultimate thumb in the face to the Taliban,” says Jones. \"The work I've chosen and (am) blessed to do is to still have a voice and still have an impact and help create that spirit in others.”\n\nJones speaks on Saturday: “On Aug. 6, I'll wake up and have breakfast with those folks and fly home.”\n\nOnce home he’ll be reunited with his son, Joseph, his high school sweetheart whom he wed in 2012, and their daughter, Margo.\n\nGeraldo Rivera says'toxic relationship' with one Fox News co-host caused his exit", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/31/tuskegee-monument-sugar-water-potato-problems-news-around-states/118486586/", "title": "Tuskegee monument, sugar water: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Alabama Shakespeare Festival, which began in a high school auditorium in 1972, is undergoing a $1.6million renovation in advance of its 50th season. Located in east Montgomery, the theater is upgrading an entrance lobby and enclosing an outdoor area. It also is adding restrooms, constructing a new gift shop and making other additions. While the theater received $1.18 million in federal pandemic aid as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, spokeswoman Layne Holley said the renovations will not use that money, and officials have yet to decide how to use the funding. Indoor shows are scheduled to resume Nov. 27 with a production of “Cinderella.” Executive director Todd Schmidt said the theater has survived the pandemic and made plans for a return in part because of strong community backing. “We had to reduce our staff and our overhead,” Schmidt said. “It’s been a tough time, but luckily we’ve had great support.” Initially staged at Anniston High School, the company relocated to Montgomery and is housed in a theater constructed in 1985.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Alaska Federation of Natives has postponed its annual convention because of a rise in COVID-19 cases in the state, officials said in a statement. The convention has traditionally been the largest gathering of Alaska Natives in the state. It had been scheduled for Oct. 21-23 but is now delayed until mid-December in Anchorage, the organization said in a statement. Organizers said they will continue planning for an in-person convention at the Dena’ina Convention Center in downtown Anchorage with a virtual option. However, the statement said the board will make a decision by mid-October on whether to maintain the in-person part. Organizers encouraged Alaskans to get vaccinated and wear masks so the convention can be held. One notable celebration this year will be the observation of the 50th anniversary of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The act was the largest land settlement in the nation’s history when President Richard Nixon signed it into law Dec. 18, 1971, and settled Indigenous land claims in Alaska. “Postponing until December provides us an opportunity to gather in person on the 50th anniversary of ANCSA, but it all hinges on everyone’s willingness and ability to get vaccinated,” said Sealaska chairman and Alaska Federation of Natives co-chair Joe Nelson.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A tribe that didn’t sign a revised gambling compact with the state earlier this year has filed a lawsuit alleging that a new law is unconstitutional and left some rural tribes in the cold by excluding them from negotiations hamming out the legislation. The suit filed by the Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe on Thursday asks the court to prevent the Department of Gaming from issuing sportsbook licenses and allowing sports betting. The lawsuit said the state presented the tribe with an amended compact “as a non-negotiable, ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ proposition.” The lawmaker who sponsored the gambling legislation defended it as fair and equitable. The legislation signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey last spring expands the types of gambling allowed at tribal casinos, lets tribes and pro sports teams take bets on sport evenings, and licenses six operators to sign up players for betting on fantasy virtual games. A judge scheduled an emergency hearing for next Friday on the suit.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge has scheduled the retrial of a former state senator on bribery and fraud charges for the first week of October. Court records, first reported by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, show U.S. District Judge Judge Price Marshall on Friday scheduled the trial for Gilbert Baker, a Republican former senator and one-time state GOP chairman, to begin Oct. 4. A federal jury earlier this month acquitted Baker of conspiracy in the case in which he allegedly conspired to bribe an ex-judge who admitted to lowering a jury’s award in a negligence lawsuit in exchange for campaign contributions. The jury, however, deadlocked on charges of bribery and wire fraud against Baker, and prosecutors on Thursday filed notice of their intent to retry those counts. Baker was accused of conspiring with former state Judge Michael Maggio, who admitted to accepting campaign donations from a nursing home operator, then reducing a judgment against that company by $4.2 million. Michael Morton, the nursing home operator, has not been charged with any crimes and has denied wrongdoing. Maggio was sentenced in 2015 to 10 years in prison.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBlythe: California farmers near the Arizona border with the oldest rights to Colorado River water will reap $38million over three years to not plant some of their fields and leave extra water in the rapidly declining Lake Mead reservoir. Located roughly halfway between Los Angeles and Phoenix, growers near the city of Blythe in Riverside County have first priority to the river water. They hold rights that stretch back to 1877, superseding 40 million customers in eight states who also depend on it. But with continued drought and overuse, a first-ever shortage in the river system was declared in recent weeks by federal authorities, triggering cuts to Arizona, Nevada and Mexico’s supplies next year. In response, farmers who control the Palo Verde Irrigation District voted unanimously this month to agree to cancel planting some of their crops for three years. They will be paid about $925 per acre this year via federal drought response funds and water ratepayers in Arizona, Nevada and Southern California, with 2% increases each year after that. Bart Fisher, a PVID trustee whose family owns the 11,500-acre Fisher Ranch, said he and others were acting not because they want the money but because they want to help others and try to guarantee continued water supply for all.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado’s secretary of state filed a lawsuit Monday to remove a rural county’s election clerk who is accused of allowing a security breach of the county’s voting equipment that is currently being investigated by the FBI. The lawsuit filed in Mesa County district court by Secretary of State Jena Griswold seeks to formally remove Mesa County Clerk and Recorder Tina Peters as the designated election official. The suit also calls for the appointment of former Secretary of State Wayne Williams to replace Peters and Sheila Reiner, former Mesa county clerk and recorder, to serve as the elections supervisor for the county’s upcoming November elections. The Board of County Commissioners praised the changes in a statement Monday, saying Mesa County will have “arguably the most secure and transparent election system in the United States.” Peters has claimed that the investigation led by Griswold – who is a Democrat – is an attempt to take over one of the few remaining conservative counties in Colorado. Griswold said initial investigation findings show images of election management software used by the county’s elections equipment were obtained by conspiracy theorists and posted on far-right blogs. Griswold’s office also said it believes one of the images was taken from a secure room.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Schools around the state looking to upgrade aging ventilation systems to improve air quality and help fight the airborne spread of the coronavirus may find themselves short on funds, even with federal pandemic aid. The Connecticut Mirror reports a state policy restricts aid for heating, air conditioning and air quality control projects. The policy could be reviewed again by legislators, but likely not before the 2022 General Assembly session in February. “There are some districts that haven’t touched their schools in 40 years,” said Kostantinos Diamantis, the state’s budget director who also has overseen the state’s school construction program for the past six years. “The local level needs to belly up to the bar. The cities have an obligation to maintain those buildings.” Connecticut reimburses communities for between 10% and 71% of new construction and large renovation projects designed to last 20 years or longer, the Mirror reports. But the cost of smaller projects such as replacing or upgrading a heating and ventilation system must be absorbed by the town. For the town of Coventry, which wants to replace ventilators in its middle and high schools and make roof repairs, that would mean a bill of more than $2 million even after unused federal pandemic aid is applied.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Preliminary necropsy results show that a young fin whale that beached itself and died at Cape Henlopen State Park last week was riddled with parasites. “There was a lot going on,” said Marine Education, Research and Rehabilitation Institute Executive Director Suzanne Thurman. Measured by MERR to be 57 feet long, the whale first showed up in Lewes on Thursday, stuck on a sandbar in the Harbor of Refuge. It was able to free itself when the tide came in, but a short time later it beached itself again on the oceanside of The Point. Around noon Aug. 27, after many onlookers had come to catch a glimpse of its tail flapping in the surf, and just moments after Virginia Aquarium representatives had arrived to provide palliative care and possible euthanasia, the whale stopped breathing, according to a MERR Facebook post. The whale had to be cut into several pieces to move it out of the water for necropsy.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Dozens of people marched to the White House on Sunday calling for support of Afghan women. Organized by the nonprofit Vital Voices Global Partnership, the group is calling on President Joe Biden and other U.S. leaders to prioritize the evacuation of women out of Afghanistan and to help permanently protect women’s rights inside the country following the crisis inside the country and the Taliban takeover, WUSA-TV reports. Protesters wore shirts and held signs emblazoned with “I stand with Afghan women” as they marched from the Vital Voices headquarters on 16th Street through Black Lives Matter Plaza and to Lafayette Square, eventually gathering in front of the White House. The deadline to evacuate U.S. citizens from Afghanistan is Tuesday. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Sunday that for those U.S. citizens seeking immediately to leave Afghanistan by the looming deadline, “we have the capacity to have 300 Americans, which is roughly the number we think are remaining, come to the airport and get on planes in the time that is remaining.”\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: Sugar growers are suing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over proposed reservoir water levels they say will be far too low. The federal lawsuits filed last week by Florida Crystals’ Okeelanta Corp., U.S. Sugar and the Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative say the current Corps plan won’t supply enough water for their fields. “Farmers need a secure supply of water, and all farmers need certainty as we plan and manage our planting schedules and crop rotation,” said Jaime Vega, vice president of agriculture at Florida Crystals. Jacksonville Commander Col. Andrew Kelly defended the Corps’ work, saying the agency will balance water supply for both the environment and farmers. The project in question is the Everglades Agricultural Area reservoir intended to cleanse tainted water so more can flow south as crucially needed toward Everglades National Park and Florida Bay. In the lawsuits, Sugar Growers say the still-under-construction reservoir should be kept at higher water levels than what is currently envisioned in a Corps of Engineers plan. Everglades restoration advocates say the growers are simply putting their priorities ahead of others.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Atlanta Black Pride organizers say the annual celebration will happen Labor Day weekend as planned with some precautions to protect against the spread of COVID-19. The larger Atlanta Pride festival and parade planned for October were canceled Wednesday because of concerns about the pandemic. But leaders of Atlanta Black Pride, which celebrates the African American LGBTQ community, say they plan to go forward, with fewer indoor gatherings, while encouraging people to wear masks and maintain social distance. Amber Moore, COO and vice president of Atlanta Black Pride, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that COVID-19 vaccines and coronavirus testing will be offered. The celebration, marking its 25th anniversary this year, is to feature events around the city. In addition to parties, that includes a fashion show, a session on empowering women, an awards ceremony for the transgender community, a virtual film festival and a health expo. Vaughn Alvarez, who is helping to promote some of the events at Piedmont Park, told the newspaper that Atlanta rapper and radio host Da Brat and fiancee Jesseca “Judy” Dupart, CEO of Kaleidoscope Hair Products, will be honored for “bravery and courage with their love story.” The two star in “Brat loves Judy” on WE-TV.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A county affordable housing committee has voted to recommend approval of a rental project on Lanai, where no new affordable homes have been built in 30 years. The Hokuao 201H Housing Project, proposed by billionaire Larry Ellison’s company Pulama Lanai, includes the development of 150 two-bedroom rental homes on former pineapple fields. About half of the units will be market-rate priced. The project will be developed under the state’s fast-track approval process for affordable housing. The Maui County Council’s Affordable Housing Committee voted 8-0 to recommend giving the project the green light after multiple meetings packed with public testimony and hours of discussion over concern about the project’s number of market-rate homes, The Maui News reports. Council Chairwoman Alice Lee said the project is “desperately needed.” Pulama Lanai had sought an exemption for sidewalks in the future subdivision, saying including them would cost about $2 million. Sharon Thom, senior vice president of development and construction for Pulama Lanai, said the sidewalks would change the “look and feel” of Lanai City. But Committee Chairman Gabe Johnson argued to include sidewalks, saying the county needs to advocate for pedestrian safety and accessibility.\n\nIdaho\n\nPocatello: The hot, dry, smoky growing season has left some potato farmers bracing for a poor crop. Randy Hardy, of Oakley, told the Idaho State Journal that his harvest will likely be the worst of his career. Statewide, spud farmers conducting test digs or early harvests are uprooting plants supporting no tubers. Where there are potatoes, there are fewer than normal, and most of the tubers are undersized and misshapen. “I’ve never had this happen before, and I’ve got an agronomist who works with me on potatoes, and he’s been doing it for over 20 years, and he said he’s never seen a worse crop than this,” said Hardy, who raises spuds for the fresh market and is chairman of the board of Sun Valley Potatoes. Hardy isn’t scheduled to harvest until Sept. 20, and he’s hoping the extra time will allow his tubers to add a bit more bulk. United Potato Growers of Idaho asked growers to submit results from Aug. 1 test digs and will gather follow-up data in person during harvest. Hardy said the average number of tubers in the test digs was down 30% from last year. Weight was also down substantially, he said. Many fields lacked deep soil moisture when the potatoes were planted. Then the state was hit with record-high heat in June, contributing to fewer potatoes growing beneath each plant, and smoke-filled air from Western wildfires.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: From a waterpark resort to a public school, seven finalists have been named in a design competition to repurpose a much-maligned state government building downtown. State officials are trying to sell the James R. Thompson Center, which was designed by famed architect Helmet Jahn. They say the 17-story curved-glass structure that opened in 1985 is inefficient and requires hundreds of millions of dollars worth of repairs and updates to keep it running. The building houses offices for the governor and employees of state agencies, who are scheduled to move next year to another building on the city’s Near West Side. Illinois officials are seeking bids for a developer and have not committed to any preservation ideas. Officials have said they want to sell the building by February 2022. Architecture buffs have pushed for preservation, an effort that’s been renewed in the wake of Jahn’s death in May. The finalists were named last week. A group of design and preservation experts picked the finalists from 59 entries. A winner will be chosen Sept. 14.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A coalition of voting rights groups is sponsoring a contest for Hoosiers to draw new maps for congressional and legislative election districts. The group All IN for Democracy said the contest is aimed at finding “fair” proposed election maps to present to legislators before they vote in late September on the once-a-decade redistricting based on population shifts from the U.S. census. Voting rights activists have complained that the GOP-dominated Legislature isn’t involving the public enough in the redistricting work and that partisan gerrymandering has helped Indiana Republicans gain outsized power in state government. The organization is providing an online site where residents can compile maps based on the 2020 census data. Proposals submitted by Sept. 13 will be judged, with the winning map for Indiana’s nine congressional districts getting $1,000, with $2,000 for the best districts for the 50 Indiana Senate seats and $3,000 for the fairest map of the 100 Indiana House districts. The group said its judging will be based on how well the maps keep communities of interest together, maintain whole cities and counties in the same district, and maximize the number of politically competitive districts.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Black applicants are 2.6 times more likely to be denied a conventional home loan than similarly qualified white applicants in the Des Moines/West Des Moines metro, according to an analysis of 2019 data by The Markup, a nonprofit newsroom. Des Moines has the fifth-greatest likelihood of denial for Black applicants out of 71 U.S. metro areas that The Markup found had statistically significant disparities in home loan approvals. The newsroom found that nationally, mortgage lenders are 80% more likely to reject Black applicants; 70% more likely to deny Native American applicants; 50% more likely to turn down Asian/Pacific Islander applicants; and 40% more likely to reject Latino applicants. For its analysis, The Markup examined more than 2 million conventional mortgage applications, accounting for 17 independent variables, including debt-to-income ratio and combined loan-to-value ratio. It did not take into account credit scores, which are not publicly available through Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data. John Sorensen, president and CEO of the Iowa Bankers Association, said in a statement that while the organization “firmly believes that discrimination has no place in the mortgage market,” the data used by The Markup doesn’t give a full picture as to why these disparities exist.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: One of the biggest gun dealers in south-central Kansas is the city of Wichita, but it actually received less than half the proceeds from the sales because it works with several online companies to auction off the firearms. Since a new state law allowing the gun sales was passed in 2015, Wichita has sold 2,082 guns that were seized during crimes for which the criminal cases were complete. The city generated $196,000 on the gun sales that went into a fund that pays for miscellaneous police equipment. But The Wichita Eagle learned the city received less than half of the $425,000 in total sales generated because the companies that handle the sales take a significant chunk of the proceeds. The city contracts with Propertyroom.com, which sells the guns through a partnership with a major gun retailer that operates an online auction site. The city finance director said officials last took proposals for the gun contract two years ago and got no better offer. Sedgwick County Commissioner Jim Howell, who wrote the law, said it’s no different from police departments selling off other seized property, and any gun purchases require background checks. Former Rep. Jim Ward, who also used to work as a city prosecutor, said he knows it’s impossible to keep all the guns off the street, but he never wanted the government in the gun business.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: An instructional assistant at an eastern Kentucky elementary school died from COVID-19 as the fast-spreading delta variant has sparked coronavirus outbreaks in several school districts. Heather Antle, an aide at Lee County Elementary, died Sunday. Antle was an involved member of the school community who “brought great joy to the students and staff that she worked with,” Lee County Superintendent Sarah Wasson said in a statement posted to social media. The Lee County district canceled in-person classes until Sept. 7 in response to coronavirus cases among students and teachers. Virus outbreaks have caused disruptions since the school year began. Several other districts have shut down classes for multiple days due to outbreaks. Gov. Andy Beshear, while expressing condolences to Antle’s family, urged Kentuckians to get vaccinated and wear masks to prevent the virus’s spread in schools. “There was a time when some argued COVID did not spread in schools,” the governor said on social media. “That time should be over. ... We must do everything in our power to prevent the spread of this virus in our schools, and vaccinations and masks are our greatest tools. Let’s do what’s right for our teachers.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A couple who met in a gross anatomy class as Tulane University undergraduates have given Tulane Medical School $5 million for an endowed professorship. Drs. Philip and Cheryl Leone, of Naples, Florida, are now retired pathologists and current members of the School of Medicine Board of Governors, a university news release said Wednesday. Their endowment will support a medical school professor who will also hold a joint appointment in another school or unit and will focus on areas such as public health, immunology, parasitology or anthropology, the university said. The Leones have worked in both academia and private practice. “Tulane University has played a major role in our lives and the lives of our family members,” Phil Leone said. “Our son graduated from Tulane, and Cheryl’s siblings earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from the university.” “Endowing a Presidential Chair with an emphasis on interdisciplinary academic study allows us to contribute to the university in these challenging times,” Cheryl Leone said. “We hope our gift will strengthen the medical school and help train future physicians who can significantly advance the field of medicine.”\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: More than 125 boats participated in a weekend protest against plans for an aquaculture operation in waters near Acadia National Park. Commercial and recreational vessels comprised the “Save the Bay” flotilla that motored around Frenchman Bay on Sunday. Some people on land also participated by holding signs stating their opposition. American Aquafarms has proposed raising 66 million pounds of Atlantic salmon annually at a pair of 15-pen sites off the coast of Gouldsboro in Frenchman Bay. The company didn’t immediately return a telephone message. Ted O’Meara of Frenchman’s Bay United likened the scope of the project to ”some huge hog farm from the Midwest and plucking it right in the middle of one of the most beautiful parts of Maine.” He said that “our first goal is to stop this project, and our second goal is to look at changing some of the rules that allow people like this to think they can just come here and plug something like this down in our waters.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The first new Catholic school built in the city in roughly 60 years opened its doors Monday to hundreds of youngsters, who entered the gleaming new building with a mix of enthusiasm and first-day-back jitters. The state-of-the-art Mother Mary Lange Catholic School was built on the site where a notoriously rough public housing high-rise once stood. In a U.S. city steeped in Catholicism like few others, the new 65,000-square-foot building near downtown Baltimore is somewhat of an anomaly in the national education landscape as the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the shuttering of many Catholic schools. It’s named after Mother Mary Elizabeth Lange, a Haitian American who started a Catholic school for Black children in 1828 – the first U.S. Catholic school for African American youth. She co-founded the Oblate Sisters of Providence in Baltimore in 1829. The Vatican is reviewing Lange for possible canonization. Archbishop of Baltimore William E. Lori said the new school, which goes from preschool to eighth grade, is not only a benefit to the students and their families but also an asset to the surrounding neighborhood. The school’s playing fields and gym will be accessible, as appropriate, to the city community. “They say a rising tide lifts all boats. And I think the opening of this school has put a spring in the step of all of our Catholic educators,” Lori said in a phone interview.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A public marker to remember the enslaved Africans forced to journey across the ocean to toil in the Americas was formally dedicated Sunday on the downtown waterfront. The Middle Passage Port Marker was installed last October at the end of Long Wharf looking out onto Boston Harbor. It is meant to acknowledge Boston’s history of slavery and honor the Africans who were forced into the the trans-Atlantic voyage known as the Middle Passage. The Sunday ceremony included remarks from Michael Creasey, superintendent of the National Parks of Boston, and officials from the downtown Museum of African American History. Names of enslaved members of Boston’s oldest churches were read aloud, and there was a traditional balafon performance by Balla Kouyate as well as a land acknowledgement statement delivered by Elizabeth Solomon, a member of the Massachusett Tribe at Ponkapoag. Millions of Africans were sold in the Caribbean and in American cities such as Boston and Newport, Rhode Island, from 1619 to 1865, according to event organizers. Native Americans from local tribes, including the Massachusett, Wampanoag and Nipmuc, were also enslaved after being taken as prisoners of war, the organizations said.\n\nMichigan\n\nPort Huron: A monument dedicated to Tuskegee Airmen who died in Michigan during World War II training was unveiled Saturday near the international Blue Water Bridge. Michigan served as an advanced training ground for many graduates of the Tuskegee University pilot training program in Alabama. Surviving Tuskegee airmen and their descendants attended the event in Port Huron, part of a three-day celebration that recognized the accomplishments of America’s first Black military pilots. Fifteen Tuskegee airmen were killed while training in Michigan, including five pilots lost in Lake Huron and one in the St. Clair River, according to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Wreckages from two planes have been found in the river and the lake. In 2014, the remains of a P-39 aircraft were found in Lake Huron, 70 years after it crashed. The body of 2nd Lt. Frank Moody washed ashore a few months after the April 1944 crash. A dive team spent a week in Lake Huron in 2015 surveying the wreckage. The plane’s wing, landing gear, engine block, tail, propeller, cockpit door, instrument panel, .50-caliber machine guns and ammunition are being restored and will become an exhibit sponsored by the National Tuskegee Airmen Museum in Detroit.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A write-in campaign for a prehistoric giant beaver that weighed more than 200 pounds has secured it a spot on a list of possible candidates for state fossil. The write-in campaign has been so successful that the beaver, or Castoroides ohioensis, is now in the lead among possible state-fossil candidates proposed by the Science Museum of Minnesota. The fossil, found in St. Paul, dates back to the Pleistocene epoch and is estimated to be anywhere from 2.58 million years to 10,150 years old, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. Minnesota is one of just seven states without a state fossil, said Alex Hastings, the Phillip W. Fitzpatrick Chair of Paleontology at the Science Museum of Minnesota, who is leading an effort to designate one. Hastings put together a list of eight candidates – representing different creatures, different parts of the state and different geologic times – for consideration. As of last Tuesday, more than 2,100 people had voted, he said. The entry for Castoroides ohioensis notes that it had “buck teeth and aquatic lifestyle” and “was the size of a small bear,” according to officials with the St. Paul museum. It almost became Minnesota’s state fossil back in 1988, but the measure failed in the Legislature. Voting ends Oct. 1, after which legislators will get involved.\n\nMississippi\n\nYazoo City: A white father and son have each been sentenced to four years in prison for convictions related to chasing and shooting at two Black teenagers who were riding all-terrain vehicles on a country road. Some of the charges were prosecuted as hate crimes, which strengthened the punishment. Wade Oscar Twiner, 49, of Yazoo City, and his son, Lane Irvine Twiner, 23, of Jackson, were sentenced Friday in Yazoo County. Jurors on Wednesday convicted each man of two counts of simple assault and one count of malicious mischief. The district attorney’s office said the penalty for each simple assault conviction was increased because the men’s actions were deemed hate crimes under Mississippi law, which allows stronger penalties for crimes motivated by the victim’s actual or perceived race, color, ancestry, ethnicity, religion, national origin or gender. The men were arrested after the Sept. 27 chase in rural Yazoo County. The two teenagers were not injured, but they told investigators they were frightened for their lives. The teenagers were riding ATVs on a country road close to Wade Twiner’s home, said Chief Deputy Joseph Head of the Yazoo County Sheriff’s Office. The father and son got in a pickup and chased the teens, firing several shots and bumping into one of the ATVs with the truck.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Officials face a tall order to get all the state’s nursing home workers vaccinated because fewer than half of them have received the shots. By that metric, Missouri’s 48% ranks third-lowest in the nation, trailed only by Florida and Louisiana, both at 47%. Yet some 82% of Missouri’s nursing home residents have been vaccinated, which is just behind the national average of 83%. That worries residents like Michael Williams, who has diabetes and is on kidney dialysis at the Crestwood Health Care Center in St. Louis. “It’s fine if they (staff) don’t want to take it, but then don’t work around us. We all have underlying conditions here,” Williams told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “They are out in the casino, and they are rolling the dice, but the sad thing about it is it’s other people’s lives they are playing with.” Some workers have already quit rather than face a mandate. Earlier this month, the Biden administration said it would require nursing home staff be vaccinated against COVID-19 as a condition for those facilities to continue receiving Medicare and Medicaid payments – revenue on which nearly all skilled nursing facilities depend. But details of that plan still haven’t been released. Data analyzed by the Post-Dispatch shows 20 facilities statewide had staff vaccination rates of 20% or less as of Aug. 15.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Montana State University has announced a $101 million donation to its College of Nursing, believed to be the largest donation ever given to a college of nursing in the United States, school officials said. The donation, announced Monday, comes from Mark and Robyn Jones, founders of Goosehead Insurance, based in Westlake, Texas. “It is hard to put into words how moved and excited all of us are at Montana State University by the generosity of the Joneses, who are helping to address some of the most critical health care disparity issues in Montana, particularly in the state’s rural areas,” MSU President Waded Cruzado said in a statement. The money will be used to fund new facilities and state-of-the-art simulation labs at MSU College of Nursing campuses in Bozeman, Billings, Great Falls, Kalispell and Missoula. The donation will also create five faculty professorships, helping MSU attract top faculty talent as the nation faces a nursing faculty shortage. MSU’s College of Nursing will also create an endowed scholarship fund and a nurse midwifery program for doctoral-level nurses to provide maternal health in rural and remote communities.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The bones of the city’s next outdoor performance space have risen in the Gene Leahy Mall downtown. Metal arches that will one day form a performance pavilion have gone up in the mall in recent weeks, part of a $400 million public-private renovation of the mall, Heartland of America Park and Lewis & Clark Landing. When the pavilion is finished – likely sometime next spring – three white arches cascading in size will cover a stage. The Omaha World-Herald reports the space will be used for all manner of performances, from concerts, symphony performances and music festivals to movie nights and dance competitions. “It’s exciting seeing it start to come out of the ground,” said Katie Bassett, vice president of parks for the Metropolitan Entertainment & Convention Authority, which is managing the park renovations for the city. Stretching out from the pavilion to the west will be a 42,000-square-foot green lawn that will be able to host thousands of people for shows and offer a recreation space the rest of the time. Officials say the venue will be reminiscent of the iconic Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, which has a similar arch-shaped covering over the stage. At night, the pavilion will be lit from underneath to create a glow effect, which Bassett said will offer “an iconic” addition to Omaha’s downtown.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The nation’s fifth-largest school system has begun using ultraviolet light as a classroom germ-killer in a bid to stop the spread of COVID-19. “This doesn’t have any chemicals. It’s just light,” said Grant Morgan, chief executive and co-founder of Utah biosafety startup R-Zero, during a demonstration of the disinfection system at an elementary school in suburban Henderson. The blue-light-emitting tower can disinfect a 1,000-square-foot indoor space in seven minutes, destroying more than 99.99% of surface and airborne pathogens, Morgan told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. It is designed to be used while a space is unoccupied but has no lingering effects when people enter a room after treatment, he said. The Clark County School District bought one Arc unit for each of its 372 campuses using $7.4 million in federal coronavirus relief money to cover the $20,000 per-unit cost, the Review-Journal said. The district has more than 310,000 students. Classes began Aug. 9.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College is asking employees who have not yet returned to campus to keep working remotely until Oct. 4. The previous plan was for workers to return at the start of September, but the college is adjusting its plans as COVID-19 cases increase regionally and nationally, said Scott Bemis, chief human resources officer. Many of those who have already returned “can continue to work on-site,” Bemis said in an email to the community Friday. He said the date is being pushed back a month “to help slow the increase in the density of people on campus, with the goal of interrupting COVID-19 transmission wherever possible.” Bemis also said that weekly coronavirus surveillance testing will be conducted for vaccinated employees, instead of every 30 days. Unvaccinated employees who are coming to campus are still required to test twice a week.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: About half a million residents stand to lose a $300 federal unemployment benefit when it expires Saturday. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday during a COVID-19 news conference that it would cost the state more than $1 billion a month to pick up the unemployment insurance tab from the federal government. “The proper way to extend federal UI benefits is through federal action, not a patchwork of state ones,” he said. “The reality is that continuing the $300-per-week benefit through state resources would be cost-prohibitive.” The expiration will affect about 500,000 people, according to the New Jersey Department of Labor. Federal jobless aid was first approved in 2020 when COVID-19 outbreak hit, sending jobless to record highs amid pandemic-related shutdowns. The state has administered $33.7 billion directly to 1.6 million residents since the start of the pandemic, the governor said. The lion’s share – $25 billion – has come from the federal government. To those unemployed residents affected by the expiration of the federal benefit, Murphy pointed to the state’s minimum wage, which will rise to $13 an hour in the new year from $12. He also pointed to the state’s paid sick and family leave programs, along with other social safety net aids.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland married her longtime partner, Skip Sayre, on Saturday night in her home state. Haaland wore a dress designed and sewn by her sister, said Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz. The ceremony incorporated elements honoring her Native American ancestry. The former New Mexico congresswoman is a member of the Laguna Pueblo. According to Schwartz, guests had to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend and wear masks per U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and New Mexico guidelines. But pictures on social media that show some people, including Haaland, not wearing masks indoors the whole time have drawn criticism. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A “sequence of failures” in the city’s subway system following a brief power outage disrupted half of the system for several hours and stranded hundreds of passengers, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday. Hochul said in a statement that a Metropolitan Transportation Authority review of Sunday night’s subway breakdown “uncovered a sequence of failures that resulted in some backup systems not providing power as designed last night, including an additional failure to quickly diagnose the underlying cause.” The unprecedented breakdown affected more than 80 trains on the subway system’s numbered lines plus the L train from shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday to about 1:30 a.m. Monday, Hochul said at an earlier news conference. The restoration of service was delayed because passengers on two of the stuck trains walked out onto the tracks by themselves rather than waiting for rescuers from agencies including the police and fire departments to help them, Hochul said. “We never, ever want riders to do that,” she said. “It is dangerous, and it caused a delay in the restoration of power.” Speaking outside a lower Manhattan subway system, Hochul promised a thorough investigation. “Let me be very clear,” she said. “Last night was unacceptable.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: State environmental regulators say a plant that for years discharged so-called forever chemicals into the air and water is not currently in compliance with its air permit. In its letter to Chemours, the Department of Environmental Quality warned that it is preparing an enforcement action against the company’s Fayetteville Works plant in Bladen County, which has been exceeding its GenX air pollution limits for much of 2021. Officials said the company could be facing up to a $25,000 fine per day. In a statement, Chemours said the site experienced a temporary increase in air emissions this year from one of its carbon adsorption units. “The issue was quickly resolved when the carbon was replaced in this unit, and emissions returned to their usual low levels,” the statement said. “However, the data results from that one emissions sampling caused an exceedance of the site’s calculated 12-month rolling air emission allowance.” Chemours, a spinoff of DuPont Co., plans to take corrective action to fix the issue in the long term, according to its statement. GenX, a type of PFAS, has been found in drinking water wells near the plant and also the municipal utility serving the city of Wilmington, about 100 miles downstream.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A new quarterly report from North Dakota State University says the state’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has slowed a bit. The outlook predicts declines in the gross state product, which is the measurement of the state’s output, labor force participation, and total wages and salaries. “The overall economic outlook for the state had been improving amidst the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the most recent data shows a state economy that is at risk of declining economic growth and a shrinking labor force,” said NDSU economics professor Jeremy Jackson, director of the Center for the Study of Public Choice and Private Enterprise. Total wages and salaries are expected to hold steady with a slight decline in the third quarter of this year, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The labor force is predicted to decline in the third quarter, with that trend continuing into next year. The unemployment rate is projected to have a slight increase in the third quarter and then return to its declining trend. North Dakota’s gross state product grew 1.8% in the first quarter of 2021, up from 1.3% in the previous quarter, but gross state product is forecast to decline heading into 2022. Despite the forecast decline, the model predicts relative stability in total tax collections.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Supporters of a proposal to legalize marijuana got the green light Monday to collect signatures to place the measure before state lawmakers. The Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol’s proposed statute was approved as a single issue by the Ohio Ballot Board, a panel of legislative appointees led by Secretary of State Frank LaRose. The group will soon begin collecting the 132,887 signatures of registered Ohio voters needed to submit the proposed law to the Legislature. If the Legislature doesn’t pass or passes an amended version of the bill, supporters can collect another 132,887 signatures to put the proposal before voters, likely in November 2022. The proposal would allow adults age 21 and older to buy, grow, possess and consume marijuana. Proceeds of a 10% tax on marijuana would go to education, addiction treatment and municipalities with marijuana businesses. Municipalities could limit or ban marijuana businesses within their borders. Ohio’s medical marijuana businesses, several of which are backing the plan, could automatically get licenses for the recreational side. The bill establishes 40 new cultivation licenses and 50 additional dispensary licenses for economically and socially disadvantaged “social equity” applicants. Additional licenses could be granted two years later.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Hospitals are again overwhelmed as the spread of COVID-19 is surging through the state, but this time, they’re facing the wave with even further strain on health care workers. The state has dealt with a nursing shortage for at least two decades, Oklahoma nursing leaders said. But the pandemic has worsened it, with the stresses driving some burned-out nurses out of the industry or to other states, amid greater demands on the health care system. “The pandemic has brought on some extra stresses that we had no way of predicting, and that has impacted our retention rates enormously,” said Shelly Wells, president of the Oklahoma Nurses Association. “For example, I don’t think that humans were meant to see as much death as our nurses have seen, personally, in the last 16 months.” A nurse working in a hospital in normal times might expect to care for a dying patient once a week, Wells said. “These patients are dying much more frequently,” she said. “There’s no family support, so the nurses are having to double as family and offer that support” on top of caring for the patients themselves. And it can be especially troubling to care for someone your age or younger “that you know is probably not going to live,” said Elain Richardson, regional chief nursing officer with SSM Health St. Anthony.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Record-low numbers of steelhead are returning to the Columbia River this year, prompting conservationists and anglers alike to call for a halt to recreational fishing for the sea-run fish. As of last week, just 29,000 steelhead passed the Bonneville Dam since July 1 – the fewest ever recorded, less than half the average of the past five years, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. A coalition of conservation and fishing groups sent a letter to the Oregon, Washington and Idaho agencies that manage fish and wildlife requesting an immediate closure of recreational steelhead fisheries on the Columbia River, the Lower Snake River and their tributaries. “This is a really, really dire year for steelhead – especially wild steelhead – in the Columbia River Basin,” said Rob Kirschner, legal and policy director for The Conservation Angler, which advocates for protection and restoration of wild fish in the Pacific Northwest and Kamchatka, Russia. “We are trying to protect every eligible spawner,” he said. “Every one of these fish counts.” Steelhead on the Columbia and Snake rivers are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Their population has been devastated by habitat destruction, including construction of hydroelectric dams, as well as overfishing and climate change. High water temperatures have also been detrimental.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Hundreds of thousands of residents will lose federal pandemic unemployment benefits after this week, including an extra $300 per week, an extra 13 weeks of benefits and coverage for the self-employed. Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration said Monday that there are sources of help for people who need it once their jobless aid runs out, including federal rental assistance through counties, Medicaid, food stamps and temporary cash-assistance for low-income families. In the first week of August, roughly 640,000 people were receiving the extra $300, according to figures from the state Department of Labor and Industry. About 388,000 of them were in the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program for freelancers or the self-employed, and almost 175,000 were receiving an extra 13 weeks of assistance through the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program. About 78,000 people were receiving benefits through the state’s regular 26-week unemployment compensation program, which will continue running, but without the extra $300 federal benefit on top. The American Rescue Plan Act, signed by President Joe Biden in March, extended those federal benefits and set them to expire after this week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee’s chief of staff, who is under scrutiny for whether he used his political clout to push through a development approval on some wetlands owned by his family, has stepped down, the governor’s office announced Monday. Anthony Silva maintains he did nothing wrong in the approval process, but the issue had become a distraction, the Democratic governor said in a statement. “Tony and I reached a mutual agreement that it is in the best interest of the administration for him to retire from state government effective immediately,” the statement said. “Right now, his situation is a distraction from the critical work we have ahead. I appreciate that Tony understands the need to remove the distraction to ensure we can continue serving Rhode Islanders effectively.” Silva once had an agreement to purchase the property in Cumberland – where McKee was once mayor and Silva was police chief. After the state Department of Environmental Management issued the necessary approvals, the property was purchased by Silva’s son, Ross. Town officials as well as neighbors oppose building on the land, saying developing it would exacerbate flooding problems in the area, and were concerned that Silva and his family got preferential treatment from the state environmental agency.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The rapid rise in COVID-19 cases in the state has the Department of Motor Vehicles changing how it gives road tests for driver’s licenses. The agency started requiring masks for both new drivers and examiners Wednesday. As of Monday, it is again requiring appointments for driving tests, and on Sept. 7 the department will go back to how it handled testing at the start of the pandemic, with the examiner outside the car, the DMV said in a statement. The modified skills test evaluates the same abilities as the regular test, with the examiner scoring the test from outside, the DMV said. The agency is encouraging but not requiring masks inside its branches. Officials also said many basic services, like driver’s license renewal, can be done online.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers tasked with redrawing the state’s political boundaries set a framework Monday that will allow them to speed through the once-in-a-decade process on a tight schedule this year. The two committees responsible for drawing the new legislative districts began their work in earnest Monday after the U.S. Census Bureau released detailed data earlier this month. Lawmakers only have about 10 weeks to propose districts before a special session of the Legislature convenes Nov. 8. The Census Bureau’s data was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re in for a very compact and a very intense schedule over the next two months to get all this accomplished,” Republican Sen. Jim Bolin told the committees, which met jointly Monday. Republican lawmakers cited the shortened process in setting two parameters that will guide their work: keeping new legislative districts between a lower threshold of 24,066 residents and an upper threshold of 26,600 people, and restricting access to the Legislature’s map-drawing software to committee members only. Legislative research staff said they were worried their work would get bogged down if the general public were allowed to propose maps through its software and said people could create their own proposals with other open-source applications.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Cummins Falls State Park has been named state park of the year. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation honored the Cookeville park for effectively managing an increase in visitors and overcrowding while enhancing safety measures, the department said in a news release Thursday. The 306-acre park in middle Tennessee used social media to inform people of river conditions, scheduled programs and activities. It also conducted more than 250 interpretation programs, held day camps for children and school programs, and hosted a weekly home-school group, officials said. Cummins Falls also has removed invasive plants, planted native species, built two greenhouses, and grown and processed sorghum, officials said. Cummins Falls is one of 56 state parks in Tennessee. It is one of several state parks honored with a 2021 Award of Excellence at a recent park management conference at Pickwick Landing State Park.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Black arts community is pushing to create a cultural center at the music venue Kenny Dorham’s Backyard, amid broader work for equity in the city’s cultural arts programs and historic preservation in East Austin. “Everybody says the words equity, sustainability. But it turns out, if there’s no intention, no action behind it, it means nothing,” City Council Member Natasha Harper-Madison told a diverse crowd of arts supporters in July as they gathered to celebrate the return of Black contemporary dance company Ballet Afrique to East Austin. “We have so much work to do to make this a truly equitable and truly inclusive city that lives up to our progressive reputation.” In 2019, the city contracted with an outside consultant, MJR Partners, to conduct a review of city-allocated cultural arts and heritage funding. An interim report released in June outlines strategies to achieve greater equity, as well as some of the challenges the city will face. The report notes that “traditional and white-led institutions struggle to accept that historic inequities exist in the city.” “I think the city is really trying,” said Carl Settles, director of the nonprofit E4 Youth, which aims to build bridges between underprivileged area youths and Austin’s creative and tech industries.\n\nUtah\n\nMoab: Two recently married Utah women were found dead from gunshot wounds after reports of a “weirdo camping near them” and a four-day search in Moab, about an hour away from Arches National Park. On Wednesday, 38-year-old Crystal Turner and 24-year-old Kylen Schulte were found by a family friend in the South Mesa area of La Sal Loop Road, where they had been camping. Schulte and Turner went missing Aug. 14, four days before they were found dead from gunshot wounds, according to the Grand County Sheriff’s Office. Schulte’s father had posted on Facebook that they hadn’t been to work, hadn’t called, were not in the hospital and were not in jail. “Kylen and Crystal told close friends that there was a weirdo camping near them that was freaking them out !!! And that they should move campsites. Now they have been missing for over 4 days and nights!” Sean-Paul Schulte posted. The couple’s bodies were transported to the Medical Examiner’s Office, which determined the cause of death to be gunshot wounds, the Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nVermont\n\nVergennes: The city is planning to erect a monument to the state’s first known black sheriff and chief of police. The city of Vergennes is planning to unveil and dedicate the monument to former Sheriff Stephen Bates on Oct. 3. Bates was first elected sheriff and chief of police in Vergennes in 1879. Bates had been formerly enslaved in Virginia. He gained his freedom and served Union soldiers during the Civil War. He first came to Vergennes in 1866 with Vermont U.S. Rep. Frederick E. Woodbridge. Bates served as sheriff of Vergennes for 25 years. He raised a family in the city before his death in 1907, and some of his descendants will be attending the event. A local team of historians and others spent the past year researching Bates’ life and rediscovering his story in Vergennes.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe has asked a court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Virginia Republicans that seeks to remove him from the ballot in this year’s closely watched race for governor over an alleged paperwork error. In a filing Friday evening, attorneys for the former governor now running for a second term against GOP nominee Glenn Youngkin said the suit was based on a “legal lie” and would effectively invalidate hundreds of thousands of votes cast in the Democratic primary. The complaint filed last week by the Republican Party of Virginia against state election officials argued that McAuliffe should be disqualified from running in the November general election because of the omission of his signature on an official form declaring his candidacy. McAuliffe argued in his filing that nothing in Virginia code requires a candidate to sign the declaration of candidacy. Further, the filing said: “Even if there were a technical defect with the declaration of candidacy – and there is not – it would provide no basis for removing McAuliffe’s name from the general election ballot and preventing Virginia’s voters from choosing him as their next Governor. The declaration of candidacy is a prerequisite for placement on the ballot in the primary election, not the general election, and the primary election has already concluded.”\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Hundreds of people gathered at the state Capitol on Saturday to protest Gov. Jay Inslee’s vaccine mandate. Announced in early August, Inslee’s order requires most state workers, health care workers and school employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 18 or face losing their jobs. Inslee has said getting people vaccinated is essential for getting Washington past the pandemic. Organizers of the rally Saturday warned that a large segment of state workers, including many firefighters, sanitation workers and bus drivers, won’t get the vaccine – as much as 30% to 40% statewide, they said. It wasn’t clear what that estimate was based on. “If the Governor refuses to rescind his mandate, it will mean that multiple areas of the state will be severely reduced or shut down completely,” Tyler Miller, of the group Liberty, At All Hazards, said in a news release. “The Governor is unnecessarily threatening the genuine safety and well-being of the citizens of Washington if he forces his mandate to stand.” Inslee spokesman Mike Faulk defended the need for the mandate. “Employees are losing their lives to COVID. Hospitals are filling up. Communities are stressed by the pandemic’s impacts. The safest and most effective way to get beyond these tragic circumstances is vaccination,” Faulk said in a statement.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Residents who landscape for wildlife use can have their land designated a “wild yard.” The program already has 300 members around the state and is operated through the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources to create more natural habitat for wildlife around the state. “It’s such a wonderful program to get involved in,” Rebecca Linger, who owns a certified wild yard, said in a news release from the agency. “And you get the added benefit of creating an environment around your house where you can enjoy seeing wildlife coming and going. It really is delightful.” Jim Fregonara, a wildlife biologist with the division, said landowners who apply, provide a habitat plan and demonstrate that their property meets the needs of native wildlife will be added to a register of wild yards. They also receive a certificate for participating in the program and a sign post to display in the yard. “We want to encourage private citizens, whether they have a little bit of property or own a lot of land, to help wildlife thrive by providing them with food, water, shelter and space,” Fregonara said.

Tony Evers said Monday. Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have criticized the vetting process and warned about terrorists being allowed into the country. After a tour of the Wisconsin base last week, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson questioned whether the refugees at Fort McCoy had been fully vetted and called White House assurances about the process “lipstick on a pig.” Evers also toured the base last week and met with refugees. He said Republicans criticizing the vetting of those refugees are “vastly uninformed.” “Or they like to raise that specter of maybe some of those little kids I saw at Fort McCoy are terrorists, or maybe those adults that I saw at Fort McCoy who were working hand in hand with our soldiers and airmen in Afghanistan, somehow they are terrorists even though they’ve been vetted four or five or six times even before they left Afghanistan,” Evers said. “To me, it’s dog whistle crap, and we don’t need any of that.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Donations are pouring in for the widow and unborn child of a U.S. Marine killed in a bombing in Afghanistan. Rylee McCollum, 20, was among 13 service members killed by a suicide bomb attack Thursday at the Kabul airport. The troops were providing security as the airport was overwhelmed with people trying to leave the country amid the U.S. withdrawal and Taliban takeover. McCollum was from Bondurant and expecting his first child in three weeks, according to his family. Almost $687,000 had been raised through two online fundraising campaigns, one for the child’s future education costs and one for McCollum’s widow, as of Tuesday morning. McCollum was on his first deployment and manning a checkpoint at the airport when the attack happened, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. McCollum attended Jackson Hole High School and competed as a wrestler. He graduated in 2019 from Summit Innovations School in Jackson.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/20/politics/joe-biden-80th-birthday/index.html", "title": "Joe Biden celebrates his 80th birthday | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden turns 80 years old on Sunday, becoming the first octogenarian to ever serve in the highest office of the United States.\n\nThe unique milestone of Biden’s birthday comes as the president faces speculation about whether he will mount a reelection run and dredges up questions about whether he’s too old to serve another term.\n\nThe president celebrated his birthday in Washington with a brunch hosted by first lady Jill Biden, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Jill Biden tweeted a photo of him blowing out a candle on top of a coconut cake, with balloons in the background.\n\nPresident Joe Biden celebrates his 80th birthday, blowing out the candle on his coconut birthday cake with first lady Jill Biden, Naomi Biden, her husband Peter Neal and other Biden grandchildren on Sunday, November 20, 2022. Flotus/Instagram\n\n“A perfect birthday celebration filled with so much love – and Joe’s favorite coconut cake!” she wrote.\n\nMembers of Biden’s family already in town celebrating his granddaughter’s wedding at the White House on Saturday attended the brunch.\n\nThe wedding’s timing, two people familiar with the planning had told CNN, was not a coincidence – noting the “age issue” is never something Biden wants to highlight.\n\nThe president has political momentum on his side ahead of a potential reelection bid – having been able to maintain a Democratic majority in the Senate and thwart the historical political tides of a resounding Republican wave in Congress. There was also the lukewarm political support his slightly younger predecessor, Donald Trump, received when he announced his recent decision to run for president in 2024.\n\nBut Biden has not been able to shake voters’ apprehensions about his age, with rhetorical gaffes and literal stumbles at times reinforcing concerns about his health and mental acuity.\n\nBiden would be an unprecedented 86 years old by the end of his second term if he were to run and win his reelection. By comparison, some of the oldest past living presidents still had years on Biden – Trump left office at the age of 74 and Ronald Reagan left office after his two terms at 77 years old.\n\nThe president, for his part, maintains that voters concerned about his age should see his record of accomplishments since taking office.\n\n“Well, they’re concerned about whether or not I can get anything done. Look what I’ve gotten done,” Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper in October. “Name me a president in recent history that’s gotten done as much as I have in their first two years.”\n\nBiden said last month that while he has not made a formal decision about running for reelection in 2024, it is his “intention” to do so. But he’s long said it’s a decision both he and his family will decide on together. And Saturday’s wedding marks a kickoff of sorts for the tight-knit Bidens to begin earnest discussions over whether their patriarch should seek a second term.\n\nAnd the president isn’t the only Washington power reckoning with pressures to bow out. On the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, Nancy Pelosi, 82, recently announced plans to step down as House speaker, celebrating Democrats ushering in a new generation of leadership.

The city of Montgomery announced Monday that band shows and other events connected with back-to-back football games planned next month between historically Black colleges were being called off because of the pandemic. Mule Day, the biggest annual event in the 4,500-person town of Winfield, also was called off for the second year straight because of rising cases of COVID-19 in northwest Alabama. In Cullman, where the Rock the South country music festival held last week drew thousands, health officials were concerned about a rise in COVID-19 cases linked to the gathering. Judy Smith, area administrator of the state health department, said 41% of recent COVID-19 cases were in people between the ages of 21 and 49. “That’s probably the majority of what went to Rock the South,” she told the Decatur Daily. Other large events are pushing ahead. The National Shrimp Festival, which can attract as many as 250,000 people to Gulf Shores, remains scheduled for October, a city spokesperson said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A ship that sank off Kodiak Island more than three decades ago has started to leak diesel fuel, and a state official suspects ground shaking from last month’s massive magnitude 8.2 earthquake might be the reason. The vessel sank in 1989 in Womens Bay, “and it’s been resting there since,” Jade Gamble, the state’s on-scene spill coordinator, told CoastAlaska. The first reports of an oil sheen came in a week after the July 28 earthquake, the largest in the U.S. in the past half-century. It’s not clear how much diesel fuel or other contaminants remain on the Saint Patrick. The 138-foot former scallop boat was hit by a rogue wave in November 1981 near Marmot Island. The crew of 12 abandoned ship; only two survived. The vessel eventually was towed to Womens Bay, where it later sank. “They’ve been able to minimize the leak,” Gamble said. “Our main goal is to ensure we don’t have some type of catastrophic release.” An official at the Alaska Earthquake Center said it’s not clear if the quake is responsible for the ship’s leak, however. The epicenter was about 260 miles southwest of Womens Bay. Despite its size, the quake didn’t cause serious damage or produce a major tsunami.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Conservative groups and Republican lawmakers said Tuesday that they will ask voters to approve an ID requirement for mail-in ballots, potentially creating a significant new voting requirement in a crucial battleground state. The measure is the latest GOP effort to impose new restrictions following Donald Trump’s baseless claims that he lost the 2020 presidential race because of fraud. “There’s a confidence crisis among many people,” said Republican Sen. J.D. Mesnard, one of the lawmakers supporting the initiative. “How it came to be is somewhat immaterial to the fact that it exists and, by virtue of it existing, is a threat to democracy.” Nearly 90% of Arizona voters cast ballots they receive in the mail. Voting-rights advocates say imposing new requirements on those citizens is inevitably going to lead some votes to be left uncounted. The proposed initiative is backed by influential and deep-pocketed groups, including the Free Enterprise Club and Heritage Action. Doubts about the integrity of the election are fueled by groups on the right pushing conspiracy theories about what happened in 2020, said Alex Gulotta, Arizona state director for All Voting is Local, a voting-rights group. “Its beyond nonsensical that you create a problem and then you now have to create a solution to the problem you created,” he said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Department of Health on Tuesday reported 41 more COVID-19 deaths, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 6,539. Arkansas’ COVID-19 hospitalizations decreased by 49 to 1,410, a day after the state reached a new record for people in the hospital due to the coronavirus. The state reported 2,203 new virus cases, bringing its total to 422,866. Arkansas ranks fourth in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The state’s cases and hospitalizations have skyrocketed in recent weeks because of the ultra-contagious delta variant and the state’s low vaccination rate. There are only 17 intensive care unit beds available in the state, the department said. There are 542 COVID-19 patients in ICUs around the state and 328 on ventilators. Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted Tuesday that COVID patients make up about 47% of the state’s adult ICU beds. Nearly 39% of the state’s population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The department reported more than 12,000 doses of vaccine were given Monday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles County on Tuesday ordered people to wear masks at all outdoor mass events such as concerts and sports games, regardless of whether they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19. The county health officer mandated masks at all times for any event with a crowd greater than 10,000 except when people are actively eating and drinking. The order will take effect at 11:59 p.m. Thursday. SoFi Stadium announced it would implement the new mask mandate at L.A. Rams and Chargers games this weekend. Other sports venues were expected to follow suit. The county previously required masks to be worn in most indoor public places, such as restaurants and gyms. The revised order now also covers “mega events” ranging from marathons to car shows and food festivals. Delta, a much more contagious variant of the coronavirus, is fueling a surge of new cases across the country. California is averaging about 10,000 new infections a day. LA County, which has 10 million residents, on Tuesday announced nearly 3,000 new cases of COVID-19, with about 1,700 people hospitalized. There also were 30 new deaths reported. Most of those infections are among the unvaccinated, authorities said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis on Tuesday rescinded a 19th-century proclamation that called for citizens to kill Native Americans and take their property, in what he hopes can begin to make amends for “sins of the past.” The 1864 order by Colorado’s second territorial governor, John Evans, would eventually lead to the Sand Creek massacre, one of Colorado’s darkest and most fraught historic moments. The brutal assault left more than 200 Arapaho and Cheyenne people – mostly women, children and elderly – dead. Evans’ proclamation was never lawful because it established treaty rights and federal Indian law, Polis said at the signing of his executive order on the Capitol steps. “It also directly contradicted the Colorado Constitution, the United States Constitution and Colorado criminal codes at the time,” the Democratic governor said to whoops from the crowd. Polis stood alongside citizens of the Southern Ute, Ute Mountain, Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, many dressed in traditional regalia. Some held signs reading “Recognize Indigenous knowledge, people, land” and “Decolonize to survive.” Evans governed the territory of Colorado during three years of the Civil War, from 1862 to 1865. He resigned after the Sand Creek massacre happened under his order.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: The earthquake that killed hundreds of people in Haiti on Saturday has had an unforeseen emotional effect on a local parish and the Rev. Dukens Boliere. Boliere is the pastor of Shekinah Free Methodist Worship Center in Bridgeport. He also oversees a sister parish with the same name in Corail, Haiti, that was destroyed by the 7.2 magnitude quake over the weekend, the New Haven Register reports. Boliere said one member of the parish was killed, and the church caretaker is in critical condition after his house, located next to the church, collapsed on him. “The church is completely destroyed,” Boliere said. “We will be in the rebuilding mode after we assess the situation.” Corail is in a remote, mountainous area in the country’s southern peninsula, making it difficult to contact the church even in the best of times, according to the newspaper. The Bridgeport parish will hold a meeting Sunday, “gather some money and send some survival kits,” Boliere said. “It’s going to be an endeavor, but we are determined that we are going to help them as much as we can,” he said. “It’s going to be very difficult. We are going to need logistical help from Haiti to get it to them.”\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: A small downtown church is one of the first in the state to disaffiliate from the United Methodist Church in defense of LGTBQ rights and same-sex marriage. Historic Groome Church, formerly known as Groome United Methodist Church, announced its disaffiliation this month. Groome’s pastor, the Rev. S. Willard Crossan III, said the United Methodist Church has wrestled with these issues for a half-century and has “repeatedly failed to come to a meaningful resolution.” “The LGBTQ community is an important and vital part of the greater Lewes/Rehoboth community in which we live, its members are part of our daily life,” Crossan said in a news release. “They are our friends, neighbors, family members, the people we worship with, choose to love, to marry, to do business and play sports with. ... How can we reconcile the posture of the denomination with our conscience, the calling of our congregation, our ministry and the commandment of love we believe to be the heart of the Gospel?” he said. “We can’t.” Groome’s exit was finalized in a disaffiliation agreement negotiated over a two-year period with the Peninsula-Delaware Conference, which includes churches in Delaware and the Eastern Shore of Maryland.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: All Metro employees will be required to get COVID-19 vaccines or upload coronavirus test results weekly to the WMATA employee portal starting Sept. 7, WUSA-TV reports. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority officials said in a statement released Tuesday that if employees choose to remain unvaccinated, they can either fill out a medical or religious accommodation form or take a weekly virus test, the expense and responsibility for which will fall on the employee. New hires with Metro will have to show proof of vaccination before starting to work at Metro, WMATA said.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: An oceanfront park is emerging as the leading site for a memorial to the victims of a deadly condominium building collapse, a judge said Wednesday. The city of Miami Beach recently offered a portion of the 28-acre North Beach Oceanside Park as the potential location to remember the June 24 collapse of the Champlain Towers South building, which killed 98 people. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Michael Hanzman said at a remote hearing Wednesday that it was unrealistic to pursue any plan for a memorial where the 12-story condo once stood, as some family members wish. That nearly 2-acre location in Surfside, he said, must be sold to compensate victims of the tragedy. At least one bidder has offered up to $120 million for the property. “It has to be used for the benefit of all the victims collectively,” Hanzman said. The park, he added, is “a remarkable and extremely valuable piece of real estate. I understand this is a beautiful site that is within walking distance.” Still, some family members of collapse victims say they would prefer a fitting memorial at the exact location. “I believe the memorial should be at Surfside, and not Miami Beach, at the site of the tragedy,” said Pablo Langenfeld, whose daughter and son-in-law died in the collapse. The park is about 100 feet from the collapse site.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The State Election Board on Wednesday took a step toward a possible eventual takeover of elections in Georgia’s most populous county under a process outlined in the state’s sweeping new voting law. The board voted unanimously Wednesday to approve a bipartisan, three-person review panel to investigate the handling of elections in Fulton County, a Democratic bastion that includes most of the city of Atlanta. The county has long been a target for Republicans. Their attacks increased after former President Donald Trump claimed without evidence that fraud in the county contributed to his narrow loss in the state. An independent monitor appointed by the State Election Board found no evidence of fraud or malfeasance. GOP lawmakers last month asked the state board to appoint the performance review panel, initiating the process that could allow the Republican-controlled state board to replace the county’s board of registration and elections with an administrator it chooses. Fulton County accounts for about 11% of the state’s electorate, and President Joe Biden won nearly 73% of votes cast there in the November election. The county is about 45.5% white, 44.5% Black and 7.6% people of Asian descent, according to U.S. census data.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Intensive care units in the state’s largest private hospital system are functioning at or near capacity this week amid an alarming surge of coronavirus cases on the islands, a hospital official said. Some ICU beds were open at The Queen’s Health Systems hospitals Tuesday, but the units were “completely full” Monday, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The hospitals were looking at canceling elective surgeries and procedures and diverting emergency patients to other hospitals. “Queen’s is accepting patients who need emergency care for treatment such as traumas, heart attacks and strokes,” said Jason Chang, The Queen’s Health systems chief operating officer and The Queen’s Medical Center president. “We remain committed to providing care by constantly evaluating our operations to ensure our doors remain open to those in need of emergency care.” But Chang said Monday that the staff is being stretched thin. “They are tired, and there is a level of frustration when you know the COVID patient you are caring for was not vaccinated, and it was largely preventable,” he said. Chang said there is no indication that the surge in new COVID-19 patients will come to an end soon. “So in two weeks the situation actually may be worse,” he said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Hospitals are reporting record numbers of COVID-19 patients on ventilators, public health officials have reactivated a “crisis standards of care” task force, and epidemiologists are warning that based on the current rate of spread, the state could see as many as 30,000 new cases a week by mid-October. Idaho Department of Health and Welfare officials made the announcements during an online news conference Tuesday afternoon. Public health administrator Elke Shaw-Tulloch said they were “extremely alarmed” by the surge. “Hospitals are completely stressed and overwhelmed and in many cases seeking assistance,” she said. There are 65 COVID-19 patients on ventilators statewide, just over last winter’s record of 63 patients. Idaho hospitals are struggling to maintain adequate staff levels, as employees get sick or decide to find work elsewhere. Based on the current infection rate of the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus, hospitals could have to implement crisis standards of care in as soon as two weeks, Shaw-Tulloch said. Crisis standards are intended to help hospitals direct scarce resources to the patients most likely to survive. One northern Idaho hospital is struggling to fill 500 jobs, Shaw-Tulloch said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s southern suburbs will receive a new area code in the coming months to meet the demand for new telephone numbers. The 464 area code will overlay the 708 area code, the Illinois Commerce Commission said Monday. It will be available only when all assignable prefixes in the 708 code have been exhausted, the panel said. That’s not expected to occur until January. The 708 area code serves most of western and southern Cook County and eastern and southern Will County including Alsip, Calumet City, Chicago Heights, Lansing and Oak Lawn. With an overlay, an additional area code is added to the same geographic area as the existing area code, with all current phone customers retaining the original area code. The 464 area code will be assigned to new customers requesting local phone service, cellular and paging services, and alarms, the commission said. Current 708 area customers will keep their numbers. Consumers seeking additional telephone lines will, in most cases, continue to be able to receive 708 telephone numbers, even after the 464 area code is in service, the commission said. Local calls will remain local calls.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state will continue paying out an extra $300 in weekly federal unemployment payments despite a Tuesday court ruling that the Republican governor had the authority to cut off the benefit. Those payments will continue because the state must give recipients a 30-day notice that they will stop, which extends past the scheduled Sept. 6 end of the federal pandemic unemployment programs, Indiana Department of Workforce Development spokesman Scott Olson said. Gov. Eric Holcomb decided in May to withdraw Indiana from the programs effective in mid-June, but a Marion County judge ruled that Indiana law requires the state to procure all available federal unemployment benefits for residents. The state resumed making the payments in July after an Indiana Court of Appeals panel turned down the state’s request to immediately block the order. A different appeals court panel, however, overturned that judge’s decision in a 3-0 ruling released Tuesday, finding that the federal pandemic unemployment programs were intended to be temporary and differed from the already existing unemployment benefits system.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The University of Iowa has revised its guidance for faculty on how to handle discussions of masks and COVID-19 vaccines in the classroom this fall, walking back earlier guidelines that restricted when and how those conversations could take place. Original FAQ-style guidance for faculty was posted online Aug. 10 and removed for revision two days later. It said faculty could only make statements in the classroom related to the use of masks or vaccinations “in the context of course material discussions of health-related issues,” and faculty could not ask students or colleagues about their vaccination status. University leadership quickly met with faculty leaders after some raised issue with the guidance. The revised, far looser guidance was published Tuesday and stresses that the university strongly encourages masks and vaccinations, although neither are required. The new guidance for faculty includes a pre-written statement they can choose to include on syllabi, reinforcing that the university encourages the use of masks and vaccines. Faculty also have the option of including a personal statement outlining why they are choosing to wear a mask indoors on syllabi.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A mountain lion remembered as the best painter among all the Topeka Zoo’s animals has been euthanized. The aging male cat, Dakota, used his paws to paint, said the zoo’s animal curator, Shanna Simpson. “He loved painting and was intentional about it,” she recalled Wednesday. “He would look at the canvas and place his paw where he thought it should go. It was adorable.” Dakota also loved his keepers, eating fish and playing with balls, Simpson said. Dakota was euthanized Monday after being found to have a perforation in his gastrointestinal tract, said Jared Bednar, the zoo’s director of administration and creative. “At nearly 14 years old, Dakota lived a full life, as male mountain lions typically live to approximately 13.6 years,” Bednar said Tuesday. Dakota had lived at the Topeka Zoo since the opening in 2009 of its Kansas Carnivores exhibit, which features mountain lions and river otters in displays designed to recreate the Kansas prairie. Dakota shared his habitat with a female mountain lion, Cassy, who survives. Both had been orphaned in the wild and lived at the Denver Zoo before being transferred to Topeka, Bednar said. He said that after 10 days of declining appetite and health, Dakota stopped eating and on Monday received a computed tomography scan, which revealed air within his abdomen.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Association of Health Plans will give away a free unlimited ride wristband and a $20 gift card, while supplies last, to attendees 12 and older who receive free COVID-19 vaccines at the West Wing Health Pavilion during the Kentucky State Fair. A choice of vaccines will be offered at the State Fair, which opens Thursday and runs through Aug. 29 at the Kentucky Exposition Center. In addition to the giveaway, the “Shots Across the Bluegrass Tour” campaign will offer Medicaid members an incentive offered by their health plan. The state’s vaccine dashboard shows 2,419,442 Kentuckians have received at least one dose of a vaccine. That is 54% of the state’s population and 66% of its adult population. Children 12 to 15 years old were the most recent group to become eligible to receive a vaccine. Kentucky is requiring facial coverings in state government buildings. That means that in compliance with the policy, masks will be mandated indoors at the fair but are not required outdoors. There will be 89 hand sanitizer stations added throughout the fairgrounds for this summer’s event.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAngola: For the second year in a row, the annual rodeo of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola has been canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. The state corrections department announced the decision Wednesday. The rodeo and an accompanying arts and crafts fair had been slated for each weekend in October. The department news release said the rodeo has grown in popularity since it first started in 1965. The arena for the rodeo now can hold as many as 10,000 people. The department said it was canceling the rodeo for the health and safety of prisoners and staff as a fourth surge of COVID-19 grips the state. The release said the penitentiary staff will contact those who had already bought tickets to issue refunds.\n\nMaine\n\nBelfast: The sudden appearance of a giant rubber duck in a harbor is a whimsical whodunit that’s defied sleuths so far. The yellow waterfowl emblazoned with the word “joy” appeared in Belfast Harbor over the weekend, and it’s a mystery who put it there. Harbor Master Katherine Given told the Bangor Daily News that the 25-foot-tall duck doesn’t pose a navigational hazard, so there’s no rush to shoo it away. “Everybody loves it,” Given said. “I have no idea who owns it, but it kind of fits Belfast. A lot of people want to keep it here.” Judy Herman, of Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, stopped to snap photos Tuesday. “It’s wonderful,” she told New England Cable News. “Who would expect to see a duck in the middle of the water here?”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city wanted to meet people where they were to provide COVID-19 vaccination information, so officials turned to social media and used memes to debunk myths. And in the past few weeks, the city’s messages have gone viral with a positive outcome, said Adam Abadir, director of communications for the Baltimore City Health Department. “We can be authentic, we can be funny, and we can reach people who we wouldn’t have been able to reach otherwise,” he said. At the beginning of the pandemic, the health department used more standard communications to get information out about COVID-19, vaccines and harm-reduction principles. After social media users reached out with questions on how to communicate safety principles with friends and family, members of the health agency were scratching their heads – until a viral moment set off the light bulb. In January, Mayor Brandon Scott garnered media attention when he told a man, “Shorty, pull your mask up, man.” Video of the incident set social media ablaze. “I remember walking around the city and hearing people say, ‘Shorty, pull your mask up,’ ” Abadir said. And when an online detractor said a keto diet full of kale salads was keeping them coronavirus-free, the department turned it into a meme, too: “Salad doesn’t cure COVID, Connor.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker on Wednesday filed a nearly $1.6 billion supplemental budget, most of which would be used to provide unemployment insurance relief for employers, which he said is critical to help businesses recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The legislation relies on a roughly $5 billion budget surplus based on better-than-expected tax revenues. “Thanks to careful management of the commonwealth’s tax revenues and strong economic activity, Massachusetts has an unprecedented surplus at the close of fiscal year 2021, and this legislation ensures those resources are put to work to support local economies and small businesses,” the Republican governor said in a statement. Driven by pandemic-related claims, the state’s Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund, funded by a payroll tax on employers, is expected to be $4 billion in the red by the end of next year, according to state figures. The governor’s proposal to provide $1 billion to the fund would relieve employers’ future obligations. Business groups have been lobbying for the help. The supplemental budget bill would also finally implement the income tax charitable deduction first approved by voters nearly 20 years ago, helping charities and nonprofits who supported vulnerable populations through the pandemic.\n\nMichigan\n\nRockland: An invasive bug that could threaten the Christmas tree industry has been discovered in the western part of the state. The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said Monday that it had confirmed the presence of the balsam woolly adelgid near Rockford in Kent County. A homeowner noticed several Fraser firs declining and contacted an arborist, who spotted the infestation and alerted the state, the agency said. It’s unclear how the bug reached Michigan or how long it’s been in the state. “Human movement is one of the most common ways non-native species spread. When traveling, remember to leave firewood at home and buy it locally at your destination,” said Rob Miller, an invasive species prevention and specialist for MDARD. The Balsam woolly adelgid has been on Michigan’s invasive species watchlist for years. The sap-sucking insect damages trees, weakening or killing them over the course of many years. The balsam woolly adelgid favors true fir trees, including balsam, Fraser and concolor (white) fir. “This invasive insect is a threat to the nearly 1.9 billion balsam fir trees in Michigan’s forests,” Miller said in a news release. “As the third largest Christmas tree-growing state in the country, Michigan produces nearly 13.5 million fir trees each year.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Pollution control and natural resources officials on Wednesday released a $700 million plan to improve the drinking water for 14 Twin Cities communities whose groundwater was contaminated due to decades­long chemical disposal by 3M Co. The long-term plan, which is expected to help 174,000 residents, aims to build or improve six water treatment plants and treat 33 municipal wells while connecting nearly 300 homes to municipal water systems and providing home filtration systems to residents with private wells to remove a persistent family of chemicals known as PFAS. “This plan protects drinking water now and into the future,” said Kirk Koudelka, assistant commissioner for the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. “The result is a plan that is comprehensive, safe and sustainable, resilient, and flexible to address the growing communities’ needs and an ever-changing PFAS world.” Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances – chemicals developed by Maplewood-based 3M designed to make products resistant to heat, oil, stains, grease and water – made their way into the groundwater in the Twin Cities’ eastern metropolitan area following decades of dumping into the area’s landfills by the company.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Amid the worst pandemic in a century, the state is leading the nation in increased diabetes deaths per capita, according to a just-released Diabetes Care study. “It’s a perfect storm,” said Tim Moore, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association. “We already have an unhealthy population in Mississippi because of poverty and lower access to health care, and now we have a population that’s getting very sick.” Mississippi has seen more than 7,880 deaths from COVID-19 as of Tuesday. According to the state Department of Health, diabetes was an underlying condition in 1,347 of those deaths. Researchers found that between Jan. 1 and Nov. 3 of 2020, Mississippi – which has a 14.8% adult diabetes rate that trails only West Virginia – saw diabetes deaths rise 1.43 times higher than the historical level. That is the nation’s highest. This revelation comes as Mississippi faces its fiercest battle in the COVID-19 pandemic, with the coronavirus’ delta variant causing hospitals to be flooded with people in critical condition, including “young people, expectant mothers and newborns,” Moore said. The state’s largest hospital, the University of Mississippi Medical Center, has within just a week been forced to set up two field hospitals, one of them in a parking garage.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Leaders of the state’s two urban areas have a message for refugees from Afghanistan: You are welcome here. St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones and St. Louis County Executive Sam Page released a joint statement Tuesday saying they are “ready, willing, and prepared” to welcome at least 1,000 Afghanistan citizens through the Special Immigrant Visa program. “This plan is consistent with our collective goal to build a more welcoming and inclusive St. Louis region, no matter where they come from or any identity they hold,” the statement said. On Monday, Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas wrote on Twitter that his city “would proudly accept refugees from Afghanistan who have served bravely by our side over the past generation.” Jones, Page and Lucas are all Democrats. Pentagon officials said Tuesday that the U.S. military is coordinating with the Taliban while accelerating the airlift of Americans and Afghan allies from the Kabul airport. The Taliban swept to power after 20 years of war against the U.S.-supported Kabul government.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The Little Shell Tribal Health Department has announced that the tribe will postpone its 10th annual powwow amid the spike in COVID-19 cases. Chairman Gerald Gray said the health department, powwow committee and tribal council were involved in the decision to postpone. “We felt it was best not to take a chance with the new variant and our elders and youth,” he said in an email. “Being an indoor powwow, we felt that it could possibly turn into a super-spreader event. We believe this is the best decision to protect our communities, our families and ourselves.” The event, which was set for Aug. 27-29, would have been the tribe’s first powwow celebration since gaining federal recognition in 2019.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Labor shortages that have plagued businesses across the country have also put the squeeze on state parks, leading officials to make the unprecedented move to cut hours and services at parks across the state. Nebraska’s state parks were already short-staffed this summer, operating with only an estimated 70% of their normal workforce, state parks administrator Jim Swenson told the Lincoln Journal Star. Now, with many seasonal workers headed back to school, parks are more short-staffed than ever. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission recently released a list of hour and service reductions at many of its properties, including scaling back hours at the Family Aquatic Center and John Wayne Stables at Mahoney State Park at Ashland. Trail rides and swimming pools at Ponca and Niobrara state parks are now operating on weekends only. Opening hours for visitor centers and offices have also been cut at Wildcat Hills State Recreation Area and Nature Center, Ash Hollow State Historical Park, Fort Kearny and Lake McConaughy, among others.\n\nNevada\n\nCarlin: A monument memorializing the mining town’s first Chinese pioneers will be unveiled next month. Three years ago, the remains of 13 Chinese men were buried in the Carlin Cemetery after they were discovered in 1996 during an excavation behind a house. The dedication ceremony for the new Carlin 13 monument is planned Sept. 6 at the cemetery, followed by a visit to the Carlin Chinese Garden and museum tours, the Elko Daily Free Press reports. A local viewing also is planned of the short film “Going Home” documenting the immigrants’ journey. The bodies were exhumed and studied by archaeologists from the Nevada State Museum, U.S. Forest Service, Elko County Chapter of the Nevada Archaeological Association and anthropologists from the Smithsonian Institution. The remains were eventually moved to UNLV in Las Vegas. Research on the men was published in the 2005 book “Chinese American Death Rituals: Respecting the Ancestors.” Lijuchin “Lee” Chin, owner of Chin’s Cafe, led a campaign to bring back “the oldest citizens of Carlin” and presided over a traditional Chinese ceremony at the 2018 reburial. A year later, the Carlin 13 were recognized with a cemetery plaque in conjunction with the 150th Golden Spike Anniversary of the Transcontinental Railroad.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Department of Justice wants nearly $1 million to continue investigating and prosecuting those accused of physically and sexually abusing children at the state’s youth detention center. The current two-year budget includes $350,000 for the cost of prosecuting crimes and defending the state against civil lawsuits, but the department estimates it will need an additional $2.7 million through June 30, 2022. Of that total, more than $950,000 would go to the Criminal Justice Bureau, mostly for the investigation into abuse allegations at the Sununu Youth Services Center, previously known as the Youth Development Center, in Manchester. “Over the last 26 months, this has evolved into a complex and multi-faceted investigation,” Attorney General John Formella wrote in a recent letter to Gov. Chris Sununu, the Executive Council and lawmakers. “This case involves a very large volume of documents, involving decades of records.” Ten men were charged in April with either sexually assaulting or acting as accomplices to the assault of more than a dozen teenagers from 1994 to 2007, while an 11th man faces charges related to a pretrial facility in Concord. More than 300 men and women have come forward with allegations involving 150 staffers from 1963 to 2018.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Gamblers continue to return to the city’s casinos this summer, even as a contagious new variant of the coronavirus continues to spread, yet it was internet gambling that set a new monthly record in July. Figures released Monday by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show the nine casinos collectively won $118.6 million online in July, the best month ever for a state that was an early adopter of internet betting. The previous record was $113.7 million in March of this year. July’s figure was an increase of almost 36% from July 2020, when casinos had just begun to reopen after a 31/ 2 -month virus-related shutdown. “This could show that patrons have not lost their appetite for internet gaming products even as they return to the in-person gaming experience, or that more people overall are participating in different gaming options,” said Jane Bokunewicz, director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University, which studies the gambling industry. When in-person casino gambling and sports betting revenue is included, the casinos and three horse tracks that offer sports betting won over $450 million in July, an increase of more than 70% from a year ago.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico has retained its title as the nation’s most heavily Hispanic state, with 47.7% of respondents to the 2020 census identifying ancestry linked to Latin America and other Spanish-speaking areas. California and Texas were neck and neck as runners up, with about 39% of residents claiming Latino or Hispanic heritage. Nearly 31% of Arizona residents describe themselves as Hispanic. In New Mexico, Latino pride runs deep within a region of the U.S. where Spanish conquerors arrived in the late 1500s and Mexico governed for decades during the 19th century. The state is currently led by its third consecutive Hispanic governor. The share of New Mexico residents who identify themselves as Indigenous by race or by combined ancestry was 12.4%. Alaska was the most predominantly Native American state, followed by Oklahoma and then New Mexico. An earlier set of data released in April showed New Mexico’s population grew by 2.8% over the past decade, making it one of the slowest-growing states in the U.S. West, adding about 58,000 residents to a population of just over 2.1 million.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A wood stork typically seen in tropical and subtropical regions migrated to New York City but died 10 days after it was first spotted on Staten Island, apparently after eating a large piece of hardened foam, researchers said. The juvenile wood stork was first seen by bird researcher Anthony Ciancimino on July 31 in a saltwater marsh near an Amazon warehouse, the Staten Island Advance reports. Lawrence Pugliares, a nature photographer and administrator of a Staten Island wildlife Facebook group, received a call Aug. 9 from a group member who said the stork appeared to be choking, the newspaper reports. The bird died soon after Pugliares arrived to check on it. Jose Ramirez-Garofalo and Shannon Curley, two adjunct biology professors at the College of Staten Island, brought the stork to the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, where a necropsy revealed a piece of insular foam more than 3 feet long in the bird’s stomach. “It was in the gut of the animal, so it presumably ate it thinking it was a prey item like an eel or a snake,” Curley told the Advance. Wood storks typically breed in Florida, Georgia and coastal South Carolina. The species was put on the federal endangered species list in 1984 but downgraded to threatened in 2014.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Lawmakers on Tuesday finalized legislation to raise the minimum age to get married in the state from 14 to 16, a decision that would end the state’s status as an outlier compared to surrounding states. The Senate voted unanimously to accept House changes to the measure, which now goes to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper for his expected signature. Children who are 16 or 17 would still be required to receive parental permission or a judge’s approval to get married, and the age difference between the youth and their spouse now could be no more than four years. Current law has no minimum age gap between the spouses, and children as young as 14 can get married if they become pregnant and if a judge allows it. Parental permission has otherwise been required beginning at 16. House and Senate legislators joined women’s rights advocates and child protection groups this year to raise the marriage age. They had tried to raise it to 18 with no exceptions, but some lawmakers remained comfortable keeping certain marriages involving a child or two youths as an option. Still, marriage reform advocates and Cooper were pleased with the agreed-to higher threshold.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Active cases of COVID-19 soared above 1,000 for the first time since spring, state health officials reported Tuesday. The state’s coronavirus dashboard showed 267 new coronavirus cases. The Bismarck Tribune reports it’s the highest daily total since 303 cases on Jan. 8. Active cases statewide rose to 1,101, up 112 from Monday and more than double the total just two weeks ago. Cases are spiking nationwide due primarily to the highly contagious and fast-spreading delta variant of the coronavirus. Health officials also confirmed three more virus-related deaths Tuesday, raising North Dakota’s pandemic death toll to 1,548. Since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, North Dakota has had 113,673 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with 111,024 recoveries and 4,487 hospitalizations. Forty-four COVID-19 patients remained in hospitals Tuesday, down three from Monday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine strongly urged Tuesday that schoolchildren continue wearing masks in school at least for the beginning of the academic year to avert more drastic coronavirus measures, such as quarantines or a return to online learning. DeWine said the state doesn’t have experience with children in classes without masks, and kids can’t afford another year without in-person schooling. “The best way to make sure a child can stay in school and not have his or her classes interrupted is for that child to be vaccinated,” DeWine said during a news conference. “If that child cannot be vaccinated, the best way to ensure a good school year for that child is for that child to wear a mask while in class. ... Or having everybody in class wear a mask, that’s how we slow this down. That’s how we keep kids in the classroom.” The Republican governor noted that the 3,235 coronavirus cases reported Tuesday, along with 1,571 hospitalizations, were the most since February. School mask mandates vary widely across Ohio. But Columbus, the largest district with about 50,000 students, is requiring them, as are Cincinnati and Cleveland schools, at least for the beginning of the year.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Indian gaming industry paid $167million in exclusivity fees to the state last fiscal year, a record amount that signals the industry’s rebound. The coronavirus pandemic prompted all of Oklahoma’s tribally operated casinos to shutter within days of each other in March 2020. Most remained closed for two months or longer. The shutdown cut off a key revenue source for tribal governments, as well as the state. One year later, business is back, according to executives gathered Tuesday for the annual Indian gaming conference in Oklahoma City. State revenues from gaming increased more than 35% between the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, which end in June, according to figures provided by Matthew Morgan, who chairs the Oklahoma Indian Gaming Association. The growth reflects pent-up demand and limited options to get out elsewhere, said Jessica Feil, vice president of the American Gaming Association. Operators now are grappling with how to maintain the success and continue to expand. Morgan credited a unified pandemic response among tribal leaders as the reason most casinos were able to reopen by the end of June 2020. The group put together safety recommendations, such as requiring face masks, that can be adjusted in response to the spread of COVID-19.\n\nOregon\n\nSeaside: Scores of live sand dollars began washing ashore on the Oregon coast Sunday, mystifying locals. The Seaside Aquarium posted photos of the sand dollars to Facebook, reporting that thousands washed up with the afternoon high tides on the south end of Seaside Beach, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. “At this time, we do not know what has caused this, and these types of incidents usually have several contributing factors,” the aquarium wrote on Facebook. The post received hundreds of comments, many from concerned people who urged locals to rush out and throw the creatures back into the water. However, sand dollars can only live a few minutes out of the ocean, the aquarium said. Sand dollars are a species of sea urchin covered in tube feet and spines that they use to move and eat. In rough waters they lie flat partially buried in the sand, but in calmer waters they stand upright like wheels. The creatures feed on algae and other small bits of organic material.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A judge has ruled that a statue of Christopher Columbus can remain in south Philadelphia, reversing the city’s decision to remove it after the explorer became a focus of protesters amid nationwide demonstrations against racial injustice. Common Pleas Court Judge Paula Patrick said last year’s decision to remove the now-boarded-up statue from Marconi Plaza was unsupported by law and based on insufficient evidence. “It is baffling to this court as to how the city of Philadelphia wants to remove the statue without any legal basis. The city’s entire argument and case is devoid of any legal foundation,” Patrick wrote. The ruling Tuesday overturns a decision in September by a city licensing board that upheld a July 2020 decision by the city historical commission to remove the 144-year-old statue. The judge wrote that the city failed to provide an adequate opportunity for public input about its future. A city representative expressed disappointment and said officials were exploring all options “including a possible appeal.” Attorney George Bochetto, who represents the Friends of Marconi Plaza, said the plaintiffs were “ecstatic.” He said he would immediately seek an order to remove a wooden box constructed by city crews around the statue after clashes between protesters and residents.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s education council has voted to reject any district’s back-to-school plans that don’t include mask mandates, essentially requiring face coverings for all K-12 students this fall, despite being told by a state Education Department lawyer that it did not have the authority to do so. After the Rhode Island Council on Elementary and Secondary Education made its unanimous decision during a meeting Tuesday night, Education Commissioner Angelica Infante-Green said she will follow the directive, WPRI-TV reports. “They’re my bosses; yes, I have to follow the council’s direction,” she said. “Basically, what was said tonight is we will take our chances with any lawsuits that may happen.” The decision comes as the delta variant is being blamed for another wave of coronavirus cases across the state. Department of Education lawyer Anthony Cottone told the council before the vote that it does not have the authority to mandate masks in school districts statewide. Only the Legislature by statute or the governor through executive order can do so, he said. Democratic Gov. Dan McKee has recommended masks for schoolchildren but has resisted issuing a mask mandate, saying the issue should be left up to school districts, many of which have already issued mask requirements.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Anyone with a permit to carry a concealed weapon in the state no longer has to keep their weapon hidden under clothing. Gov. Henry McMaster held a ceremonial signing last week for a new state law allowing people to carry pistols in the open. The law still requires a permit obtained in a training class to carry a pistol in public, but it eliminates the need to keep a holster hidden under a pant leg or jacket. The legislation passed this spring also eliminates a $50 permit fee to get a concealed weapons permit and lowers the number of bullets that someone must fire at a target in an accuracy test to get a permit from 50 to 25 shots. Requirements remain that a permit holder be 21 or over, take eight hours of training and pass a background check that includes fingerprinting. “This is a good day for South Carolina. It is a happy day for law-abiding citizens,” McMaster said Friday at the Palmetto State Armory in Greenville, joined by Second Amendment advocates. The South Carolina House this year passed a bill allowing anyone who can legally own a gun to carry one openly. That proposal is now in the Senate. The law was opposed by State Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel as well as police chiefs and sheriffs in some of the state’s largest population centers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Tattoo shops are booming, with waits up to six months long for an appointment, as the economic reopening has customers looking to get the ink they’ve delayed. On the most recent Friday the 13th – traditionally a busy day for tattoo studios, as they draw walk-in clients seeking a quick “flash” tattoo preset design that’s on sale – Siouxperior Ink was busy filling walk-ins and completing hours­long work for clients who had booked appointments months ahead of time. It was a stark contrast to the lack of traffic the shop had in its scheduling book last year. During the slow pandemic months, owner and tattoo artist Andrew Thomas created extra Halloween masks, and artist Mike Adaver painted metal striping on cars for side income. “A lot of people, they would cancel appointments because it’s like, ‘Now I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’m laid off from work,’ ” Thomas said. “It’s like, ‘Hey we understand. It was rough on everybody.’ ” Now the shop is booked, a sentiment echoed across Sioux Falls as many tattoo studios have seen a rush of people booking appointments into the end of the year. Some studios have even closed their books to new clients.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials say five counties will no longer require emissions testing of vehicles early next year under new federal approval, though the capital city area won’t be among them. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation said the Environmental Protection Agency has approved a revision to the state’s air quality plan that allows for Hamilton, Rutherford, Sumner, Williamson and Wilson counties to eliminate their testing. The requirement will end Jan. 14, 2022. Nashville-Davidson County is forging ahead under a state law that offers an option for local agencies with their own air pollution control program to continue vehicle emission testing. The Republican-supermajority General Assembly passed legislation in 2018 to seek federal approval to eliminate vehicle emissions testing.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: As COVID-19 cases rise, businesses could be at risk of being punished by the state if they try to require customers to show proof they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19. In its recent regular session, the Legislature passed a measure that prohibits businesses from requiring proof of immunization. The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, which regulates alcohol sales, posted on its website this week that it may require compliance with the law as a condition of holding a liquor license or other authorization. The agency said it has not taken action against any businesses to date but has requested to meet with business operators where “potential noncompliance could be taking place.” The agency’s statement came after Austin restaurants Launderette and Fresa’s, which share the same ownership group, announced earlier in the week that they would require anyone dining indoors at their restaurants to provide proof of at least a first round of vaccinations against COVID-19. The restaurants’ social media posts said indoor diners would have to wear masks when not seated at a table, though outdoor diners would not need proof of vaccination, nor would they have to wear masks.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: After a tumultuous year of limited in-person performances, the Utah Symphony has reemerged with the “Forever Mighty” Tour, visiting many of the state’s national parks and landscapes and ending Saturday in Hurricane with hundreds of attendees despite the threat of harsh rains. The symphony previously held the “Mighty 5 Tour” in 2014 and the “Great American Road Trip Tour” in 2017, both with performances in similar settings. This year’s tour aimed to promote responsible recreation amid record visitation and celebrating togetherness after more than a year of limited live entertainment, organizers said. “We have exceptional performers and musicians in Utah, and it’s important for everyone to have the opportunity to experience them live and in-person,” Jill Remington Love, executive director of the Utah Department of Cultural and Community Engagement, said in a May press release. With heavy cloud cover as nearby St. George was hit with monsoon rains Saturday night, hundreds gathered on lawn chairs, blankets or reserved white chairs in the grassy area 25 miles from Zion National Park. Before Hurricane, the tour traveled 500 miles through rural communities, stopping in Cache Valley on Tuesday, Helper on Wednesday, Bryce Canyon National Park on Thursday and Kanab’s Angels Landing on Friday.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Environmental groups allege in a lawsuit that a state agency has failed to protect endangered bats when spraying pesticides to deter mosquitoes. The Vermont Natural Resources Council and Center for Biological Diversity accused the Agency of Natural Resources of endangering five bat species while spraying for bugs – a claim one official said has no legal or scientific merit. “If our scientists had credible scientific evidence that the mosquito control district insecticide use was having an impact on the bat population, we would certainly take action,” said Louis Porter, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife. The Indiana bat, northern long-eared bat, little brown bat, eastern small-footed bat and tricolored bat are protected by Vermont’s Protection of Endangered Species Act. Mason Overstreet, an attorney at Vermont Law School’s Environmental Advocacy Clinic, said in a statement that “poorly regulated pesticide spraying is putting the state’s threatened and endangered bats at risk.” The environmental groups said the spraying is done at night when bats are hunting for insects. The bats are exposed to the toxins when they inhale or eat insects that have been sprayed. Porter said the state has “done as much or more as any state in the country to protect and restore threatened and endangered bats.”\n\nVirginia\n\nManassas: The U.S. Treasury Department is releasing a shipment of tiles that were intended for a northern Virginia mosque but were confiscated at Dulles International Airport after they were determined to have violated sanctions on Iran. Word of the release came through the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which released a letter dated Aug. 16 from the Treasury Department to attorneys representing the Manassas Mosque. “We welcome this decision as a reaffirmation of our nation’s respect for religious freedom and diversity. Americans of all religious backgrounds should have access to the symbols of their faith, whatever the origin of those symbols,” CAIR’s national deputy director, Edward Ahmed Mitchell, said in a news release. The 750 pounds of tiles were a gift from a mosque in the Iranian city of Qom to the Virginia mosque and include verses from the Quran. Imam Abolfazl Nahidian said the custom-made tiles were shipped in June and were to be used in construction of a new mosque a few miles away. Nahidian said he paid no money for them, but a Customs and Border Protection officer at the airport blocked the mosque from claiming the tiles, citing the sanctions. A letter from Customs and Border Protection had initially informed the mosque that the tiles must be shipped back or destroyed.\n\nWashington\n\nFord: Strong winds on Monday led to fire growth in central and eastern Washington that prompted new mandatory evacuations and burned homes, fire officials said. A fire northwest of Spokane that started Sunday near the town of Ford caused residents to scramble to leave their homes Monday, The Spokesman-Review reports. Authorities called for Ford residents and those in nearby communities to immediately evacuate as the Ford Corkscrew Fire threatened hundreds of buildings. Hannah Roach, 18, was with her six other family members as well as pets, including geckos, lizards, dogs and birds packed into their pickup truck, as they stopped for groceries in Loon Lake. Behind her, smoke plumes and glowing orange flames crept over the hillside near where her family lived. “We didn’t actually hear about the fire. We saw it first,” Roach said. “We decided to get ahead of it.” The fire has damaged or destroyed 20 buildings – including eight homes – and has burned through more than 20 square miles, officials said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday authorized the use of federal funds to help with firefighting costs for the Ford Corkscrew fire, officials said. The blaze’s cause is under investigation.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia University said Tuesday that it is requiring masks to be worn in classrooms and labs for the next 30 days, citing several factors, including that not enough students and employees have submitted proof that they have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The university announced the change effective Wednesday, the first day of classes on the Morgantown campus, regardless of a person’s vaccination status. While WVU does not require its students and employees to be vaccinated for COVID-19, the university had set a vaccine verification goal of 80% by Sept. 1. Students, faculty and staff on all campuses are required to provide either vaccine verification or a negative coronavirus test result by Friday. But the rates are well short of that goal. So far just 68.4% of students and 67.5% of faculty and staff on the Morgantown campus have submitted their verification paperwork, with the rates being much lower on the Beckley and Keyser campuses, the school said. In addition, many had not completed a required COVID-19 education module by a Tuesday deadline. WVU also cited the anticipated recommendation of booster shots for long-lasting protection against the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Hundreds or even thousands of Afghan refugees could be headed to Fort McCoy for processing, according to Pentagon officials. Afghans are scrambling to find ways to escape after the Taliban overran their country over the past week, initiating the blitz with U.S. troops weeks away from the Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline. Garry Reid, director of the Department of Defense’s Afghanistan Crisis Action Group, told reporters Monday that the U.S. Army is working to set up reception centers for Afghan refugees at Fort McCoy in western Wisconsin and Fort Bliss in Texas. He said the Army is preparing to receive as many as 22,000 refugees at the two bases as well as at Fort Lee in Virginia. Fort McCoy spokeswoman Tonya Townsell said Monday that the base, located between Tomah and Sparta, has been notified it will receive refugees and is prepared to house them in soldiers’ barracks as well as provide them with food and medical care. Gov. Tony Evers issued a statement saying the state stands ready to assist Afghans seeking refuge. The last time Fort McCoy served as a refugee center was in 1980, when the base housed 14,000 Cubans who fled from Fidel Castro’s government.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: The park won’t implement a timed-entry system at least in the next year, but it’s possible eventually, the park’s superintendent said. Yellowstone is among the busiest national parks during the summer. Other busy parks, including Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, have implemented timed entry, which requires visitors to reserve a time when they may enter. The goal is to reduce auto traffic, which at Yellowstone’s busier entrances can stretch up to a mile during summer, the Cody Enterprise reports. Timed entry in Yellowstone would most likely be limited to the South entrance north of Grand Teton National Park and West entrance near West Yellowstone, Montana, Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly said Friday. The gate west of Cody and the Montana gates outside Gardiner and Cooke City are less busy. A decision on timed entry would be made far in advance, after consultation with the public and likely coordination with Grand Teton, Sholly said. “I don’t think it needs to be implemented next year or the immediate future,” Sholly said. Yellowstone has been setting tourism records this year after being shut down at the start of the 2020 summer season due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/30/obamas-break-ground-missing-zebras-planet-word-bathrooms-news-around-states/119000794/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBrighton: Police have recovered a horse-drawn carriage that was stolen from a church parking lot near Birmingham ahead of a funeral. The carriage and the trailer it was on were found Monday behind a home about 20 miles from the church in Brighton where it was taken, al.com reported. Brighton Police Chief Larry Woods told the news site multiple people are in custody in connection with the theft. The owner of the carriage, Frank Tate, said it was valued at more than $15,000. His company, Magic Tours, provides carriages for funerals, downtown Birmingham tours and other special occasions. Tate told al.com he left the carriage in the parking lot of St. Mark AME Church to pick up horses. He planned to use it later on Saturday to take a family to a funeral, but when he returned about 9 a.m., it was gone. He said the carriage would be hard to hide. “It’s a distinctive carriage,’’ Tate said. “Nobody else around here has carriages.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: U.S. prosecutors have charged three men with leaving a special viewing platform and getting too close to bears in Alaska’s Katmai National Park and Preserve. The U.S. attorney’s office filed charges last week in the August 2018 incident. Spokesperson Lisa Houghton said the office doesn’t discuss the timing of cases. “Every case is unique, and it takes varying amounts of time to bring forth criminal charges,” she said by email. The remote park on the northern Alaska Peninsula protects some of the highest densities of bears in the world and requires visitors to abide by special rules. Mature male brown bears at Katmai can weigh up to 900 pounds, the park said. The charges alleged the men entered a closed area of the park by leaving an authorized viewing area and wading into the Brooks River when bears were feeding on salmon in the nearby falls. The U.S. attorney’s office said two of the men are from Alaska and one is from New Mexico. An online court records system did not show attorneys for the men who could comment on their behalf.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday endorsed former television broadcaster Kari Lake in the Republican race for governor. Trump retains a strong following among many Republicans and his endorsement catapults the former news anchor into clear front-runner status in the crowded GOP primary field. Lake is a political newcomer who left her job in March and launched her bid for the Republican nomination for governor in 2022 in June. She had been widely seen as a possible candidate and has criticized a media landscape that she contends needs more balance.Trump announced his endorsement via email because he remains banned from Twitter and other social media sites following the Jan. 6 incidents at the U.S. Capitol. He said Lake is strong on crime, the border and supports gun rights. He also took a shot at Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who is term-limited. Using the expression for “Republican in name only,” Trump said “she will do a far better job than RINO Governor Doug Ducey.” Ducey certified President Joe Biden’s victory in Arizona over Trump last year despite pressure from the former president to overturn the election results.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday said he allowed the state’s public health emergency for the coronavirus pandemic to end, saying he didn’t need any additional powers to respond to it. Hutchinson told reporters he didn’t seek an extension from the Legislature for the emergency, which expired Monday. But Hutchinson cautioned that the state is still feeling the effects of COVID-19, which the Health Department on Tuesday said had claimed another 21 lives in the state. “I need to emphasize that we are still in a pandemic. We still have 20 plus people dying every day because of COVID,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news conference. “Just because the technical emergency was not extended does not mean we’re not still in a very serious situation with the pandemic and the actions we need to take.” Arkansas lifted most of its virus restrictions, including a statewide mask mandate, and ended its emergency declaration last spring. But Hutchinson in July reinstated the emergency as the state saw a surge in cases due to the delta variant of the virus. The Health Department said the state’s death toll from COVID-19 now totals 7,651. The state reported its cases rose by 800 to 493,920 total since the pandemic began.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State Treasurer Fiona Ma repeatedly shared hotel rooms with employees, a practice she said saved money but that business experts contend crosses an ethical line and can lead to lawsuits like one Ma now faces, the Sacramento Bee reported Tuesday. Judith Blackwell, the former head of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, sued Ma in July, alleging sexual harassment, racial discrimination and wrongful termination. Ma said the allegations are without merit. Records obtained by the Bee show Ma shared a hotel room with her chief of staff, Genevieve Jopanda, 13 times over two years. She also stayed with four other aides at a three-bedroom property on a trip. There’s no policy in the state’s human resources manual on whether managers and staff can share hotel rooms. Ma said her work as state treasurer frequently requires her and aides to travel across the state and that the hotel rooms were shared to save money.\n\nColorado\n\nSilverthorne: The residents of several hundred homes have been evacuated or warned to be ready to leave because of a wildfire burning in Colorado’s north-central mountains. Evacuations were first ordered Monday night near Silverthorne shortly after the fire was reported on U.S. Forest Service land. The Ptarmigan Fire was burning on about 60 acres around midday Tuesday, after growing about 40 acres overnight, an amount which surprised officials, Dillon District Ranger Adam Bianchi said, the Summit Daily News reported. Air tankers and a helicopter were initially used to try to slow the fire’s growth and prevent it from moving downhill toward residential areas because it was considered too dangerous to send in firefighters on the ground. Officials have some hope that forecasted cooler weather in the mountains, where it has been dropping below freezing at night, and possible rain and snow in the coming days will also help.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state Senate voted Tuesday to extend Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s emergency powers for the sixth time during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite pushback from Republican lawmakers who argued the state is no longer in crisis. “It all needs to end,” said Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott. “No one can deny that there’s no public health emergency and that individual, local and legislative powers must be restored.” Yet Senate President Pro Tempore Martin Looney, D-New Haven, said state legislators have a “much stronger reason” to extend the public health and civil preparedness emergencies than back in July, the last time Lamont’s powers were extended until Sept. 30. He noted how the state’s COVID positivity rate and number of hospitalizations have increased since then because of the delta variant. The resolution to extend the governor’s powers until Feb. 15 passed 18-15 on Tuesday with two Democrats joining the Republicans in opposition. Three senators were absent. The vote came day after the House of Representatives voted 80-60 in favor of extending Lamont’s renewed declaration of public health and civil preparedness emergencies until early February, when the General Assembly’s regular legislative session is scheduled to open. Democrats control both chambers.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: All teachers and school staff in Delaware will be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing, Gov. John Carney said Tuesday. The requirement announced by Carney, the Division of Public Health and Department of Education will be formally issued by emergency regulation and takes effect Nov. 1. The requirement also applies to contractors and volunteers who work in K-12 public and private schools. The top priority has been to get all students back in school this fall and the mandate will help minimize disruptions, Carney said in a statement. “There’s no better way to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and keep all Delaware children in their classrooms, than to get vaccinated,” Carney said. “These vaccines are safe and extremely protective against COVID-19 infection and serious illness. I encourage all Delawareans to get your shot and help us finally put an end to this pandemic.” The Delaware State Education Association, the state’s largest teacher’s union, supports the decision and urges members to get vaccinated, according to a statement from President Stephanie Ingram. The union’s goal is to keep educators and students in school while protecting their health, Ingram said. Since some have concerns about the vaccine, weekly testing is a “reasonable alternative,” she said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The city’s new Planet Word museum is being lauded for its lavatories, WUSA-TV reported. Cintas, the cleaning product and services company, selected 10 places across the country for the cleanest, most innovative commodes, and Planet Word is among the finalists. “Planet Word is flush with bathroom humor,” said founder Ann Friedman, reading a slogan from one of the walls. She has a bit of a potty mouth. “Here’s our take on Shakespeare. ‘Farting is such sweet sorrow,’” she said, opening a stall and revealing the slogan painted behind a porcelain throne.The toilets on the second floor of the downtown museum are ripe with ribald literary references. “To pee or not to pee, that is the question,” is emblazoned in another stall. Then there’s “If at first you don’t succeed, flush, flush again.” and “I stink, therefore I am.” The museum has five floors, with restrooms on each, each with its own theme. “Here we have euphemisms for No. 1 and No. 2,” she said on the main floor. They include: “Take a whiz”...and others maybe we shouldn’t mention. Even Friedman’s a little embarrassed by some of the bathroom humor. Although when she was looking for donors, the phrase, “Take the Browns to the Super Bowl,” may have helped her close the deal with a guy from Ohio.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: A group of South Florida businessmen sued the federal government Monday in hopes of overturning a gambling agreement Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed with the Seminole Tribe. The suit filed against the Department of the Interior in federal court in Washington claims the agreement illegally expands gambling in Florida. Among the plaintiffs are developer Armando Codina and car dealer Norman Braman. The department approved the deal in August. It allows the Seminole Tribe to operate sports betting and add roulette and craps to its seven Florida casinos, with the state potentially receiving $20 billion over the next 30 years. But the lawsuit claimed that the state constitution requires voters approve an expansion of gambling. The state Legislature approved the deal in May. It is the second suit filed challenging the gambling compact.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Logistics company Radial Inc. plans to hire 4,000 entry-level workers outside Atlanta this year ahead of the busy holiday season, the company announced Tuesday. The new employees will work out of two Atlanta-area fulfillment centers – one in Locust Grove and one in Buford – to process online orders from various different brands, Radial said in a news release. The company then plans to promote more than one-third of the seasonal employees to full-time positions, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. According to the statement, research conducted by Radial shows that 65% of shoppers plan to spend either increased or similar amounts of money on online purchases this year compared to 2020. The site director of the Locust Grove fulfillment center, Eric Narvaez, did not disclose how much the positions would be paid but said the pay would be similar to that of other large companies like Home Depot and Amazon, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. regulators on Tuesday banned swimming with Hawaii’s spinner dolphins to protect the nocturnal animals from people seeking close encounters with the playful species. Swimming with dolphins is a popular tourist activity in Hawaii. Several companies offer tours that take swimmers to areas frequented by dolphins with the aim of giving them an opportunity to get in the water with the animals. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration rule under the Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits swimming with or getting within 50 yards of a spinner dolphin that is within 2 nautical miles of the shore of the main Hawaiian Islands. The rule applies to boats, canoes, stand-up paddleboards, drones or other objects. NOAA also is proposing a regulation that would prohibit entering certain areas between 6 a.m. and 3 p.m. in parts of the Big Island and Maui that are considered essential daytime habitats for spinner dolphins. Spinner dolphins hunt in offshore waters at night. During the day, they use areas close to shore that have optimal environmental conditions to socialize, nurture their young, hide from predators and rest in preparation for nightly hunting. Hawaii’s spinner dolphins get their name from their habit of leaping in the air and spinning around. Some scientists say such behavior is not always playfulness and can instead be an attempt to alert others to danger.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Schools should set up confidential tip lines that can be used by students and others to report concerning behavior as a way to prevent school shootings, a report reviewing an eastern Idaho school shooting said. That’s one of 29 recommendations in the report released Monday by the Idaho State Board of Education following a school shooting at Rigby Middle School in May. Authorities said a sixth grade girl injured two other students and a custodian after pulling a handgun from her backpack and firing multiple rounds inside and outside the school. She was ultimately disarmed by a teacher. The report said students saw behavioral changes in the accused attacker, but that didn’t come to light until after the shooting. The report, made by the School Safety and Security Program, noted that the behavior change was not apparent to school staff because the girl was in her first year at Rigby Middle School after moving up from elementary school. The same school had another incident last week when authorities said a 13-year-old girl brought a gun to school, but was disarmed by a school resource officer in the bathroom, and no one was injured. Immediately after that incident, Jefferson School District Superintendent Chad Martin banned backpacks at two middle schools and two high schools.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: After five years of legal fights, gentrification concerns and a federal review, Barack and Michelle Obama dug shovels into the ground Tuesday during a celebratory groundbreaking on the Obama Presidential Center. Construction on the center along Lake Michigan, near the Obama family home and where the former president started his political career on Chicago’s South Side, officially began last month. Standing near an excavator and other heavy equipment, Obama described how the city’s South Side shaped him, first as a community organizer, then as a husband, father and elected official. He said the center was one way of giving back and he hoped it would bring an economic boost to the area and inspire a future generation of leaders. “We want this center to be more than a static museum or a source of archival research. It won’t just be a collection of campaign memorabilia or Michelle’s ballgowns, although I know everybody will come see those,” he joked. “It won’t just be an exercise in nostalgia or looking backwards. We want to look forward.” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and several city aldermen were among the few people allowed at the event, which was streamed online to limit crowds amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The presidential center will sit on 19 acres of the 540-acre of Jackson Park, named for the nation’s seventh president, Andrew Jackson.\n\nIndiana\n\nTerre Haute: A historical marker has been dedicated in western Indiana in remembrance of a Black man lynched about 120 years ago by a white mob. George Ward’s descendants, Terre Haute residents and Mayor Duke Bennett were among those at Sunday’s ceremony in Fairbanks Park, the (Terre Haute) Tribune-Star reported. George Ward was arrested in 1901 in the slaying of a white teacher, Ida Finkelstein. The mob took him from the Vigo County Jail and struck him in the head with a sledgehammer, said Terry Ward, adding that the attackers grabbed his great-grandfather along a bridge and bystanders pelted him with sticks. “Imagine the pain and the fear and no one comes to your aid,” Terry Ward told those at the dedication. George Ward then was hanged from a former wagon bridge. His body later was cut down and burned. “George Ward was denied due process for a crime for which he was accused,” Terry Ward said. “He was killed by a mob that acted as judge, jury and executioner.” The dedication was part of the national Community Remembrance Project, which recognizes lynching victims.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The longtime president of the Des Moines police officers’ union sent explicit photos to four female colleagues but retired before he could face discipline and wasn’t criminally charged, the city confirmed late Tuesday. In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, four Des Moines Police Department employees alleged that they were sent unsolicited photos by Des Moines Police Bargaining Unit Association President Stew Barnes in 2019 and 2020, including many of himself naked. The department let Barnes, 61, retire in August 2020 with full benefits despite “overwhelming evidence” of his harassment of co-workers and employees of a tanning salon and a credit union, the lawsuit claimed. Department leaders recognized him at a retirement banquet in October 2020. Iowa law allows the state pension system to deny retirement benefits to members who are not “in good standing,” including those who face pending disciplinary proceedings for misconduct. The lawsuit argued that Barnes should have been disqualified from benefits and faced a criminal investigation, alleging he was using police resources “to find and stalk women” and that his victims were ready to cooperate. A statement through the city manager’s office defended the department and the city’s handling of the internal investigation but did not explain the lack of a criminal investigation. Barnes confirmed to have sent the inappropriate photos and resigned his job before the inquiry concluded, the statement said. Police Chief Dana Wingert later determined the misconduct occurred and that it would have been a fireable offense.\n\nKansas\n\nSanta Fe:John Freeman Colt, a convicted sex offender who escaped June 30 from Larned State Hospital, was captured Monday night in Wayne County, Utah. Colt’s arrest came after residents recognized him from a wanted poster they saw on TV and contacted the U.S. Marshals Service and the Wayne County Sheriff’s Office, the marshals service said in a news release Tuesday. “As sheriff’s deputies were staging in a parking lot near the target house, they saw Colt roll by on his blue motorcycle and gave chase,” the marshals service said. “Colt eventually decided to give up.” Colt was being held Tuesday in Utah awaiting his return to Kansas, according to the news release.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State police said new regional driver testing branches have been created in Madisonville and Owensboro. The Madisonville office serves Caldwell, Crittenden, Hopkins, McLean, Muhlenberg and Webster counties, and the Owensboro site is for residents of Daviess, Hancock, and Ohio counties. Gov. Andy Beshear said the regional testing locations offer more efficient services. Driver testing was offered starting Monday in both locations. Appointments can be made online and are available Monday through Friday at the state police website. Appointments are required for a permit, driver’s license or commercial driver’s license test. Officials are working to open the remaining regional offices statewide by June 30.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: Five people were injured in an explosion at a chemical plant, news outlets reported. The explosion at the Westlake petrochemical plant near Lake Charles was reported late Monday night, Louisiana State Police spokesman Derek Senegal said. He said five workers were taken to a hospital, but their conditions were not immediately known. A fire at the site is now out, and the cause of the blast is under investigation. KPLC-TV reported that the unit where the explosion occurred is used in the production of ethylene and was undergoing maintenance at the time.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The owner of four hydroelectric dams on the Kennebec River sued two Maine agencies alleging they improperly cooperated on fish passage regulations that impact the future of the dams and fish populations. The lawsuit filed in Kennebec Superior Court is the latest brought by Brookfield Renewable Power, a subsidiary of a large Canadian company that owns many of the dams in the state, the Portland Press Herald reported. The lawsuit contended the Department of Marine Resources improperly helped the Department of Environmental Protection draft fish passage policies, claiming that the cooperation between state agencies violates a 1993 settlement between the dams’ then-owners, environmental groups and state and federal bodies. The company argued under that settlement, disputes about fish passage standards related to the dams must be resolved through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which licenses dams. The Shawmut dam is under review for FERC relicensing and must get water quality approval from Maine as part of that process.\n\nMaryland\n\nUpper Marlboro: Five zebras that escaped from a farm nearly a month ago are still on the loose. They got away Aug. 31 from a private farm near Upper Marlboro, about 20 miles southeast of the nation’s capital, The Washington Post reported. Prince George’s County animal control officials told the newspaper the caretakers have been trying to lure the animals into a fenced feeding area ever since. Zebras have to be corralled to be captured, not chased. Three of the animals have been traveling together while the other two have been in a pair, officials said. Residents have been sharing stories of zebra sightings on social media. Joshua DuBois, who worked for the White House during the Obama administration, tweeted Sept. 19 that he and his wife dressed up their three children in zebra-print outfits to go “zebra hunting.” He shared a video and photos of when they found the animals. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton – who represents Washington in Congress – joked in a Sept. 10 statement that despite her general support for freedom and her recent opposition to fences, referring to the fences around the U.S. Capitol, she was not responsible for setting the zebras free.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMelrose: A home seriously damaged by fire has been listed on the market with an asking price of $399,000. WBZ-TV reported Monday that the listing for the home in Melrose, a suburb of Boston, is evidence of how hot the housing market is. In August, industry groups listed the median sale price of single-family homes in the state to be between $535,000 and $552,000. The online listing for the burned three-bedroom, 1,857-square foot home starts with a call out to contractors, and continues: “House is in need of a complete renovation or potential tear down and rebuild. Buyer to do due diligence. House being sold as is.” The house suffered an intense fire in August that blew out the front windows, which are now boarded up. The Boston Globe reported that firefighters had to tear out parts of the walls and ceiling of the home to extinguish the blaze.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A young Detroit-area man who snapped a photo of a gang chart while cleaning an FBI office and posted it on social media was sentenced Tuesday to probation. Publicizing the chart could have caused a “bloodbath,” said U.S. District Judge Linda Parker. Parker said it was a serious case, but she turned down the government’s request that Anthony Cassani be locked up for three months. “I don’t think you need to be incarcerated to understand the gravity of what you’ve done here,” the judge said. In 2020, Cassani, 22, was cleaning an FBI office to reduce the risk of COVID-19 when he saw a chart of Detroit gang members. He admits taking a picture of the chart with his phone and posting it on Snapchat. It could have gone “horribly wrong” if “search warrants were executed and the targets of the search warrant were prepared for the agents to come in,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Eaton Brown said. “We’re thankful that’s not what happened.” Cassani pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. He apologized and acknowledged the potential harm.\n\nMinnesota\n\nChaska: Tensions at a suburban Twin Cities school board meeting over a new mask mandate escalated to a physical scuffle. The Eastern Carver County Schools said Monday all students would need to wear a mask through at least the middle of next month because of a rise in coronavirus cases. At a meeting Monday night in Chaska, speakers lined up to talk about their support or opposition to the mandate. A couple of men got physical over what appeared to be a disagreement about someone taking a photo. Several other men intervened to separate the two and police were summoned, video from WCCO-TV showed. Some parents said the mask mandate is causing bullying concerns on both sides of the issue. Many parents said they want some sort of protocol about what they should do if their child is exposed, and if there is a required quarantine period.\n\nMississippi\n\nBay St. Louis: Three Mississippi cities and Birmingham, Alabama have been awarded grants to improve their train stations ahead of the planned return of Amtrak service to the Gulf Coast. Bay St. Louis, Gulfport and Pascagoula received a little more than $700,000 total, and another $250,000 went to Birmingham, the Biloxi Sun Herald reported. The newspaper said the grants were announced Monday by the Southern Rail Commission. The money will fund improvements to amenities such as lighting, sidewalks and parking areas. The grants require an equivalent matching contribution from local officials. Amtrak said it hopes to resume operating between New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama in January. The region has been without passenger service since Hurricane Katrina badly damaged tracks and equipment in 2005. Before that, passenger trains ran between the cities three times a week. The start of service is still pending a decision by the federal Surface Transportation Board on Amtrak’s right of access to freight lines.\n\nMissouri\n\nStockton: A southwest Missouri prosecutor said he has charged five employees of a private Christian boarding school with abusing students – far fewer than the number of charges recommended by state investigators. The five employees of the Agape Boarding School near Stockton were charged with a total of 13 third-degree felony assault counts, Cedar County Prosecuting Attorney Ty Gaither said. The charges came after the Missouri State Highway Patrol investigated allegations of abuse at the school. Based on that investigation, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt recommended prosecuting 22 employees with 65 counts on behalf of 36 victims, including felonies for abuse of a child and tampering with a victim, and misdemeanors for endangering the welfare of a child and failure to report child abuse. After Gaither said last week that he planned to charge far fewer employees than recommended, Schmitt asked Gov. Mike Parson to remove his office from the investigation because he didn’t believe Gaither intended to “seek justice” for all the victims. Gaither said this office believed “these to be the appropriate charges under the fact of the investigation,” The Kansas City Star reported. Although Gaither asked for the attorney general’s assistance in the case, Missouri law gives county prosecutors sole authority in deciding what charges are filed.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Federal authorities are investigating a small plane crash that killed a couple and critically injured their son in southern Montana on Sunday, authorities said. Robby and Pam Stephens died at the crash south of Billings and son Riley was taken to a hospital with critical injuries, officials said. Responders arrived to find the plane on fire in a wooded area near the Blain Airstrip, Yellowstone County Sheriff Mike Linder said. According to preliminary information, the Beech 35S plane crashed at about 7:30 p.m. Sunday, National Transportation Safety Board spokesperson Keith Holloway said. The investigation will include looking at any air traffic communications, radar data, weather reports and a review of the plane’s maintenance records and medical and flight history of the pilot, Holloway said. A typical NTSB investigation can take between one and two years to complete, he said.\n\nNebraska\n\nMaywood: A woman was arrested over the weekend in southwestern Nebraska after being accused of pulling a gun after a store clerk refused to sell her beer, authorities said. The incident happened shortly before noon Saturday, when a business in the village of Maywood called the Frontier County Sheriff’s Office to report that a woman who appeared to be high on drugs pulled a gun when she wasn’t allowed to buy beer, KRVN reported. Deputies and the Nebraska State Patrol later stopped a vehicle on Highway 23 in which the woman was believed to be riding. Officers arrested Dixie Kaiser, 39, of Wellfleet, on suspicion of making terroristic threats. Kaiser was being held in the Seward County Jail on $15,000 bond.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Mt. Rose Ski Tahoe is launching the largest capital improvement project in the history of the resort with a $7.5 million expansion that includes a new high-speed chairlift and trail additions to help skier traffic patterns. Resort officials said the expansion including the new chairlift in the Lakeview mountain zone near the Mount Rose Highway connecting Reno to Lake Tahoe is expected to be completed ahead of the 2022-23 winter season. Mike Pierce, the resort’s marketing director, said strong ridership combined with COVID-19 related lift restrictions made it necessary to increase Lakeview’s lift capacity last season. The old lift has been accessing a part of the mountain with views of the alpine lake for 41 years. Improvements already under way include a $1 million investment in snowmaking infrastructure, and slope grading to reduce obstacles and allow opening of terrain with as little as a foot of packed snow, Pierce said. A 60-year-old domestic water system serving the main lodge base area also is being replaced.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A judge dismissed a lawsuit challenging a decision by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu’s administration to end unemployment benefits under the federal CARES Act early, saying the claims are based on flawed interpretations of state law. The pandemic-related benefits were scheduled to run out on Sept. 6. The lawsuit filed in Hillsborough Superior Court in Nashua against the state of New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Employment Security and its commissioner asked a judge to reinstate the benefits dating to June 19, when they were ended. In her ruling, Judge Jacalyn Colburn wrote “the plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims because neither of the statutes on which they rely require the defendants to act.” New Hampshire was among the first to expand eligibility for unemployment benefits when the pandemic first struck. Thousands of people were collecting unemployment benefits, including $300 per week supplemental payments either from the state or a federal program created during the pandemic. The state decided to end the extra payments early because the unemployment rate had dropped and given the abundance of available jobs, Sununu said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nGalloway Township: A man who apparently tried to break into a restaurant in a southern New Jersey strip mall died after he got trapped in an exhaust fan on the roof of the building, authorities said. The body was found shortly before 10 a.m. Monday at the restaurant in Galloway Township. It’s not known how or when the man became trapped, police said, and officials are still working to determine his identity. Authorities have not said how the body was discovered or who found it. A similar robbery had occurred at the business a few weeks ago, and authorities are trying to determine if the episodes are connected.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The family of a passenger on a hot air balloon that crashed and killed five people in Albuquerque in June is suing the estate of the deceased pilot and the companies that operated the commercial balloon. The estate of Martin Martinez, 62, filed a lawsuit in state district court last week against Hot Air Balloonatics LLC, Sventato LLC, and the estate of the pilot, Nicholas Meleski. The suit accuses Meleski, who had drugs in his system, of piloting the balloon in a reckless manner. Martinez’s family is seeking unspecified monetary, punitive and other damages. A Federal Aviation Administration report showed that Meleski, 62, had marijuana and cocaine in his blood and urine. The National Transportation Safety Board hasn’t ruled on the cause of the crash. According to the lawsuit, Meleski was an employee of Hot Air Balloonatics and one of the organizers of Sventato, which owned the balloon that crashed June 26. The balloon struck a power line and the basket toppled about 100 feet onto a busy street. Hot Air Balloonatics declined to comment on the lawsuit. Also killed in the crash were Martinez’s wife, Mary, 59; Georgia O’Keeffe Elementary School assistant principal Susan Montoya, 65; and her husband, John, 61. Co-workers had chipped in to purchase the balloon ride for Susan Montoya as a going-away gift because she planned to transfer to another school.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Pope Francis accepted the resignation of the Catholic bishop of Brooklyn, Nicholas DiMarzio, weeks after a Vatican investigation cleared him of sexual abuse allegations, and appointed a native New Yorker to replace him. DiMarzio is 77, two years beyond the usual retirement age for bishops. Francis accepted his resignation and appointed Bishop Robert Brennan of Columbus, Ohio, to take over in Brooklyn, the Vatican said. On Sept. 1, the New York church announced that the Vatican had closed its case against DiMarzio after an investigation concluded that the allegations against DiMarzio didn’t have “the semblance of truth.” Two men had separately claimed DiMarzio abused them a half-century ago, when he was a priest in New Jersey. DiMarzio denied the allegations. The accusers’ attorney, Mitchell Garabedian, has said the men will press forward with civil cases against DiMarzio. In a tweet Wednesday, DiMarzio welcomed Brennan to Brooklyn and said he had “great confidence in his ability to lead” the diocese. Brennan, 59, was educated at St. John’s University in Queens, ordained in Rockville Centre, Long Island, and made an auxiliary bishop there before being sent to lead the Columbus diocese in 2019.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCarolina Beach: The town’s council terminated the contract of Reef Parking because of defective parking meters and the need for new ideas. Reef Parking manages 1,200 parking spaces in Carolina Beach, including spots in 20 surface lots and 165 metered on-street spaces. Parking fees account for more than $1.9 million of the town’s $16.5 million general fund revenue for fiscal year 2022. This summer, the town fielded complaints about inoperable parking meters, Mayor LeAnn Pierce said. Pierce said she received more complaints about meters not working than about the town’s parking rates. The town will be accepting requests for proposals, which will include reviewing past proposals submitted by other parking companies, Pierce said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The developer of an oil refinery planned near Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North Dakota has a new contract with a company that will buy and market all diesel and gasoline produced at the facility. Developer Meridian Energy Group said its 10-year contract with Musket Corp. covers 360 million gallons of diesel and 280 million gallons of gasoline produced annually. The fuels make up 90% of the volume of refined products at the plant. Meridian first proposed the refinery just 3 miles from the park in 2016, with the goal of having it operating by next year. Meridian says the Billings County project has faced delays from the pandemic and litigation from environmental groups, and the company has struggled to secure financing. Environmentalists objected to the permitting process and have concerns about the refinery’s proximity to the national park, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The company announced last November that it had entered into an agreement with Utah-based Kiva Energy, which will purchase propane and butane from the refinery.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Ohio’s utility commission said it has asked an independent auditor to examine whether FirstEnergy Corp. used customer money to pay for naming rights at the stadium where the Cleveland Browns play. The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio announcement follows a request on Tuesday by Democratic lawmakers. They want FirstEnergy’s name removed because of its involvement in secretly funding a $60 million bribery scheme to win legislative approval in 2019 for a $1 billion bailout for two nuclear plants operated by a wholly owned FirstEnergy subsidiary. Akron-based FirstEnergy in 2013 agreed to pay $102 million over 17 years for naming rights to the stadium that was called Cleveland Browns Stadium when it opened in 1999, cleveland.com reported. FirstEnergy spokesperson Jennifer Young said the corporation pays for the naming rights deal and not customers of its three Ohio electric companies.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:The Cherokee Nation and three opioid distributors reached a $75 million settlement to resolve opioid-related claims against the companies. The Tahlequah, Oklahoma-based tribe announced the settlement, the largest in Cherokee Nation history, with McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation. The settlement will be paid out over 61/ 2 years. The tribe sued the three companies, along with several pharmacy companies, in 2017, alleging they contributed to “an epidemic of prescription opioid abuse” within the tribe and have not done enough to prevent tribal members from acquiring illegally prescribed opioid painkillers. The three companies said in a joint statement that the settlement is a step toward “a broader settlement with all federally recognized Native American tribes across the country.” The Cherokee Nation’s claims against Walmart, Walgreens and CVS are pending.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:After more than a year of renovations – and a much-anticipated reopening delayed by rising COVID-19 cases — the Salem Public Library is set to open Friday with limited in-person services. Residents can visit the library for Express Service, which includes browsing, pickup of holds and limited public computer use. The services will be available 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday to Saturday. Curbside services will continue by appointment, and the outdoor book return is available 24 hours a day. The library closed its downtown location in February 2020 to undergo $18.6 million bond-funded seismic retrofits and cosmetic renovations. It relocated its collection to a temporary location on Broadway Road NE, but the location was only open a few weeks before the pandemic hit Oregon and closed libraries and indoor services. There will be a number of rules in place, including masks being worn over the mouth and nose at all times inside the library and a maximum of 200 visitors in the building at one time.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Allegheny County government employees will be required to submit proof of COVID-19 vaccination by Dec. 1 or face termination under a policy announced Wednesday by County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. About 5,000 employees are subject to the new mandate, of whom more than 75% are already vaccinated. The rest will need to get the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine or their second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines on or before Dec. 1 to be considered in compliance, officials said. Government workers who remain unvaccinated and who do not obtain an exemption will face termination beginning Dec. 2, the county said. County officials cited the rise of the highly contagious delta variant, which has led to increased COVID-19 caseloads, hospitalizations and deaths, and the need to protect workers and the public.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Foundation has awarded another $450,000 in grants to several more nonprofits that are helping state residents cope with and recover from the pandemic. Centro de Innovacion Mujer Latina, Rhode Island Rescue Ministries and The Samaritans of Rhode Island are among the organizations that benefited from the latest round of grants. Centro received $30,000 to provide community mental health services and other assistance to the Spanish-speaking community. Rescue Ministries received $20,000 to purchase cold storage and nonperishable food containers for its homeless shelter, food pantry and soup kitchen. Samaritans received $20,000 to improve the responsiveness of its digital suicide prevention services. The foundation has now awarded more than $21 million in pandemic relief since March 2020.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A federal judge suspended South Carolina from enforcing a rule that banned school districts from requiring masks for students. Parents of disabled children, helped by the American Civil Liberties Union, sued the state saying the ban discriminated against medically vulnerable students by keeping them out of public schools as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. The mask ban has been forcefully backed by Republican Gov. Henry McMaster and GOP lawmakers who said parents should decide whether students wear masks, not school officials. U.S. District Judge Mary Geiger Lewis compared the General Assembly preventing mask requirements to telling schools they can no longer install wheelchair ramps. McMaster’s spokesman, Brian Symmes, said the ruling isn’t the last word in the case. “The governor strongly disagrees with the court’s decision and will defend a parent’s right to decide what’s best for their children up to the United States Supreme Court, if necessary,” Symmes said in a statement,\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBlack Hawk: More than 150 homeowners in a development outside Rapid City are suing Meade County over risks to their properties after a sinkhole exposed an abandoned gypsum mine. The federal complaint filed Monday by Hideaway Hills residents in Black Hawk seeks damages to be determined by a jury and other relief “allowed by law or equity.” The sinkhole forced about 40 residents from 15 homes in April 2020. Geotechnical studies showed there could be water flowing through the abandoned mine and toward Interstate 90 and there is the potential for future sinkholes, the Rapid City Journal reported. The complaint alleged several violations of the state Constitution. It said the decision to approve the subdivision by the county Planning Commission and the Meade County Commission put homeowners at risk. Developers allegedly informed the county in 2001 of an underground gypsum mine and discussed taking steps to determine if it was safe to build on. The commission approved the subdivision proposal in 2003. Katelyn Cook, an attorney for the county, said her legal team does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nTennessee\n\nFranklin:A house in downtown Franklin that belonged to the grandparents of country comedy legend Minnie Pearl, who performed at the Grand Ole Opry for more than 50 years, is for sale for $2.75 million. The home on West Main Street is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It belonged to Ophelia and William House,the grandparents of Sarah Colley Cannon, better known by her stage name of Minnie Pearl. The Queen Anne-style home was built in 1873 and sits in Franklin’s historic downtown district. Many of the original furnishings and fixtures remain, including mantels for the six fireplaces. The distinctive home has glass doorknobs and intricately designed door handles. The nearly 6,000 square foot residence sits on a little more than an acre, and has four bedrooms and five bathrooms. Outdoor space includes a wraparound front porch, sunroom, back porch and patio. Hardwood floors are throughout the home.\n\nTexas\n\nHuntsville: Rick Rhoades, 57, was executed Tuesday night for fatally stabbing two Houston-area brothers during a robbery in their home more than 30 years ago. Rhoades was executed by lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville. He was condemned for the September 1991 killings of Charles Allen, 31, and Bradley Allen, 33. The brothers were killed less than a day after Rhoades had been released on parole after serving a sentence for burglary. Rhoades, strapped to the death chamber gurney, turned his head and looked briefly at relatives of his victims as they walked to a window in a witness area a few feet from him. Asked by the warden to make a final statement, he declined. He was pronounced dead at 6:29 p.m. CDT, 17 minutes after the lethal injection began. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to delay Rhoades’ execution over claims his constitutional right to due process was being violated because he was being prevented from pursuing allegations that some potential jurors at his trial might have been dismissed for racially discriminatory reasons. Rhoades was the third inmate put to death this year in Texas and the sixth in the U.S. Four more executions are scheduled for later this year in Texas, the nation’s busiest capital punishment state.\n\nUtah\n\nMoab: The police chief in the tourist town where officers stopped Gabby Petito and her boyfriend weeks before her death has taken a leave of absence. Moab Police Chief Bret Edge requested a leave of absence that began Monday, city spokesperson Lisa Church said. It is unknown if his request is related to criticism the department has faced over the past week after Petito’s body was discovered in a remote area in northwestern Wyoming. Petito and her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, got into a physical altercation Aug. 12 in Moab that led to a police stop for a possible domestic violence case. Ultimately, police there decided to separate the quarreling couple for the night but no charges were filed and no serious injuries were reported. Last week, the city of Moab said it would conduct a formal investigation into the police department’s handling of the dispute. Petito was reported missing Sept. 11 by her parents after she didn’t respond to calls and texts for several days while she and Laundrie visited parks in the West. Petito’s death has been classified as homicide, meaning she was killed by another person, but medical examiners in Wyoming haven’t disclosed how she died pending further autopsy results.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A food box program with its roots in the early days of the pandemic is ending after distributing tens of thousands of meals to people across Vermont. In June, the Full Plates Vermont program run by the Vermont Foodbank took over the Farmers to Families Food Box program that was begun by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The original USDA program was designed to feed people left hungry by the pandemic and give those in the food industry, notably farmers, a place to sell their products. The food bank, working with private, state and other partners, coordinated food distribution events where people’s vehicles were loaded with boxes of food containing poultry, fruit, vegetables and dairy items. The Rutland Herald reported that after the original program ended in May, the Vermont Foodbank continued with its version of the program, which has distributed 40,000 meals since June. Sayles said after the program ends Thursday, people who benefited from it can check with the Foodbank to learn where they can get help.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin clashed Tuesday night over vaccinations, tax policy, education and their respective records in the second and final debate in Virginia’s closely watched gubernatorial election. The event quickly got off to a combative start and neither candidate let up over the course of the hour, with each accusing the other of lying to voters. Five weeks from Election Day and with early voting already underway, recent polls suggested a tight race between McAuliffe, who is seeking a second term after his first ended in 2018, and Youngkin, a former business executive and political newcomer. Democrats made huge gains in Virginia while President Donald Trump was in office, taking full control of state government, but Republicans are more energized and optimistic about their chances this fall than they have been in years. The contest, one of only two regularly scheduled governor’s races this year, is also drawing national attention as a possible indicator of voter sentiment heading into next year’s midterms.\n\nWashington\n\nRenton: A woman has filed a lawsuit against King County Metro claiming a bus driver ran over her leg while she was laying on a sidewalk and then drove away. Jessica Chapel’s injuries were so severe that doctors had to amputate one of her legs, her attorneys said. The bus driver, who is no longer with King County Metro, is facing hit-and-run charges, KOMO-TV reported. Chapel was homeless in March and decided to lay down on the sidewalk to take a nap, her attorneys said. The bus pulled out of the South Renton Park & Ride lot and turned right, cutting the corner short. The rear tire of the bus ran on top of the curb and drove over Chapel’s leg, her attorneys said. “The injuries were gruesome,” said attorney Kirk Bernard. According to the complaint filed Tuesday, the King County bus driver initially stopped to check on Chapel before returning to the bus and pushing the response button to get help from law enforcement. The lawsuit alleged that the driver left Chapel on the road side and canceled the help that was supposed to be on the way. A passerby called for help.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A new program launched by West Virginia’s Supreme Court that uses technology to promote safety and access in cases involving sexual assault and domestic violence is expanding to Ohio County, officials said. The new system allows victims of domestic violence and sexual assault to file petitions for protective orders without going to a courthouse. Ohio County is the second community to pilot the program, which was introduced last month in Cabell County as a way to address safety concerns. The only option before the program was for victims to appear in person at the courthouse. “This new system will provide an option to victims to help keep them safe from the people they allege assaulted them. We also are ensuring every person’s constitutional rights are protected,” Chief Justice Evan Jenkins said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWausau:The city could soon be home to up to 85 refugees, including some of the thousands of evacuees who fled the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan. The Ethiopian Community Development Council announced Wednesday that it is preparing for the first 10 individuals to be resettled into the central Wisconsin city by December, and that another 75 could be received from January through September of 2022. The organization said among those resettled in the community could be Afghans, through the Afghan Placement and Assistance program. The organization received authorization for the resettlement from the Department of State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, but no costs have yet been completed for the effort. Before the refugees can be resettled, the organization is working to hire a director for its Multicultural Community Center and raise funds to hire other local staff members, according to a release. As soon as staff members are in place, the group will work with local partners to prepare for the first arrivals.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Widespread news coverage of Gabby Petito helped searchers in an unrelated case find a man’s body not far away, officials said. A team with a search dog looked for four hours Tuesday before finding the body of a man matching the description of Robert ‘Bob’ Lowery, according to a Teton County Search & Rescue statement. Lowery, 46, of Houston, went missing Aug. 20. The man’s body was found on a steep, wooded slope in the area of Teton Pass in western Wyoming. How the man died wasn’t immediately known. Authorities notified Lowery’s family while awaiting confirmation the body was his. News coverage of Petito, 22, who went missing on a cross-country road trip and whose body was found near Grand Teton National Park on Sept. 19, sometimes mentioned Lowery’s disappearance. That prompted at least two people to call authorities with information about Lowery, searchers said Tuesday. Lowery was wearing a black baseball cap with a gold letter “P” and spotted in hotel camera images carrying a black duffel bag with the Nike logo. Searchers in the area of a popular canyon trail said they found a bag matching that description with the body, far off the trail. The bag contained a tent and sleeping bag, Lowery’s sister, Leigh, told the Jackson Hole News & Guide. The Teton Pass-area canyon where the man’s body was found is about 45 miles from where Petito was found. Petito’s parents reported her missing Sept. 11 after she didn’t respond to calls and texts while she and boyfriend Brian Laundrie visited national parks in the West.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/27/news-around-states/40892461/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The deadline is approaching for a company to earn a $15 million bonus for finishing work early on a major bridge project in Alabama’s largest city. Texas-based Johnson Brothers Corp. will get the money if it completes work by Jan. 21 on the new Interstate 59/20 overpasses through Birmingham, state officials told news outlets. But the company will have to pay $250,000 a day if the opening is delayed past March 21. State transportation officials said the work is nearly done, and they will work out a schedule for opening the roads after the holidays. The more than $700 million project is replacing elevated highways built more than 45 years ago to accommodate 80,000 vehicles daily through the heart of downtown. Transportation officials said I-59/20 carried more than twice that number of vehicles before it was closed in January and demolished. The shutdown, which forced drivers to travel around the city on surface streets or Interstate 459, affected a more than mile-long section of I-59/20 from Red Mountain Expressway to Interstate 65. The state said it is keeping an eye on safety as contractors complete work that includes smoothing out the driving surface, installing lighting and adding stripes. Plans call for the area beneath the elevated highway to be used for community spaces including a park and an area for food trucks.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A project that maintains seismic monitoring stations in Alaska needs more funding to continue fully operating, officials said. Scientists, lawmakers and federal agencies are promoting the permanent installation of the Transportable Array Network, The Anchorage Daily News reported Tuesday. The National Science Foundation project was installed temporarily beginning in 2014. The stations can monitor earthquake activity and track weather, wildfires and volcanoes. The system can also detect North Korean nuclear testing, officials said. Many of the network’s stations in northern and western Alaska are set to be removed over the next two years if funding is not secured to maintain them permanently, officials said. The Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks took more than 43 stations in southeast Alaska in September, officials said. The center operates through an external grant on behalf of the U.S. Geological Survey, but it will need more funds to support the monitoring network for the long term. Permits for the stations will need to be renewed if they stay in the ground, officials said. The Alaska Earthquake Center requested $2.5 million in state funding to help maintain the network, money that would go to the University of Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:A flash flood watch is in effect for parts of southwestern Arizona through Friday morning as another storm rolls off the Pacific, over California and into the 48th State. The heaviest rainfall was expected Thursday afternoon and evening, according to the National Weather Service. The forecast office in Phoenix said light to moderate rain will spread across southern and central Arizona Thursday night, with some lingering showers and maybe a few thunderstorms on Friday. All of this could be great news for skiers and snowboarders. Another round of snow is forecast to hit northern Arizona late Thursday through Saturday morning, according to the National Weather Service office in Flagstaff, where an additional 4 to 8 inches is expected. The storm that rolled through the state over Christmas dumped 11.8 inches of snow on Flagstaff’s airport as of 5 p.m. Wednesday. Arizona Snowbowl reported 47 of its 48 trails served by ski lifts were open as of Christmas Day.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: An optometrist group is asking the state Supreme Court to reconsider its Dec. 12 ruling that directed the state to count all the signatures submitted in favor of holding a referendum on a law that would allow optometrists to perform a broader range of surgeries. Secretary of State John Thurston had not counted all the signatures because canvassers didn’t file paperwork required under a law enacted earlier this year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. However, the court ruled the requirements weren’t in effect when the Safe Surgery Arkansas committee submitted its signatures. The law in question, Act 579, would allow optometrists to perform additional procedures that currently only ophthalmologists can. Much of the debate has focused on whether optometrists have the necessary training. The referendum would allow voters in next year’s general election to decide if Act 579 should take effect. Supporters of the referendum believe eye surgery should only be conducted by medical doctors.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLaguna Beach: A sea lion pup was in critical condition but “still feisty” Wednesday after it fell more than 30 feet from a footbridge onto a highway, officials said. The 33-pound pup, now named “Lords-a-Leaping,” was dehydrated and emaciated when it was rescued Monday night in Laguna Beach by staff from the Pacific Marine Mammal Center, The Orange County Register reported. It did not appear to suffer any fractures or internal injuries. Most animals at the center are considered to be in critical condition for at least a week after they arrive, animal care coordinator Wendy Leeds told the Associated Press. “He is up, he is eating and he is still feisty,” Leeds said. The animal crawled up to the footbridge and jumped onto the shoulder of the highway before staff from Pacific Marine Mammal Center arrived. It was unclear what prompted the pup to head to the footbridge.\n\nColorado\n\nBreckenridge: The town of Breckenridge canceled its New Year’s Eve fireworks display over environmental considerations, officials said. The decision was a continuation of the town’s decision earlier this year to celebrate holidays in ways that have a less environmental impact, Summit Daily reported. The town canceled its 2019 Fourth of July fireworks display, which officials said was a result of concerns about fire safety and potential negative effects on the forest and wildlife. The town council opted to remain consistent with its summer holiday cancellation, Breckenridge spokeswoman Haley Littleton said. Breckenridge Ski Resort has not changed plans to hold its annual New Year’s Eve torchlight parade, in which ski and snowboard instructors carry torches and ride from the top of one of the mountain’s peaks down to the resort village.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Farmers are being asked to suggest ways to improve the state’s Connecticut Grown campaign, an effort to raise awareness about produce and other agricultural products grown and sold in the state. Bryan Hurlburt, the commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Agriculture said his agency plans to embark on an integrated marketing campaign that will promote Connecticut Grown products during 2020 and beyond. The program was developed to assist producers and retailers of Connecticut farm products by raising awareness and increasing direct-to-consumer and wholesale buying. During his visits to over the past few months to numerous farms and businesses, Hurlburt said he heard a clear message that promotion of the Connecticut Grown brand needs to be improved.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The remains of a 33-year-old American soldier killed in combat in Afghanistan have been returned to the United States on Wednesday, arriving at Dover Air Force. Sgt. 1st Class Michael J. Goble of Washington Township, New Jersey, was killed Monday in a roadside bombing in northern Kunduz province. The Taliban claimed they were behind the attack. Goble was assigned to 1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) at the Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The Pentagon has said Goble’s unit was engaged in combat operations when he suffered fatal injuries. Multiple U.S. officials, including national security adviser Robert O’Brien and Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended Wednesday what the military calls a dignified transfer in which the cases containing the remains are transferred to a vehicle from the aircraft that ferried them to the United States.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Metro admits it “did not follow safety procedures” – or follow a 2015 guideline from federal investigators – when it sent a Red Line train to investigate sparks on the tracks during Dec. 10’s morning’s rush, WUSA-TV reported. Metro safety watchdogs said riders were put in danger. A transit agency investigation of the incident found that a rail operations controller radioed the operator of Train 130 to check out a track problem near Tenleytown, “but failed to instruct Train 130 to offload its passengers before beginning the inspection.” NTSB investigators said trains carrying passengers should not be used to scope out track issues.\n\nFlorida\n\nCocoa Beach: Who needs a sleigh when you have a surfboard? Some 600 surfers dressed as Santa chose surfboards instead of sleighs on Tuesday during an annual Christmas Eve surfing fundraiser in Cocoa Beach. Almost 10,000 spectators turned out for the 10th Annual Surfing Santas event along Florida’s Space Coast. The surfing fundraiser raised $40,000 for the Florida Surf Museum and a nonprofit that helps people with cancer.\n\nGeorgia\n\nColumbus: A manufacturer of plastic stretch film is planning to open a new manufacturing facility in Georgia. Zummit Plastics, based in Phoenix, is expanding with plans to create 50 jobs and invest $25 million into the project in Columbus, according to the Georgia Department of Economic Development. The location and opening date were not announced, The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer reported.. “This announcement is a fantastic way to wrap up 2019,” said Russ Carreker, chairman of the Development Authority of Columbus. “We are grateful that Zummit Plastics decided to choose Columbus as the place to achieve business success with their environmentally-friendly stretch film products.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The Hawaii Police Department has gone $3 million over budget primarily because of the necessity of an increased police presence near the site of demonstrations at the Mauna Kea Access Road, an official said. Assistant Chief Samuel Thomas told the Hawaii County Police Commission of the budget overrun Friday, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Wednesday. Since July, demonstrators have blocked access to the summit of Mauna Kea to prevent the construction of a giant telescope. Demonstrators have said the Thirty Meter Telescope could damage land considered sacred by some Native Hawaiians. The department’s increased presence on Daniel K. Inouye Highway has required an increase in officer overtime payments, Thomas said. The county has accrued more than $5 million in law enforcement expenses related to Mauna Kea demonstrations and increased traffic enforcement on the highway, Thomas said. Thomas told commissioners the police budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, is just more than $70 million, adding that a budget meeting with the county Department of Finance is scheduled for January. The state has spent about $15 million to provide safe access to the mountain, Democratic Gov. David Ige said earlier this month.\n\nIdaho\n\nKetchum: The Idaho Public Utilities Commission rejected a proposed settlement for home and small business solar panels, officials said. The agreement would have changed how Idaho Power Co. customers are credited for the solar power they produce and put into the grid, The Idaho Mountain Express reported Tuesday. The proposed agreement reached in October by Idaho Power, utilities commission staff and seven other entities involved net metering, officials said. Net metering records the amount of power produced by a home power producer relative to the amount the home consumes, officials said. The commission’s Dec. 20 order rejected the settlement agreement, finding the record created from the settlement proceedings was insufficient to support the proposal. The public was not adequately notified the agreement might result in significant changes to Idaho Power’s net metering program, the commission said.\n\nIllinois\n\nAlton: Authorities in southwest Illinois made a Christmas-morning rescue after a woman who climbed up bluffs above a city park got stuck on a ledge for hours. Madison County 911 received a call that a woman could be heard calling for help around 1 a.m. Wednesday, according to The (Alton) Telegraph. Alton Fire Chief Jesse Jemison said a woman climbed the bluffs in a part of Piasa Park with thick wooded brush. He estimated she had been there since 4 p.m. Tuesday and was stranded about 30 feet off the ground in an area with loose rock. Crews used a ladder to rescue her after cutting a path to the woman with a chainsaw, Jemison said. The woman did not appear to have serious injuries, according to the newspaper. Authorities said the woman gave no reason for the attempted climb and was able to walk through thick brush before being transported to an area hospital.\n\nIndiana\n\nBedford: State conservation officers are investigating the deadly shooting of a bald eagle in southern Indiana and offering a reward to anyone with information. The investigation began last week after a landowner notified a Lawrence County animal control officer and officials with the Brown County Indiana Raptor Center of an injured bird. It had suffered an apparent gunshot wound and was treated for injuries but died, officials said. Authorities are seeking help from the public for any information and offered a $1,000 reward. The birds are no longer endangered but remain protected by two federal laws. Under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, a first offense of killing a bald eagle can bring up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine. The other law is the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Earlier this week, Louisiana wildlife agents said at least one bald eagle might have been killed in the state’s northwest region.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A proposed class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of liquor retailers alleges that the Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division illegally marked up the price of their products for years. The lawsuit comes days after the division’s former comptroller filed his own lawsuit alleging he was fired for blowing the whistle on the illegal price markups. Attorney Stuart Higgins represents the plaintiffs in both cases. Division spokesman Tyler Ackerson said Monday the agency is consulting with legal counsel and has no comment. He said last week that the allegations filed by former comptroller Todd Halbur were not true. The new lawsuit was filed on behalf of Class E liquor license holders who purchased products from the agency, Iowa’s exclusive wholesaler and distributor of liquor. Those licensees include nearly 1,700 grocery, liquor and convenience stores. State law allows the division to mark up products by 50% above what it paid before selling them to licensees. The lawsuit alleges that the markups that the agency assessed for years was “in excess of the statutory cap” and seeks reimbursement for the overcharges and other damages. It doesn’t elaborate on the amount involved.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Zoo animals in Topeka will soon be making use of castoff live Christmas trees. The city said in a news release that the trees can be dropped off at a special location at Gage Park, where the zoo is located. Zoo Director Brendan Wiley said animals that can benefit from the trees include lions, tigers, owls, mountain lions, giraffes, black bears and painted dogs. Once the animals make use of the trees, they will be ground up and turned into mulch. The trees must be free of ornaments, hooks, tinsel and tree stands. They also can’t be in plastic bags.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Effective next week, motorists with some special license plates will be required to pay an additional charitable donation to the organization represented on the plate. Currently, $10 donations are optional, but starting Monday, the $10 donation will be required. The change affects 29 special license plates, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet said in a news release. Most special plates already have a donation requirement that will not change. The legislation changing the requirement for special plates was passed during this year’s General Assembly. It also requires approved nonprofit organizations to maintain at least 500 registrations annually for the cabinet to continue producing the plate design. New fees for the 29 special plates will be $44 when first purchased and $44 at annual registration renewal. Currently, the cost is $44 at initial purchase and $31 at annual renewal.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Two elderly sisters have completed their goal of attending mass at every Catholic church in the Archdiocese of New Orleans. It took them nearly 20 years. Beverly Kelly, 84, and her sister, Pat Mahaffey, 88, crossed the final church off their list on Sunday when they attended 11 a.m. mass at the St. Joseph Abbey Church near Covington, The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate reported. It was the 160th church where the sisters attended Mass. That’s more than the 120 churches and chapels in the archdiocese. But some churches have closed since they started their journey. They also went to some churches outside the New Orleans area. They aimed for one church a month, figuring that would take them roughly 10 years, according to the newspaper. But they revisited many churches along the way and were delayed when Hurricane Katrina struck. Two other sisters were part of the effort, but they died. That made Sunday’s Mass emotional. “We were a very close family,” Mahaffey, 88, said. “Sybil (one of the sisters) was sort of the instigator in this church quest. I said a prayer: ‘God, I’m sorry you couldn’t spare her to complete this.’ But I feel she is watching us.”\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A cold snap followed by warming temperatures has left many lakes and ponds in the state with dangerously thin levels of ice, the Maine Warden Service has warned. The service is urging residents to exercise caution before venturing out on any ice-covered Maine waterways. Ice conditions vary widely across the state, and that means residents must check the thickness of ice before going onto it for activities such as ice fishing. The service recommends ice fishermen and others check the ice in different places using an auger or another means of making a “test hole” that gauges thickness. It’s a good idea to make several such holes, the state said. People venturing onto the ice should also bring a partner, avoid areas with currents, look for honeycombed ice and take other safety precautions, the state said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The Solid Waste Division of Worcester County will hold its annual collection of Christmas trees through Jan. 31. Area residents can drop off Christmas trees at the Central Landfill in Newark and the Berlin, Pocomoke and Snow Hill Homeowners Convenience Centers at no cost. Businesses and organizations that sold trees will not be permitted to drop off trees at the convenience centers but can take them to the Central Landfill, where applicable tipping fees will be assessed. The trees will be ground into mulch for use at the Central Landfill. For more information, contact Recycling Manager Mike McClung at (410) 632-3177.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Public health officials are seeking organizations to set up centers where people can be monitored after using illicit drugs. These planned “medical observation and monitoring services” would be staffed by nurses and other clinicians, who would monitor the clients’ vital signs, administer oxygen, intravenous fluids, and the overdose-reversing drug naloxone if necessary, the Boston Globe reported Wednesday. The clients will be able to remain anonymous and receive counseling, treatment for infections and wounds, and help with obtaining primary health care and addiction treatment. People will not be allowed to use drugs inside these centers, a marked difference from the concept of “safe consumption sites.” The state’s Department of Public Health is seeking bids to create three to five monitoring sites. Each would serve five to 10 people who have taken too much of a sedative, such as heroin or fentanyl, or a stimulant, such as cocaine or methamphetamine. The site locations have not yet been determined.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: WOOD-TV reported that doctors in Detroit removed a kidney from Logan Bosselaar on Christmas Eve and transplanted it to Vanessa Bosselaar. The surgery had been in the works for weeks. Doctors were surprised that Logan was a perfect transplant match for his 24-year-old wife, who has a serious kidney disease. They live in Kentwood, near Grand Rapids. It’s been a challenging month: The Bosselaars were in a rollover crash after a medical appointment a few weeks ago but had only minor injuries. “The fact that we were OK from our car accident and then to go in and have a successful surgery – that’s amazing,” Logan said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Before heading out to deliver presents for Christmas, Santa made a special stop last week at the CentraCare – St. Cloud Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit to visit babies who were dressed for the occasion. The March of Dimes provided the outfits – most of them donated – including tiny hats made by one of CentraCare’s NICU nurses. The bows were also handmade, showing how each baby is a gift to their family. Hospital officials said Tuesday that Santa was expected to return overnight to fill Christmas stockings.\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: Warren County supervisors voted to delay a decision on hauling away flood debris, which could cost the county more than $100,000. A total of 24 homes at Eagle Lake have been demolished by volunteers following flooding. The delay means the next board of supervisors will decide on the move after they are sworn in on Jan. 1 to begin new four-year terms. Water trapped inside a levee system stood for months this year. A floodgate that allows the water to drain from what’s called the Yazoo backwater region was kept closed because it was preventing even worse flooding from the Mississippi River. Under the plan, the county would place dumpsters in the Eagle Lake area to collect debris. That would cut down on the number of time-consuming round trips to the county’s landfill. But county emergency manager John Elfers estimates nearly 250,000 cubic yards of debris needs to be hauled away, equivalent to 305 dumpsters. That would cost the county more than $137,000. Officials say Warren County must pay for the work itself and isn’t eligible for federal disaster reimbursement. Outgoing supervisors asked county employees to make a new estimate of the amount of debris, as well as determine whether it’s all on public rights-of-way. Mississippi counties are barred by state law from working on private property.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Education officials said they have a plan that would not only increase teachers’ pay but also offer raises and attract them to positions that are challenging to fill. The state has one of the worst teacher compensations in the country, ranking at 40th with the average salary of $48,000, according to data from the National Education Association. But a new proposal could lift Missouri up to 26th with an average salary of about $54,000. Paul Katnik, an assistant education commissioner at the state’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, presented a nearly $400 million proposal to the State Board of Education during its December monthly meeting. The three-part plan calls for increasing the base pay for teachers from $25,000 to $32,000, offering teachers a $4,000 raise and creating a fund to lure teachers to take on hard-to-fill positions. The fund would allocate $75 million to recruit teachers to work in high-poverty or rural schools or teaching subjects such as high school science or English as a second language classes for immigrants. Education officials, teachers and education associations penned the plan.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: State parks across Montana will offer guided hikes on New Year’s Day as part of the “First Day Hikes” annual tradition across the U.S. Some 55,000 people walked more than 133,000 miles in state parks nationwide on New Year’s Day last year, according to the National Association of State Park Directors. This year, among the Montana parks participating, Missouri Headwaters State Park will offer a 3-mile family friendly loop at 11 a.m. Wednesday, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported. The land had been used for thousands of years by the Bannock, Salish, Shoshone, Crow and Blackfeet tribes, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. The Lewis and Clark expedition camped at the site in 1805 on its way to the Pacific Ocean. Later, the land was used by fur traders as a meeting place. It was also where the state’s first flour mill was built. The mill supplied flour to gold miners throughout southwest Montana. Missouri Headwaters State Park was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. Participants can meet at the main picnic grounds near the Gallatin River. The hike will begin at 11 a.m. David Andrus, manager of the 532-acre park, said the event will include hot chocolate and toasted bagels beginning at 10 a.m.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Union Pacific is continuing its fight against reinstating a train engineer who defecated on a locomotive connection knuckle. The company filed an appeal last week to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. Last month a district judge in Omaha upheld an arbitration board’s decision that the fired engineer should be reinstated because termination was “excessive discipline.” Union Pacific had sued the employee union to overturn the board’s order to put Matthew Lebsack back on the job. The lawsuit says Lebsack walked past the locomotive cab bathroom on Nov. 20, 2016, when the train was stopped. It said he left the locomotive and defecated on the metal knuckle that connected the locomotive to a rail car. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Buescher said in his ruling that he didn’t understand why the board didn’t think Lebsack’s conduct was worthy of upholding his termination. But Buescher also said the law didn’t let him consider the merits of the arbitration board’s decision, but only whether that decision fell within the board’s discretion under the provisions of railroad-union contract. He said Union Pacific presented no evidence showing the board’s decision was not within its discretion.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Veterans Village has announced plans to add 150 affordable units to the Nevada housing community and change its name to SHARE Village Las Vegas. The master-planned community will also be opened to nonveterans, The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported Monday. The nonprofit organization had been planning to expand the affordable housing community, and a fatal fire accelerated the timeline, Veterans Village founder and President Arnold Stalk said. Six people died and 13 were injured Saturday in a fire at Alpine Motel Apartments. A Las Vegas Fire Department official said the blaze was the deadliest in the city’s history. In addition to those killed or injured, 30 to 35 residents were displaced from their homes and were assisted by the American Red Cross. Five of the 13 injured were initially listed in critical condition, including a pregnant woman. The cause of the fire is under investigation, but it appeared to have originated at a stove. There was no evidence of criminal activity, the fire department said. After the Alpine Motel fire, Stalk wanted to “let the public know that we are expanding our mission and services,” he said. SHARE Village Las Vegas also offers year-round crisis intervention centers, medical and mental health services, employment training, nutrition programs, and other services as part of its public-private partnerships.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Two state senators hope to increase accountability and transparency in the budgeting process for the state’s community college system. Sen. Dan Feltes, D-Concord, and Sen. John Reagan, R-Deerfield, sit on the Senate Finance Committee. They expressed concern after the New Hampshire Technical Institute announced that it is laying off 10 people Dec. 27, including senior professors in the departments of English, education, accounting and social science. Although the layoff announcement came after the filing deadline for new legislation, the senators said they will seek some kind of legislative fix to address the issue. College President Gretchen Mullin-Sawicki has said the decision was “very painful, but unfortunately necessary to create a more sustainable institution” at a time when enrollment has dropped 8% in the last year.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWall Township:A home that caught fire Christmas Day reignited early Thursday morning as multiple fire crews were back on the scene in the southeastern corner of town, Capt. Greg Carpino said in a news release. A video of the fire posted by News 12 showed smoke and flames coming from the second floor of the three-story house at 2379 Peter Court. Smoke could be smelled all around the area toward Point Pleasant Beach because of weather conditions preventing it from escaping into the atmosphere Thursday. The fire had been extinguished again as of 9 a.m. and the cause remains under investigation, Carpino said. Township police said the fire first started around 2:05 p.m. Wednesday. Everyone in the home was accounted for and were uninjured, but a family pet died, according to a GoFundMe page set up for the family. As of Thursday morning, more than $2,000 of the $20,000 goal had been raised. On Wednesday, dozens of emergency vehicles blocked off the cul-de-sac on Peter Court as scores of firefighters worked in and around the smoking house into the late afternoon.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: State officials are planning another public meeting focused on the state’s oversight and scientific monitoring of environmental impacts at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Environment Department has scheduled the next meeting for Jan. 9 at the University of New Mexico campus in Los Alamos. The focus will be a 2016 agreement the state signed with the U.S. Energy Department regarding the cleanup of contamination and other responsibilities of the lab. The order spells out milestones the lab needs to meet with its cleanup campaigns and establishes corrective actions for the release of hazardous wastes or groundwater contamination. Watchdogs have been critical of the pace of cleanup projects at the northern New Mexico lab. Earlier this year, environmental groups filed a federal lawsuit over water pollution downstream from the lab. The groups asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to issue a permit that would specifically regulate urban stormwater runoff from developed areas at the lab, the town of Los Alamos and the nearby community of White Rock.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed Thursday a study to look into what it would take to bring high-speed rail to New York. Cuomo is proposing bringing together outside experts to look at the state’s past reports on high-speed rail and come up with a new plan. The Democrat’s idea was released Thursday as part of the governor’s 2020 State of the State agenda. Cuomo said previous plans over the last two decades have long said high-speed rail projects would take decades and prove too expensive for New York. The governor said most of New York’s population lives along the Amtrak’s Empire Corridor through New York City, Albany and Buffalo, and those lines often average 51 mph. He has said that makes travel on them the “slowest method available for New Yorkers.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The fight over the critically endangered red wolf has returned to court as Gov. Roy Cooper sought immediate help for the dozen or so remaining in the wild and federal biologists planned to transfer wolves into the recovery area for the first time in years. In late November, Cooper sent the secretary of the interior a sharply worded letter warning that, with no more than 14 known wolves in the wild, “the American red wolf is on the brink of extinction.” He noted that in 2019, no litters of red wolf pups were born in the wild for the first time in the history of the reintroduction program. Red wolves once occupied much of the Eastern U.S. but were driven to near-extinction by trapping, hunting and habitat loss before they were reintroduced to North Carolina in 1987. Their range is limited to five North Carolina counties. Another 200 live in captive breeding programs.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: The Grand Forks Police Department said it has received numerous reports of mail being stolen from residential mailboxes. Two suspected vehicle descriptions have been provided to police. One is a dark colored-sport utility vehicle and the other is a white four-door sedan, according to police Sgt. Mike Jennings. Police have no further details. Jennings said the thefts have happened in the late night and early morning hours in an area south of 24th Avenue and east of 20th Street South. Police are recommending that residents do not leave outgoing mail for pickup in their mailboxes overnight and that they ask the Post Office to hold their mail then they are out of town.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A New York-based sports network has turned to the federal courts in its trademark dispute with Ohio State University over use of the letter “O.” Overtime Sports Inc., an online network focusing on high school basketball and football, has a capital O with sloping corners as its logo. Its application to trademark the logo is pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Ohio State asked the company in July to stop using the logo, saying it was too close to its own trademarked octagonal “block O” letter. Overtime Sports disagrees with Ohio State’s position and on Monday filed a federal lawsuit in New York City asking that the university be prohibited from trying to stop the use of the logo. The lawsuit noted that Ohio State’s “O” contains neither rounded edges nor a rectangle in the center, as the company’s logo does. It also argued there’s no danger of someone confusing the letters, and that Overtime Sports has not unfairly competed with Ohio State or violated any of its rights. Ohio State declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group seeking a public vote on whether to legalize recreational use of marijuana in Oklahoma has temporarily abandoned its effort. The two proponents of the initiative petition – Amy Young and Vanessa Avery – notified the Secretary of State’s office Monday that they were withdrawing the petition they filed earlier this month. Young said in a statement she grew concerned about the impact that recreational marijuana might have on existing medical marijuana businesses and on children who are able to receive medicinal marijuana. A spokeswoman for the group, Michelle Tilley, said they plan to rewrite the petition to include greater protections for the medical marijuana industry and submit it again. If passed, it would amend the Oklahoma Constitution to allow adult use of marijuana and impose a 15% tax on the sale of marijuana, in addition to state and local taxes. Oklahoma’s medical marijuana program launched last year and has been wildly successful, with more than 220,000 patients and 1,500 dispensary licenses issued so far.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: Authorities are searching for a skier from California who went missing while skiing at an Oregon resort on Christmas Day. The search for Ashlee Gingerich began around 5 p.m. Wednesday when Deschutes County deputies were alerted she had not reunited with her skiing partners at Mt. Bachelor. The Ski Patrol swept all the runs right away and did not find her. Deschutes County Search and Rescue professionals and volunteers then got involved. The search resumed early Thursday. KOIN reported that Gingerich, 30, was last seen around 3:40 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nNorth Huntingdon: Police said a western Pennsylvania woman and her boyfriend were both charged with assault for a fight she said began when he found her wrapping presents for another boyfriend. The Tribune-Review said Daniel W. Hill and Diedra L. Dibucci, both 50 years old, were arrested after the incident in the North Huntingdon apartment they shared. Police answered a call about a man with a knife and had to force their way inside. That’s where they said they found Hill on the floor, with injuries and scratches to his face and neck. Dibucci told officers Hill threw a chair at her and grabbed a kitchen knife. Hill was charged with aggravated assault and resisting arrest. He was jailed after failing to post bail. An attorney was not listed for him in court records. Court records indicated Dibucci faces an assault charge. She did not appear to have a listed phone number.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Mayor Jorge Elorza, who has three years left in his second mayoral term, is considering a run for governor in 2022. He said he still has to consider various factors, including whether he can raise enough money to compete in what will likely be a competitive Democratic primary field, The Boston Globe reported. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo won’t be able to run in 2022 because of term limits. Elorza has more than $600,000 in his campaign account. Treasurer Seth Magaziner, Lieutenant Gov. Daniel McKee, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea are widely expected to run in the Democratic primary for governor in 2022.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAndrews: Members of Spirit Filled Ambassadors for Christ church said someone broke into a building they use for gatherings and set several fires. Someone also broke nearly all the windows on a church bus sometime early Sunday morning, Pastor Deshawn Rouse said. Several tablecloths in the Georgetown County church’s Executive Hall were set on fire. Pictures posted to the church’s Facebook page show burned tables, soot on the walls and other damage. The church’s sanctuary was not damaged, so services went on even with heavy hearts, Rouse told WMBF-TV. The State Law Enforcement Division is helping Andrews Police investigate the fire and vandalism. The state agency has been called in to investigate most church fires in South Carolina since a series of blazes at houses of worship in the 1990s. Rouse said the FBI has also been called in to help the investigation at the predominately African American church, also something that routinely happens in arson cases with mostly black congregations.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster: An acting supervisor has been selected for the Black Hills National Forest until a replacement is named for the outgoing leader. Andrew Johnson, the supervisor of the Bighorn National Forest in Wyoming, will manage the South Dakota wildness area for up to four months, the Forest Service said. The current supervisor, Mark Van Every, is retiring next week. Johnson will start on Jan. 6. The Black Hills National Forest covers 1.2 million acres in western South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming. Offices are located in Sundance and Newcastle, Wyoming, and Custer, Rapid City and Spearfish in South Dakota.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:A new poll shows Tennessee voters strongly support the spending of federal dollars to provide child care options. As well, voters want to see increased early childhood education opportunities in the state, according to the poll released on Wednesday by Tennesseans for Quality Early Education. The poll comes days after a Vanderbilt University survey also showed similar results – that voters support spending the state’s federal grant reserves to subsidize child care for low-income workers. The TQEE survey found 71% of voters said the state should use all of the federal funding it receives because there are not enough quality, affordable child care options for families. The poll conducted by Public Opinion Strategies surveyed 600 likely Tennessee voters from Nov. 18-21 and sampled voters across the state’s political, demographic and geographic lines, according to a news release. Overall, 93% of state voters view early childhood education – including the role of child care – as a bedrock to the short- and long-term success of children.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A Texas woman who drove to Mexico to deliver Christmas gifts to a sprawling refugee camp housing people waiting for U.S. court dates said Wednesday she was detained by authorities there for two days. Anamichelle Castellano said she and another volunteer for her nonprofit group were stopped Monday at a bridge crossing from Brownsville, Texas, to Matamoros, Mexico. She said authorities discovered a small box of ammunition inside the car she was driving, which she said was left inside by her husband. Mexico has strict laws against entering the country with guns or ammunition. Those laws occasionally ensnare Americans crossing the border. Castellano said she spent Monday night sleeping on a couch with her 9-year-old daughter in a government office. She gave a statement Tuesday to someone she believed to be a prosecutor, then was allowed to leave a few hours later. The prosecutor’s office in Mexico’s Tamaulipas state did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah firefighters are among the U.S. federal and state personnel who have traveled to Australia to help stop brush fires that have prompted a national emergency, officials said. Five federal agencies and 10 states including Utah have sent 21 firefighters to Australia, The Deseret News reported Tuesday. The state of emergency was declared because of a massive fire near Sydney, with other national park and mountain fires expected to fuse as brush fires continue to spread across 1,563 square miles of Australia, authorities said. The fires have been fueled by 25 mph winds amid temperatures reaching 113 degrees, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: Two women have started a pet food pantry to assist animal owners in need. Linda Groce and Theresa Jones opened the pantry Dec. 17 and plan to keep it open until January, the Rutland Herald reported. Groce said she was inspired by a similar effort in another city. The pantry will accept pet food donations Monday through Thursday. If the pantry continues to do well, and if space permits, the pair would like to bring it back next year, Groce said. Leftover donations will be donated to the Rutland Cupboard, local rescue organizations and the Feline Connection.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A lawmaker has filed a bill that would scrap the state’s Lee-Jackson holiday celebrating two Confederate generals and add one on Election Day. Del. Joseph Lindsey’s measure is one of hundreds lawmakers will consider when they convene next month for the start of the 2020 legislative session. Lee-Jackson Day, established more than 100 years ago, is observed annually on the Friday preceding the third Monday in January. It honors Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, both native Virginians. For a time, the holiday was merged with the one celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. But the 2000 General Assembly brought an end to Lee-Jackson-King Day when it voted to create a separate holiday for King. Critics of the Lee-Jackson holiday view it as a celebration of the state’s slave-holding history that’s offensive to African Americans. Many cities and counties have opted not to observe it. Lindsey, a Democrat whose district includes Norfolk and Virginia Beach, is the new chair of the House privileges and elections committee. He is the first black lawmaker to serve in that role, according to the legislative black caucus.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that drivers must use their signal every time they turn or change lanes on a roadway. Thursday’s ruling reverses a Court of Appeals ruling that said a signal is required only when public safety is affected. The high court ruled that the plain language of the law requires drivers “to ensure turns and lane changes are done safely and with an appropriate turn signal.” The ruling was issued in the case of David Brown, who was arrested for driving under the influence in Kennewick in March 2015. State patrol officers pulled him over after he briefly turned on his left turn signal while approaching a light in a designated left turn lane but turned it off and did not reactivate it while at the light or making the turn. He was arrested after his breath test showed .26 breath alcohol content, more than triple the legal limit. Brown had argued that the evidence of the breath test should be suppressed because the underlying traffic stop was without cause, and a lower court agreed and dismissed the case. The only issue before the Supreme Court was whether Brown violated traffic laws. The case now goes back to the lower courts to proceed in accordance with the high court’s guidance on the initial stop.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: The city isn’t going to force retired police officers and firefighters to return miscalculated and overpaid pension payments. The City Council decided Monday to keep the overpaid pensions where they are and correct any underfunded pensions, The Herald-Dispatch reported. Those whose pensions were underpaid will also receive back pay. Mayor Steve Williams said the city’s pension funds are now the strongest they have ever been, and the fund is making payments on time after having been late for months. In 2013, the police officer fund’s net worth was about $22.3 million. It has nearly doubled since then. The firefighter fund was about $13 million in 2013 and now sits at about $30 million. A 2017 review of the city’s pension calculations found that some workers were being paid too much and some were being paid too little.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A large number of people donated kidneys this year at the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison – and in each case, it was a donation to a stranger. It’s unclear why there was a surge in kidney donations this year – 28 in all – but a staffer at the hospital has a simple theory: “Society in general just wants to do good right now,” Leza Warnke, a UW Hospital transplant coordinator, told the Wisconsin State Journal. “We’re hurting for some ‘feel good.’ ” The 28 people who donated their kidneys are a rare type of donor known as “nondirected donors” because they’re willing to give to anyone, regardless of whether they know the person. Of the 28 donors, 22 were women and six were men. The ages of donors ranged from 23 to 78. Garet Hil, founder and CEO of the National Kidney Registry, said there were about 300 such donors nationwide this year, which still makes the act unusual. “We don’t know what’s driving it,” Hil said. “It’s still about one-in-a-million. These are very special people.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A woman from Alaska has donated body armor to a Wyoming K9 officer, the Laramie County Sheriff’s Office said. The bullet and stab protective vest for K9 officer Arie comes from a donation by Denise Nading of Anchorage through a nonprofit organization called Vested Interest in K9s, Inc. Nading made the donation in memory of Mel Nading, an Alaska State Trooper and pilot who died in a helicopter crash in March 2013 while returning from rescuing a stranded snowmobiler in Talkeetna, Alaska, according to news reports. The vest is embroidered with: “In memory of Mel Nading, Pilot of Helo 1,” the sheriff’s office said in a Facebook post on Tuesday. Arie, who joined the sheriff’s office this fall, is trained in narcotics detection, suspect tracking and apprehension, building search and officer protection.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/13/met-opera-cat-catch-slender-man-news-around-states/118816660/", "title": "Met Opera, cat catch: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission will ask lawmakers to revise the state’s medical marijuana law in order to get plants in the ground next year and make the products available to patients sooner, Al.com reports. The commission also voted to offer State Treasurer John McMillan the job of executive director of the new agency that will run the medical cannabis program. McMillan – who served two terms as state agriculture commissioner and is a former commissioner of the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources – told the news outlet he expects to accept the job, which would require him to resign as state treasurer. Al.com reports Commission Vice Chair Rex Vaughn said he has been in discussions with lawmakers about moving up the start date for licensing cultivators from Sept. 1, 2022 to early 2022. The time required to grow the plants, which will be raised in greenhouses, is 90 to 110 days. The 14-member commission oversees a new agency that will license and regulate cultivators, processors, secure transporters, testing laboratories and dispensaries of medical marijuana products. It will be a seed-to-sale intrastate program, with products made from plants grown in Alabama. A special legislative session is expected this fall on redistricting. Another might be held on prison construction.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy said President Joe Biden’s push to require millions of U.S. workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is “ill conceived, divisive and un-American.” “At a time in which we are called to work together, forced medical procedures run counter to our collective sense of fairness and liberty,” the Republican governor said Friday. Biden on Thursday outlined plans to mandate that employers with more than 100 workers require their employees to be vaccinated or tested for the coronavirus weekly. When asked Friday about critics who might sue over the plan, Biden said: “Have at it.” Dunleavy has faced some criticism for not issuing a statewide mask mandate and for not implementing a new disaster declaration to deal with a recent surge in COVID-19 cases. He has instead asked lawmakers to act on legislation intended to address staffing concerns raised by health care facilities. In a letter to legislative leaders this month, he said the virus is now “endemic,” and his administration is “adapting and proposing changes that make the response to the challenge more durable, and not subject to the whims of 30-day proclamations or health orders.” Still, in his statement, Dunleavy said it is “clear from the data and empirical evidence over the last year that the vaccine is the most effective way to fight COVID-19.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state has sold off $93 million in Unilever bonds and plans to sell the remaining $50 million it has invested in the global consumer products company over subsidiary Ben & Jerry’s decision to stop selling its ice cream in Israeli-occupied territories, the latest in a series of actions by states with anti-Israel boycott laws. The investment moves state Treasurer Kimberly Yee announced last week were mandated by a 2019 state law that bars Arizona government agencies from holding investments or doing more than $100,000 in business with any firm that boycotts Israel or its territories. Arizona appears to be the first of 35 states with anti-boycott laws or regulation to have fully divested itself from Unilever following Ben & Jerry’s actions. While Ben & Jerry’s, based in Vermont, is owned by London-based Unilever, it maintains its own independent board, which Unilever said makes its own decision on its social mission. Ben & Jerry’s announced July 19 that maintaining its presence in the occupied territories was “inconsistent with our values.” The Arizona law enacted in 2016 and revised in 2019 had broad, bipartisan support and was signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. He tweeted that the Ben & Jerry’s decision “is discrimination.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: An appeals court has reversed a lower court judge’s order that the city must reinstate a police officer who was fired for fatally shooting a Black motorist. The Arkansas Court of Appeals panel on Wednesday reversed Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox’s decision last year regarding the firing of former Officer Charles Starks over the fatal shooting of Bradley Blackshire. Starks fired his gun at least 15 times through the windshield of a car Blackshire was driving in February 2019. Fox reversed the Little Rock Civil Service Commission’s decision to uphold Starks’ firing and instead imposed a 30-day suspension and reduction in salary. Starks resigned in September and accused the police chief of making his working conditions “intolerable” after his reinstatement. Starks pulled over Blackshire because the car he was driving had been reported stolen, though Blackshire’s family has said he borrowed it from a friend. Surveillance and dashcam footage showed that Starks instructed Blackshire to exit the parked car. Instead, Blackshire began to slowly drive away and bumped Starks, who fired into the windshield four times. The car briefly stopped, and Starks got onto its hood and fired at least 11 more times into the car as it continued to move.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State lawmakers have approved what advocacy groups say are the nation’s strongest protections against falsely labeling items as recyclable when they in fact are destined for landfills. The measure sent late Thursday to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom for his consideration would reserve the “chasing arrows” recycling symbol for items that actually can be recycled. The bill’s author, Democratic Sen. Ben Allen, said in a statement that it will force truth in advertising and “will reduce contamination in the recycling stream and improve the sorting process, thereby saving cities and ratepayers money while empowering consumers to make more informed decisions.” It’s among efforts in several states to ease confusion about recycling and increase recycling efforts. A Consumer Brands Association report recently asserted that confusion has led to “a broken recycling system in America.” A coalition of 14 opposition groups countered that the bill would have “resounding impacts” on the state’s goal to divert 75% of trash from landfills and hinder efforts to recycle packaging. The bill would likely require regulators to create a list of eligible items that “is extremely limiting,” potentially including just 15, the groups said – eight types of paper materials, two forms of glass, two types of metals, two types of plastics and one type of colored plastic.\n\nColorado\n\nGolden: Security workers will accompany nurses and staff members of Jefferson County Public Health’s three mobile vaccine units for the foreseeable future after months of harassment and abuse. One weekend this month, the agency was forced to pull vans off the street after a driver in Gilpin County, which contracts Jefferson County’s health agency, drove toward and destroyed signage around the van. Others “verbally abused” staff members Sept. 4, said Dr. Dawn Comstock, the agency’s executive director. These types of attacks have been going on for months, she said, but they’ve escalated to a higher degree. For instance, last month someone threw live fireworks into a tent of nurses and staff members, the Gazette reports. Despite the ongoing barrage of attacks and harassment, the county was still set to hold its COVID-19 vaccine events. “JCPH will not be intimidated out of its public health mission,” Comstock said. “We’ve arranged additional security measures to keep staff safe and will be working with our law enforcement partners to assure these handful of extremists are not allowed to infringe on the rights of those who want to be vaccinated.” Each incident has been reported to law enforcement, but each time the perpetrator has left the scene before officers arrived.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Tourism officials plan to spend more money than usual promoting the state’s fall foliage in an attempt help the industry rebound from the pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont helped launch the $1.4 million “Full Color Connecticut” marketing campaign Friday, which he said will link leaf peeping to other attractions across the state. Tourism officials said the play on the fall colors is meant to highlight other colorful destinations in the state, “from the golds of corn mazes and the pinks of cotton candy to the blues of coastline sails and the ambers of craft beer.” The campaign’s budget is nearly triple the amount typically invested in a fall marketing program, officials said. It is designed to reach about 33% of the market in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island – compared to 10% in recent years – and expand into other markets, such as Philadelphia. The campaign also will take advantage of the state’s high COVID-19 vaccination rates, which tourism officials have said helped bring visitors to Connecticut this summer. The campaign will run through Nov. 20 and feature hundreds of tourism-related businesses, from the state’s parks and orchards to its casinos and shops.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Decades of structural defects and water damage have put a 30-year-old condominium complex at risk of collapse, but disagreements among condo owners over annual fees have prevented repairs from moving forward. “The buildings are deteriorating. We’ve been paying through the nose,” Michael “Mick” Donnelly said, comparing the situation at Le Parc, where he’s lived since 2009, to that of a condo that collapsed in June near Miami. “It’s been a nightmare situation similar to Surfside because the buildings are nearing condemnation and the people here don’t deserve it.” The fatal collapse of the 12-story condominium complex in Surfside, Florida, put many Le Parc residents on edge. Most of the issues found to have contributed to the collapse of the over 130-unit Champlain Towers South on June 24 mirror long-standing problems Le Parc owners have endured. Le Parc Condominiums – consisting of three four-story buildings housing 76 units – has faced similar issues to those at Champlain Tower South, including shoddy construction practices, design flaws, the developer going bankrupt, and decades of deterioration and water infiltration. While some emergency work was done, a permanent fix – estimated to cost $4.5 million – has been on hold nearly five years due to a lack of funds and financing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, who has a doctorate in education, joined D.C. middle school students and families Friday, welcoming them back to classrooms and honoring the educators who made it all possible, WUSA-TV reports. The first lady spoke at Brookland Middle School and delivered words of encouragement while acknowledging the challenges of the past year and a half during the coronavirus pandemic and highlighting goals to come. “We are going to partner with you because we don’t always know what the future holds, but we do know what we owe our children,” she said, while affirming that the administration will ensure schools like Brookland have the resources and support to continue in-person learning. “We owe them a promise to keep their schools open as safe as possible. We owe them a commitment to follow the science. We owe them unity so that we can fight the virus, not each other.” Meanwhile, the president emphasized the necessity of COVID-19 shots. “Parents, get your teens vaccinated – you’ve gotten them vaccinated for all types of other things,” he said. “The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, easy and convenient.” Biden also celebrated D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s vaccination efforts and her success in setting up 20 inoculation sites at local schools\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Gardens: The most notable catch in Saturday’s NCAA football game between Miami and Appalachian State didn’t happen on the field. It wasn’t even a football. It was a cat. The animal somehow got into Hard Rock Stadium, then got caught by one of its paws off the facade of the upper deck in the first quarter. It eventually fell to the lower level of the stadium, where fans using an American flag as a makeshift net were able to safely break its fall and catch it before it was carried off to safety. “They were trying to grab it from above, and they couldn’t reach it, but they were scaring it downward,” said Craig Cromer, a facilities manager at the University of Miami and season ticket holder who with his wife, Kimberly, brings the flag to each home game. “It hung there for a little while with its two front paws, then one paw, then I was like, ‘Oh my goodness, it’s coming soon.’ ” That’s when the Cromers unhooked the flag from the railing and hoped for the best. The petrified cat fell, bounced a bit off the flag, and eventually was secured by some in the student section before being brought away by stadium security. “I’ll tell you, if the cat will help us in our red-zone offense, I’m going to see if we can give it a scholarship,” Miami coach Manny Diaz said. Some videos of the incident were posted on Twitter, tagged #HardRockCat.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city’s transit authority is soliciting public input for the exterior graphic design of new railcars. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority is encouraging current and potential future riders to vote for one of four design options through its website or on its social media pages. All four designs include MARTA’s traditional color scheme and are inspired by “the dynamism and movement of trains,” according to a news release. The transit authority says more than 1,300 people participated in a similar crowdsourcing effort in the spring that sought input on the interior design of the railcars. Those votes and comments revealed that the most popular interior features are digital maps, next station and destination displays, and Americans with Disabilities Act accessible seating and signage, the release says. “We were thrilled with the response we received on the interior features and are eager to see what riders think of the exterior design options,” MARTA General Manager and CEO Jeffrey Parker said in the release. The new railcars are slated to arrive in stations in 2023.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige is requiring government contractors and visitors to state facilities to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test. Ige’s executive order issued Thursday takes effect Monday, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. State contractors must attest to their employees’ vaccination status or provide weekly tests for unvaccinated staff. Contractors also must wear masks and maintain physical distance while on state property. The order also applies to visitors to state facilities. It does not apply to beaches or outdoor state properties. Inmates at correctional facilities, patients at state hospitals, and children under 12 or students attending state public or charter schools are exempt. Travelers arriving at airports are also exempt. The order says it is intended for the “safety of the government workforce during this ongoing escalation in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths resulting from the delta variant.” Last month, Ige issued an executive order requiring state and county employees to be either vaccinated or tested weekly.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene: Northern Idaho’s long, deep streak of anti-government activism has confounded attempts to battle a COVID-19 outbreak overwhelming hospitals in the deeply conservative region. A deadly 1992 standoff with federal agents near the Canadian border helped spark an expansion of radical right-wing groups across the country, and the area was for a long time the home of the Aryan Nations, whose leader envisioned a “White Homeland” in the county that is now among the hardest-hit of the pandemic. Hospitals in northern Idaho are so packed with COVID-19 patients that authorities announced last week that facilities would be allowed to ration health care. “This is extremism beyond anything I ever witnessed,” Tony Stewart said of people who refused to get vaccinated and wear masks. Stewart is a founding member of the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations, which battled the Aryan Nations for decades and helped bankrupt the neo-Nazi group. “I’m almost speechless in seeing so many people have lost concern for their fellow humans.” Anti-government sentiments are strong in northern Idaho. State Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, refused an interview request, saying reporters were liars. She has promoted mask-burning protests and is among lawmakers who have frequently pushed COVID-19 misinformation on Facebook.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Lawmakers are considering whether to put a statue on state Capitol grounds of Ronald Reagan, the Illinois native who served as the country’s 40th president. Members of the House Statue and Monument Review Task Force met Wednesday to discuss Reagan’s legacy and whether to memorialize him at the statehouse in Springfield, where there are statues of two of the four U.S. presidents who were either born in or launched their political careers from the state, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant are represented on the Capitol grounds, but not Reagan or Barack Obama, who started his political career in the Illinois Legislature. Reagan was born in Tampico and raised in Dixon. He later had an acting career in Hollywood before becoming governor of California. Rep. Mary Flowers, D-Chicago, the chairwoman of the task force, said that “whether we agree with his policies or not … (Reagan) had a profound impact on the direction of this country.” She noted Reagan’s “made-for-TV” presidency produced images and ideas that remain with the U.S. today – for better or worse. His “It’s Morning Again in America” campaign ad created an idealistic vision of the country, she said, but he also is credited with the offensive phrase “welfare queen.” The task force will continue to take public comment.\n\nIndiana\n\nLogansport: The body of a Marine who was among 13 U.S. service members killed in a suicide bombing during the U.S.-run evacuation at Afghanistan’s Kabul airport was returned Sunday to his northern Indiana hometown. A military procession marked the beginning of memorial services for Marine Corps Cpl. Humberto Sanchez, 22, of Logansport. Sanchez’s body arrived Sunday morning at Grissom Air Reserve Base. The procession then headed about 20 miles to Logansport. People lined the route to show their respects, many with American flags, and jets flew overhead as the procession approached downtown Logansport. It stopped briefly downtown, where the hearse carrying Sanchez’s body paused under a garrison flag. The procession included Indiana State Police and vehicles carrying Sanchez’s family, followed by thousands of motorcycles. Sanchez was among 17 members of his Logansport High School class who joined the military after their 2017 graduation. He died in the Aug. 26 attack in Kabul, where he had been transferred after serving as a U.S. embassy guard in Jordan, according to his obituary. A public visitation is scheduled for Monday at LifeGate Church in Logansport. The funeral is set for 11 a.m. Tuesday at the church. Burial will follow at Mount Hope Cemetery.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A state court judge declined Friday to halt enforcement of a law that prohibits school boards from enacting mask requirements, saying there is no evidence that any school board would immediately impose a mask mandate if the law weren’t in effect. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Frances Parr, a mother of twin boys from Council Bluffs. She sued the state, Gov. Kim Reynolds and several state officials last month in Polk County District Court, seeking an order halting enforcement of the law. Judge Celene Gogerty, who was appointed to the bench by Reynolds in November 2018, said Parr has presented no evidence that a temporary injunction would alleviate Parr’s alleged harm caused by the law. Parr has asserted the law violates her constitutional rights. Her sons were set to start first grade in the Council Bluffs Community School District this fall, but she is teaching them at home over fears for their safety because the school cannot require other students to wear masks. Parr also has asked Gogerty to issue an order for a universal mask mandate for all students and school personnel until a voluntary plan can be implemented that separates mask-wearing students and staff from those who refuse. That request has not yet been argued before the judge but is another available remedy, Gogerty said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Hospitals across the state will receive $50 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds for extra pay for nurses to keep them on the job but will be required to report monthly on how many nurses they’ve lost and why, under a plan a state task force approved Friday. Kansas law required a bipartisan pandemic response task force to spell out how the $50 million would be spent, and the task force added the reporting requirement. The task force’s meeting came a day after President Joe Biden imposed new vaccine requirements for as many as 100 million Americans. Republican officials in Kansas and across the nation strongly criticized Biden’s mandate. Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, proposed the reporting on nurses who’ve been terminated. He called Biden’s new federal vaccine requirements “dictatorial edicts.” “We’ve had front-line workers – I mean, you can call them heroes – on the front lines for the last year and a half,” Masterson said. He also said he worries that “we’re gonna get some of them premium pay, and we are going to give some others a pink slip.” Earlier in the week, Masterson proposed to make hospitals with vaccine mandates ineligible for retention incentives – a proposal that failed on a 5-2 vote.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Lawmakers grabbed the quarterback role to direct the response to COVID-19, but when it came time to lead, the GOP-led Legislature “punted” the decision on mask-wearing in schools to local boards, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said Friday. A day after a special legislative session ended, Beshear gave a blistering response to the Legislature’s decision to halt statewide mask mandates to combat Kentucky’s worst surge of the coronavirus pandemic. He declared that the Legislature “owns this pandemic moving forward.” Legislators passed bills Thursday that scrapped a statewide mask mandate for public schools and imposed a ban on any statewide mask rules until June 2023. Beshear vetoed the mask-related language, but Republican lawmakers overrode him before ending their three-day session. “The masking decision the General Assembly made was wrong. And it was also a punt,” Beshear told reporters. “I’ve been willing to make the calls, to take the hits, to make the plays. And the Legislature asked to go in … at QB. And what did they do? They punted on first down. When you’re in charge, it means you’ve got to make the decision. This one was to push the decision to others.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Supply trucks are once again delivering beer on Bourbon Street, and the landmark Cafe Du Monde is serving beignets, fried pastries dusted with powdered sugar, even though there aren’t many tourists or locals around to partake of either. With almost all the power back on in New Orleans nearly two weeks after Hurricane Ida struck, the city is showing signs of making a comeback from the Category 4 storm, which is blamed for more than two dozen deaths in the state. More businesses are opening daily, gasoline is easier to find, and many roads are lined with huge debris piles from cleanup work. Thousands are still struggling without electricity and water outside the metro area, and officials say oppressive heat is contributing to health problems and misery. It could still be weeks before power is restored in some areas, and many residents who evacuated haven’t returned. “It is not lost on anybody here at the state level and certainly not on our local partners just how many people continue to suffer,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said Thursday. “While things are getting better, and we can be thankful for that … this is going to be a very long-term recovery.”\n\nMaine\n\nPhippsburg: A group wants to create an oyster reef off the town’s coast to improve water quality, protect a shoreline from storm surges and act as a habitat for other smaller shellfish. The oyster reef is part of the fight against “the immense amount of change” that’s taking place because of climate change in waters off the Maine coast, Marissa McMahan, a senior fisheries scientist at Manomet, a Brunswick-based conservation nonprofit, told the Times Record. The project is the continuation of a two-year pilot program the Nature Conservancy began in 2017. The conservatory’s goal was to see if an oyster reef could be grown on the ocean floor in the Gulf of Maine, which is warming faster than 99% of the world’s large bodies of saltwater, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Phippsburg group is growing oysters in bags that float on the surface of the water. They’ll eventually be released into the ocean with a hope that they’ll attach to one another and grow as a vertical structure. Oysters benefit the environment because they filter algae, creating clearer, cleaner water that can support underwater grasses used for habitat by crabs, scallops and fish. They also can break up waves and reduce shore erosion.\n\nMaryland\n\nBethesda: Activists are calling for the return of a Black cemetery to a church decades after it was erased by development. The Rev. William J. Barber II and Rev. Liz Theoharis, co-chairs of the Poor People’s Campaign, spoke by Zoom to participants at a Friday rally, which organizers said included descendants of those buried at the Moses African Cemetery and members of the Macedonia Baptist Church. The church plans to restore the cemetery and build a monument and museum on the site. The Bethesda African Cemetery Coalition sued Montgomery County’s Housing Opportunities Commission last month claiming that part of the cemetery is beneath the parking lot of the Westwood Tower Apartments, news outlets report. The housing agency owns the property and apartment building and uses the rental income to cover costs of the agency. An estimated 500 bodies of enslaved people or relatives of the enslaved rest at the cemetery, the lawsuit says. The plaintiffs argue that selling the parcel that was used as a burial ground without court approval violates state law. Last week, a Montgomery County judge temporarily blocked the $51 million sale of land that includes the Westwood Tower Apartments, WTOP-FM reports. The temporary restraint forbids the sale until a Sept. 27 hearing on the matter.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nLawrence: The body of a U.S. Marine killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan returned home Saturday in a solemn procession through Massachusetts on the 20th anniversary of the attacks that led to America’s longest war. Sgt. Johanny Rosario Pichardo died in the Aug. 26 bombing near the Kabul airport where people were being evacuated amid the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. A dozen other U.S. service members and 169 Afghans were killed as people struggled to get into the airport and on flights out of the country. Dignitaries including Gov. Charlie Baker, Boston Mayor Kim Janey and U.S. Sen. Edward Markey paid their respects to Rosario Pichardo’s family as her body arrived at Boston’s Logan International Airport. In her hometown, Lawrence, people lined highway overpasses and streets waving American flags as the vehicle procession made its way through the city near the New Hampshire state line. A Marine honor guard carried the flag-draped draped casket into the Farrah Funeral Home as police, firefighters and others stood and saluted. “We will never forget her name,” Lawrence Mayor Kendrys Vasquez said afterward. “We are proud to have her home.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday vetoed a Republican-sponsored bill that would have restricted state officials’ ability to use the Public Threat Alert System to announce new laws or executive orders. The Democratic governor, whose veto had been expected, said the system has only been activated once in the five years since it was created, for an active-shooter situation. The state used a different, federal system last year to send alerts to wireless devices about Whitmer’s stay-at-home and mask orders due to the coronavirus pandemic. That angered GOP lawmakers who said it should only be activated for “immediate” threats. That system would not have been affected by the state legislation. In a letter to legislators, the governor said the bill “would add complexity to the administration of the state’s public threat alert system, making it harder for law enforcement officers to do their jobs and making Michiganders less safe. … There is no need to further limit or complicate its use.” The measure had cleared the Republican-controlled Legislature mostly along party lines. The federal Wireless Alert System allows four types of messages: presidential alerts, imminent threat alerts, AMBER alerts and – as of 2019 – public safety messages designed to save lives or safeguard property. People can opt out of the latter three.\n\nMinnesota\n\nIsabella: Authorities said Sunday that a vast majority of the Greenwood Lake wildfire in northern Minnesota is contained, one month after lighting ignited the blaze in the Superior National Forest. The U.S. Forest Service reported that the nearly 27,000-acre fire was 67% contained as of Sunday morning. The Forest Service had said last week that the fire was nearly half under control as hundreds of firefighters were still being dispatched to the area. “I think the team is feeling really good about how things are looking out there. There’s been a lot of great work done and progress made taking advantage of this cooler weather,” Fire Service spokeswoman Stefani Spencer said. “The containment is pretty much growing every day.” Spencer added that the public is happy to have roads open, including all traffic opened along Highway 2. She said the closure was an inconvenience and frustration for folks traveling to Ely and the popular Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, the Star Tribune reports. The fire started Aug. 15 about 10 miles southwest of Isabella has destroyed 14 cabins and homes along with 57 outbuildings. Some residents in the affected area who were evacuated have recently been allowed to return to homes and cabins after the fire lost intensity.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Physicians who spread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines could now have their licenses to practice medicine suspended or completely revoked, according to a new policy adopted by the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure. The policy, adopted Sept. 7, says doctors have an “ethical and professional responsibility” to practice medicine in the best interest of their patients and share factual and scientifically grounded information with them. “Spreading inaccurate COVID-19 vaccine information contradicts that responsibility, threatens to further erode public trust in the medical profession and puts all patients at risk,” the policy says. Whether physicians “recognize it or not,” they possess a high degree of public trust due to their specialized knowledge and training, giving them “a powerful platform in society,” it says. The policy specifically warns doctors against spreading misinformation on social media and strongly recommends physicians separate their personal and professional content online. “Physicians must understand that actions online and content posted can affect their reputation, have consequences for their medical careers, and undermine public trust in the medical profession,” it says.\n\nMissouri\n\nLiberty: Thieves in the Kansas City area have in the past month have taken two churches’ fruit harvests. Hosanna! Lutheran Church in Liberty had planned to harvest grapes it grows after a Sunday worship service earlier this month, WDAF-TV reports. But members discovered that all 1,500 pounds of grapes had been stolen, apparently cut off their vines. The church has for about 15 years had the grapes bottled for communion wine. The harvest is a big annual event, especially for children in the congregation. The grapes were valued at $1,500. “This wasn’t really about theft of grapes,” said Pastor Mike Kern. “We don’t care about the value. It was more of a theft of joy.” Kern’s church was not alone. St. Peter and All Saints Episcopal Church in Kansas City reported that four of its apple and pear trees were recently picked clean, too. The anticipated harvest was three or four years in the making. The Rev. Jonathan Frazier said the Episcopal church donates its fruit to a nearby food pantry and a downtown homeless shelter. “So it’s just really sad because for somebody to take that quantity of fruit, they’re probably going to sell it,” he said.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Glacier National Park’s reservation system for Going-to-the-Sun Road, which ended last week after a three-month trial run, caused countless headaches for locals and outsiders who struggled to secure $2 tickets, but park officials say it worked as intended, alleviating traffic congestion inside the park and preventing long lines of cars from spilling onto U.S. 2. “Generally we do feel it was a success because it met our major goals,” Glacier spokesperson Gina Kerzman told the Daily Inter Lake. Kerzman noted the park never had to close the west entrance, as it has been forced to do in past seasons, and there were never more than about 15 cars backed up on the highway. In recent years, she said, traffic jams have stretched for miles from West Glacier to Coram. Additionally, the reservation system helped ensure that many visitors could find parking and access their desired trailheads and campsites. “We feel that we were able to manage the number of visitors and be able to ensure a good experience for everybody,” Kerzman said. Of course, not everyone was enamored by the new approach to crowd control. One recent review on tripadvisor.com called the reservation system “a disgrace” that made it “impossible” to access the park and prompted the author to cancel their visit, losing money on a hotel booking.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorfolk: Starting in early 2022, public transit will be more widely available in the city and surrounding communities. To address the increasing demand for public transit in Northeast Nebraska, the newly renamed North Fork Area Transit announced new services that will provide “safe, efficient and affordable” public transportation. A new flexroute bus service called “Forklift” will provide rides along three routes and the addition of almost 100 bus stops across the community, said Steve Rames, Norfolk’s public works director. The Norfolk Daily News reports that Forklift, which will operate seven days a week, will also allow anyone who lives within three-quarters of a mile from any marked bus stop to schedule curbside service. The flexroutes will run from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends. The system will likely rotate on 30-minute cycles during peak times and one-hour cycles during non-peak times, Rames said. The North Fork Area Transit’s existing call-ahead ride service will continue but under a new name, “Telelift.” With Telelift, riders are able to schedule a ride 24 hours in advance. Service is available up to 30 miles around Norfolk, seven days a week, Rames said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A change in newly issued Nevada driver’s licenses means airport security screeners may have to manually check the credentials because their scanners can’t read the bar codes, officials said. The Transportation Security Administration hasn’t yet updated its scanning system to account for a minor change to the bar code on the state’s new license design, said Kevin Malone, a state Department of Motor Vehicles spokesman. TSA agents at U.S. airports can manually inspect a license if the scanning system won’t read the bar code, TSA Lorie Danker spokeswoman said. The state began issuing licenses with the new design in July. A note on the DMV’s website recommends that travelers allow extra time to complete airport security screening.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBrentwood: Dozens of families have challenged mask-wearing policies in New Hampshire school districts during the coronavirus pandemic, with two cases in court Friday calling for injunctions to stop enforcing them. A lawyer representing families in the Epping, Londonderry and Timberlane districts argued at a Rockingham County Superior Court hearing that mask mandates violate the parents’ rights to make health care and medical decisions for their children, and they are illegal restraints under a state law that limits the use of child restraint practices in school. “Their children have difficulty breathing with these masks on,” attorney Robert Fojo said. “It’s causing them to be afraid; they suffer anxiety and stress as a result of wearing these masks, experiencing lightheadedness and trouble concentrating. Masks irritate their skin, cause acne. It exacerbates already inherent problems that they have, such as asthma, difficulty with speech, learning-related disabilities, and obviously a distraction. They inhibit social interaction, which is what these children should be doing in school.” Attorneys for the school districts have argued for the case to be dismissed, saying the districts have been following a “tool kit” for schools from the state Department of Health and Human Services that recommends mask-wearing.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Four more counties have received a major disaster declaration from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, paving the way for residents of Essex, Hudson, Mercer and Union counties to access federal assistance in the wake of the remnants of Hurricane Ida, Gov. Phil Murphy confirmed. The declaration comes after Bergen, Gloucester, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Passaic and Somerset counties received declarations from the White House last Monday. The declaration allows for assistance with needs like grants for temporary housing and home repairs, among other things that will help residents and business owners in the aftermath of Ida. There also will be federal funding available to all levels of government as well as some nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work to repair or replace facilities damaged by the storm in the designated counties. Many in Essex County had been pushing for a disaster declaration after the area got crushed by Ida. Montclair officials had hoped for FEMA to include the county after the storm brought “devastating” flooding. In Montclair, which received 7.5 inches of rain, at least 50 drivers were rescued from cars and countless more ruined, more than 150 basements needed to be pumped out, officials said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Native American communities across the state are putting the finishing touches on proposed redistricting maps aimed at greater self-determination in future public elections, as competing plans wind their way toward the Legislature for consideration. Participants in a redistricting commission for New Mexico’s Indigenous pueblo communities said Friday that map proposals may be finalized as soon as this week. The maps will be submitted to a seven-member Citizen Redistricting Commission that is reviewing and vetting redistricting maps for the Legislature, which can adopt recommendations or start from scratch. The seven-seat commission has no Native American representation. New Mexico is home to 23 federally recognized tribes, whose growing political clout is reflected in the election of Laguna Pueblo tribal member Deb Haaland to Congress in 2016 and her promotion this year to secretary of the interior. Attorney Joseph Little is working with a broad alliance of Native American communities to turn redistricting principles into action using results of the 2020 census to track population changes. Major redistricting changes are most likely in the heavily Native American northwest region of the state and an oil-producing region in the southeast.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: For the first time in 550 days, an audience was inside the auditorium at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on Saturday night, attending a Metropolitan Opera performance of Verdi’s “Requiem.” The night of multiple extended standing ovations was in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks but in fact marked much more. The company was performing in its home for the first time since hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic, including Met violist Vincent Lionti, assistant conductor Joel Revzen and chorister Antoine Hodge. It also marked the first performance in the house since the death of conductor James Levine, the Met’s towering figure of the last half-century. He died in March at 77, a little over three years after was he was fired for sexual improprieties. Levine’s successor as music director on the podium is 46-year-old Yannick Nezet-Seguin. The pandemic caused the Met to cancel more than 275 performances, including its entire 2020-21 season, plus an international tour. The gap was the longest since the company began in 1883. A series of Broadway shows will start opening this week. The New York Philharmonic begins Friday at Alice Tully Hall, while David Geffen Hall undergoes reconstruction expected to last another year.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A judge has set a mid-October deadline for state lawmakers to follow a court-ordered plan to provide full funding for improving public education, or he will take action himself. State Superior Court Judge David Lee said he was “very disheartened” that the General Assembly is funding a small part of a plan calling for at least $5.6 billion in new education funding by 2028, news outlets report. Lee has scheduled a court hearing Oct. 18 and said if the plan isn’t fully funded by then, he will consider options on how the court can resolve the matter. Pat Ryan, a spokesman for Senate leader Phil Berger, also accused Lee of overstepping his authority, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports. Lee’s warning marks the next stage in the Leandro school funding case first filed in 1994 by low-wealth school districts to get more state funding. The case is named after a Hoke County student who has since graduated from college. The North Carolina Supreme Court assigned Lee to oversee the case after Judge Howard Manning retired. Over the years, the state’s highest court has ruled that the North Carolina Constitution guarantees every child “an opportunity to receive a sound basic education” and that the state wasn’t meeting that standard.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State agriculture officials have confirmed a second case of cattle anthrax in Kidder County. The case was confirmed by the North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory on Friday, according to the state Agriculture Department. The first case was reported in August. Officials say producers in the county and surrounding areas should check with their veterinarians to see if they should start vaccinating their cattle for anthrax. The disease is caused by bacterial spores that can lie dormant in the ground for decades and become active under ideal conditions, such as drought. Anthrax vaccines are readily available, but it takes about a week to establish immunity, and the vaccine must be administered annually. Two cases of anthrax were reported in North Dakota in 2020. In 2005, more than 500 confirmed animal deaths from anthrax were reported, with total livestock losses estimated at more than 1,000.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The Cincinnati Police Department is pledging to increase recruitment of female officers to reach the goal of a force composed of 30% women by the year 2030. The department announced it is joining the New York University School of Law’s “30x30 Pledge.” In addition to recruitment, Cincinnati police also want to improve the retention and promotion of women in policing. According to a memo from the Cincinnati City Manager’s Office, the force is currently 22.7% female, compared to the national average of 13%. Officials say about 100 departments throughout the country have signed the pledge. “The goal of the pledge is not only to inform agency progress but also to identify and understand barriers to progress such as resources, capacity or authority,” the manager’s office reported. Officials said the police force should also be representative of the population it serves, which is 51% female.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Supreme Court has rejected a request to remove two members of the state’s Pardon and Parole Board from a high-profile death penalty case. The court’s brief ruling Friday denied a prosecutor’s request to remove Adam Luck and Kelly Doyle from considering the commutation request of Julius Jones, who was sentenced to death for the 1999 killing of Edmond businessman Paul Howell. The ruling came after a lawyer for District Attorney David Prater argued before a court referee that unless members Luck and Doyle were barred from taking part in the decision, the five-member board would likely recommend that Jones’ sentence be commuted following a hearing Monday. Prater, who argued that Luck and Doyle have a conflict of interest because of their work with released inmates, said in a statement that he respects the high court’s decision. “This is the system I operate in every day and I believe in it, though decisions don’t always go as I desire,” Prater wrote. He said his office is prepared to present “the truth of the circumstances” surrounding the fatal shooting of Howell during a carjacking. “If the Board objectively considers the truth, they will quickly vote to deny the killer’s commutation request,” Prater wrote.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Transportation Commission has granted conditional approval to a plan to expand Interstate 5 through Portland’s Rose Quarter as well as build a cap over the freeway to allow for the redevelopment of a Black community destroyed when the interstate was first built. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the commission’s unanimous decision Thursday follows the recommendation of Gov. Kate Brown that the Oregon Department of Transportation pursue “hybrid option 3.” That plan would essentially tunnel the freeway and provide economic opportunity for the region’s Black community in an effort to reclaim the Albina district. Supporters say the idea is to remediate historic harm caused by the freeway’s original construction and displacement of community members. Approval of the hybrid 3 model is contingent upon ODOT providing a thorough analysis of the project’s cost structure and funding sources by December. It also requires ODOT and its contractors to update its diversity and subcontracting plans and to reevaluate the project’s initial environmental impact study. The project’s cost has risen significantly from its initial price tag of between $715 million and 795 million to upward of $1.18 billion.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Some physicians are offering stock doctor’s notes for use by parents wishing to have their children exempted from wearing masks in school, according to state health officials who say they have referred the matter for possible disciplinary action. A statewide, universal mask mandate for Pennsylvania schools went into effect Tuesday as the Wolf administration seeks to keep school buildings open for in-person learning amid the latest surge in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. The acting health secretary’s face covering order contains an exemption for students for whom wearing a mask would cause or worsen a medical condition. But parents in districts that require a doctor’s note or other medical documentation have complained it’s been difficult to find a physician who will sign off. The Health Department said some doctors are pushing stock exemptions available to anyone. “The administration is aware that some physicians have indicated that they intend to offer blanket ‘exemptions’ to individuals with whom they have no treatment relationship, and regardless of whether the individual’s physical condition required an exemption,” the department said in a statement. Those doctors “have been and will be referred to the appropriate licensing boards for possible disciplinary action.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Kingstown: A pond has been closed to shellfish harvesting after seven people reported becoming ill after consuming raw shellfish harvested in the area last month. The state departments of health and environmental management said Saturday that Potter Pond in South Kingstown will be closed until further notice. The agencies said two of the sickened individuals tested positive for Campylobacter Jejuni. People with Campylobacter infection usually have diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps as well as nausea and vomiting, the agencies said. The symptoms usually start after two to five days and last about one week. The agencies advise anyone who consumed shellfish from the area and is feeling ill to seek medical attention, as more serious complications can develop. Health officials say they’ve contacted all commercial harvesters in the area to ensure that any product harvested during the time frame under investigation is not sold at restaurants and markets. They’re also urging recreational harvesters who collected shellfish between Thursday and Saturday in the pond to either discard them or avoid consuming them raw or undercooked. Officials say quick steaming isn’t sufficient to prevent illness, but cooking the shellfish until it reaches an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit can reduce risk.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A lawsuit filed in federal court is asking a judge to overturn a requirement in state ethics laws that makes it illegal for anyone who files a complaint against a public official from talking about it unless the complaint is found valid. The lawsuit is filed by a whistleblower who says a state lawmaker broke ethics laws by voting in favor of a special interest that paid the legislator $108,000 over three years through contracts with firms with ties to the lawmaker. The State Ethics Commission rejected the complaint after discussing it behind closed doors, saying the lawmaker taking money from a subsidiary of the special interest didn’t affiliate him with the interest, the whistleblower’s lawyer said in a lawsuit obtained by The Post and Courier. In the lawsuit, attorney Chris Kenney called the finding a “legal absurdity.” Kenney, who works in state Sen. Dick Harpootlian’s law firm, told the newspaper he can’t further identify the lawmaker or the special interest without a ruling in his favor from the court. Ethics laws prevent people who file a complaint from talking about it publicly before the complaint is heard and also if the commission rules against it, even on a technical issue. Critics of that provision have said it violates free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nDeadwood: The first sporting bets have been wagered in the city, bringing to fruition an effort that began several years ago after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned commercial sports gambling. Four casinos in Deadwood opened sports betting Thursday: Tin Lizzie, Cadillac Jack’s, Gold Dust and Mustang Sally’s. Betting is only allowed at licensed facilities in Deadwood. People can place their bets with tellers at a window, at a digital kiosk or, soon, through an app on their phone. The app will only work within the facilities. The South Dakota Commission on Gaming issued a final ruling Wednesday on a list of sporting events on which gamblers will be able to place bets, including Olympic events and professional and college-level sports, the Rapid City Journal reports. Deadwood Gaming Association Executive Director Mike Rodman said Thursday’s opening was a success. “We’re very pleased that we got to this point,” he said. “And it’s been a long haul getting there. We’re happy to be there today.” In 2019, the Deadwood Gaming Commission attempted to get the Legislature to legalize it but came up three votes short. In 2020, South Dakota voters legalized sports gambling with about 58% approval, and the Legislature passed the gaming laws in 2021.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The federal Environmental Protection Agency is proposing the addition of a former munitions factory just outside the city to a list of prioritized Superfund toxic cleanup sites, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen said. The EPA has proposed adding the National Fireworks site in the Memphis suburb of Cordova to its Superfund National Priorities List for removal of toxic chemicals detected in groundwater, Cohen, D-Memphis, said in a statement Thursday. National Fireworks made flares, grenades, incendiary bombs and large caliber rounds for the U.S. Army and Navy from 1942 to 1945, the EPA said. Metals and chlorinated solvent contamination have been identified in the soil and groundwater on the Superfund site, the EPA said. The 260-acre site was redeveloped in 1986 as an industrial park. The listing would make the site eligible for cleanup funding as one of the nation’s highest priority contamination sites. The site is “dangerously close to Memphis’ Shaw Wellfield that provides drinking water to 79,000 people,” Cohen said.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The CEO of Salesforce said the company will help employees leave the state, and he did so while retweeting a story linking the offer to concern about Texas’ new anti-abortion law. Salesforce, which sells customer-management software, joins a small number of companies that have reacted against the law. CNBC reported that the San Francisco-based company told employees in a Slack message that it will help them move “if you have concerns about access to reproductive healthcare in your state.” On Friday night, CEO Marc Benioff retweeted a post about the story, adding: “Ohana if you want to move we’ll help you exit TX. Your choice.” Ohana is a Hawaiian term for family. The company did not return messages for comment. The Texas law passed the Republican-controlled Legislature and was signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in May but didn’t go into effect until this month. It bans most abortions after six weeks, before many women know whether they are pregnant, and lets private residents sue anyone who helps a woman get an abortion. By a 5-4 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block the law. Last week the U.S. Justice Department sued Texas to block the law.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Thirteen Utah hospitals will postpone many nonemergency surgeries starting this week as health care workers are overwhelmed by another surge in coronavirus cases from the faster-spreading delta variant, a major health care company said Friday. Intermountain Healthcare announced that the hospitals will postpone non-urgent procedures for several weeks starting Wednesday. The announcement comes a week after state hospital leaders made emotional pleas for vaccinations and universal masking to curb the state’s ongoing COVID-19 surge. Hospital utilization in Utah is nearing its previous peak in December, when intensive care units were 104% full, and 606 COVID-19 patients in hospitals. There were 516 people hospitalized for COVID-19, and ICUs were 93% full as of Thursday, state data shows. About 62% of Utah residents ages 12 and older were fully vaccinated as of Thursday. Utah reported 10 new deaths from COVID-19 on Thursday, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 2,703. Several Utah hospitals postponed nonemergency surgeries at the start of the pandemic in 2020 to alleviate some of the strain on health care networks.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The city’s annual marathon has been shortened so that fewer health care professionals will be needed at the race next month amid a surge in COVID-19 infections, organizers said. The People’s United Bank Vermont City Marathon & Relay will be a half marathon and modified relay event Oct. 24, RunVermont said. “After extensive review and discussions with professionals associated with the health care field, RunVermont believes it would be insensitive to ask those professionals to step aside from their duties to attend to the needs of the race at a time when the medical community is under some significant strain,” the organization said in a statement. Marathon runners can switch to a half marathon, select a virtual marathon option or defer the race until May 2022, organizers said. They can also chose to enter one of three races on a complimentary basis if space is available: the Mad Marathon in Vermont on Sept. 12; the Adirondack Marathon in upstate New York on Oct. 3; or the Eversource Hartford Marathon in Connecticut on Oct. 9.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Arrests on marijuana-related charges have fallen dramatically this summer in and around the capital city since a new law legalized possession of small amounts of pot and residents keeping a few cannabis plants, according to a newspaper report. Twenty-five marijuana-related arrests occurred in Richmond and in Chesterfield, Hanover and Henrico counties in the first seven weeks after the law took effect July 1, compared to 257 arrrests during the same period last year, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports, citing local law enforcement data. “A 90% reduction in marijuana arrests indicates that the public policy is performing as intended and in a manner that is consistent with post-legalization observations from other states,” said Jenn Michelle Pedini, executive director of the Virginia chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. The law legalized possession by adults age 21 and over of up to 1 ounce of marijuana and the cultivation of four pot plants per household, among other decriminalization provisions. Selling marijuana remains illegal until the state launches a regulated market in 2024 and issues licenses. A regulatory board will help carry out the details.\n\nWashington\n\nLa Conner: The Swinomish Tribe is threatening to sue the federal government to speed up estuary restoration and salmon preservation on the Skagit River delta. Much of the estuary has been drained and closed off with tide gates to facilitate agriculture, but such habitat is crucial for juvenile salmon. The tribe says that under an agreement reached in 2010 – following a prior lawsuit – the Army Corps of Engineers isn’t supposed to grant construction permits to dike districts for work on the tide gates unless they first restore estuary habitat. But for the past five years, the Corps has been doing just that, the tribe says. During that time, at least 660 acres should have been restored. The restoration efforts are now behind the agreement’s schedule, which calls for restoring 2,700 acres by 2035. At the current pace, it will take a century to complete that, tribal scientists say. The tribe notified the Army Corps last week that it intends to sue within 60 days, saying the agency has allowed the dike districts to violate the Endangered Species Act. Skagit River Chinook salmon are protected under the law. The Army Corps and NOAA Fisheries said they are reviewing the tribe’s claims.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: West Virginia University is expanding its mask mandate to include all indoor campus spaces, officials said Friday. Masks will be required beginning Monday in all buildings and facilities regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status through Oct. 6, when public health conditions will be reevaluated, the school said in a statement. Last month, the university began requiring masks to be worn in classrooms and labs, citing several factors, including that not enough students and employees have submitted proof that they have been inoculated against COVID-19. The numbers of cases and quarantines involving university employees and students remain manageable, but officials said they decided to take the precautionary step due to the recent, significant increase of COVID-19 cases in the state. The mask requirement won’t apply in personal office spaces, small gatherings in residence halls, or while eating or exercising, officials said. Meanwhile, Gov. Jim Justice said Friday that cases in West Virginia are still rising, and there are a record number of patients in intensive care units and on ventilators. He continued to urge residents to get vaccinated. “This thing is running rampant right now,” he said. “These vaccines are incredibly safe, and they’ll stop this.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A woman who admitted to helping stab a classmate to please online horror character Slender Man will be freed Monday from a mental health institution under strict conditions, a judge ruled Friday. Anissa Weier, 19, will be released after spending almost four years at the Winnebago Mental Health Institute in Oshkosh. A conditional release plan calls for her to live with her father, submit to around-the-clock GPS monitoring and receive psychiatric treatment, among other things. She won’t be allowed to use the internet except at home, and the state Department of Corrections will monitor her online activity. Weier and a friend, Morgan Geyser, both were committed to Winnebago after pleading guilty to attacking Payton Leutner when they were all 12 years old. Geyser stabbed Leutner multiple times as Weier urged her on. Leutner suffered 19 stab stab wounds – including one that narrowly missed her heart – and barely survived. Waukesha County Judge Michael Bohren said the conditions of Weier’s release were fair, and the plan “provides for the protection of the community” as well as for Leutner and for Weier herself. Weier, dressed in a dark suit and smiling occasionally, said nothing during the 20-minute proceeding. “She looks forward to moving on into a productive life,” her attorney, Maura McMahon, told the judge.\n\nWyoming\n\nSheridan: Artifacts found this summer at Medicine Lodge Archaeological Site are slated for radiocarbon dating, which could tell researchers more about when the Crow, or Apsaalooke, people came to the area, according to the state archaeologist. “This summer, we found Crow ceramics, as well a range of things, from thousands and thousands of flakes and 10 arrow points (or arrowheads) and preforms to make arrowheads to animal bone from bison as well as bighorn sheep, as well as obsidian,” Wyoming State Archaeologist Spencer Pelton said. “We really hoped to find Crow ceramics to radiocarbon date, to have a better idea of how old those ceramics are.” Sharon Peregoy, a member of the Montana House of Representatives who represents the Crow Agency, said this type of work may help date early people of the area, preserving – or recovering – history that can otherwise be lost. “It helps dispel the concept that the Crow, Apsaalooke, people were new transplants to the area,” she said, adding that in this context, “new” means an arrival of 500 years ago. “The findings of these types of excavations and research correlates with our Crow oral history, which dates from time immemorial … prehistoric,” Peregoy said. “History is important to preserve a homeland for future generations.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/19/flag-fix-fire-starters-piggie-pageant-news-around-states/50252431/", "title": "Flag fix, fire starters: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPrattville: Three former workers at a church day care center have been indicted on more than three dozen charges of abusing children ages 2 and younger, some of whom were harmed on video, authorities said Tuesday. A special grand jury returned charges after watching security videos that showed children being hit, kicked and punched, according to court records and prosecutor C.J. Robinson, who spoke at a news conference. “When you have videos in crimes of this nature, it leaves very little doubt,” he said. The 44 total charges against Susan Baker, of Prattville, Leah Livingston, of Wetumpka, and Alicia Sorrells, of Deatsville, stem from their work at a day care operated by Journey Church of the River Region, Robinson said. All three women were arrested earlier this month. Each person was indicted on charges of child abuse and failure to report child abuse, officials said. An attorney for Sorrells said she will be acquitted once jurors consider the evidence. Livingston doesn’t have an attorney to speak on her behalf, and a lawyer for Baker wasn’t immediately available. Church leaders have cooperated in the investigation, Robinson said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: State lawmakers tasked with negotiating a budget deal reached a tentative agreement Tuesday that would pay residents more than $3,000 this year, but the final amount would depend on whether the Legislature can muster the votes needed to access a key savings account. The tentative agreement calls for a dividend from the state’s oil-wealth fund in the range of $2,500 this year, plus a $1,300 “energy relief” check. However, half the funding for the energy check would come from a budget reserve account that requires three-fourths support in each the House and Senate to access. Payments to residents could be about $3,200 or $3,850 depending on whether the vote threshold is reached, according to estimates shared with reporters by the office of Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, the Senate Finance Committee co-chair. He chaired the conference committee, which met for the first time Sunday and announced the tentative agreement Tuesday, the day before the legislative session was scheduled to end. The negotiated package is subject to a vote by the House and Senate. Stedman said the budget is a good one, with a “healthy dividend,” capital projects around Alaska, and attention to K-12 education and the university system. He said the dividend is a “sensitive issue” to negotiate, with splits among lawmakers over what the size should be.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Two more bills restricting responses to the coronavirus pandemic are heading to Republican Gov. Doug Ducey’s desk, including one that would affect the ability of future state leaders to respond to another airborne disease and a second blocking the state from ever requiring schoolchildren to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Tuesday’s state Senate votes were the latest moves by GOP lawmakers to limit what they have called government overreach. The Republican-controlled Senate approved a bill that would ban any state or local government agency from requiring face masks to be worn in their buildings. The measure already passed the House and got no support in either chamber from minority Democrats. They have argued it removes one of the most effective measures to prevent the spread of a respiratory disease like COVID-19. Senators also approved a bill barring the state Health Services Department from adding a COVID-19 vaccine to the list of inoculations required to attend public schools. It replaces a measure passed last year that only banned mandates for vaccines given federal emergency use authorizations. That measure, too, is heading to the governor’s desk and got no support from minority Democrats.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has raised another $601,000 in her bid for governor, continuing to far outpace her Republican and Democratic rivals. Sanders, who is seeking the Republican nomination in the state’s May 24 primary, reported having more than $7 million cash on hand for her campaign. Monday was the deadline for campaigns to file their monthly fundraising reports with the state. Sanders faces former talk radio host Doc Washburn in the GOP primary. Sanders reported spending more than $838,000 last month. She has raised nearly $15 million since launching her campaign last year. Chris Jones, the front-runner in fundraising among the five Democrats seeking the party’s nomination, raised more than $161,000 last month and spent more than $147,000. Jones has raised $1.8 million since entering the governor’s race and has about $108,000 on hand. The other candidates seeking the Democratic nomination are Anthony Bland, James “Rus” Russell, Jay Martin and Supha Xayprasith-Mays.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Dozens of environmental and anti-nuclear organizations expressed opposition Tuesday to any attempt to extend the life of California’s last operating nuclear power plant, challenging suggestions that its electricity is needed to meet potential future shortages in the nation’s most populous state. Last month, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom raised the possibility that the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant – which sits on a coastal bluff halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles – could keep running beyond a scheduled closing by 2025. His office said the governor is in favor of “keeping all options on the table to ensure we have a reliable (electricity) grid.” In a letter to Newsom, groups that included San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace, the Oregon Conservancy Foundation, the Snake River Alliance and the Ohio Nuclear Free Network said the plant is old, unsafe and too close to earthquake faults that pose a threat to the twin reactors. “Your suggestion to extend the operational life of the Diablo Canyon nuclear facility is an outrage,” they wrote. “Diablo Canyon is dangerous, dirty and expensive. It must retire as planned.” The Democratic governor has no direct authority over the operating license for the plant. He floated the idea that owner Pacific Gas & Electric could seek a share of $6 billion in federal funding the Biden administration established to rescue nuclear plants at risk of closing.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man who shot and wounded two demonstrators while apparently aiming at a Jeep that was headed toward the crowd during a protest to bring attention to police violence in suburban Denver in 2020 was sentenced Tuesday to 120 days in jail followed by five years of probation. Samuel Young, 24, had been convicted in March of two counts of second-degree assault, four counts of attempted manslaughter and a single count of illegally discharging his gun, The Denver Post reports. “It all happened so fast, there was no time to think, just to react,” Young said in court. “My reaction was wrong. … I cannot take bullets back. I immediately regretted what I’d done and wanted to repair the damage.” Several hundred people who attended the July 2020 protest in Aurora had walked onto a highway and blocked all its lanes. A Jeep approached from behind the protesters and headed toward the crowd, prompting Young to fire five shots. Two hit the back of the Jeep, and two hit fellow protesters. One man was shot in the leg and another grazed in the head. A woman also broke her leg when she leaped from the highway. The driver, who pulled off the highway and contacted police, was not charged. The protest was organized in support of Elijah McClain, a Black man who died after being injected with ketamine by first responders called to the scene of an arrest.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Department of Justice has given the green light to National Guard members on active duty for their states to join labor unions, despite a U.S. law that makes it a felony for military personnel on active federal duty to unionize. The agreement, finalized Tuesday, settles a lawsuit filed in federal court in Connecticut by labor unions against Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Justice Department, seeking collective bargaining rights for Connecticut National Guard members on state duty ordered by the governor. Already, the case has prompted some National Guard members in Texas to unionize. A 1978 federal law makes it a criminal felony for members of the armed forces, including the National Guard, to join or attempt to form a labor organization. But the statute only applies to service members when they are on active federal duty ordered by U.S. military officials, according to the Veterans Legal Services Clinic at Yale Law School, which represented the unions in the lawsuit, filed in November. “Before this case, unions were understandably deterred from organizing state active duty National Guard members due to the potential for criminal penalties,” Rekha Kennedy, a Yale law student working for the clinic, said in a statement.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Staffing challenges mean there won’t be lifeguards at the Savannah and Johnnie Walker beaches this summer, a city official said. City Manager Ann Marie Townshend said the city was not in a position to safely guard the two municipal beaches. The city didn’t want to inadequately staff the beaches and create a “false sense of security,” she said. The city intends to return to a full lifeguarding staff in the future, Townshend said. Meanwhile, people should continue following beach rules and be careful while swimming and enjoying the beach, she said. Many Delaware resort towns have increased pay or benefits to attract more summer employees. Lewes recently increased lifeguard pay from $13.49 per hour to $16 per hour to compete with neighboring municipalities. In the past, Lewes has had lifeguards patrolling from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. throughout the summer. Last year, Lewes hired eight lifeguards, two fewer than has been typical. Beaches were unguarded for a weekend in August due to low staffing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: This Friday the district is celebrating Bike to Work Day, encouraging locals to reduce their carbon footprint and get some exercise to boot, WUSA-TV reports. Another incentive: The price of gas in the Washington metro area is at a 10-year high, with the cost per gallon in the district averaging $4.84 as of Wednesday, according to Gas Buddy. The Bike to Work Day tradition is coordinated by a network of transportation organizations in the D.C. area called Commuter Connections, as well as the Washington Area Bicyclist Association. The first 15,000 people who register online to participate are eligible to receive a free T-shirt at any of the event’s pit stops. There are more than 100 pit stops for Bike to Work Day, located throughout D.C., Maryland and Virginia. Those who register will be entered into a raffle to win a free bike donated BicycleSPACE, Three Points Cycles and Bikes@Vienna. Those looking for a biking buddy can join a free Bike to Work convoy led by experienced biking commuters. And Capital Bike Share is offering free unlimited rides of up to 45 minutes per trip on its standard bikes. Its e-bikes will be offered at 10 cents per minute. Bike to Work Day in D.C. started with a small group of riders in 2001, and by 2017 the day saw an all-time high of 18,700 people participating.\n\nFlorida\n\nBunnell: A 17-year-old gay student who was suspended for leading protests at his high school against the state’s so-called Don’t Say Gay legislation says school administrators are now stopping him from running for senior class president. Because of the disciplinary infractions he received for leading the protests at Flagler Palm Coast High School in March, school administrators are preventing him for running for the elected student body office, Jack Petocz said in a letter posted on Twitter on Tuesday. The school is located about 30 miles north of Daytona Beach. “I am continuing to be punished for standing up for my identity and against widespread hatred,” Petocz wrote. “We shouldn’t be subject to abuse both in Tallahassee and at-home.” In an email, school district spokesman Jason Wheeler said Flagler Schools was not permitted to speak about individual students’ disciplinary records. Requirements for individual on-campus clubs or organizations are set by the schools or clubs themselves, he said. “The district has no say in setting those requirements or in how those requirements are enforced,” Wheeler said. Petocz is being honored next week with an award at the 2022 PEN America Literary Gala for organizing students to protest the Florida legislation and fighting book bans. PEN America is a New York-based nonprofit that advocates for free speech and is made up of novelists, journalists and other writers.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Republican head of the state election board said Tuesday that a recently released film alleging ballots were illegally collected and dropped off during the 2020 presidential election falsely suggests there were tens of thousands of illegitimate votes in Georgia. Still, State Election Board Chairman Matt Mashburn promised a “fair” investigation of its claims. “It’s not going to be a witch hunt,” he said at a meeting of the board. “It’s going to be done soberly and with great care by people who know what they’re doing.” The movie, called “2000 Mules,” paints an ominous picture suggesting Democrat-aligned ballot “mules” were supposedly paid to illegally collect and drop off ballots in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It has been praised by ex-President Donald Trump as exposing “great election fraud,” but election security experts say it is based on faulty assumptions, anonymous accounts and improper analysis of cellphone location data. Mashburn, who said he watched the film, said it suggested there were 92,000 “illegitimate, manufactured votes” in the state, but he said that’s not true. Even if a ballot is illegally dropped off, it goes through the same checks as other ballots to ensure the vote is legitimate, he said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Honolulu Police Commission has narrowed down the competition for the next police chief to four finalists. Seven people vying for the job spent last week going through an assessment process that included a mock press conference. The four highest scorers advanced as finalists: Scott Ebner, Mike Lambert, Arthur “Joe” Logan and Ben Moszkowicz. Lambert and Moszkowicz are Honolulu police majors. Lambert heads the training division. Moszkowicz heads the traffic division. Logan is a retired Army major general who was head of the Hawaii National Guard. Ebner is a retired New Jersey state police lieutenant colonel. Out-of-state consultant PSI Services LLC was contracted for $145,777 to assess the candidates, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The commission will take over the remainder of the selection process, which includes allowing the public to interact with the finalists, Hawaii News Now reports. It’s been more than a year since former Chief Susan Ballard retired. Interim Chief Rade Vanic took his name out of the running for the permanent position in March, KITV reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Powerful state House Speaker Scott Bedke has won the GOP primary for lieutenant governor. The fourth-generation rancher who is generally considered an expert on Idaho’s water issues defeated state Rep. Priscilla Giddings in a race called Wednesday following voting in Tuesday’s primary. The race was another battle between an establishment Republican in Bedke against a far-right candidate in Giddings. Bedke got about 52% of the vote and Giddings 43%, while Daniel Gasiorowski received the remainder. Giddings was censured by her House colleagues late last year after publicizing the name of a 19-year-old intern who reported she was raped by another House lawmaker. Bedke was appointed to a House seat representing south-central Idaho in 2001 by Republican Gov. Dirk Kempthorne. Following redistricting, he won the GOP primary and general election. He ran mostly unopposed ever since. He became speaker in 2012 by defeating then-Speaker Lawerence Denney, now Idaho’s secretary of state. Bedke will face Democrat Terri Pickens Manweiler in the November general election for lieutenant governor, a post Democrats last held in the 1970s in deeply conservative Idaho.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The Archdiocese of Chicago has agreed to pay $1.2 million to a man who alleged he was sexually abused at 12 years old by a defrocked priest who was convicted of sexually abusing several boys, the man’s attorney announced Tuesday. The settlement of the case before a lawsuit was filed was announced in a news release by attorney Lyndsay Markley and marks the latest chapter in the story of Daniel McCormack, one of the most notorious pedophiles in the history of Chicago’s archdiocese. McCormack, who pleaded guilty in 2007 to sexually abusing five children while he was a priest at St. Agatha’s parish in Chicago, was released from prison last fall and has registered as a sex offender with the Illinois State Police. According to published reports, he was listed at that time as living in Chicago’s Near North neighborhood. The settlement follows other similar settlements in which the archdiocese has agreed to pay men who alleged they were abused by McCormack when they were children. In all, the archdiocese has paid well over $12 million to men who filed lawsuits or settled cases involving McCormack before filing lawsuits. The archdiocese declined to comment on the settlement.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Republicans aren’t showing signs of putting the brakes on rising state gasoline taxes even as Indiana’s government continues its streak of fast-growing tax collections. Hoosiers are now paying about 56 cents per gallon in state taxes on gasoline – the highest-ever level shown in state records – and it will increase next month based on rising fuel prices. Democrats have been calling over the past week for Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb to issue an emergency order suspending the gas tax or for the GOP-dominated Legislature to do so when lawmakers hold a one-day meeting next week. Republicans shrugged off a push in March by Democrats for a gas tax suspension projected to cost about $125 million a month as national gasoline prices surged past $4 a gallon after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Republican legislative leaders argued that much of the gas tax money was dedicated to the state’s highway construction program, and they instead pushed through a plan for gradually cutting Indiana’s individual income tax rate over the next seven years. Indiana’s average price hit $4.60 for a gallon of regular as of Wednesday, according to AAA. State Rep. Tonya Pfaff, D-Terre Haute, said that a gas tax suspension would be in “the best interest of Hoosiers” and that “where there’s a will, there’s a way.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Jackson Elementary will retain its name but honor a new historical figure going forward. The Des Moines School Board voted unanimously to change the name during its Tuesday meeting. Students launched the name change campaign about two years ago while researching a class assignment. During a school board meeting last month, Jackson students cited the seventh U.S. president’s ownership of enslaved people and mistreatment of Native Americans as just two of several reasons they were advocating for a name change. The children argued Mary Jackson, NASA’s first Black female engineer, was a better fit in part because the school’s name should reflect its diverse student body. Mary Jackson’s story was made famous in the 2016 book and film “Hidden Figures.” Of the elementary school’s nearly 400 students, 25% are white, roughly 36% are Hispanic, 12% are Black, and about 20% are Asian, according to state data. Parents, students and staff attending the meeting quietly cheered and clapped following the vote. Jackson fourth grader Maximus Vannavong, who spoke at last month’s meeting, said he was “happy that it changed and got approved.” Board Chair Dwana Bradley thanked the students for their hard work. “It’s very important and valuable and people do listen and pay attention when you use your voices,” she said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Republicans on Wednesday improved their chances of flipping the state’s only congressional seat held by a Democrat, when the Kansas Supreme Court upheld the new congressional map they drew. The map slices territory out of the Kansas City-area district Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids has carried by a 2-to-1 margin and replaces it with three counties that ex-President Donald Trump carried by more than 40 percentage points in 2020. Republicans argued that Davids still would have carried the new district two years ago and that the map was a fair way to rebalance the number of residents in each of the state’s four districts after 10 years of population shifts. Attorneys for the Kansas voters and voting rights group that challenged the map urged the state Supreme Court to declare that broad language about “inalienable natural rights” and “equal protection and benefits” in the state’s bill of rights bars overly partisan and racial gerrymandering. But the justices apparently didn’t see it that way. Their decision bucks what has been a trend in a small but growing number of states since the conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision in 2019 that complaints about partisan gerrymandering are political issues and not for the federal courts to resolve.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: After a disastrous showing last summer that included long lines and a severe lack of water for attendees amid blazing heat, the Railbird Festival “will take a pause in 2022,” according to a Tuesday post on the event’s Twitter account. More than 30,000 people flowed into the music festival at Keeneland in Lexington in August 2021 as attendees anxiously awaited bands like My Morning Jacket, Dave Matthews Band, Leon Bridges, Jason Isbell and Bendigo Fletcher. However, with anticipation came perspiration as the two-day event held in the middle of summer was sold out, which meant long lines for everything, including water. During the first of the festival’s two days, patrons were expected to bring empty bottles to fill while at the event but were not allowed to bring any water within their containers. That, mixed with the 20- to 30-minute lines to access the limited water stations placed around the grounds, angered attendees as temperatures reached 90 degrees. According to its Twitter account, Railbird Festival said organizers have taken the criticisms and concerns from former festivalgoers “to heart” and are “working hard behind the scenes to create an exceptional experience for the next edition of the festival.” The fest will reopen June 3-4, 2023, at its new downtown venue, Red Mile Gaming & Racing.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A state lawmaker’s attempt to set restrictions on what public schools can teach about race was rejected by a House committee Tuesday, with some panel members saying the legislation needlessly encroached on state and local education officials’ duties, while other said the legislation was so broadly written it could squelch classroom debate. Both bills were by Rep. Ray Garofalo, a St. Bernard Parish Republican who lost his chairmanship of the House Education Committee last year after pushing similar legislation over the objections of the House leadership. Garofalo was back before the same panel during a livestreamed meeting at the Capitol in Baton Rouge. His House Bill 1014 listed several teaching restrictions, including forbidding teaching that anyone of any race bears “collective guilt” for past actions by members of the same race; that the United States is “systemically racist”; or that anyone should be “adversely or advantageously treated” on the basis of race. Similar bills have been proposed or passed in a number of Republican-controlled states in response to the recent spate of publicity about “critical race theory,” an academic framework dating to the 1970s that centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation’s institutions. Critical race theory is not a fixture of K-12 education but has become a catchall political buzzword for any teaching in schools about race and American history.\n\nMaine\n\nDyer Brook: Residents of a town in far northern Maine are experiencing trouble with mail delivery that officials blame on roads full of potholes. Officials with the U.S. Postal Service told Dyer Brook officials last week that mail carriers were suspending deliveries because of unsafe roads, WGME-TV reports. Officials said deliveries have resumed as the potholes are starting to get filled in. WGME-TV reports residents were told mail would be held in a neighboring town during the service disruption.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: More than 3,000 customs, hot rods, street machines, classics and muscle cars will assemble for various car shows, contests, parades and live auctions in the city from Thursday to Sunday for the 31st annual Cruisin’ event. Residents and visitors alike are reminded to tap the brakes as they cruise along Coastal Highway, as the resort town will be designated a special event zone for the rest of the week, meaning lower speed limits. Violators will face increased fines and penalties for violations and, in extreme cases, arrest. The Ocean City Police Department will remain on high alert during the entirety of the event. Officers from the Ocean City Police Department, Maryland State Police and the Worcester County Sheriff’s Office will strictly enforce all traffic laws. Officers will also enforce all laws for spectators who incite drivers for spinning of wheels or burn-outs, as well as for the driver. According to the OCPD, significant traffic congestion and alternate traffic patterns are anticipated throughout the weekend. Due to the high traffic volume, all motorists are advised to plan their drives accordingly to ensure they arrive at their destinations safely and on time.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The commission put together to study the racial implications of the Massachusetts state seal and motto has voted unanimously to recommend that both be replaced. The Special Commission on the Official Seal and Motto of the Commonwealth, made up of lawmakers, members of Indigenous tribes, historians and others, made the decision at its meeting Tuesday, GBH News reports. The current seal that appears on state flags, which dates to the late 19th century, features a depiction of a Native American man beneath a colonist’s arm brandishing a sword. Critics say it references the defeat of local tribes at the hands of English colonists centuries ago. The state’s Latin motto –which translates into English as, “By the sword we seek peace, but peace only under liberty” – dates to about 1659 and is attributed to English politician Algernon Sydney, according to the secretary of state’s office. Brian Boyles, co-chair of the 20-member commission, pointed out at Tuesday’s meeting that the face on the seal was based on a photograph from the Bureau of Ethnology in Washington, D.C., of Thomas Little Shell, a Chippewa leader who never lived in Massachusetts. “No Native residents were consulted in this selection,” Boyles said. The next step is seeking new designs to the seal and motto.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: A prosecutor said Wednesday that he will only decide whether to charge a white police officer in last month’s fatal shooting of Patrick Lyoya, a Black man, after he finishes discussing it with experts. Kent County prosecutor Chris Becker acknowledged that the “investigation appears to be moving painstakingly slowly,” six weeks after Grand Rapids Officer Christopher Schurr shot Lyoya in the back of the head during a struggle. “It is imperative that I review all the facts and evidence before making a charging decision,” Becker said. “In this situation, my decision can only be made by taking the time to gather all the available information, both from (state police) and from state and national experts.” State police submitted a report April 28, but Becker said he requested more information. “I ask for your continued patience,” he told the public in a statement. Schurr killed Lyoya, 26, on April 4, minutes after stopping his car because the officer said it didn’t match its license plate. Lyoya didn’t produce a driver’s license and began to run. The officer quickly caught him, and the pair grappled on someone’s lawn while a bystander recorded video. Schurr shot Lyoya in the head after demanding that Lyoya “let go” of his police Taser.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCass Lake: The federal government will soon return nearly 12,000 acres of land in northern Minnesota it wrongfully took from the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe decades ago. The federal Bureau of Indian Affairs thought it had the power to sell tribal tracts without the consent of the majority of the owners, a misinterpretation of an Interior Department order back in 1948, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Tribal District 3 Representative LeRoy Staples Fairbanks III said the land transfers were acts of outright theft. “They mailed out letters to people. If they didn’t get a response, they took them as ‘yes.’ They took them as approval,” he said. Fairbanks said he asked his staff to begin looking into the issue in 2012 after hearing from community members for many years. Then-President Donald Trump signed legislation in December 2020 allowing for the return of the land, which is located within the Chippewa National Forest in Cass County. The land is expected to be returned to the tribe in the coming months now that the band has submitted its survey detailing each of the parcels involved. Fairbanks said the Leech Lake band’s relationship with the Cass County leaders played an important role in getting the Leech Lake Reservation Restoration Act signed into law.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: A Catholic elementary school that primarily serves Black and Hispanic families in the Mississippi Delta is closing after more than 70 years, following a sex abuse scandal, declining enrollment and a steep decrease in donations. St. Francis of Assisi School in Greenwood notified teachers and families Friday that it will close at the end of this week, the Greenwood Commonwealth reports. It joins more than 200 other Catholic schools in the U.S. that have closed permanently during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the National Catholic Educational Association. The school in Greenwood was founded in 1951 and is run by the Franciscan Friars of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Province, a Wisconsin-based religious community that opened a mission in an impoverished part of Mississippi. In recent years, the school in Greenwood has been tarnished by a clergy sex abuse scandal dating back to the 1990s. Paul West, a former friar who was a teacher and principal, was convicted in April of abusing a former student at the school. The Mississippi attorney general’s office later dropped a second set of charges against West in the abuse of another student as the 62-year-old former friar began a 45-year prison sentence.\n\nMissouri\n\nPotosi: A prosecutor is seeking to vacate the conviction of a man who spent nearly two decades behind bars for the 1998 death of his mother – a crime he and others insist he did not commit. Washington County Prosecuting Attorney Joshua Hedgecorth has asked a judge to set aside 38-year-old Michael Politte’s second-degree murder conviction, the Kansas City Star reports. Politte was released from prison last month, two months after he was granted parole. Politte was just 14 when Rita Politte died in a fire at the family home in the eastern Missouri town of Hopewell. Michael and a friend were also in the home but managed to escape the blaze. Politte’s lawyers said the boys were awakened by smoke and scrambled to escape, before Politte found the burning body of his mother. Investigators said the fire was started with gasoline and determined Rita Politte had also suffered blunt force head trauma. The investigation focused on her teenage son as the main suspect, and four years later he was convicted as an adult and sentenced to life in prison. The only physical evidence investigators had to link him to the crime was what they said was the presence of gasoline on the teen’s shoes. But that finding was based on now-discredited fire investigation techniques, and the state has conceded there was no gasoline on his shoes.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Residents who want to cast a vote in next month’s primary election must be registered with their county elections office by noon June 6, under an order by the Montana Supreme Court. The justices, in a 4-1 ruling Tuesday, said changes to election laws passed by the 2021 Legislature will remain in effect for the June 7 primary. District Court Judge Michael Moses of Billings had ruled last month that a law ending Election Day voter registration appeared to unconstitutionally burden the right to vote, and he temporarily blocked it for this year’s primary election. The Supreme Court lifted that injunction, agreeing with Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen that three local elections have been successfully held under those laws. The court also noted the plaintiffs – the Montana Democratic Party, Native American organizations and youth advocacy groups – had not challenged the laws prior to the earlier elections. Sheila Hogan, executive director of MDP, has said the 2021 voting laws were an attack on the constitutional right to vote and more greatly affected young, Native, elderly or disabled voters and others who might have difficulty getting to the polls. Western Native Voice, whose work includes registering Native Americans to vote, said in recent years its largest voter registration days have been on election days.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The City Council has approved a redevelopment plan for a downtown property to become a skyscraper housing Mutual of Omaha’s headquarters, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The plan involves the city buying an existing parking garage and Mutual adding a block of downtown property as part of its $600 million proposal, according to the newspaper.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: People start more wildfires that burn more acres in the state than natural events like lightning. In the past four years, Nevadans – either intentionally or unintentionally – started 1,419 fires, while natural events such as lightning started 1,015 fires. Those human-sparked fires burned 776,125 acres, nearly 48,000 acres more than started naturally. In 2018, illegal fireworks set off near Winnemucca started the largest fire in Nevada’s history, burning 439,000 acres. Other significant causes of human-started fires include arson, power lines that brush against vegetation, chains dragging behind trailers causing sparks, target shooting, and campfires. The most notable year was 2020, when nearly half of the 491 wildfires in Nevada were sparked by human causes. While Nevada’s largest, most destructive fires have not been caused by target shooters, “there is just a lot of them in the wildland urban interface areas, drawing down resources needed on other wildland fires,” said Kacey KC, Nevada state forester and fire warden. Part of that is due to Nevada’s rapid growth – the state is one of the fastest growing in the nation. Areas that were once remote locations for target shooting and discharging fireworks are now close to residential areas.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPeterborough: A 168-year-old company known for its handwoven, hardwood baskets is closing its factory and stopping production, partly because of an insect pest that has been destroying ash trees. The Peterboro Basket Company has been in business since 1854. The company said in a recent announcement that the baskets “are principally made of U.S. grown, Appalachian White Ash,” which is also typically used for baseball bats and ax handles. “For some years the Emerald Ash Borer beetle has reduced the availability of the wood used to make the baskets,” the company said. The emerald ash borer has destroyed tens of millions of trees in the U.S. and Canada. The company said other extreme labor shortages, ongoing supply chain issues and owners who are “ready to retire” are among the other considerations in deciding to close. The factory plans to produce its last basket this summer or fall.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nCedar Grove: Gov. Phil Murphy announced proposed legislation Wednesday that would create licensing for police that he said would make it easier to fire rogue officers. “It will send a strong message that we are rebuilding the bonds of trust between the police and residents, especially in Black and brown communities,” Murphy said during the announcement at the Essex County Police Academy in Cedar Grove with Acting Attorney General Matt Platkin. New Jersey has been grappling with the question of licensing police officers for at least the past four years. Licensing was one of several recommendations the Asbury Park Press made in its police misconduct series “Protecting the Shield” that were embraced by then-Attorney General Gurbir Grewal after its publication in January 2018. The series highlighted the fact that New Jersey stands nearly alone in the nation in failing to license police officers. Rhode Island and Hawaii are frequently mentioned as the other states without licensing. But police licensing is a broad catch-all that obscures some of the details of the process of removing a police officer from policing, which varies around the country. Decertification is more to the point. But decertification as it has stood in New Jersey for decades doesn’t have any teeth.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A conservative-backed foundation that aims to post online registration records for voters across the country urged a federal judge Tuesday to override objections by New Mexico election regulators who say the initiative violates state law and would discourage people from registering to vote out of privacy concerns. The VoteRef.com website does not list details of how people voted regarding candidates or initiatives. The Voter Reference Foundation has posted voter rolls from at least 20 states that can be searched by names or addresses to verify where people live and view whether they voted in various past elections. A companion website highlights the difference between the number of ballots cast according to certified election results and the number of people listed as having voted on registration rolls at various points in time as local registrations are added and purged. Eddie Greim, an attorney for Voter Reference Foundation, urged a federal judge to intervene and ensure voter rolls can be published online to provide direct accountability and allow people to vet the accuracy of most registration records submitted by others. New Mexico election regulators say the unprecedented efforts flouts state statutes that limit the acquisition and sharing of voter registration rolls to governmental activities and political campaigns.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says he’s considering a run for Congress after a legal battle over the state’s political maps opened up a seat in Brooklyn. The two-term Democrat, who left office at the end of 2021, said Wednesday that he’s formed an exploratory committee for New York’s 10th Congressional District. The Democratic-heavy district will include a large slice of western Brooklyn, where he lives. New York’s 10th District is currently represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler, but the state’s political maps are being redrawn under supervision of a New York judge after a court found they were unconstitutional and gerrymandered in favor of Democrats. The court this week unveiled new proposed maps that significantly draw a number of New York City-based districts. Nadler said he believed the maps were changed so much that they are also unconstitutional, but if the proposed districts become final at the end of this week, he intends to run in the 12th District representing Manhattan. The primary contest has been pushed back from June to Aug. 23. De Blasio toyed with running for governor this year before deciding to sit it out. He also had a short-lived run for president in 2019.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The General Assembly returned Wednesday to Raleigh for its traditional budget-adjustment work session, but lawmakers aren’t getting out of the blocks quickly. The House and Senate gaveled in and out sparsely attended floor sessions at midday Wednesday. Republican leaders in both chambers say committee meetings and recorded votes won’t occur until next week. The delay is not surprising given that dozens of incumbents have been back home competing in Tuesday’s primaries. Lawmakers began introducing bills Wednesday. The chief job for lawmakers is to approve changes to the second year of the already-enacted two-year budget. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper made recommendations last week. House Speaker Tim Moore told reporters Wednesday that he expected the session to last five or six weeks. That’s in line with Senate leader Phil Berger’s recent comments that he and Moore were aiming to adjourn the session around July 1, when the new fiscal year begins. Other legislation pending from 2021 likely to be debated now include bills that would legalize medical marijuana and sports wagering. Moore said he didn’t expect cannabis legislation, which has yet to clear the Senate, to be considered in the House until 2023.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nDevils Lake: Horizon Financial Bank is holding its first ever “Piggie Pageant,” featuring nothing but locally made piggy banks. Teaming up with a third grade class from Sweetwater Elementary School, bank representatives read students “The Story of the Original Piggie Bank” and talked to the kids about the importance of savings their money. Sami J. Lindenberg, bookkeeper for the bank, said they also donated the book to the classroom library, explained the rules of the pageant to the kids and instructed them to paint their own piggy banks for the competition. Community members are invited to cast their ballots for their favorite pig. Voting, to last through Friday, is anonymous and can be done by stopping into the bank or online, through Horizon’s Facebook page. After the pageant is over, the piggies will be returned to the students to take home and keep.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Judges would be required to consider criminal suspects’ threat to public safety when setting bail amounts under legislation and a separate proposal for a state constitutional amendment being advanced by Ohio House Republicans. The GOP proposals follow a ruling by a divided state Supreme Court earlier this year that said a $1.5 million bond for a Cincinnati man accused of fatally shooting a man during a robbery was too high. The measures were scheduled for votes in the House on Wednesday, but they were pulled from the agenda. House Speaker Bob Cupp said more discussion was needed on how the proposals mesh with bigger conversations on changes to the state’s bail system. Lawmakers must weigh a number of issues, including people stuck in jail on nonviolent offenses “simply because they can’t afford to get out,” said Cupp, R-Lima. The Ohio Supreme Court majority said safety concerns expressed by the victim’s family members and evidence that the suspect presented a false ID when confronted after fleeing to Las Vegas weren’t factors relevant to the amount of bail. The court said public safety concerns could be met by other requirements, such as electronic monitoring, which was done in the case of the Cincinnati murder suspect, according to court records.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Republican leaders in the state House and Senate announced an agreement Tuesday on a $9.8 billion spending plan for the upcoming fiscal year – the largest in state history. Unlike previous years, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt was not included in a statement announcing the agreement, and his office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposal. “This year’s budget agreement reflects that the Oklahoma Legislature prioritizes education, law enforcement and healthcare,” Senate President Pro Tempore Greg Treat said in the statement. Among the key provisions is a plan to send “inflation relief” cash payments in December of $75 to each individual taxpayer and $150 to married couples who file jointly. The deal includes a $32.5 million increase in funding to the Department of Human Services to eliminate the waiting list of more than 5,000 developmentally disabled Oklahomans to receive state services. While the average budget increase was about 10%, some state agencies received boosts, while others had a reduction in funding. Public schools received a modest increase of about 0.54% over last year’s budget, while colleges and universities saw an increase of about 7.45%. The House and Senate saw their budgets increased by 19% and 15%, respectively, while the budget for the governor’s office remained flat.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Voters in Multnomah County have elected a female sheriff for the first time in history. Current Undersheriff Nicole Morrisey O’Donnell, a 26-year veteran of the agency, handily won the top job with two-thirds of the vote and will replace Sheriff Mike Reese on Jan. 1. Reese could not run for reelection due to term limits. Morrisey O’Donnell received key endorsements from Reese, former Govs. Barbara Roberts and Ted Kulongoski, and the mayors of three cities –including Portland – that contract with the county for law enforcement services, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Morrisey O’Donnell called the day a win for the community and “trailblazers everywhere.” “I promise to work every day to reduce gun violence, bring compassionate solutions to the homelessness crisis, and collaborate with partners to make our community safer,” she said in a statement. “I know it’s a big task, and I’m honored and encouraged by your trust in me.” Morrisey O’Donnell was hired by the sheriff’s office in 1996 as a corrections deputy and was appointed undersheriff in August, making her the first woman in Multnomah County to serve as second-in-command in the sheriff’s office. She previously led both the agency’s corrections and law enforcement divisions, the newspaper reports.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: One of the Legislature’s most powerful Republicans lost a primary race, and another was in real danger Wednesday of going down to defeat, both targeted by challengers from the right. As vote counting continued, state Sen. Pat Browne of Lehigh County was a few dozen votes behind school board member and pilot Jarrett Coleman. State Rep. Stan Saylor of York County lost to Wendy Jo Fink, who promised to eliminate school property taxes. Both incumbents were attacked for being Harrisburg insiders. Saylor was elected in 1992 and Browne in 2005 after a decade in the state House. They chair the Appropriations Committee in their respective chambers. The committees are the conduit for the state budget legislation and play a prominent role in much of the Legislature’s business. Another longtime House Republican from York County also was looking at a possible defeat: Rep. Keith Gillespie was trailing badly to Joe D’Orsie, the communications director at an Apostolic Church. Gillespie was first elected 20 years ago. On the Democratic side, 12-year incumbent Rep. Pam DeLissio lost to nurse Tarik Khan in a Philadelphia district.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNarragansett: Members of the Narragansett Indian Tribe will be able to walk onto Narragansett Town Beach for free this summer despite the objections of some residents who voiced concerns about overcrowding. The Town Council narrowly voted to approve the change late Monday night during a raucous meeting that lasted for more than four hours. “It’s about the beach, but in many ways, it’s about more than just the beach,” said Town Council President Jesse Pugh, who introduced the resolution along with Councilwoman Deb Kopech. Typically, anyone over the age of 12 must pay a $12 admission fee to walk onto Narragansett Town Beach, on top of paying for parking. Town residents have the option of purchasing a discounted seasonal pass. Pugh said Monday that members of the Narragansett tribe, regardless of whether they are town residents, would be able obtain a seasonal pass for free by showing their tribal identification cards at the beach’s sales office. The pass will be good only for this summer, and the town has no obligation to continue the program after this year. Supporters see the move as a small but meaningful way to honor the tribe from which the town took its name. But opponents said it seemed like the measure was being rushed through.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A deputy charged in the deaths of two women who drowned in a locked police van in 2018 ignored barricades and drove into rapidly rising floodwaters against advice from his supervisors and officials on the highway, a prosecutor said Monday. Former Horry County Deputy Stephen Flood is on trial on two counts of involuntary manslaughter and reckless homicide for the drownings of the women he was taking to mental health facilities under a court order as rain from Hurricane Florence inundated eastern South Carolina. Flood faces up to five years in prison if convicted of involuntary manslaughter and 10 years in prison for each reckless homicide charges. Flood could have prevented the deaths of Wendy Newton, 45, and Nicolette Green, 43, four separate times that evening, Solicitor Ed Clements said in his opening statement Monday at the Marion County courthouse. First, he could have listened to people in the Horry County Sheriff’s Office to avoid the shortest route, which was along a highway that had flooded in major storms before, Clements said. Flood then drove around barricades closing state Highway 9 near Nichols, ignored National Guard troops in the road past the barricades who warned them the water was too deep to traverse, and drove his police transport van into water covering the highway near the Little Pee Dee River bridge, the prosecutor said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State lawmakers on Wednesday unanimously approved a report finding that Republican Gov. Kristi Noem’s daughter got preferential treatment while she was applying for a real estate appraiser’s license in 2020. The findings of last year’s legislative probe, which was conducted by a Republican-controlled Government Operations and Audit Committee, repudiate Noem’s insistence that her daughter, Kassidy Peters, didn’t receive special treatment with her application. State lawmakers on Wednesday approved the committee’s findings by a voice vote and without discussion. Noem, who is running for reelection and is positioned for a 2024 White House bid, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, despite holding a meeting that included Peters and key decision-makers from the agency that was evaluating her license application just days after the agency moved to deny her the license. After the meeting, Peters received another opportunity to demonstrate she could meet federal standards and was ultimately awarded the license. The Republican governor on Wednesday stuck to her defense, saying in a statement that “Kassidy followed the same process as other applicants did to obtain her license. She did not receive preferential treatment.” But the report says Peters received three opportunities to demonstrate to state regulators that she could meet federal standards with her appraisals, which deviated from the standard certification process of two opportunities before an application is denied.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s highest court ruled Wednesday that Republican Gov. Bill Lee’s school voucher program does not violate the state constitution, clearing the path for families to soon use taxpayer dollars on private schools. The Tennessee Supreme Court’s 3-2 decision overturns several lower court rulings that had previously determined the program violated the Tennessee Constitution’s “home rule,” which says the Legislature can’t pass measures singling out individual counties without local support. Under the law, the voucher program would apply only to Nashville and to Shelby County, which includes Memphis – the areas with the lowest-performing schools and regions with Democratic political strongholds who opposed the measure. The law squeaked through the GOP-controlled General Assembly in 2019, with Republicans repeatedly tweaking the legislation to ensure it applied only to Democratic-controlled areas after acknowledging it was unpopular among their constituents. “Every child deserves a high-quality education, and today’s Tennessee Supreme Court opinion on (the voucher law) puts parents in Memphis and Nashville one step closer to finding the best educational fit for their children,” Lee said.\n\nTexas\n\nMcAllen: U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Tuesday that authorities were prepared for an anticipated increase in migrants crossing the border from Mexico, days before a public health order is set to end after being used to turn people away nearly 2 million times without a chance to seek asylum. A federal judge may order that pandemic-related asylum limits continue, but Mayorkas offered public reassurances of readiness after a whirlwind tour of Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. Homeland Security has said it will prepare for as many as 18,000 daily crossings, compared with a daily average of about 7,800 in April, though Mayorkas emphasized that those are not projections. Mayorkas visited a remodeled processing center in McAllen, the region’s largest city, where migrants sat on metal benches and on sleeping mats spread on the floor, as aluminum thermal blankets made rustling noises. Televisions pointed into cells. The center reopened about six weeks ago for about 1,200 migrants. Chain-link fences have been replaced with cinder block walls. Cells have an open roof that Border Patrol officials said provides better ventilation.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A new report detailing the risk of wildfires across the nation for the next 30 years found southwest Utah to be one of the riskiest areas in the country. The report, released Monday by the nonprofit First Street Foundation, used a 30-year simulation of fires across America and a variety of metrics to calculate fire risk, including data from the U.S. Forest Service’s LANDFIRE program, weather reports from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, historical records of where wildfires have occurred in the past and changes in climate trends. It found approximately 79.8 million properties in the lower 48 states are at wildfire risk. The report highlighted several counties in Utah with a lot of structures at risk for fire. In Utah County, there are over 118,000 structures at risk. In Salt Lake County, there are 138,600. But while those counties had the largest numerical risk, the areas with the highest risk per household were in southwestern Utah. The report estimates that of Washington County’s 101,400 structures, 93.6% are at a 0.2% or worse risk of being involved in a wildfire this year, compared to 35.2% in Utah County and 9.3% in Salt Lake County. Overall, 57.7% of structures in Utah are at a 0.03% wildfire risk, while 24% of structures are at a 0.2% risk.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: Planned Parenthood of Northern New England will close four health centers in Vermont and one in New Hampshire next month, while also expanding the days of operation at seven other centers in the region. The organization announced the “difficult but strategic decision” decision to shutter part-time health centers in Bennington, Hyde Park, Middlebury and St. Albans in Vermont and in Claremont, New Hampshire, effective June 12, said Kai Williams, senior vice president of health care delivery, in a statement. “We believe these decisions will ensure that we can continue to serve northern New England for generations to come,” she said. Over the course of a year, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England will expand the days of operation to a minimum of four or five days a week at health centers in Barre, Brattleboro and Williston, Vermont; in Exeter, New Hampshire; and in Sanford, Biddeford, and Topsham, Maine, the organization said. Operating hours will not change at facilities in Burlington, Rutland, St. Johnsbury and White River Junction, Vermont; in Derry, Keene and Manchester, New Hampshire; or in Portland, Maine.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A Virginia State Police pilot was temporarily blinded during a search for a suspect when a person on the ground aimed a laser pointer at the police aircraft, officials said. Troopers were helping the Nottoway County Sheriff’s Office with a pursuit and search for a suspect near the town of Crewe on Monday, state police said in a news release. While one of the agency’s airplanes was aiding in the search, the pilot was temporarily blinded by a laser pointer being used on the ground, police said. When the pilot regained his vision, he and his co-pilot identified the source of the laser and provided troopers on the ground with an exact location and address. As the airplane continued to assist with the search, the laser continued to track the aircraft. Crewe police officers and Virginia State Police troopers found a woman and the laser pointer and took her into custody. The woman was charged with one felony count of interfering with the operation of an aircraft, police said. The Federal Aviation Administration was notified of the incident, which is under investigation. WRIC-TV reports that state police said the woman and the suspect police were searching for were not connected.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Rainier National Park: Two climbers were rescued by helicopter Friday after one fell into a crevasse the day before on Mount Rainier. The climbers had been in contact with the National Park Service beginning last Wednesday evening, when they stopped their summit bid at 12,800 feet because of adverse weather, according to the NPS. They didn’t initially ask for assistance, the Seattle Times reports. But the climbers called for help Thursday after one of them fell 80 feet into a crevasse at about 12,200 feet above sea level and suffered arm and leg injuries, officials said. The climber who fell was able to communicate with Mount Rainier National Park dispatchers, as well as his partner on the Kautz Glacier, but authorities could not immediately launch a rescue effort because of deep snow, limited visibility and strong and erratic winds, according to the Park Service. Heavy winds thwarted rescuers’ efforts to reach the climbers Friday morning, but rescuers were able to reach the pair several hours later. The climbers were on the Kautz Glacier climbing route below the Wapowety Cleaver and had planned to descend the Disappointment Cleaver route when one of them fell into the crevasse, officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The finishing touches on a six-lane upgrade of the West Virginia Turnpike in Beckley are getting underway and expected to last about eight weeks. The $140 million widening project on the 8-mile stretch was finished last fall, but final paving and striping were delayed to allow holiday traffic to have full access on the heavily traveled road. Paving and striping will take place between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. to minimize impact on motorists, said Jeff Miller, executive director of the West Virginia Parkways Authority. Delays should be expected until the work is complete. The speed limit in the zone will be 55 mph, the state Department of Transportation said. Miller said it will be strictly enforced. “It’s a very, very busy area, and we just don’t want anything bad to happen to anybody,” he said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge on Tuesday voiced skepticism about a lawsuit challenging the legality of private grant money awarded to the city to help run the 2020 election, calling some of the arguments “ridiculous,” a “stretch” and “close to preposterous.” The lawsuit argues that private grants given to Madison from a group funded by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg amounted to illegal bribery. The Wisconsin Elections Commission in December rejected that complaint, and this lawsuit is an appeal of that decision. Four nearly identical lawsuits are also pending in Milwaukee, Green Bay, Racine and Kenosha. The case in Madison was the first to hold arguments. Three Wisconsin courts have previously rejected similar lawsuits arguing that the grants were illegal. Similar lawsuits filed in other swing states have also been rejected. Dane County Circuit Judge Stephen Ehlke referenced those rulings when he questioned attorney Erick Kaardal Tuesday. Kardaal said the commission got it wrong, and Madison should not have been allowed to use a portion of the grant money to pay for absentee ballot drop boxes because, he said, they are illegal, based on a Waukesha County circuit court ruling issued after the election. The Wisconsin Supreme Court is currently weighing an appeal of that ruling.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: The father of a Marine killed in an attack on an airport in Afghanistan last year is planning to run for the state House as a Republican, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Jim McCollum’s son, Rylee, died at age 20 in a suicide bombing in Kabul during the U.S. withdrawal from the Taliban-run nation. Wyoming’s 16th legislative district is currently represented by Democratic Rep. Mike Yin, who ran unopposed in 2020, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/14/bear-crop-circles-corpse-blood-subway-cameras-news-around-states/118819930/", "title": "Bear crop circles, corpse blood: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuskegee: A lawsuit has been filed that could decide the fate of a Confederate monument that has stood in a square at the center of a nearly all-Black city for 115 years. WSFA-TV reports the Macon County Commission has filed suit against both the local and state chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, arguing that the county owns the property where the statue is located and wants title to the plot. While records show the county gave the land to the Confederate heritage group for use as a park for white people in 1906, the suit contends the property belongs to the county because the county’s action was illegal. Macon County, which was joined in the suit by three Black residents, said it is willing to negotiate with the Daughters of the Confederacy. If someone comes forward, they could settle and give the statue to the group. The statue has been the subject of periodic demonstrations for decades in Tuskegee, which is almost all Black and the home of Tuskegee University. The nation’s first Black military pilots trained in the city during World War II. Protesters tried and failed to pull down the monument in the 1960s. In July, City Council member Johnny Ford and another man used an electric saw to cut into the statue, but the damage was later repaired by a crew hired by the United Daughters of the Confederacy.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A lawmaker requested and has received an excusal from the state Senate until mid-January, citing the challenges of traveling to Juneau from Anchorage after she was suspended from flying on Alaska Airlines earlier this year. Republican Sen. Lora Reinbold on Thursday requested the excusal from Saturday through Jan. 15. She said she was unaware of any other airline flying to the state capital during that period. Juneau is accessible by air or water, including via the state-run ferry system. Lawmakers are in their third special session of the year, due to end Tuesday. The Legislature has yet to finalize a dividend amount to pay residents this year. Alaska Airlines said in an April statement that Reinbold was not allowed to fly with the carrier “for her continued refusal to comply with employee instruction regarding the current mask policy.” Reinbold – has been critical of masking rules, including at the Capitol – said she had been in compliance and called the ban political. She said the ferry schedule is limited, and she doesn’t want to hold up legislative proceedings if she cannot reach Juneau “in a timely fashion.” After her suspension, Reinbold drove through part of Canada and took a ferry to reach the capital, a two-day trip. If there is another special session, she said it should be held in a community connected to Alaska’s main road system.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State auditors say public safety may be put at risk by reporting gaps and a backlog in the database that Arizona uses for conducting background checks of people seeking certain jobs or occupational licenses and for helping prosecutors and judges decide whether defendants should get plea bargains or lenient sentences. The problems exist in the state’s central depository of criminal history records, a database maintained by the Arizona Department of Public Safety and updated with case reports from law enforcement agencies and courts, the Auditor General’s Office said in a report released Friday. The auditors said the database didn’t include 17% of a sampling of 103 felony offense records from four Arizona law enforcement agencies, and 40% of a sampling of 30 felony offense records in the database were missing dispositions, such as whether a case was dropped or the defendant was convicted. The database is important because criminal justice agencies use it “when making decisions that could help deter further offenses, such as decisions regarding plea bargains, and sentencing repeat offenders,” and the records also are checked to see whether people seeking jobs in fields such as teaching and child care have criminal histories, the auditors’ report said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A former state senator said Monday that he would run for the Republican nomination for secretary of state, becoming the second to challenge the incumbent in next year’s GOP primary. Former Arkansas Sen. Eddie Joe Williams announced his bid for the seat currently held by Republican Secretary of State John Thurston, who was first elected in 2018. Thurston already faced a primary challenge from state Rep. Mark Lowery. Joshua Price, a former Pulaski County election commissioner, is the only Democrat running for the seat. Williams said he was running to “make sure our elections are fair, honest, and always transparent.” The former Cabot mayor was elected to the state Senate in 2010 and was the chamber’s first Republican majority leader after the GOP won a Senate majority in 2012. Williams left the Legislature after former President Donald Trump appointed him in 2017 to be the federal representative to the Southern States Energy Board. The nonprofit organization focuses on energy issues in 16 Southern states.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America installed its first openly transgender bishop in a service held in San Francisco’s Grace Cathedral on Saturday. The Rev. Megan Rohrer will lead one of the church’s 65 synods, overseeing nearly 200 congregations in Northern California and northern Nevada. “My call is … to be up to the same messy, loving things I was up to before,” Rohrer told worshippers. “But mostly, if you’ll let me, and I think you will, my hope is to love you and, beyond that, to love what you love.” Rohrer was elected in May to serve a six-year term as bishop of the Sierra Pacific Synod. “I step into this role because a diverse community of Lutherans in Northern California and Nevada prayerfully and thoughtfully voted to do a historic thing,” Rohrer said in a statement. “My installation will celebrate all that is possible when we trust God to shepherd us forward.” Rohrer, who uses the pronoun “they,” previously served as pastor of Grace Lutheran Church in San Francisco and a chaplain coordinator for the city’s police department and also helped minister to the city’s homeless and LGTBQ community. Rohrer, married with two children, became one of seven LGBTQ pastors accepted by the progressive Evangelical Lutheran church in 2010. The church is one of the largest Christian denominations in the U.S.\n\nColorado\n\nBrighton: A man convicted of vehicular homicide for hitting a car during a Facebook livestream that showed him speeding on a highway has been sentenced to 15 years in prison. The Adams County District Attorney’s Office said 44-year-old Bryan Kirby was sentenced Friday. A jury convicted Kirby of the vehicular homicide charge in July, as well as of reckless manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident causing death. Kirby was accused of driving as fast as 167 mph at night on a highway near Denver in October 2018 while making comments to viewers about his speed. At the end, he rapidly crossed from the left lane to the right and crashed into a sedan from behind at 120 mph, prosecutors said. Kirby fled the crash. The driver of the sedan died at the scene. “Mr. Kirby’s unconscionable and reckless actions took a life and destroyed a family,” District Attorney Brian Mason said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: About 300 refugees from Afghanistan are expected to arrive in the state in the coming weeks and months as immigrant advocacy groups work to find permanent homes for them, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal and advocates said Monday. Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, and resettlement workers anticipate that refugees will begin arriving in large numbers in communities across the U.S., perhaps as early as next week, after clearing security checks and other vetting. Some 50,000 Afghans are expected to be admitted to the United States under a program called “Operation Allies Welcome,” including translators, drivers and others who helped the U.S. military during the 20-year war and who fear reprisals by the Taliban, who seized power last month. “We owe these Afghan allies the safety and escape they need from murder and torture they face and their families face in Afghanistan,” Blumenthal said at a news conference with advocates in New Haven. “They sided with us. They went into combat with our troops. They protected them and our diplomats. They now have targets on their backs.” Blumenthal said he is pushing Congress to approve financial aid for resettlement services, including housing, job placement, clothing and other needs. He said the cost could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: Three teenagers were hospitalized with injuries incurred at Funland on the the city’s boardwalk Sunday night, according to Sussex County Emergency Medical Services. Two patients were stable and sent to Beebe Healthcare, and one was taken to Christiana Hospital with a head injury, said Glenn Marshall, public information officer for Sussex County EMS. Rehoboth Beach Police Department later reported that the injured were two girls, 14 and 15 years old, and one 16-year-old boy. The two girls were released from Beebe, but Rehoboth Beach police said the boy was still in serious condition at Christiana as of 3 p.m. Monday. The incident happened in the area of the Superflip 360 about 7:45 p.m., according to a statement from Funland Personnel Manager Chris Darr. The injured guest was not riding the attraction, he said. “Initial efforts have determined that the injuries result from the individuals be struck by debris caused by an air storage tank failure,” a Rehoboth Beach police press release said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Foo Fighters’ performance at the 9:30 Club last week came with breaking news: Frontman Dave Grohl told the crowd that an exact replica of the original version of the venue is in the works, WUSA-TV reports. The special surprise show, part of a reopening week celebration at the 9:30 Club, was one of its first in-person shows since the coronavirus pandemic began. Grohl, who grew up in northern Virginia, played some of his earliest shows as a teenager in punk bands at the 9:30 Club. But that was the old 9:30 Club, he said Thursday, reminiscing about the old days and describing its 199-person capacity as intimate. “That was our church,” Grohl said in a video provided by I.M.P., which owns the venue. “That’s where we all played first. That’s where R.E.M. played first; that’s where the Chili Peppers played first; that’s where Nirvana played first ... magic happened in that room.” Grohl said an exact replica of the old club will be coming to 2047 9th Street NW, where The Satellite Room used to be. “For all you people who never got to see the old 9:30 Club, you’ll get to see that ... next door someday,” Grohl said on stage. “And let me tell you, if it’s the same vibe as the old 9:30 Club, you’ll see some real magic.”\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A Miami Beach apartment building owned by the mayor of the adjacent town where a condominium collapsed in June has given his tenants 45 days to vacate the building so extensive repairs can be completed. The lease termination letter from Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said workers have been waiting for the city of Miami Beach to issue permits to repair the damage caused by Hurricane Irma in 2017. He said he hopes the final permit will be issued imminently so work can be completed to the front of the building as well as the elevator. “We regret that this work will create potentially dangerous conditions for residents,” Burkett’s letter said. In addition, he said the Lois Apartments will also undergo the required 40-year inspection early, due to the Champlain Towers South collapse. That building was in the midst of repairs found during a 40-year inspection when it suddenly collapsed in the middle of the night, drawing new scrutiny of the structural integrity of buildings throughout the region. Burkett informed tenants they will need to leave by Oct. 24 but can return once renovations are completed in several months. Meanwhile, in court Friday, a judge was told that many personal belongings such as jewelry and photos cannot be recovered from the Champlain Towers collapse. “A vast majority of the personal property is completely destroyed,” said Michael Goldberg, an attorney appointed as receiver to handle the Champlain Towers’ finances. Many of the 17 safes found at the site, he said, “are cracked open like an egg.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nDunwoody: An explosion rocked an apartment building in suburban Atlanta on Sunday, causing the three-story structure to partially collapse and leaving four people with minor injuries, authorities said. The cause of the explosion was unknown, but a local utility had received a call from a resident about a strong odor of gas shortly before the midday blast, according to DeKalb County Fire and Rescue Deputy Fire Chief Melvin Carter. He said 90% of the building had been searched, and officials were in the process of shoring up the rest of the complex so rescuers could continue searching for anyone who might be trapped. Fire Capt. Jaeson Daniels had said two people were unaccounted for and may have been in one of three apartments that had completely collapsed. Rescuers hadn’t been able to enter those apartments due to instability of the overall structure. But WSB-TV reports, citing DeKalb fire officials, that the two people were eventually found safe. A helicopter and drones circled above the structure as the local Red Cross began canvassing residents to see who might need help finding accommodations. The partially collapsed building and several others nearby were evacuated. Residents were told that Monday was the earliest they could return to their homes.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A judge has given preliminary approval to a settlement in a lawsuit by inmates who allege state officials mishandled the pandemic and failed to protect them from COVID-19 outbreaks in prisons and jails. In a ruling Thursday, U.S. District Judge Jill Otake said the settlement between the state and the inmates is “fair, adequate, and reasonable.” Both sides agreed to the settlement, which establishes a five-person panel to oversee public health in correctional facilities and other measures to improve sanitation, hygiene and medical monitoring. The settlement also directs officials to make vaccines available and to “promote and educate inmates and staff regarding COVID-19 vaccination.” The class-action lawsuit was meant to provide resources to improve safety during the pandemic, said Eric Seitz, an attorney for the inmates. He said Friday that he’ll pursue damages in separate, future legal action. Situations described in court documents included ailing detainees kept near a bathroom flooded with urine and feces. Their requests to use the bathroom were frequently denied, forcing them to urinate in their drinking cups, according to the documents. Other descriptions the judge noted include an inmate with lupus who contracted the coronavirus but received little to no medical care and ended up with serious kidney damage.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: More than 1,000 protesters gathered in the city Monday morning during a visit by President Joe Biden to express their displeasure about his coronavirus plan, the election and other issues. Biden came to Boise as part of a swing through three Western states to promote his administration’s use of a wartime law to aid in wildfire preparedness, survey wildfire damage and push his economic agenda. He arrived at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise late Monday morning to meet with fire officials and Gov. Brad Little, a Republican. Lisa Mitchell, 65, of Middleton, Idaho, said she was protesting because she doesn’t believe the 2020 election was valid. “I’m here to support Trump and stand for freedom,” said Mitchell, who was wearing a “Trump won 2020” sticker. “He is in there illegally.” Though some of former President Donald Trump’s most fervent supporters believe his continued claims that the presidential election was stolen, there is no evidence of widespread fraud, and Republican and Democratic election officials certified the election as valid. Courts have also repeatedly rejected lawsuits claiming the election was tainted. About a half-dozen Boise police officers were stationed at the entrance to the National Interagency Fire Center, with other law enforcement officers patrolling the area on motorcycle.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The Chicago Park District said it plans to put life rings along the Lake Michigan waterfront – but only in areas that are considered safe to swim, upsetting the mother of a college student who drowned off a pier. “I’m infuriated,“ said Maria Diaz, whose son, Miguel Cisneros, drowned last month in the Rogers Park neighborhood. “Don’t they have kids; aren’t they mothers, fathers? And how would they feel if (it were) their son?” Diaz said. “Because, believe me, you never think about this until it hits home. And it can happen to anyone.” Cisneros, 19, drowned Aug. 22, a few weeks before his planned departure for Columbia University in New York. A vigil for him was held Tuesday night. Rogers Park residents have put life rings on the pier near where Cisneros died, but they have been removed by the park district, the Chicago Tribune reports. Instead, the district is discussing ways to restrict access to the piers while installing life rings elsewhere where it’s “safe to swim,” general counsel Timothy King said. At a Wednesday meeting, a law professor said the park district could be exposing itself to liability if life rings are placed in other locations. Water safety specialist Gerry Dworkin said the rings can be hard to throw accurately from a beach, though they can be effective if dropped to a struggling swimmer near a pier.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: About 300 Purdue University students and employees face disciplinary action for failing to comply with the school’s mandatory coronavirus testing for those who haven’t provided proof of COVID-19 vaccination. That includes 84 students on the West Lafayette campus who have been notified a second time that they haven’t completed required surveillance testing three weeks into the fall semester, Purdue officials said. A third violation could result in suspension from the university as soon as this week. About 210 employees have received an initial written warning for not being tested. Those employees face disciplinary action up to and including termination. Purdue is requiring surveillance testing, which could be as frequently as each week, for any students or employees who’ve not submitted documentation of their COVID-19 shots. About 82% of the some 55,000 students and employees on the West Lafayette campus have submitted vaccination proof, according to the university’s tracking. Indiana University has mandated that all students and employees receive COVID-19 vaccinations unless they are granted exemptions or face dismissal from classes or their jobs. The latest figures released by IU show 88% compliance, but school officials haven’t yet released any information about disciplinary actions.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Polk County will purchase Sleepy Hollow Sports Park, county officials and the park’s longtime owners announced in a news release over the weekend. The 76-acre facility opened in 1994 on Des Moines’ east side. Sleepy Hollow is a central Iowa favorite for tubing and sledding in the winter and for Renaissance fairs, festivals, comedy shows and concerts in the summer. Each fall, Sleepy Hollow’s Renaissance Faire Park turns into a Halloween attraction, and the surrounding forest becomes a haunted trail. Taylor Swift once even performed there early in her career. Rick and Mary Flatt will continue to run all operations through the end of 2022. In 2023, Polk County Conservation will operate the winter sports facility. The Flatts will run camping operations and special events, including the Kosmic Kingdom music festival, the Renaissance Faires and the Scream Park. Polk County will run all operations beginning in 2024. With the announcement, the county pledged to raise millions of dollars to fund improvements at the park, including a full-service campground, ski lodge improvements, new cross-country and snowshoe trails, enhanced fishery options, and a conversion of an existing pond to an ice skating rink in the winter.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Kansas State Fair officials judging the 4-H entomology entries last week discovered an invasive insect that prompted quarantines elsewhere. Fair Board member Gregg Hadley the student who caught the spotted lanternfly didn’t know it had prompted quarantines in at least 45 counties in Pennsylvania and New Jersey to try to stop its spread. Hadley, who is director for extension at Kansas State’s Research and Extension, said it’s not clear how the invasive bug made it to Kansas, but it may have hitched a ride on a camper. The insect that was first found in Pennsylvania about 10 years ago feeds on some 70 different plant species and can cause plants to die by depositing excretions on them that can grow mold and block photosynthesis. One of the fair’s entomology judges was familiar with the insect and a requirement that it be reported to the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Federal officials are expected to try to learn how the insect reached Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nFort Wright: The city plans to return artifacts on loan after closing the James A. Ramage Civil War Museum forever. The City Council unanimously passed a municipal order Sept. 1 to dissolve the museum’s volunteer board, close the museum and confirm Mayor Dave Hatter’s prior order of closure. The Behringer-Crawford Museum, which focuses on Northern Kentucky history, has been called in by the city to help with what to do with all the artifacts, including Sons of the Union Veterans medals. The closed museum, in a house at Battery Hooper, was named for a retired Northern Kentucky University history professor who led efforts to preserve the key Civil War defensive position. The museum helped tell the story of one of the first Black brigades in the Civil War and the defense of Cincinnati. “We just want to make sure everyone gets the artifacts back if they want them,” said Laurie Risch, executive director of the Behringer-Crawford. Jeannine Kreinbrink, an archaeologist for the Behringer-Crawford and a former James A. Ramage Civil War Museum board member, will be assisting with the review of artifacts, Risch said. “We’re just happy to be able to help,” Risch said. “Nobody is happy to see a museum closed.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The head of the Louisiana State Police says he wants to know why 67% of his agency’s uses of force in recent years have been directed at Black people and would welcome a U.S. Justice Department “pattern and practice” probe into potential racial profiling if that is deemed necessary. “If the community is concerned about that, obviously I am concerned about that,” Col. Lamar Davis said in an interview Friday. “I’m a Black male. I don’t want to feel like I’m going to be stopped and thrown across a car just because of that, and I don’t want anyone else to feel that way.” Davis’ comments came a day after an Associated Press investigation identified at least a dozen cases over the past decade in which state police troopers or their bosses ignored or concealed evidence of beatings, deflected blame and impeded efforts to root out misconduct. It included several newly obtained body camera videos of violent arrests that had been locked away for years. “It challenged me emotionally, not just from a law enforcement perspective but as a citizen,” Davis said of viewing the footage. “But I have to put my emotions in check and understand what my duties are. I don’t want the community thinking we’re going to ‘get them.’ Those are the types of things I’m trying to get to the root of.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Two companies that manufacture coronavirus testing supplies in the state say they’re ready to step up to meet demand following President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine and testing mandates for companies with more than 100 workers. Puritan Medical Products makes swabs used for testing, and Abbott Laboratories makes test kits in Maine. Both furloughed or laid off workers before the surge in virus cases tied to the delta variant. “We are monitoring the situation, and are ready to ramp up based on government orders as we did before,” Puritan said in a statement. Abbott spokeswoman Kim Modory told the Portland Press Herald that the company’s Maine workforce “continues to deliver millions of rapid tests at a time when our country needs testing, particularly rapid testing, to manage this next phase of the pandemic.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Cruise ship passengers left the city’s port for the first time in 18 months Sunday, a celebratory moment after putting in place plenty of COVID-19 safety precautions for guests. As a steel drummer played in the port terminal, the Carnival Pride welcomed 1,500 passengers for a weeklong voyage to the Bahamas, The Baltimore Sun reports. All passengers had to be fully vaccinated, with some exceptions for children under 12 and people with documented medical conditions. Those unvaccinated equal less than 5% of the passenger total, Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy said. All passengers also had to get a negative coronavirus test within three days of boarding, and guests 2 and up must wear face masks in elevators and certain indoor areas. While passenger Donna Ford, 60, of Pittsburgh, wasn’t thrilled with the mask mandate, she was still happy to sail: “I don’t like it, but if that’s what it takes for me to cruise, then I’m OK with it.” The Pride, operating at 70% capacity, is Carnival’s ninth ship to welcome passengers back since the pandemic halted cruise operations in March 2020, Duffy said. Port preparations were extensive, port Executive Director William P. Doyle said. Port officials also contracted with a transportation firm in case sick passengers must be removed from the ship during the trip.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nDanvers: A tourist farm called police on a Black couple it accused of stealing six apples and is now apologizing after the family went public in a blog post. Manikka Bowman and Jeff Myers said in the post that they visited Connors Farm in Danvers on Labor Day, spending more than $100 on admission, apple picking, food and drinks. But the couple from Cambridge said they were confronted by farm staff over six apples that did not fit into the prepaid apple-picking bag. They said the overflow fruits were in their child’s stroller, and they intended to pay for them at the farm store, where they also planned to buy cider donuts. Bowman, who is a vice chair of her city’s school committee, said a security guard instead searched her purse, and the manager called police when the couple demanded the farm owner’s contact information. The responding officer, the couple said, accused them of “playing the race card.” “By jumping straight to an assumption of theft, Connors Farm created a scene, harassing us and causing our 7-year-old to burst into tears, anguish that lasted well into the evening,” the couple wrote. “We are left wondering, was it ever about the apples?” The farm, in a Facebook post Thursday, said it apologized to the family and will ensure staffers “undergo diversity, equity and inclusion training.”\n\nMichigan\n\nBenton Harbor: Advocacy groups are urging the Biden administration to help provide safe drinking water in a low-income, predominantly Black city in southwestern Michigan where tests repeatedly have shown excessive lead levels in the water supply. In a petition filed Thursday with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, about 20 organizations said local and state officials have not responded adequately or quickly enough since the contamination was discovered three years ago in Benton Harbor. “It’s urgent that the EPA intervene to give this community access to water that won’t harm our health, especially our children’s health,” said the Rev. Edward Pinkney, president of the Benton Harbor Community Water Council. EPA spokesman Tim Carroll said Friday that the agency was “carefully considering the issues and concerns” raised in the petition. “We are closely monitoring lead-related health issues in Benton Harbor,” Carroll said, adding that the city was among 10 communities that participated in discussions with the EPA as it reviews changes to federal lead and copper regulations made by the Trump administration. The petition was filed one day after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called for spending $20 million in Benton Harbor to replace nearly 6,000 service lines – most suspected of containing lead – within five years.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Black bear sightings are on the rise, as this summer’s drought has made it harder for the animals to find the food they need to prepare for hibernation. This time of year, Minnesota’s black bears are trying to eat as many as 10,000 to 15,000 calories a day. They start to feed nocturnally and for longer periods of time on nutrition-rich acorns, hazelnuts and berries – food sources that are harder to find because of the drought. Bears are now increasingly seeking out backyard bird feeders and other food sources. “There have been a lot of anecdotal reports of bears all over the place this year,” Andy Tri, acting bear project leader with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, told Minnesota Public Radio News. The state’s bear population has remained stable for nearly a decade at between 12,000 and 15,000 statewide, Tri said. However, their range is expanding, especially into the northern Twin Cities suburbs, he said. “So people who grew up there and didn’t grow up seeing bears are now seeing bears regularly,” Tri said. He said while it’s important to be respectful of bears, there’s no need to be afraid. He advises making sure the bear has a clear path to leave the yard, then watching it from inside the house: “Just take a moment to appreciate it. And then just make sure to give bears their space because they’re wild animals.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Six Black farmworkers say in a lawsuit that their former employer brought white laborers from South Africa to do the same jobs they were doing and that the farm has been violating federal law by paying the white immigrants more for the same type of work. Mississippi Center for Justice and Southern Migrant Legal Services filed the federal lawsuit last week on behalf of the six workers against Pitts Farm Partnership, which grows cotton, soybeans and corn in the Mississippi Delta’s Sunflower County. The lawsuit said the farm violated regulations of a foreign worker visa program, which requires equal treatment of U.S. workers and their immigrant counterparts. It seeks an unspecified amount in damages, including money the U.S. workers say they were shorted because of the uneven pay scale. Four of the plaintiffs – Andrew Johnson, Wesley Reed, Gregory Strong and Richard Strong – said they did agricultural work from February through November, and Pitts Farm Partnership usually paid them the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, with $8.25 an hour for weekend work. Two had been paid $9 an hour since 2018. The farm paid the white workers from South Africa $9.87 an hour in 2014, and that rate increased most years until it reached $11.83 an hour in 2020, the lawsuit said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A member of Washington University’s student government placed nearly 3,000 U.S. flags meant to commemorate victims of the Sept. 11 attacks in trash bags, prompting an investigation by the school. The university’s chapter of College Republicans had placed the 2,977 flags on Mudd Field at the school’s campus in St. Louis to honor Saturday’s 20th anniversary of the attacks. Fadel Alkilani, a vice president of finance for the Student Union, acknowledged he removed the flags Saturday and put them in plastic bags as part of a protest but was interrupted when another student began recording video of him. After a video was posted on social media, Alkilani said in a statement that he intended to leave the bags on Mudd Field along with statistics detailing the human cost of Sept. 11 since the attacks. He said the flag display did not mention Islamophobia in the U.S. or civilian casualties in the Middle East caused by the U.S. military, The Kansas City Star reports. Washington University Chancellor Andrew Martin said in a statement that removing the flags was “reprehensible” and was seen as “a personal affront by many, at WashU and beyond, and as an affront to the ideals of our institution.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Montana Youth Action, Forward Montana Foundation and Montana Public Interest Research Group are suing Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen over state laws they say reduce youth voter turnout. Plaintiffs are challenging Senate Bill 169, which changes voter identification requirements and limits the use of a student ID; House Bill 506, which prohibits ballot distribution to people who will but do not yet meet age and residency requirements; and House Bill 176, which eliminates Election Day voter registration. The complaint was filed in Yellowstone County’s 13th Judicial District Court. “Each of these laws unconstitutionally burdens Montanans’ fundamental right to vote, both subverting the will of Montana voters and upending norms that Montana covers have come to rely on – for no reason, let alone a compelling one,” plaintiffs allege in their complaint. “None of these laws accomplish a compelling state interest and each violates the Montana Constitution.” The Montana Secretary of State’s office released the following response: “The voters of Montana spoke when they elected a Secretary of State that promised improved election integrity with voter ID and voter-registration deadlines, and we will work hard to defend those measures.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Four students are suing Creighton University over its requirement to get vaccinated against COVID-19 to remain enrolled, arguing that some of them “feel coerced” to violate their religious beliefs against abortion. The lawsuit filed in Douglas County District Court also alleges that some of the four students have medical conditions that make vaccines not recommended for them. The university in Omaha is affiliated with the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church. It mandated that all students get vaccinated in August, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to a vaccine mandated by Pfizer, according to local news reports. The university had previously allowed medical exemptions to its vaccine requirements but not religious ones. The lawsuit says all four students have “religious objections” to COVID-19 vaccines because “the vaccines were developed and/or tested using abortion derived fetal cell lines.” Attorney Robert Sullivan said in a statement that a Catholic university should not place students in the position of having to violate the church’s teachings. The Vatican declared in December that it is “morally acceptable” for Roman Catholics to receive COVID-19 vaccines based on research that used cells derived from aborted fetuses.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: An analysis of K-12 proficiency exams and state financial reports found Nevada’s students are doing worse on most tests than they did in 2000, when the state spent 79% less on each pupil. Meanwhile, the state continues to land on the wrong end of several nationwide school system rankings, including state-by-state comparisons of per-pupil spending and student-teacher ratios. As recently as 2019, Nevada ranked dead last in at least one test-based survey of K-12 academic achievement. Critics have raised plenty of pointed questions about exactly what such exams measure and how much they really say about the Silver State’s pupils. Yet most politicians and education advocates agree test scores are going to continue to play a key role in shaping, among other things, classroom curriculums, teacher performance evaluations and federal funding opportunities. Annual results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, also known as the Nation’s Report Card, show Nevada’s elementary and middle students have made modest gains in writing and math proficiency over the past two decades. But student performance on three other, better known tests – the SAT, ACT and state-administered SBAC – has trended, sometimes dramatically, in the opposite direction.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire has been awarded a $1.8 million grant to study how and why coastal hazards like excessive flooding are causing roads to crack and crumble. “We’re trying to better understand the causal links of not only the extreme events but also the gradual changes in sea level rise that can increase the rate of damage to pavement and trigger failures that require major road reconstruction,” Jo Sias, professor of civil and environmental engineering, said in a news release. “We’re looking at storm surges and wave action but also factors like the amount of time the pavement is under water.” UNH researchers and their partners at the University of South Alabama and the Rockingham Planning Commission will develop a number of hydrodynamic models that can analyze fluids in motion. The information will be valuable to state and town officials to assess the impact of sea level rise on the longevity of coastal roadways and help implement practical alternatives for communities to protect the infrastructure. The study will focus on the northeast coast of New Hampshire and the southeast coast of Alabama.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHerald: Farmers say they’re fed up with nuisance wildlife and the crop circle-esque damage bears are dealing to their fields. Phil Brodhecker said bears are literally eating his profits, as they tend to roll around and flatten plants when they partake of his corn. The damage in some of his fields adds up to 80% to 90%, Brodhecker said. In others, it’s only about 2% to 5%, but there is damage “in every field.” The situation will only get worse for him and other farmers due to New Jersey’s policy not to have an authorized bear hunting season this year, Brodhecker said. The hunt will be skipped because there is no Comprehensive Black Bear Management Policy in effect, which is required for one to proceed. But the bears aren’t the only ones causing damage, Brodhecker said. The deer are also in on it. The bears leave behind their signature “crop circles,” while the deer “graze” through most fields, munching on blossoms and buds beginning in the spring. Shoulder-high weeds have taken over where sunflowers were stunted by deer biting off buds. The Brodhecker family was one of the first commercial sunflower seed operations in New Jersey, producing birdseed packages for the state Audubon Society. “We have too many bears and deer,” he said following a tour of his Hampton farmland, showing the damage caused.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: As the United States battles COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, a new study co-authored by a New Mexico State University researcher examines how COVID-19 infections in social circles may influence vaccine willingness. In the study, Jagdish Khubchandani, public health sciences professor at NMSU, and a team of researchers conducted a national assessment of COVID-19 vaccine willingness among American adults based on coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths within their friend and family groups. “Education, race and political ideology are the major factors, and we need more efforts to reach sections of our society that remain hesitant about the vaccines,” said Khubchandani, who has conducted multiple studies on the topic since late 2020. The study, published last week in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, included 1,602 participants,about 79% of whom reported receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The remaining participants indicated they planned to get the vaccine (10%) or would not (11%). Overall, participants who did not have a friend or family member infected, hospitalized or die with COVID-19 were at least two times more likely to refuse vaccines, compared to those who had someone in their social networks affected by the virus.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: All of the city’s 472 subway stations are now equipped with security cameras. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced Monday that it had installed the last of thousands of cameras at the G line’s Broadway stop. The installation of the cameras has been accelerated over the past year after crime spiked in the subway system during the pandemic, when ridership dropped. Two hundred stations have been outfitted with cameras in the past year, according to the MTA. Subway ridership fell more than 90% during the height of the pandemic and continues to lag far below pre-pandemic levels. An MTA survey in the spring found that crime and harassment were as big a concern as COVID-19 for riders weighing whether to return to the subways, despite the presence of hundreds of additional city police officers deployed to stations. While crime has continued to be an issue, the MTA said the increased number of cameras has helped increase arrests recently by more than 28%. Some of the cameras broadcast in real time to the subway’s security center, while others record locally and can provide footage that can be used in criminal investigations, according to the MTA.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Certain felons who’ve been released from prison or were never incarcerated and who registered to vote recently in North Carolina will remain eligible as litigation over their right to vote continues, the state’s highest court has ruled. The state Supreme Court, in a lawsuit challenging when North Carolina residents convicted of felonies have their voting rights restored, essentially declined to reinstate a order last month that declared any offender no longer behind bars could register. That order would have affected about 56,000 people who were still serving probation, parole or other supervision, according to court records. On Sept. 3, the state Court of Appeals blocked last month’s trial order amid pending litigation filed by civil rights groups and ex-offenders challenging state law on the restoration of voting rights. Those plaintiffs immediately appealed to the Supreme Court, which late Friday declined to block the Court of Appeals order but also declared it would be implemented only going forward. That means felony offenders who registered between Aug. 23 and Sept. 3 – when the trial judges’ order was in place and based solely on that order – can’t be removed from voting rolls and “are legally registered voters” until told otherwise, the Supreme Court wrote.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Authorities said one person was injured in an explosion during a fireworks display in southeast Bismarck at midday Saturday. It created a dense cloud of black smoke that could be seen throughout the city. Bismarck Rural Fire Chief Dustin Theurer said fireworks or an explosive ordnance was the “likely” cause of the explosion. Authorities didn’t immediately offer other details on what happened or where exactly the incident occurred, saying the investigation was ongoing. Firefighters, police and medical professionals responded to the scene shortly before 11:30 a.m., The Bismarck Tribune reports. Roads in the area were closed, and the public was asked to stay away. One person was taken to a hospital with undisclosed injuries, according to the Bismarck Rural Fire Department. The explosion could be heard around the city, and some people reported that it rattled doors. Joshua Watts, who happened to be in the area, said he witnessed more than one blast. “There was an explosion and then another explosion,” he said. “The first one went off … and I actually saw the fireworks blow up.” The explosions touched off grass fires in the area. No buildings were damaged, Theurer said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A second federal lawsuit filed against six local hospital groups, alleging they conspired against their employees by requiring COVID-19 vaccines, has been voluntarily dismissed. It’s the second time the antitrust lawsuit has been filed and then voluntarily dismissed. Among the allegations was that the hospital groups – Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, the Christ Hospital Health Network, Bon Secours Mercy Health, TriHealth, UC Health and St. Elizabeth Healthcare – are requiring employees to be vaccinated even though, according to the lawsuit, there is no increasing spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus. “The plan was simple,” the lawsuit said. “If the six large systems stuck together, all the employees would be trapped.” The pandemic and the vaccines created to battle it, the lawsuit alleged, are part of a fraud perpetrated by “government, pharmaceutical (companies), social media, mainstream media, corporate America, healthcare and political parties.” According to data from the Health Collaborative, which tracks daily bed counts at more than 40 hospitals, the number of COVID-19 patients in the region’s hospital and intensive care beds remains on an upward trajectory. The number of COVID-19 patients is at its highest point since January and February.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Pardon and Parole Board on Monday recommended the governor commute the death sentence of Julius Jones, who has maintained his innocence in a 1999 killing that has garnered national attention. The five-member board voted 3-1 to recommend Jones’ sentence be commuted to life in prison after board member Scott Williams recused himself because of a professional relationship he had with one of the attorneys who spoke on Jones’ behalf. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt ultimately will decide the fate of Jones, who claims he was framed for the 1999 shooting death of Edmond businessman Paul Howell. “Personally, I believe in death penalty cases there should be no doubts. And put simply, I have doubts about this case,” said Chairman Adam Luck, one of Stitt’s appointees on the board who voted to commute Jones’ sentence. Monday’s vote came after several hours of testimony from members of Howell’s family, prosecutors who tried the case, and attorneys and supporters of Jones. Kelly Doyle, another Stitt appointee who voted in favor of commuting the sentence, said she agreed with Luck and noted there were mitigating factors she considered, including the fact that Jones, now 41, was 19 when Howell was killed during a carjacking. A spokeswoman said Stitt plans to review the recommendation carefully.\n\nOregon\n\nYachats: A man who attempted to jump across a wide cove of frothing water at Cape Perpetua Scenic Area is presumed dead, according to state police. Steve Allen, 67, of Walnut Creek, California, apparently tried to hurdle Devil’s Churn, a narrow boiling inlet just off Highway 101 south of Yachats on the central Oregon coast. Devil’s Churn, a popular stopping point at Cape Perpetua, is a somewhat narrow slice in the coastal basalt rock known for boiling water that kicks up large sprays of waves. “Troopers and emergency personnel responded for a subject who had fallen into the ocean at Devils Churn,” Oregon State Police said in a news release. “Fellow visitors attempted to rescue Allen but were unable to retrieve him from the water.” Allen was last observed by rescue agencies unresponsive prior to losing sight of him, officials said. The U.S. Coast Guard and other responding agencies suspended their search at approximately 6:40 p.m. Allen is presumed to be dead, officials said. OSP was assisted by Lincoln county Sheriff’s Office, Newport Fire Department, Yachats Fire and Rescue and the Coast Guard.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The union that represents corrections officers in Pennsylvania prisons wants a state court to intervene over the governor’s recent mandate that they all get COVID-19 vaccines or submit to weekly coronavirus testing. The six-page Commonwealth Court complaint over a rule Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf announced last month requests that the court issue a preliminary injunction to end mandatory testing unless inmates, visitors and outside vendors are also subject to the requirement. “The entry of a preliminary injunction is necessary in order to maintain the equity” between members of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association “and all other participants in the commonwealth controlled congregate settings, and to further ensure the intent of the order itself,” which is to protect the public from COVID-19, according to the lawsuit filed Friday. “The commonwealth’s failure to apply the ‘vaccinate or weekly test’ rule to all individuals in the congregate setting unnecessarily increases the risk to the health and safety” of union members, the lawsuit claims. Wolf announced a month ago that about 25,000 employees of Pennsylvania’s prisons and state health care and congregate care facilities would have to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by Sept. 7 or take weekly tests for the virus.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: An estate once famously owned by Claus and Martha von Bulow has sold for $30million. Clarendon Court on Newport’s famed Bellevue Avenue mansion row was sold late Thursday. The buyer’s name wasn’t disclosed. The grand estate on more than 7 acres with sweeping ocean views was built in 1904 by the architect Horace Trumbauer. The sale easily tops the $17.75 million paid by singer Taylor Swift in 2013 for her home in Westerly, which is considered the highest price fetched by a home in the state. Clarendon Court was where heiress Martha “Sunny” von Bulow slipped into a coma in 1980 from which she never woke up. Claus Von Bulow, a Danish-born socialite, was convicted but later acquitted of trying to kill her to gain her fortune so he could live with his soap opera actress mistress. His two trials in Rhode Island in the 1980s drew intense international attention with its high society overtones. The story was the subject of the 1990 movie “Reversal of Fortune” starring Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close. Sunny died in 2008 in New York City; Claus died in 2019 in London.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A large granite monument honoring 9/11 victims was defaced by vandals who spray-painted “Taliban” on it in two places, authorities said. The granite statue is made of two towers, each weighing 4,000 pounds, with a light beam outside a Greenville County business, WYFF-TV reports. Deputies were called to investigate the vandalism Sunday morning, and the damage was cleaned up later that day, said Paul Nichols, founder and CEO of Upstate Granite Solutions. His granite company constructed the memorial, which is surrounded by 1,000 American flags, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the U.S. “This monument is meant to show the community how much we care and to offer our support to our military and our first responders and let people know there’s still something to believe in in America,” said Kelly Nichols of Upstate Granite Solutions. Nichols said hundreds of people visited the memorial Saturday night.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Badlands National Park will build a new visitor center in the southeast section of the park, the National Park Foundation said Monday. The new facility will be located in the Cedar Pass section of the park, where wind and water have carved towering geological rock formations from the prairie. The center is planned to educate park visitors about the region’s paleontological and geological resources, as well as the culture of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and Lakota people. Nearly 917,000 people visited the park last year, according to the National Park Service. The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust donated $3.3 million for the project. Badlands Natural History Association has also pledged $1.8 million, and the Badlands National Park Conservancy has contributed $100,000. “Badlands National Park’s layered rocks formations and stunning buttes offer visitors a breathtaking glimpse into a scenic landscape that began forming millions of years ago,” Helmsley Charitable Trust Trustee Walter Panzirer said in a statement. “We’re excited to lead the funding effort to construct a new, modern visitor center to highlight the park’s splendor and significance.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Some residents affected by last month’s flooding can apply for emergency food benefits. The Department of Human Services announced that the state will begin accepting applications for “disaster SNAP” benefits for people who live or work in Dickson, Hickman, Houston or Humphreys counties. SNAP refers to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. To qualify, individuals must meet income requirements and can’t already be a current SNAP recipient. Individuals also must have experienced a loss of income due to the storm, damage to a residence or place of employment, or some other unreimbursed disaster-related expense. Applications from Humphreys County will be accepted through Friday. Those in Dickson, Hickman and Houston counties can apply from Sept. 20 to Sept. 24. Applications can be filled out on the department’s website or in person by appointment. The Aug. 21 flooding killed 20 people as it took out houses, roads, cellphone towers and telephone lines.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Several Austin-area funeral home embalmers say it’s common practice to pour human blood from corpses down the drain, a procedure that Austin Water officials admit they were unaware was occurring and one that could compromise the treatment of wastewater entering the Colorado River. Death-related issues are often considered taboo, which might be why Texas Funeral Service Commission Executive Director Glenn Bower said it’s been about 20 years since he was asked how funeral homes in the state dispose of human fluids. He said if a family chooses to embalm a loved one, all the blood and body fluids mixed with embalming liquid that come out of the remains – referred to by embalmers as drainage – go down the common sink. “I can honestly say we measure the volume going in, but we don’t measure the volume coming out,” Bower said. “But that does go down the drain.” Of the solution put into the remains, “about half of that solution, give or take, will come out in the drainage,” he said. Disposing of the medical waste and embalming fluid is not dangerous to the public or to the environment, Bower said, as workers dilute the medical waste with water. Austin Water disagreed, saying in a statement that permits must be acquired to drain blood or embalming fluid into local wastewater systems.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: The Utah Shakespeare Festival is partnering with the Iron County Care and Share on a local food drive, offering discounted tickets for participants, starting this week. The food drive runs Sept. 14 to Oct. 9, and by donating at least six items of non-perishable food, playgoers can get half-price tickets to any show Mondays through Thursdays, according to a release from organizers. The deal is good on the day of the performance only and not for advance sales. The offer is limited to four discounted tickets per person. Food donation barrels will be located outside the Eileen and Allen Anes Studio Theatre, near the ticket office. “It’s important every year to support this shelter, but considering the times we’re in and all of the damage caused by the pandemic, food insecurity has only gotten worse. So the festival is very happy to help where we can,” said Donn Jersey, the director of development and communication. Flooding this year in the Cedar City area has made the food drive’s mission that much more important, organizers said, adding to an increase in need brought on by the financial instability the COVID-19 pandemic has caused.\n\nVermont\n\nThetford: Public meetings will be held this month as a plan to commit the state to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years is drafted. The Global Warming Solutions Act was passed last year despite Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s veto. The legislation set up a council on climate to analyze ways Vermont can reduce emissions. A virtual meeting to gather feedback from farmers will take place Tuesday from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The climate council is then holding in-person public meetings in Elmore on Sept. 21; East Dorset on Sept. 22; Island Pond on Sept. 23; and Colchester on Sept. 26, the Agency of Natural Resources said. The council is in the early stages of drafting the plan that will be presented to the Legislature on Dec. 1, the Valley News reports. There will be extensive feedback and revisions through January 2022, said Administration Secretary Susanne Young, who is chairwoman of the council. Some of the strategies the panel is considering are recommendations for carbon capture and sequestration on farms; programs to encourage Vermonters to buy electric or low-emission vehicles; promoting compact communities to reduce commute distances; and building on Efficiency Vermont’s work to weatherize more homes, the newspaper reports.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: This year’s menhaden catch so far in the Chesapeake Bay is worrying the state’s top fisheries regulator, but the company harvesting most of the oily fish says it won’t exceed a set quota. Virginia Marine Resources Commissioner Steven Bowman wrote that Omega Protein has already caught 75% of the bay’s quota, the Daily Press of Newport News reports. “This is a troubling development, as recent harvest rates mirror those from 2019 when Omega did exceed the Bay harvest cap by 15,000 metric tons,” Bowman wrote to the Virginia-based company, which operates a fish oil and fishmeal plant in Reedville. Omega spokesman Ben Landry said the company has no intention of breaking the law. In 2019, Virginia had a different quota for the Chesapeake Bay than the one set by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an interstate body that manages several fish species. Omega’s catch was within the state cap, Landry said. The differing quotas led to a federal order closing the menhaden fishery unless Virginia adopted the Atlantic States commission cap and cut the allowable catch for 2020 to make up for what was caught in 2019, the newspaper reports. Virginia complied, and Omega did not exceed the 2020 cap.\n\nWashington\n\nBlaine: Officials say they’ve destroyed a second nest of Asian giant hornets found in northwestern Washington state this year and are preparing to take down a third. The Washington State Department of Agriculture said in a Facebook post that a team eradicated the nest Saturday in northern Whatcom County, near the town of Blaine along the Canadian border. It said a third nest this season has been located, and planning is underway to eradicate it. The nests have been within a few miles of each other. The first nest this year was destroyed in August. The hornets were first detected in the U.S. in 2019 in Whatcom County. Asian giant hornets are an invasive pest not native to the U.S. They are the world’s largest hornet at 2 inches long and a predator of other insects, including honeybees that pollinate many of the crops in Washington’s agriculture industry. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their sting is extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill. They’re sometimes called murder hornets because they prey on other bees.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: This year’s West Virginia Book Festival is going virtual due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases, officials said. The free event will still be held Oct. 22-23 at the Charleston Coliseum & Convention Center, but events will be hosted online, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. “The health and safety of our guests, volunteers, presenters and sponsors is our top priority, and due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Kanawha County, we felt it was prudent to cancel in-person activities this year,” festival co-chair Sarah Mitchell said in a statement. “Instead, book festival presentations will be streamed live online, so book lovers can still engage with our renowned literary guests.” Some of the authors scheduled to appear include Pulitzer Prize winner Colson Whitehead, best-selling author and West Virginia native Homer Hickam, and children’s author Jon Scieszka.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers sought Monday to join the court fight over Wisconsin’s redistricting process, just as Republicans who control the Legislature have. The first-term governor asked a federal court to let him join a lawsuit over the shape of congressional and legislative districts for the next decade. Where the lines go will help determine which political party has the upper hand in elections. Ten years ago, Republicans controlled all of state government and drew maps that helped them. This time, Republicans won’t have as easy of a time because Evers can veto whatever they draw. If Evers and lawmakers can’t reach a deal, it will likely be left to the courts to decide where the lines go. Anticipating that could happen, voters and groups started filing lawsuits last month asking judges to set a timetable for legislators and Evers to act. Three lawsuits have been filed over the map-drawing process, two in federal court and one in state court. Evers, who is represented by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul, on Monday asked to join one of the federal cases. A panel of three judges is hearing both federal cases and is considering combining the two cases it is overseeing. The panel gave GOP lawmakers permission to join one of the cases last month and is considering letting them intervene in the other one.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A man accused of choking his girlfriend has pleaded guilty in Laramie County District Court. Joshua Gene Nunn pleaded guilty to felony strangulation of a household member as part of a plea agreement. He originally pleaded not guilty to the charge, along with one count of misdemeanor domestic battery, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. If a judge follows the agreement at sentencing, Nunn could receive three years of probation, with a suspended sentence of three to five years in prison. Early last Sept. 29, a Cheyenne Police officer responded to a report of a domestic incident. The woman said that, during an argument, she had tried to lock Nunn out of their bedroom, but he broke the door and came in, according to court documents. Nunn got on top of her and choked her by pushing his forearm under her throat. The woman said she couldn’t breathe, and “her head got fuzzy,” and then Nunn punched the left side of her face, according to court documents.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/14"}]}

Dayton discovered lacrosse when she went off to Longwood College in Farmville, Virginia.\n\nLater this summer, that chance encounter will land Dayton in the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame. The irony doesn’t escape Dayton, 57, who has been the athletic director at St. Catherine’s, an all-girls private school in Richmond, Virginia, since 2000.\n\n“I went to Longwood to play field hockey,” she said.\n\nYet Dayton ended up being a two-time lacrosse All-American as well at Longwood. She then was part of the U.S. national women’s lacrosse player pool for 10 years from 1981 through 1990. She played for the U.S. in a 1984 exhibition at the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and the 1986 World Cup.\n\nThe first time Dayton put a lacrosse stick in her hands was when Laurel traveled to Sanford School, in Hockessin, for a summer hockey camp. In the 1970s, only the Independent Conference schools fielded girls lacrosse teams. A couple times during those trips to Sanford, there would also be lacrosse going on and Dayton would casually pick up a stick.\n\n“I didn’t know anything about the sport and had no interest in it,” said Dayton, who scored 61 goals for Laurel her junior and senior field hockey seasons.\n\nBut it was common at that time for college field hockey players to also be on lacrosse teams for schools that had them. Dayton would later remark that she was fortunate Longwood didn’t have softball, because she likely would have chosen that. As it was, the hockey coach at Longwood, Dee McDonough, also happened to be the lacrosse coach.\n\n“She was a smart coach to recruit from her own university within the field hockey team,” Dayton said. “There were several us she took in the gym in the winter and put lacrosse sticks in our hands and taught us how to play.”\n\nIt was a humbling experience, at first.\n\n“At 18, learning a new sport, I was not a fan,” Dayton admitted. “This stick is in my way. It slows me down. That kind of thing.”\n\nDelaware's Barnhill still writing the book on lacrosse\n\nBut she came to love the game’s wide-open spaces and speedy pace while netting 93 career goals at Longwood from 1978-81.\n\nDayton joins a long list of National Lacrosse Hall of Famers with Delaware ties that includes Milt Roberts, the former University of Delaware and Cape Henlopen High coach; Jackie Pitts, the long-time Sanford School teacher who coached the U.S. women as well as Sanford teams; Janet Smith, the former Tatnall School and University of Delaware women’s coach; former UD player Karen Emas, who was a U.S. teammate of Dayton’s; and Ursuline Academy coach Feffie Barnhill, a Tatnall graduate.\n\nShe’ll be honored Sept. 10 at the Grand Lodge in Hunt Valley, Maryland.\n\n“I learned along the way,” Dayton said of her development as a lacrosse player. “The thing that really opened the door for me was at the end of the college season to go through a selection process and play in a regional tournament and then a national tournament. Our coach would say ‘You guys oughta try this.’ A few of us did. I don’t know, I just loved playing with better players, got even better coaching and really took to it.’’\n\nAfter her second year through, Dayton became part of the national player pool.\n\nBand of football ROMEOs loves weekly breakfast meeting\n\n“It was a life-changing experience to have that opportunity to make a national squad,” Dayton said.\n\nA 2003 inductee to the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame, Dayton still has family in the First State. Her mom Doris and brother Brian live in Seaford and sister Pam Smawley resides in Ellendale. Her father, Herbert, died in 2011.\n\n“I think my nature, which I probably got from my dad, is to be very competitive,” Dayton said of another characteristic that aided her on the lacrosse field. “I only know one way to play and that is playing to win.”\n\nDayton was playing U.S. lacrosse while embarking on a coaching career, which actually began at St. Catherine’s followed by a stint as an assistant for field hockey and lacrosse at the University of Virginia. She was later head field hockey coach at Virginia in 1992-93 and Dartmouth from 1993-99, logging a 70-49-2 record, before returning to St. Catherine’s as athletic director.\n\nBecause she was a late comer to lacrosse, Dayton always felt she needed to apply extra dedication and diligence when competing against players who’d picked up the game at much younger ages.\n\nShe often called on the positive influence that Laurel coaches such as the late Bonnie Bryan, who had the hockey and softball teams, instilled.\n\n“It was a challenge,” said Dayton, who won U.S. Lacrosse’s Beth Allen Award in 1987 as the most outstanding U.S. player. “I had to work harder. I had to train harder. I had to be as fit as I could be. And I had to take my best ‘A’ game forward to hang with some of those players. Somehow I hung on there for 10 years.’’\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

John Carney, D-Delaware, says he'll work to reduce turmoil and heal divisions in the state's public school system.\n\n\"The attitude I would like us to see is that we're all in this together and everybody is rowing in the same direction,\" Carney said. \"What I hear from teachers is that they are constantly being told to change direction, so I think we need to settle down, find a framework that works, and stick with it.\"\n\nThe state has seen plenty of high-profile, emotionally charged controversies over education issues in the past few years: the fights over the federal Race to the Top grant and the priority schools program, the battles over the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission, a debate over standardized testing and conflicts over charter schools, to name a few.\n\nCarney, the heavily-favored Democratic nominee for Delaware's highest office, on Tuesday released a 12-point education platform Tuesday he hopes will turn attention off of those controversies and back to classroom instruction.\n\nLINK: Bonini wins GOP governor primary\n\nLINK: Bonini: Delaware needs fewer state government workers\n\nThe platform says Carney would \"refocus\" the Department of Education on providing professional development and other support to teachers, rather than acting as a regulator. It also calls for the state to take advantage of new federal laws that give states more leeway on issues like the use of test scores in teacher evaluations.\n\nMany local educators have criticized state and federal education officials for being too heavy-handed in education. Carney argues a big part of the problem is that the state has implemented changes frequently without giving teachers input or time to adjust. The statewide exam changed three times in five years, for example.\n\nState Sen. Colin Bonini, R-Dover South, Carney's Republican opponent in November, said he agrees with Carney that the state needs to be more consistent in education policy. Overall, Bonini said, there isn't much in the Carney plan that he opposes, other than that the plan doesn't propose drastic enough change.\n\n\"I think this is very status quo, more of the same,\" Bonini said. \"The idea of bringing everybody together sounds fine. But if my car breaks down on the side of my highway, I don't want to bring people together — I want to get somebody who can fix the car.\"\n\nCarney also wants to give local education officials more flexibility in how they use their state funding.\n\n\"We're not an underfunded education system, but the funding mechanisms aren't always as flexible as they need to be so you can get resources into classrooms where they need it the most,\" he said.\n\nAnother big theme: continuing to beef up pre-kindergarten education, particularly for low-income families. Carney wants to create a cabinet-level council on early childhood education, strengthen the connections between the K-12 system and pre-K, and maintain financial investments made during Gov. Jack Markell's tenure despite tight budgets.\n\n\"We know we need to get to them early, particularly kids who are growing up in low-income households or those that might have disadvantages,\" Carney said. \"In my conversations with educators, I hear over and over again how important this is.\"\n\nCarney's platform does not specifically address some of the more hotly debated issues. In an interview, Carney said he thinks charter schools are an important part of the educational system but the state needs to do more to make sure charters fit in the larger educational system.\n\nHe also said that he does not think it makes sense for the Christina School District to remain in Wilmington, but he acknowledged that the Legislature defeated a Wilmington commission's plan for redistricting and said many more conversations must be had to come up with plan that would get broader support.\n\nBonini said problems in many schools are severe enough that more drastic action is necessary, and those changes might upset some people. He called for making it easier for parents to \"choice\" their kids between schools, for a new funding system where every dollar \"follows\" the child and an accountability system that gives individual schools more freedom but also tougher consequences for poor results.\n\n\"Delaware doesn't need a couple of aspirin, Delaware needs real medicine,\" Bonini said.\n\nThis story has been updated to expand on Carney's stance on Wilmington school redistricting.\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428 or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.\n\nMonitor: State in 'substantial compliance' with mental health settlement\n\nChristina School District adjusts after setbacks\n\nJohn Carney education platform\n\nMaking sure all children get to kindergarten ready to learn\n\nCreate a cabinet-level council to better deliver early childhood education programming.\n\nBuild stronger connections between early learning and K-12 schools.\n\nMaintain support for high-quality STARS rated programs.\n\nProvide at-risk parents and families with early intervention and coaching from birth through early childhood.\n\nGiving educators the tools and students the resources they need\n\nRefocus the role of DOE from a regulatory agency to a support agency\n\nTake advantage of the flexibility in Every Student Succeeds Act to set goals and accountability measures that make sense for Delaware.\n\nOffer useful and effective professional development to Delaware educators.\n\nDevelop leadership opportunities to keep high-quality teachers in the classroom and supporting other teachers.\n\nCreate flexibility with state resources so teachers and schools can more effectively address the needs of their students.\n\nBreak down silos to get social services in schools for students and families.\n\nEnsuring that all students graduate high school and are career and college ready\n\nExpand career pathways programs to get more students professional certifications before graduation.\n\nCreate measures for school and student success based on outcomes, including career readiness.\n\n​​", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2021/03/23/effort-launched-have-indoor-track-facility-built-delaware/4732372001/", "title": "Effort launched to have indoor track facility built in Delaware", "text": "Though COVID-19 forced an outdoor meet this year, the Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association has conducted its annual indoor track and field championships in Landover, Maryland, since 2014.\n\nThe move to the Prince George’s Sports & Learning Complex came after the University of Delaware Field House, which once had a 200-meter track, was converted to an indoor practice facility for other UD teams with artificial turf covering the floor.\n\nThere is no other suitable facility in Delaware, forcing the annual commute to the Washington, D.C., suburbs.\n\nThat could change in the coming years.\n\nAmbitious plans formulated by a group called Indoor Track Delaware aim for a facility in Delaware that would also benefit other sports and attract athletes beyond First State borders. They’ll reveal their plans Wednesday morning during an event at Wilmington’s West End Neighborhood House.\n\n“There’s a possibility we can have something here that’s very attractive,” said Jim Fischer, the Ursuline Academy coach who spent 30-plus years coaching University of Delaware teams and is part of Indoor Track Delaware’s efforts. “It’s an exciting project and I hope we can move forward on it. It would be a great thing for people in Delaware and surrounding states.”\n\nAn arena with a 200-meter, hydraulically banked track and seating for 3,500, the minimum for NCAA indoor track and field events, is envisioned.\n\nWhen the track is not up – or in a larger facility with adjacent space – wrestlers, volleyball and basketball players and competitive cheerleaders could move in. Organizers foresee an arena that would be in operation throughout the year.\n\n“We’re excited about it and we just hope it comes through because that could do a lot for the Beast,” said Vic Leonard of the Delaware Wrestling Alliance, referring to the annual Beast of the East tournament that brings hundreds of high school wresters and their families to the University of Delaware’s Bob Carpenter Center each December.\n\n“We could bring a lot of revenue in here and there’s a lot of things we could do if we had the mat space.”\n\nNow comes the difficult part – finding land to build it with proper infrastructure and the money to pay for it.\n\nCost estimates range from $25 million to $50 million, depending on the size and scope of the venue.\n\nIndoor Track Delaware, a nonprofit, hired the market research firm Victus Advisors to perform an economic impact and feasibility report.\n\nVictus determined that, over a 30-year period, the smaller proposed facility could provide $975 million in economic impact while the larger version could generate $1.4 billion. Food and beverage, lodging and shopping would benefit the most.\n\nBOUNCING BACK: UD axed his teams but Fischer still coaching champs\n\nAmong its findings was that tourism in Delaware is lowest during the months of December through March and a facility able to draw large gatherings for sporting events would address that.\n\n“Thinking about the possibility of having an indoor track here in Delaware is very exciting,” said Marnie Giunta, who has coached Padua Academy to numerous state track and field titles. “Hats off to them if they can make that happen.”\n\nIndoor Track Delaware organizers have studied two other facilities, in particular, in the hope of creating a similar venue.\n\nThe Virginia Beach Sports Center, located less than a mile from the Atlantic Ocean and close to numerous hotels, opened in 2020 at the cost of $68 million. It can seat 5,000 spectators for track and has already been selected for NCAA meets. A separate conjoined area has space for 24 volleyball and 12 basketball courts.\n\nThere is also the $46 million CrossPlex in Birmingham, Alabama, which opened in 2011 and also houses a competitive swimming pool. It has hosted numerous NCAA track, wrestling and swimming championships and seats 4,000.\n\nA Wilmington area facility, the Victus report said, would be within a 120-mile radius of 34.7 million people. That’s roughly seven times the population surrounding Alabama’s CrossPlex.\n\nThere is presently no preferred location for such a facility, as each part of Delaware is viewed to have various benefits. Location will depend on cost and availability of land, according to Indoor Track Delaware organizers.\n\nSussex County has the beach-area hotels, seaside attractions and, in the western area, less expensive and perhaps available land. It’s also an area to which Washington-area residents are familiar traveling.\n\nKent County provides a better in-state mid-point and the potential for tie-ins with Delaware State University or Dover International Speedway, where surrounding land has been used for the annual Firefly music festival.\n\nNew Castle County has two-thirds of the state’s high schools and nearly 60% of Delaware’s residents, while also being part of the nation’s eighth-largest Philadelphia metropolitan area with 6.1 million residents. It’s also where land may be less available and more costly.\n\n“I think we can find a place to put it,” Fischer said. “The issue is getting the money to put it up.”\n\nThe hurdle in several previous efforts to place an indoor track facility in Delaware was finding the economic support, Fischer said.\n\nYouth and high school sports in Delaware have recently benefitted from the addition of two other new destinations – DE Turf in southern Kent County and the Chase (formerly 76ers) Fieldhouse in Wilmington.\n\nDE Turf, which opened in 2017 at a cost of $24 million, has a dozen artificial turf playing fields frequently utilized for lacrosse, field hockey, soccer and football competitions, practices and camps.\n\nThe $30 million Chase Fieldhouse opened in early 2019 featuring a 2,500-seat gym that is home court for the NBA G League’s Delaware Blue Coast and also hosts high school games. It also has a large, enclosed turf playing field, another athletic field outside and other sports-related amenities.\n\nPlanners and builders from Wilmington’s Buccini/Pollin Group considered installing an indoor track there. They decided against it because a track “significantly increases the size of the facility” and, therefore, the cost, Buccini/Pollin Group co-president Rob Buccini said at the time.\n\nIndoor track teams must travel\n\nThe 2020-21 high school indoor track season was an outlier. COVID-19 safety protocols instituted by the DIAA prevented out-of-state competition.\n\nIn addition, with large indoor gatherings prohibited, no meets were held at Tower Hill School’s Carpenter Fieldhouse in Wilmington. Carpenter Fieldhouse has long been the site of almost weekly indoor track meets that Delaware teams would frequent. But its track isn’t the proper length or width for a sanctioned championship meet such as the DIAA’s.\n\nAs a result, Delaware teams turned winter into spring in 2020-21, holding meets on outdoor tracks and then the state championships at Dover High’s stadium, where they were greeted by mild and sunny weather on March 3.\n\n“We were handcuffed to the weather,” said Giunta. “The one thing that has never changed is we have to train outdoors [during indoor season]. But the one constant we always had was we were competing indoors [on weekends]. We knew we would have excellent conditions when we went to our meets, so that was always something to look forward to and you could plan and train for that.”\n\nPANDA POWER: Padua wins state winter track title\n\nIn previous and, presumably, future indoor seasons, when they weren’t going to Tower Hill, Delaware high school teams could travel the Mid-Atlantic area for weekend meets and find no shortage of sites.\n\nThe Wicomico Youth & Civic Center in Salisbury, Maryland, has been a regular stop for Delaware teams, especially those from Sussex and Kent counties. It wasn’t deemed large enough, however, for the DIAA championships when officials were pondering a new championship site after the UD Field House’s alterations.\n\nLikewise, the Hytche Athletic Center on the campus of Maryland-Eastern Shore in Princess Anne has been the site of Henlopen Conference championships but also lacks the space and seating capacity for a state meet.\n\nNumerous Pennsylvania colleges have indoor tracks that have been regular stopping points on the winter tours of Delaware high school teams. They include Lehigh’s Rauch Fieldhouse, Penn State’s Ashenfelt Indoor Track, Ursinus’ Floy Lewis Bakes Center Field House, Franklin & Marshall’s Schnader Field House, Haverford’s Alumni Field House and Dickinson College’s Kline Center.\n\nBut they are really for training and competition, not crowds. The largest seating capacity among those is just 800 at Penn State, which is also the only one with a hydraulically controlled banked track. Indoor Track Delaware organizers imagine something that could attract large gatherings from a wide area and also be a multi-purpose setting.\n\nBecause of the necessary costs of traveling to out-of-state meets that limit some high schools, an indoor facility in Delaware would provide “equitable opportunity for everyone,’’ Giunta said, and possibly a practice location.\n\n“That’s just a fabulous thing,” she added. “This would open the door for opportunities for all teams to be able to have those kinds of competitive settings.’’\n\nWINTER WINNERS: Salesianum takes another DIAA track title\n\nDIAA indoor track had 863 female and 1,207 boys participants during the 2019-20 school years, the most recent available. Participation was down in 2020-21, as in all high school sports, as some schools didn’t field indoor track teams because of the COVID-19 limitations and virtual learning.\n\nThe Armory in New York City is also a frequent proving ground for indoor track competitors.\n\nAnother facility Delaware planners have looked to for inspiration is the Ocean Breeze Track and Field Athletic Complex, which sits across the street from the Atlantic Ocean on Staten Island. The 135,000-square-foot building opened in 2015 at a cost of $93 million and has 2,500 seats.\n\nThe two New York tracks are continuously busy from late fall through the winter. A state-of-the-art Delaware facility could be, Indoor Track Delaware leaders believe, the sport’s primary destination between here and Virginia Beach.\n\n“Kids go up to Ocean Breeze and they go up to the Armory from Delaware,” Fischer said, “and they’re such nice facilities. You get fast times and everything’s well organized.\n\n“That’s the picture we have for here, too. It would not only be for the people of the state but could draw people from a big area. When you have something like this. people just want to go there.”\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

She told the USA TODAY Network that she is campaigning to change an “unsustainable status quo” she believes is hurting the middle class and creating hopelessness for the American people.\n\nIn 1998, she founded Project Angel Food, a nonprofit that provides free meals to Los Angeles residents who are too sick to shop and cook for themselves.

She has also called for halting all new fossil fuel subsidies and instead investing that money into wind and solar energy, among other energy initiatives. Williamson has said she will ban all fracking operations in the U.S. and prioritize training workers to move from traditional energy sectors to new ones.\n\nCrime & policing\n\nThe author and spiritual leader has called America’s longstanding efforts to fight crime ineffective. Instead, she proposes what she calls a holistic approach to address the underlying causes of crime. Williamson has called culture and education “the strongest preventative medicines” for American communities. As president, she would fund and increase the number of social workers, create “wraparound” programs to provide healthcare and other services for children and fund efforts for law enforcement officials to repair relationships with their communities.\n\nEducation\n\nWilliamson has called for free tuition for public college students, including community colleges, four-year colleges and universities, and historically Black colleges and universities. She has also called for free trade school tuition for certain professions, such as carpenters and plumbers. As president, the author would also forgive all federal and private student debt. She also says she would end “high stakes” testing for students in a push to “return to teachers the opportunity to practice the art of teaching.”\n\nEconomy\n\nWilliamson has proposed an economic bill of rights for Americans, including the “right to a job that pays a living wage,” “the right to good, affordable housing,” and other guarantees. Williamson has also called for setting a nationwide goal of eradicating poverty and expanding social safety net programs for low-income people. She has proposed increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour and closing tax loopholes for large corporations, and she includes investments in care programs, drug pricing, and other common costs as part of her economic platform.\n\nForeign policy\n\nWilliamson has called for creating a U.S. Department of Peace, which would support efforts to end conflicts, coordinate humanitarian assistance and create a U.S. Peace Academy working with the U.S. Military Academy. She has vowed to increase the budget for the State Department’s peace efforts. She has also proposed launching a 10- to 20-year plan for “turning a wartime economy into a peace-time economy,” which would involve shifting current investments to building schools, infrastructure and more.\n\nHealth care\n\nWilliamson supports a Medicare for All-type health care system, a universal plan for Americans that would replace coverage from private health insurance companies. If elected president, she would push for lower prescription drug prices by pursuing negotiations with drug companies. But Williamson has also called for a “Whole Health Plan,” in which the country would prioritize health and wellness initiatives across the board.

He was middle-aged, overweight and unvaccinated. He had also recently tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nTwo weeks earlier, a doctor who had diagnosed the man during an urgent care visit had noted his risk factors and prescribed a new drug: Paxlovid, an antiviral pill that in clinical trials cut a person’s the risk of hospitalization or death from Covid-19 by nearly 90% compared with a placebo.\n\nBut the man hadn’t taken it because he couldn’t find it.\n\n“He said, ‘I went to a couple of pharmacies, and they just didn’t have it,’ ” said a doctor who later treated him in the ER. The doctor asked not to be named because he didn’t have permission from his employer to speak about the case.\n\nA CT scan revealed that a massive clot called a saddle embolism was choking off the blood supply to the man’s lungs. The doctor had no doubt that the cause of the rare clot was the man’s untreated Covid-19 infection. Quick treatment saved the man’s life. “He was extremely lucky to survive,” the doctor said.\n\nPaxlovid and another Covid-19 antiviral pill, molnupiravir, were widely hailed as pandemic game-changers when the US Food and Drug Administration authorized them in late December. Taken within the first five days of Covid-19 symptoms, they can sharply reduce illness severity.\n\nSeizing on the potential of these new therapies, the federal government ordered at least 23 million courses of these medications – 20 million of Paxlovid and more than 3 million of molnupiravir – at a cost of more than $1 billion.\n\nThis week, the federal government is launching a program called test-to-treat that aims to improve access to the medications by creating one-stop locations where people with Covid symptoms can take a rapid test, get their results within minutes, see a clinician and leave with a course of the medication to take at home\n\nThe program was needed because although the federal government has been shipping treatment courses to states, access to the pills quickly became unequal.\n\nWhile a doctor in Delaware scours the internet and spends hours calling local pharmacies to try to find the pills for her patients, courses of the drugs sit unused on pharmacy shelves in Mississippi – leading Dr. Thomas Dobbs, the state’s public health officer, to plead with physicians and patients to use them.\n\nThe government has beendistributing these scarce treatments to states based on the size of their populations and their Covid-19 infection rates. And although states can shift unused supplies within their own borders, there’s no plan to redistribute unused doses from states that have a surplus, like Mississippi, to those that are going without, like West Virginia, which has used 84% of its allotted doses of Paxlovid through March 7.\n\n“Holy smokes! I could use some of that,” said retired Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, director of West Virginia’s Joint Interagency Task Force, after learning how many doses of Paxlovid other states still have on hand.\n\n“We use our entire allocations every week, and we could probably use an additional two to three times what we receive,” Hoyer said.\n\nNo plan to redistribute unused pills\n\nIn the past, if states weren’t using all their supplies of infused therapies like monoclonal antibodies, they could decline their allotment, and the federal government could sweep unused Covid-19 therapies back into a federal pool, where it could be claimed by other states, said Michael Ganio, senior director of pharmacy practice and quality at the American Society of Health Systems Pharmacists.\n\n“Because of the high demand for these drugs and because of how limited the supply is, by not sweeping it, it makes sure that states still have access to that amount,” Ganio said.\n\nThat gives the states some certainty with regard to supply, but it comes at the expense of flexibility and access for areas that are going without.\n\n“It’s really, really frustrating from an ICU doc perspective,” said the Maryland doctor who treated the man with the serious blood clot. “I should be able to prescribe it to my family members, like I do with Tamiflu, and it should be available at every CVS in the country. I just don’t understand why it’s not.”\n\nTest-to-treat may bring this ideal closer to reality. For the first time, pharmacies will be able to order their own supplies of the pills from the federal government, without having to go through states.\n\nIn its latest weekly update, the US Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, or ASPR, said the supplies of pills to stock the test-to-treat program will come from a separate federal cache of drugs that will not affect current state allocations. Test-to-treat will also ship pills directly to pharmacies serving long-term care facilities.\n\nPharmacy chains will choose where the pills should go, however, rather than the federal government or states.\n\nAlthough the program officially gets underway this week, it may take some time to get it up and running, and it’s not clear where stores that participate in the program will be located.\n\nIn many states, lifesaving pills go unused\n\nUntil test-to-treat becomes widely available, however, states will continue to be the main distributors of antivirals pills.\n\nA CNN analysis of data collected from state health departments shows big differences in availability of these medications.\n\nWashington and New Jersey report using nearly all available supplies of their Paxlovid, for example, but Minnesota, Mississippi and Utah still have more than three-quarters of their allocated supplies.\n\nProviders are tasked with reporting daily usage of these therapeutics into the federal government, and HHS shares this data in a “public therapeutics locator.”\n\nThe federal data, however, is notably incomplete. Thousands of providers last updated usage more than a month ago, and some states told CNN that some providers have not reported this information at all.\n\n“It’s really frustrating,” said Dr. Tete Tonwe, who runs a family practice clinic called Divergent Primary Care in Milford, Delaware.\n\nDespite regularly searching the government’s therapeutics locator database, networking with other doctors and calling pharmacies, Tonwe says, she still hasn’t been able to find this drug to treat her high-risk patients, though she recently heard that a physician friend was able to find some.\n\n“I just want to help people feel better,” she said.\n\n“When something like this drug – which is as close to a cure as you get with a virus – exists, but it’s not available here and it’s being wasted elsewhere, it’s just really, really kind of like a moral injury,” she said.\n\nThe Delaware Department of Health and Social Services says the state gets enough Paxlovid every two weeks to treat 200 people. Mississippi has enough Paxlovid sitting unused on pharmacy shelves to treat 2,846 people, according to the state Department of Health.\n\n“The test-to-treat program should reach more people creating convenience for our citizens. We are communicating with our partners and providers to determine resources they would need to implement this statewide,” wrote Timothy Turane, a spokesperson for the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services, in a statement to CNN.\n\nAlthough some states are reserving their limited supplies of the drug to treat only those at highest risk of severe consequences, Mississippi is making the medications available to anyone with a positive Covid-19 test and a prescription.\n\n“We have unused tools in our toolbox, and we want to make sure that everyone is aware that they are available and can help save Mississippi lives,” Dobbs said at a recent news briefing.\n\nThough the pace of new infections is slowing nationwide, 78% of US counties are still reporting substantial or high rates of transmission, according to CDC data.\n\nAlmost 45,000 new Covid-19 infections reported each day in the United States, yet about half of Covid-19 therapeutics are still going unused, according to ASPR.\n\nOvercoming hurdles to prescribing the drugs\n\nThe reasons why these lifesaving treatments have been underutilized are complex.\n\nMolnupiravir causes the genetic material inside the virus to make mistakes as it copies itself, essentially mutating the virus to death. Because of the way the drug works, there’s some fear that it may also mutate the DNA in rapidly dividing cells. Animal studies have suggested that it might interfere with bone formation, so it’s not supposed to be used in anyone younger than 18. It’s also not recommended for women who are pregnant, since there’s a risk of birth defects.\n\nIn clinical trials, molnupiravir was less effective than Paxlovid, cutting the risk of a Covid-19 hospitalization by 30%. That led many doctors to question whether the risks for some people are worth its benefits.\n\nPaxlovid, a pill that combines two medicines, interacts with drugs in 32 classes of medications, including antidepressants, antibiotics, antipsychotics and blood pressure medications. These interactions make it tricky to prescribe.\n\n“The sicker people who qualify for it are also more likely to have drug interactions, so we have to be more cautious of it,” says Dr. Mark Horne, immediate past president of the Mississippi State Medical Association.\n\nHorne says he recently tried to prescribe Paxlovid for a 94-year-old patient, and although he could have temporarily stopped his patient’s cholesterol medication, he didn’t feel like he could stop a different heart medication his patient was taking that would have interacted. Instead, he had to call around until he found a dose of the monoclonal antibody sotrovimab, which came from a neighboring state.\n\nAnother obstacle is that doctors just aren’t aware of the medications or don’t feel familiar enough with how they work to confidently prescribe them.\n\nDobbs, the state health officer for Mississippi, says this happened with monoclonal antibody infusions, too.\n\n“They were available for many months before we had robust use in the state of Mississippi,” Dobbs said.\n\nOnce a prescriber has found a patient who can safely take one of the new antiviral drugs, they have to locate it. Even with the pills becoming more plentiful, the medications can still be difficult to find.\n\nRod Hilton, a 40-year-old software developer from Denver, recently drove three hours round-trip to fill his Paxlovid prescription.\n\nHilton has an underlying health condition, and says he and his wife are very Covid-conscious. They pulled their two young children out of school through the winter holidays to try to protect them from infection. Then, when the family couldn’t stand doing work and school from home any longer, their 5-year-old ended up catching Covid-19 on her first day back to school.\n\n“Then it was just one by one dominoes,” he says. His 3-year-old got sick, then his wife, “and then I caught it.”\n\nNormally, their family doctor phones in their prescriptions to a nearby pharmacy. This time, though, he handed Hilton his prescription on a piece of paper because he’d already written 14 prescriptions for Paxlovid. They’d all gone unfilled.\n\nKnowing that he had to take the medicine quickly for it to be effective, Hilton sat in the parking lot of his doctor’s office – congested and with a throbbing headache – and started searching for pharmacies that might have it. Walmart was out across the state. The he found the Covid-19 Therapeutics Locator website and started calling. Finally, he found some at a hospital pharmacy in Greeley, a 90-minute drive north into the mountains.\n\nHilton says the drug was worth the trip. The day he filled his prescription, he was in rough shape. He took his first dose that night. “Within 24 hours, it was gone,” he says.\n\nHilton and his wife are both vaccinated. She got Covid-19 before he did. Hilton recovered completely within a day of starting Paxlovid, but his wife was sick for more than a week after he recovered.\n\nHilton knows he was lucky. Even sick, he had the means and time to find a pharmacy where he could get his pills. Not everyone is able to do that.\n\n‘We’re not done with treatment’\n\n“The prescribing process is what kind of took the shine off the medications,” said Dr. Jane Wainaina, an infectious-disease specialist and medical director of the antimicrobial stewardship progam at Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee.\n\nWainaina said that although the pills – particularly Paxlovid – looked in their clinical trials like they could deal a crushing blow to the pandemic, they have been harder to use in the real world.\n\n“We’ve been able to supply oral antivirals to every patient that qualified and wanted their treatment,” she said, but not many do. At her hospital, only about 30% of the people the hospital has deemed eligible to take the pills have responded to an initial phone call. And of that group, only about half end up taking them.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWainaina says many patients feel wary about taking a medication that’s not fully approved by the FDA. Both antiviral pills are available through an emergency use authorization, which requires a lower standard of evidence to bring a treatment onto the market.\n\nShe says timing also presents some challenges.\n\n“We’re offering these medications early because that’s when they work. At that point, many people are not feeling unwell. They’re like, ‘Why do I need to take a medication? I don’t feel that bad. It’s just a cold,’ ” she said.\n\nThese drugs are good, she said, but they don’t check all the boxes.\n\n“We’re not done with treatment. We’re going to have to continue to work and study in order to stay somewhat ahead of the virus as far as effective treatments go,” Wainaina said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/27/delaware-art-museum-works-sale/6967825/", "title": "Delaware Art Museum to auction off treasures", "text": "Margie Fishman\n\nWilmington (Del.) News-Journal\n\nWILMINGTON -- In a rare move, the Delaware Art Museum will sell as many as four works of art, valued at $30 million, to repay debt from a facilities expansion and replenish its endowment, museum leaders announced Wednesday.\n\nMuseum CEO Mike Miller said the \"last resort\" board action was necessary to avoid closing the museum.\n\nHe acknowledged that the decision could damage the museum's reputation nationwide, resulting in possible loss of accreditation and professional sanctions that would bar the museum in the short-term from loaning or borrowing works from other museums. The move could also hamper the century-old Delaware museum's efforts to recruit a new director.\n\n\"We're basically shunned for a period of years,\" he said.\n\nMuseum leaders declined to name the specific works that will be auctioned off within six months, but they said they were selected to have \"minimal impact\" on the museum's 12,500-piece collection. The sale could involve paintings and sculptures. The board has identified three works to be sold, Miller said, and could select a fourth from a short list if needed.\n\nNo work that was acquired through a gift or bequest – representing roughly 90 percent of the museum's collection – will be part of the sale, Miller said. That includes one of the museum's most iconic works, Edward Hopper's Summertime, which officials said could easily fetch $30 million on its own. The painting was donated in 1962 by the sister of Wilmington art collector John L. Sexton.\n\nHousing the largest collection of British pre-Raphaelite art outside of the United Kingdom, the museum also boasts significant holdings from one of Wilmington's favorite sons, Howard Pyle.\n\nSixteen board members in attendance voted unanimously to approve selling the works, including Pyle's great-grandson, board vice president Roberts Brokaw III. Brokaw did not return a phone call late Wednesday.\n\nThree trustees – board chairman Gerret Copeland, Paula Malone and Joshua Twilley – were absent. Copeland, a major donor, was traveling out of the country, but agreed with the decision, said Miller.\n\nAfter losing its credit guarantee from Wells Fargo bank, the museum was faced with having to repay by October the full $19.8 million remaining on the bond, which would have nearly liquidated the museum's reserve fund.\n\nTo avoid that scenario, trustees had been working for a year on various refinancing options, an alliance or merger with another local arts institution, or restructuring the museum's operating model. None of those options proved viable, Miller said, given the museum's outstanding debt. Currently, the museum's operating deficit is $1.6 million, which represents more than 40 percent of its $4 million budget.\n\nThe museum also sought guidance from two professional associations: the Association of Art Museum Directors and the American Alliance of Museums. AAMD president Timothy Rub, who directs the Philadelphia Museum of Art, said he advised museum leaders to go public with their financial difficulties to rally support among private donors and legislators to restructure the debt.\n\nSale a last resort\n\nMuseum officials first learned in early 2013 that the bank had planned to withdraw its credit guarantee, Miller said, and leaders subsequently reached out to major donors with no success.\n\n\"We talked to every white knight we could think of,\" he said. \"We didn't want to do it this way.\"\n\nMuseums regularly sell pieces in their collections to fund future acquisitions, a process known as \"deaccessioning.\" The Delaware Museum has sold six works in the past decade through this practice.\n\nBut selling works to fund operating expenses or capital improvements is against AAMD and AAM guidelines, Rub said. It also contradicts the Delaware museum's collection policies.\n\n\"It's highly unusual for boards of trustees to take such a step,\" Rub said. \"You can count the examples not even on one hand in recent memory.\"\n\nOver the past decade, the AAMD has sanctioned only one museum – the National Academy Museum in New York – for selling two Hudson River School paintings in 2008 to pay its bills. Sanctions, which don't happen until after the sale is complete, can involve directing the AAMD's more than 230 members not to collaborate with the offending museum on exhibitions.\n\nIn the last two years, the Delaware museum has presented two traveling exhibitions, and loaned three mid-19th century pre-Raphaelite paintings to the Tate in London.\n\nMiller, 63, is the museum's former part-time chief financial officer and former chief financial officer for DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. He has no arts background. He has led the museum since former director Danielle Rice departed in August. After 8 years, Rice left to direct a new museum leadership graduate program at Drexel University.\n\nWhile the board has dealt with the debt issue, the search for Rice's replacement has been put on hold, Miller said. He expects it to resume this fall.\n\nReached this week, Rice declined to comment on the art sale. The debt, she said, \"was a struggle that was with me from the moment I started.\"\n\nDuring her tenure, Rice helped raise $6.7 million as part of the museum's centennial campaign to rebuild its endowment. But that was still $3.3 million short of the goal. Donors, she said, were reluctant to give based on the museum's longstanding debt.\n\nAsked if the museum would consider selling art again as part of a financial bailout, Miller replied: \"Never again.\"\n\n\"We're taking care of the debt issue,\" he said. \"We really think we're setting the [museum] up for the next 100 years.\n\nHow the museum got here\n\nIn 2005, the museum nearly doubled its size under a $32.5 million building project that was plagued with cost overruns and delays. To finance the expansion, the museum took out $24.8 million in tax-exempt bonds, which were expected to be paid in full by 2037.\n\nBut after the 2008 financial crisis, banks tightened their lending regulations. At the same time, the museum's endowment declined sharply from $33 million to a low of $21 million. Faced with a dropoff in corporate and private donations and at least a decade-long operational deficit, the museum cut staff. Arts institutions across the country have confronted similar budget constraints.\n\nThe situation became so dire that the Delaware Art Museum had to default on certain stipulations in its debt agreement, Miller said, such as maintaining a sustainable debt-to-earnings ratio. That prompted Wells Fargo to demand repayment sooner. The museum has paid $5 million toward the debt principal over the last three years, along with annual debt-service payments of more than $500,000.\n\n\"While the Trustees fully understand and respect museum best practices, we couldn't bear voting to close our beloved Delaware Art Museum,\" board president Elva Ferrari-Graham said in a statement. She did not return a phone call late Wednesday.\n\nThe board has promised to work tirelessly next year to rebuild the donor base, Miller said.\n\nFounded in 1912 as the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts, the museum was established by a group of Pyle's students, admirers and friends. They seeded it with 128 paintings from Pyle's studio, which were purchased from his widow. Pyle's distant cousin Dana Pyle still lives in north Wilmington. At age 88, he recently displayed at the Delaware museum a group of miniatures he created based on his celebrated ancestor's works.\n\nDana Pyle said he owns five original Pyle engravings and considered donating them to the Delaware Museum after he moved into a retirement home.\n\nIf the museum decides to sell any of Howard Pyle's works, \"it would be a disaster,\" he said, adding that he would refuse to donate his collection.\n\n\"I would take my five Howard Pyles and find a place for them,\" he said. \"I would keep those until the very last minute.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/05/06/high-school-report/26737951/", "title": "High school report", "text": "Brandywine\n\nBrandywine\n\nCongratulations to English teacher Jeannie McMullen for being chosen as Brandywine High School's Teacher of the Year.\n\nMaria DiCristofaro, outstanding female athlete, and Raquel Brown, athlete of promise, were honored at an April 19 luncheon sponsored by the Delaware Women’s Alliance for Sports and Fitness.\n\nCongratulations to the March Athletes of the Month: Drew Koski for tennis and Alicia Corrado for softball.\n\nBaseball Coach Larry Wheeler recorded his 450th coaching victory with a win over McKean on March 31.

The red states are moving social policy sharply to the right within their borders on issues from abortion to LGBTQ rights and classroom censorship, while simultaneously working to hobble the ability of either the federal government or their own largest metro areas to set a different course.\n\nTo a degree unimaginable even a decade ago, this broad offensive increasingly looks like an effort to define a nation within a nation – one operating with a set of rules and policies that diverge from the rest of America more than in almost any previous era.\n\n“The only time I can recall in American history even remotely like this [divergence] was after the Civil War when the separate but equal doctrine began to emerge” across the South as a backlash against the attempts of the 13th, 14th and 15th Constitutional amendments to ensure equality for the freed slaves, says Donald Kettl, the former dean of the public policy school at the University of Maryland and author of the book, “The Divided States of America.” He added, “It’s a multifront war with very sharp swords.”\n\nThe elements of the red state offensive include a flurry of lawsuits seeking to block actions from Biden’s administration on issues from the environment to civil rights to immigration; other lawsuits, such as the case around a Mississippi law that prompted the Supreme Court to overturn the right to abortion, aimed at providing states more leeway to deviate from previously nationally guaranteed rights; a flurry of red state laws that advance the cultural priorities of the GOP’s predominantly White Christian electoral base; and a steady flow of red state statutes blocking Democratic-leaning large cities and counties from setting their own policies on everything from police budgets to recycling.\n\nThe willingness of so many red states to adopt these common approaches testifies in part to the energetic organizing efforts of many conservative groups, from Heritage Action and the American Legislative Exchange Council to the Republican Attorneys General Association. But even more profoundly, the alignment of so many red states behind this shared agenda and strategy underscores how many of them are being shaped by a common set of economic and demographic trends.\n\nOn everything from gun ownership and religious affiliation to reliance on fossil fuels and participation (or not) in the 21st century information economy, most red states are following similar tracks, while diverging more sharply from the experience in blue states. Broadly speaking, blue states are more heavily exposed to the big demographic, cultural and economic forces reshaping American life, while red states are less exposed, and to the extent they are, those changes are centered overwhelmingly on their large metropolitan areas, which are trending Democratic and often – like in Austin or Atlanta – are a target for the Republicans controlling state government.\n\n“It’s not at the level of Jim Crow, or certainly the difference between slave states and free states, but the differences are major,” says Jake Grumbach, a University of Washington political scientist who studies divergence among the states. And like Kettl, Grumbach believes the economic and political differences between the red and blue states are on track to only widen.\n\nFor Democrats, the red state offensive has been a source of rising alarm. The fact that the red states have succeeded in shifting policy toward the right on so many fronts has spurred widespread frustration within the party, as exemplified by California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s frequent calls for a more forceful response.\n\nYet the real threat in the red state effort to set their own course may be less an advantage for one side or another than a challenge to the nation’s underlying cohesion. As red states grow more aggressive about going their own way, while working to preempt challenges from above (the federal government) or below (blue local governments), they are testing how much divergence the nation’s fundamental cohesion can take before it begins to unravel.\n\n“You have a very dangerous situation,” said David Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association and legal adviser to the immigration advocacy group America’s Voice. “This is a direct threat to the nation as a unified entity. This is one step closer to the country dividing into two separate countries.”\n\nNeither all red, nor all blue, states are carbon copies of each other. Significant differences remain within each bloc (and between urban and rural areas within each state).\n\nOne way to define the red states is to examine the 25 that voted for Donald Trump in both the 2016 and 2020 elections. At a time when the foreign-born share of the total US population is nearing its all-time high, 19 of the Trump states rank among the bottom 25 states in the share of their population composed of immigrants. While the overall share of college graduates is also rising, 20 of these states also rank in the bottom 25 for the share of their population that holds at least a four-year college degree, the Census Bureau found. The vast majority of Trump states, by contrast, fall into the top half when states are ranked by the share of their population that are White Christians or who own guns.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch: Trump introduced by hype video, pyrotechnics at GOP event 03:44 - Source: CNN\n\nIn their economic structure as well, the red states, as a group, are much more rooted in the powerhouse industries of the 20th century than their blue counterparts, and less represented in the information-age industries generating the greatest economic output in the 21st century. Of the states Trump won, 23 rank in the top 26 states that emit the most carbon from their energy sector for each dollar of economic output, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. As I’ve written before, that’s a revealing metric of the states that are most heavily integrated in the existing fossil fuel economy, either as producers or big consumers of coal, oil and natural gas.\n\nBy contrast, 18 of the Trump states rank in the bottom half for the share of the workforce employed in technology jobs, according to data provided to me by Brookings Metro, a center-left thinktank.\n\nThe red states have some clear economic strengths. Housing costs and taxes are generally lower in them, which has helped some of them add population at a rapid rate. But with these high-wage, high-value information-age jobs concentrating more in blue states, a substantial gap has opened between the two regions in economic output and wages. Only three smaller red states with large energy extraction industries (Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming) have median wages that equal the average across all of the blue states, according to calculations by Grumbach and two co-authors in a chapter of the recent book, “The American Political Economy.”\n\nMichael Podhorzer, chair of the Analyst Institute, a collaborative of progressive groups that studies elections, recently quantified the economic gap between the two sections in another way. He used a slightly different definition of red and blue states (based on both presidential voting and which party controls state government) whose main impact was to remove seven states into a third purple group: Trump-won North Carolina and six captured by Biden. Looking at the remaining states, Podhorzer calculated that the gross domestic product per person and the median household income are now both more than 25% greater in the blue section than in the red.\n\nTo a somewhat remarkable extent, the two major sections are divided as well in the basic structure of where people live – with the blue states revolving much more around big metropolitan centers. Using a classification system that divides communities into six categories from most to least urban, Podhorzer calculated that over three-fifths of residents in the blue states live in the two most dense categories (core urban counties and inner suburbs) while less than one-third live in the least urban categories. Red states are almost the mirror image: almost three-in-five residents live in the three least urban categories, while slightly less than one-in-three reside in the two most urban groupings.\n\nThose population findings put an exclamation point on the underlying economic divergence. The most urban counties are the most Democratic-leaning parts of the red states – places like Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, Phoenix and their inner suburbs. Conversely, the least urban places are the most Republican-leaning parts of the blue states. If you subtract each of those outlying areas from their section’s total economic output – that is, remove the most urban places from the red total and the most rural places from the blue – the gap between them in total economic output widens even further: with those counties removed from each side, the blue section’s contribution to the total US gross national product is an astonishing 75% bigger than the red section’s.\n\nTo a far greater extent than in earlier generations, control of state government now aligns with states’ preferences in presidential elections. Republicans now control both chambers of the state legislature in all of the 25 states that voted two times for Trump except for Nebraska, which has a unicameral nonpartisan legislature. Republicans also control the governorship in 21 of the two-time Trump states, all but Louisiana, Kansas, Kentucky and North Carolina.\n\nWith this preponderant political control, Republicans in these states have been at the forefront of efforts to roll back what legal scholars have called the “rights revolution” of the past six decades in which the Supreme Court and Congress have nationalized a wide array of rights – from abortion to contraception and same-sex marriage – and constrained the ability of states to impinge on those rights.\n\nOf the 25 states that voted for Trump, 19 have already moved to restrict abortion access since the Supreme Court last month struck down Roe v. Wade, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights thinktank that tracks state policy. Four other two-time Trump states are considered likely to also restrict abortion in the coming months, with Indiana beginning a special session on Monday that could pass new limits and Kansas voters deciding next week on a constitutional amendment that could open the door to future restrictions. The only Trump states where abortion rights do not appear in imminent jeopardy are North Carolina (where Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has vetoed anti-abortion legislation) and Alaska.\n\nSimilarly, 18 of the Trump states have passed laws preventing transgender girls from competing on girls’ school sports teams, with several also moving against parents who authorize gender-affirming care for their minor children. Most of these same states have passed laws since 2021 restricting how public school teachers can discuss issues of race, gender or sexual orientation, such as Florida’s “don’t say gay” bill. And several on the list have simultaneously passed laws making it easier for critics to ban books from school libraries. These states also dominate the list of jurisdictions that have passed legislation making it more difficult to vote in response to Trump’s false claims of fraud in the 2020 election.\n\n“Right wing culture wars are now taking on even more significance because the Supreme Court has tossed what were once protected constitutional rights into the political battlefield,” Cooper, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, told me in an interview. “A zip code should not determine a woman’s reproductive rights, but that’s where we are right now.”\n\nAs I’ve written, red states over the past decade have increasingly preempted the authority of blue-trending local governments across a dizzying array of issues – everything from environmental rules to police budgets to masking or lockdown rules issued in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Conservative Republicans in the Texas state legislature have announced they intend to introduce legislation next year that would authorize district attorneys from any county to prosecute violations of the state’s abortion ban – a means of circumventing officials in large blue counties who have indicated they would not prioritize such enforcement.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Indiana holds special session attempting to pass new laws restricting abortion 03:00 - Source: CNN\n\nSimultaneously red states are aggressively using the courts to either overturn national rights or to block action from the federal government across a wide array of issues. Sixteen of the Trump states filed briefs supporting Mississippi in the lawsuit that led to the Supreme Court majority overturning Roe v. Wade. Eighteen of these states have joined a lawsuit seeking to block the Biden administration’s regulations extending to transgender students the educational civil rights protections established under Title IX. The Biden administration’s efforts to combat climate change have been another frequent target of lawsuits from various combinations of the same red states.\n\nThe rulings constraining Biden on immigration may encapsulate most precisely how the alliance of red states and GOP-appointed judges are interacting to constrict federal action.\n\nVarious combinations of these states, usually led by Texas, have launched multiple federal lawsuits designed to prevent Biden from reversing hardline immigration policies set by Trump. That included the case in which the Supreme Court last week let stand a district court ruling from a Trump-appointed judge that is preventing the Biden administration from setting immigration enforcement priorities different from those Trump established. Last year, Andrew Hanen, a conservative district court judge appointed by George W. Bush, in response to a suit brought by nine red states, issued an injunction blocking the Biden administration from accepting new applications under the program that provides legal protection to young people brought to the US illegally by their parents.\n\nLeopold, the former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, notes that these immigration cases have followed a similar trajectory. The red states, led by Texas, find a sympathetic district court judge, usually based in Texas, to target for the first hearing, which ensures that the case rises into the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, perhaps the country’s most conservative, and then from there reaches the Supreme Court, which is now dominated by six GOP-appointed justices. Leopold calls this the “anti-immigrant judicial pipeline” and says it has become a template for blocking federal action far beyond issues of migration.\n\n“These are attacks on specific policy choices that have traditionally been assigned to the executive … that are preventing Biden from effectively doing his job,” Leopold said. “What they have done is with the Trump years behind them, and with a deeper [roster] on the bench, they have completely used this politicized [Supreme] Court to make federal policy and to thwart the specific policy objectives of the Biden administration. Forget that 81 million people voted for him, this is about using the court as a political tool. And they have perfected the strategy.”\n\nSeen as a whole, the red states’ drive to set their own rules, while blocking any interference from either blue-leaning local governments or a Democratic-controlled federal government, represents the broadest effort to carve out a separate sphere of influence since the fierce resistance to reconstruction across the South after the Civil War that ultimately led to Jim Crow segregation, Kettl believes. In some respects, he argues, red states are displaying a greater separatist impulse today than the South did then.\n\n“The late 19th century had a focus on separate but equal doctrine, and it had to do with a fundamental question of social policy,” Kettl told me. “This is an effort on a far broader collection of fronts – immigration, abortion, health care, the governance of schools, the issues of transportation policy. One after another. It’s on a far broader front than was ever the case in the late 19th century.”\n\nFor now, Kettl sees the initial red state Republican goal primarily as consolidating these new rules and blocking any interference – what he calls “an effort to build very high castle walls with a very deep moat.” But like Grumbach and other experts on state policy, Kettl is dubious that Republicans will settle for imposing their values solely on the states now under their control. As the red states pursue a more consistent and coordinated course, Kettl predicts that Republicans will “try to impose [this] policy on the nation as a whole” if they achieve the federal power to do so.\n\nBlue states such as California, New York, Illinois and Colorado have moved forcefully over the past two years to expand many of the liberties now under siege in the red states. But congressional Republicans while in the minority have already introduced proposals that would apply the red state rules across the entire nation on many of these same issues. The new social order red states are now sketching behind their “castle” walls may offer the best preview of what Republicans will try to impose on all states the next time they achieve unified control of the White House and Congress in Washington.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}]}
