By most standards, you’d be right – because drinking is typically tracked as an average over the week.\n\nDrinkers who binged were about five times more likely to experience multiple alcohol problems, according to new research. Yordan Rusev/Adobe Stock\n\n“This leaves many drinkers mistakenly assuming that a moderate average level of consumption is safe, regardless of drinking pattern,” said Rudolf Moos, professor emeritus of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine, in a statement.\n\nMoos is the coauthor of a recent study that found many moderate drinkers above age 30 actually end up binging on the weekend – defined as five or more drinks in a row or within a short period of time.\n\nPeople who binged were about five times more likely to experience multiple alcohol problems, such as “getting hurt, emotional or psychological problems from alcohol, having to use more alcohol to get the same effect, and experiencing effects of alcohol at work, school or caring for children,” said study coauthor Charles Holahan, professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, in an email.\n\n“What this means is that an individual whose total consumption is seven drinks on Saturday night presents a greater risk profile than someone whose total consumption is a daily drink with dinner, even though their average drinking level is the same,” Holahan said.\n\nAdult binge drinking\n\nMost past research on binge drinking has focused on the younger generation, typically teens and college students. Consuming multiple drinks at one sitting is widespread in this population segment. But statistics show a good many adults over 30 are binge drinkers, and the problem is on the rise, especially among women and adults over 65.\n\nYet levels of binge drinking among adults may escape “public health scrutiny, because it occurs among individuals who drink at a moderate average level,” Holahan said. “At present, binge drinking among moderate drinkers is largely undetected in primary care settings.”\n\nWomen are especially sensitive to the effects of alcohol, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Alcohol-related problems appear sooner and at lower drinking levels than in men, the NIAA said.\n\nWomen are more susceptible to alcohol-related brain damage and heart disease than men, and studies show women who have one drink a day increase their risk of breast cancer by 5% to 9% compared with women who abstain.\n\nFor both men and women over 65 years of age, the increase “is of particular concern because many older adults use medications that can interact with alcohol, have health conditions that can be exacerbated by alcohol, and may be more susceptible to alcohol-related falls and other accidental injuries,” the NIAA stated.\n\nAn ‘overlooked’ pattern\n\nThe new study, published in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine, used survey data collected as part of the Midlife Development in the United States study, which has been following a national sample of Americans between the ages of 25 and 74 since 1995.\n\nThe study analyzed nearly 1,300 drinkers over nine years and found most cases of binge drinking — and of multiple alcohol problems — occurred among individuals who were average moderate drinkers.\n\n“An average moderate drinker of, for example, one drink a day might achieve that average by a daily drink with dinner or seven drinks on Saturday night,” Holahan said.\n\nWhile that behavior would not necessarily lead to alcoholism, Holahan said, the study found drinking an average of more than one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men – or five or more drinks on the same occasion – was linked to alcohol problems nine years later.\n\n“These findings point to a need for alcohol interventions targeting moderate average level drinkers in addition to conventional strategies focusing on the higher risk, but smaller, population of habitually high-level drinkers,” Holahan said.\n\nIs your drinking a problem?\n\nHow do you know if your use of alcohol has become a problem? One telltale sign is when drinking is beginning to interfere with your ability to go through your daily life, experts say.\n\nThere is help. Find it here The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has a tool called “NIAA Alcohol Treatment Navigator” that “helps adults find alcohol treatment for themselves or an adult loved one.” For teens, the institute recommends these resources. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has a free, confidential National Helpline active 24/7/365 to provide information and treatment referrals to local treatment facilities, support groups, and community-based organizations: 1-800-662-HELP (4357) and 1-800-487-4889 (TTY option).\n\n“Alcohol use disorder is defined as compulsively using alcohol despite having negative consequences from your use, such as an impact on your relationships, your ability to function in your job or in whatever roles you have in your community,” Dr. Sarah Wakeman, medical director of the Substance Use Disorders Initiative at Mass General Brigham told CNN in a prior interview.\n\nBe wary if you continue drinking despite negative impacts on your physical or mental health. And it doesn’t have to be calling in sick or working with a hangover, Dr. Leena Mittal, chief of the women’s mental health division in the department of psychiatry at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, told CNN previously.\n\n“Don’t forget relationships. Are you having more disagreements? Are people in your life expressing concern or noting that you’re different? Hiding your drinking, or lying about it, these too are concerning behaviors,” Mittal said.\n\nHere’s a red flag: You’re pouring big drinks without realizing it. Current American Heart Association guidelines call for no more than two standard drinks a day for men and one for women and anyone 65 and older.\n\nWhat is a standard drink? It’s 12 ounces of regular beer, 4 ounces of regular wine or 1.5 ounces of liquor, according to US standards.\n\n“Yet people may be pouring a huge goblet of wine and not realize that it’s actually two or three servings of wine and not just one,” Wakeman said.\n\n“We know that millions of Americans drink above those levels, even in pre-pandemic times,” Wakeman said. “In 2019, some 66 million Americans had episodes where they were drinking higher than those recommended limits.”\n\nIf you (or a loved one) appears to be struggling with alcohol, don’t hesitate to reach out for help, experts stress. There are many different support groups that can assist, such as 12-step programs and individual therapy.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/health/dementia-ultraprocessed-food-wellness/index.html", "title": "Ultraprocessed food may contribute to dementia, study says | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN —\n\nWe all eat them — ultraprocessed foods such as frozen pizza and ready-to-eat meals make our busy lives much easier. Besides, they are just darn tasty — who isn’t susceptible to hot dogs, sausages, burgers, french fries, sodas, cookies, cakes, candy, doughnuts and ice cream, to name just a few?\n\nIf more than 20% of your daily calorie intake is ultraprocessed foods, however, you may be raising your risk for cognitive decline, a new study found.\n\nThat amount would equal about 400 calories a day in a 2,000-calories-a-day diet. For comparison, a small order of fries and regular cheeseburger from McDonald’s contains a total of 530 calories.\n\nThe part of the brain involved in executive functioning — the ability to process information and make decisions — is especially hard hit, according to the study published Monday in JAMA Neurology.\n\nMen and women in the study who ate the most ultraprocessed foods had a 25% faster rate of executive function decline and a 28% faster rate of overall cognitive impairment compared with those who ate the least amount of overly processed food.\n\n“While this is a study of association, not designed to prove cause and effect, there are a number or elements to fortify the proposition that some acceleration in cognitive decay may be attributed to ultraprocessed foods,” said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine and nutrition, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“The sample size is substantial, and the follow-up extensive. While short of proof, this is robust enough that we should conclude ultraprocessed foods are probably bad for our brains.”\n\nThere was an interesting twist, however. If the quality of the overall diet was high — meaning the person also ate a lot of unprocessed, whole fruits and veggies, whole grains and healthy sources of protein — the association between ultraprocessed foods and cognitive decline disappeared, Katz said.\n\n“Ultraprocessed foods drag diet quality down, and thus their concentration in the diet is an indicator of poor diet quality in most cases,” Katz said. “Atypical as it seems, apparently some of the participants managed it. And when diet quality was high, the observed association between ultraprocessed foods and brain function abated.”\n\nUltraprocessed foods, like burgers and fries, could raise your risk for cognitive decline if it's more than 20% of your daily calorie intake, a new study found. d3sign/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nA lot of ultraprocessed foods\n\nThe study followed over 10,000 Brazilians for up to 10 years. Just over half of the study participants were women, White or college educated, while the average age was 51.\n\nCognitive testing, which included immediate and delayed word recall, word recognition and verbal fluency, was performed at the beginning and end of the study, and participants were asked about their diet.\n\n“In Brazil, ultraprocessed foods make up 25% to 30% of total calorie intake. We have McDonald’s, Burger King, and we eat a lot of chocolate and white bread. It’s not very different, unfortunately, from many other Western countries,” coauthor Dr. Claudia Suemoto, an assistant professor in the division of geriatrics at the University of São Paulo Medical School, told CNN when the study abstract was released in August.\n\n“Fifty-eight percent of the calories consumed by United States citizens, 56.8% of the calories consumed by British citizens, and 48% of the calories consumed by Canadians come from ultraprocessed foods,” Suemoto said.\n\nUltraprocessed foods are defined as “industrial formulations of food substances (oils, fats, sugars, starch, and protein isolates) that contain little or no whole foods and typically include flavorings, colorings, emulsifiers, and other cosmetic additives,” according to the study.\n\nThose in the study who ate the most ultraprocessed foods were “more likely to be younger, women, White, had higher education and income, and were more likely to have never smoked, and less likely to be current alcohol consumers,” the study found.\n\nIt’s not just the brain\n\nIn addition to the impact on cognition, ultraprocessed foods are already known to raise the risk of obesity, heart and circulation problems, diabetes, cancer and a shorter life span.\n\n“Ultraprocessed foods in general are bad for every part of us,” said Katz, president and founder of the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine.\n\nUltaprocessed foods are usually high in sugar, salt and fat, all of which promote inflammation throughout the body, which is “perhaps the most major threat to healthy aging in the body and brain,” said Dr. Rudy Tanzi, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and director of the genetics and aging research unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“Meanwhile, since they are convenient as a quick meal, they also replace eating food that is high in plant fiber that is important for maintaining the health and balance of the trillions of bacteria in your gut microbiome,” Tanzi added, “which is particularly important for brain health and reducing risk of age-related brain diseases like Alzheimer’s disease.”\n\nWhat to do\n\nHow can you keep this from happening to you? If you include ultraprocessed foods in your diet, try to counter these by also eating high-quality, whole foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\n\n“The conclusion suggested here is that ultraprocessed foods are, indeed, an important ‘ingredient,’ but the exposure that should be the focus of public health efforts is overall diet quality,” Katz said.\n\nOne easy way to ensure diet quality is to cook and prepare your food from scratch, Suemoto said.\n\n“We say we don’t have time, but it really doesn’t take that much time,” Suemoto said.\n\n“And it’s worth it because you’re going to protect your heart and guard your brain from dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. That’s the take-home message: Stop buying things that are superprocessed.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/24/health/hypermobile-ehlers-danlos-syndrome-health-hnk-spc-dst-intl/index.html", "title": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome affects millions. Why isn't the medical ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne day in July 2021, my then 15-year-old daughter Poppy stumbled and fell while walking down some stairs, grazing her knee. It wasn’t a serious wound, but over the weeks it didn’t heal.\n\nAround the same time, her wrists and knees became sore; her ankles started rolling when she walked; her hands began shaking; her headaches and stomach aches became more frequent and intensely painful. She was always exhausted.\n\nBefore her health declined, Poppy had enjoyed horse riding and gymnastics, she’d competed in cross country races and been a fearless goalkeeper for the school hockey team.\n\nBut within a couple of months, as walking became increasingly difficult, she asked me for a walking stick. We found one that folds up and fits neatly in her school bag.\n\nI took Poppy to doctors who conducted tests, but they couldn’t find out what was wrong with her. Then, in October, a breakthrough.\n\nA podiatrist who was measuring Poppy for insoles to support her aching feet asked if Poppy could bend her thumb to reach her forearm. She could. Could she pull her little finger back to form a 90-degree angle with the back of her hand? She could do that, too.\n\n“Have you heard of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?” the podiatrist asked me. I hadn’t – so as soon as I got home, I went looking on the internet.\n\nThere are 13 types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), according to research and advocacy organization The Ehlers-Danlos Society. Most types are very rare, and can be diagnosed using genetic tests. However, the genes that cause hypermobile EDS (hEDS) – the most common form, accounting for about 90% of cases – are unknown, so diagnosis is based on a checklist of symptoms. The list includes a hypermobility rating, known as the Beighton Score.\n\nPoppy had enough symptoms to qualify for hEDS, and the diagnosis was confirmed by a doctor one year ago, on Christmas Eve. He told us that although we can do our best to alleviate some symptoms, there is no cure.\n\nPoppy reacted to the news better than I did. She had known for some time that something was fundamentally wrong. The diagnosis was upsetting but identifying her illness also gave her a sense of relief. I felt shocked and overwhelmed, and I cried for weeks.\n\nReading about EDS was like a dreadful slow reveal.\n\nI learned that it’s a genetic disorder that causes the body to make faulty connective tissue, and connective tissue is everywhere – in the tendons, ligaments, skin, heart, digestive system, eyes and gums.\n\nWeak connective tissue leads to hypermobility, which may sound like a good thing, but some people with bendy bodies suffer a mind-boggling array of symptoms, including joint dislocations and subluxations (like a mini dislocation, when the joint partially slips out of place), soft stretchy skin, abnormal scarring, poor wound healing, gastrointestinal disorders, chronic pain and fatigue.\n\nThe severity of symptoms varies wildly. Patients with milder cases can lead relatively normal lives, while others become housebound, and some can’t digest food and must be fed through tubes.\n\nWhat’s more, people with hEDS are prone to other conditions, including POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which makes you dizzy when you stand up) and MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome, which gives you allergy-type symptoms).\n\nI learned a lot of new acronyms and they all spelled bad news.\n\nZebras or horses?\n\nI initially thought hEDS was rare, because all forms of EDS are commonly referred to as rare. But within a few weeks, I felt like I was seeing references to hEDS everywhere. Actor, writer and director Lena Dunham; actor and presenter Jameela Jamil; and drag queen Yvie Oddly live with it. I deep dived into EDS Twitter and EDS Instagram, while Poppy found it comforting to watch TikTok videos made by teenagers with the condition.\n\nDrag queen Yvie Oddly, who has hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, crab walks down the pink carpet at RuPaul's DragCon LA in 2019. Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images\n\nI discovered multiple patient groups on Facebook, each with tens of thousands of members, which turned out to be great sources of support. I asked questions (what kind of shoes are best for weak ankles? Which knee braces are easiest to pull on and off?) and kind strangers sent helpful advice. At the same time, scrolling through countless personal stories of pain, despair and shattered dreams made me feel terrified about what might lie ahead.\n\nI noticed common themes. Many EDS patients had spent years seeking the correct diagnosis; others felt they’d been neglected and gaslit by doctors.\n\nThere was also a lot of talk of zebras.\n\nLinda Bluestein, a Colorado-based physician who specializes in EDS and other hypermobility conditions, and has hEDS herself, explains why.\n\n“I was told in medical school, ‘when you hear hoofbeats think horses, not zebras,’” she says. Many trainee doctors receive the same advice – when a patient presents with symptoms, “look for the common thing.” That’s why EDS patients commonly refer to themselves as zebras – and also use the fabulous collective noun “dazzle.” The name represents rarity and evokes the stripy stretch marks that are a common feature on EDS skin.\n\nBut if people with hEDS are medical zebras, why am I encountering so many of them?\n\nBluestein says that for many years it was thought that one in 5,000 people had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. But she says the limited research that’s been carried out into the prevalence of hEDS suggests the true number of cases is “much, much higher” than that.\n\nDr. Linda Bluestein has treated hEDS patients who have been searching for a diagnosis for decades. Linda Bluestein\n\nBluestein points me to a 2019 study carried out in Wales – a country of 3.1 million people. An examination of primary care and hospital records from 1990 to 2017 found that one in 500 people there has either hEDS or joint hypermobility syndrome (a similar condition with a slightly different set of symptoms). She says it’s “a good study” but believes it’s still an underestimate. The Ehlers-Danlos Society says more population studies need to be done to give a more accurate view of its incidence elsewhere.\n\nBut despite this possible prevalence, and how debilitating hypermobility disorders can be, the average time to diagnosis from the onset of symptoms is 10 to 12 years, according to The Ehlers-Danlos Society.\n\nBluestein has firsthand experience of this. Growing up, she wanted to become a ballet dancer and trained six days a week. When puberty hit, she started experiencing joint pain and migraines, and at 16 had her first orthopedic surgery. She realized she wouldn’t succeed in the ballet world and instead pursued her “back-up plan,” to become a doctor. But despite her career choice, Bluestein only received her hEDS diagnosis when she was 47 – more than 30 years later.\n\n“I told my doctor on numerous occasions, ‘there is something wrong with me, I don’t heal well, I get injured more easily than other people’,” she says. “And he just never, never listened.”\n\nWhy, for so many patients, does it take so long to get diagnosed?\n\n‘The worst possible model’\n\nIn 2014 a leading EDS expert, Professor Rodney Grahame, remarked at a conference that “no other disease in the history of modern medicine has been neglected in such a way as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.”\n\nFar more women than men are diagnosed with EDS, which could help to explain the neglect, because the medical profession has a long history of overlooking health complaints made by women.\n\nA 2009 study, conducted by the European Organisation for Rare Diseases, surveyed 414 families of EDS patients from five countries and found that the average delay to an EDS diagnosis was four years for men – but 16 years for women.\n\nThe report states that women with EDS tend to be “diagnosed later because their pain and hypotonia (poor muscle tone) aren’t considered as physical symptoms but rather as psychological symptoms or common complaints.”\n\n“We tend to get dismissed a lot more easily,” says Bluestein. “People jump to the conclusion that we’re histrionic females.”\n\nAnxiety is very common in patients with hypermobility issues, says Bluestein, which can cloud the picture. “When people with anxiety present to a physician, it can suck all the air out of the room, so that the physician almost can’t see anything else.”\n\nThis can ramp up the patient’s anxiety further “because people aren’t validating our symptoms, and then we start to doubt ourselves,” she says.\n\nWhat’s more, medicine is divided into silos which creates the “worst possible model” for EDS patients, says Bluestein.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'We're born with this and will never be free:' Hear stories from people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 05:02 - Source: CNN\n\nShe explains that undiagnosed patients might consult a neurologist for their migraines, a rheumatologist for joint pain, a cardiologist for palpitations, a gastroenterologist for digestive issues and a urologist for bladder symptoms. Each doctor focuses on the symptoms that fall within their specialty but doesn’t consider the other ailments. “Nowhere along the way does somebody realize that there are certain conditions that could tie all of these things together and explain everything,” says Bluestein.\n\nThe 2009 rare diseases study found that during the quest for a diagnosis, 58% of EDS patients consulted more than five doctors, and 20% consulted more than 20.\n\nThe consequences of not getting diagnosed for years can be devastating.\n\nMelissa Dickinson, a psychotherapist in Atlanta, Georgia, says she experienced symptoms of a “mystery illness” since childhood. Then in 2013, she “went on honeymoon to Mexico, relatively healthy, and came back disabled and with a dislocated neck.”\n\nWhile on vacation, Dickinson says she got food poisoning and was prescribed ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that can pose a serious risk of aortic aneurysm to people with EDS. Instead, she says it triggered significant nerve damage, digestive issues that almost made her go blind because her body wasn’t absorbing nutrients, and put her in a wheelchair.\n\nDickinson, who finally received her hEDS diagnosis in 2014, says taking the wrong medication “wrecked me from head to toe.” Now that she’s receiving treatment, “I can walk with mobility aids, but most of my body has to have constant support to function.”\n\nLara Bloom, president and CEO of The Ehlers-Danlos Society, who herself has hEDS, says many patients have “medicalized PTSD.”\n\n“They have had to stop their careers, they’ve had to drop out of school, their relationships have broken down.” The delay inevitably results in worsening symptoms and a declining quality of life, she says. In worst-case scenarios, patients “are dying by suicide, they’re self-harming.”\n\nSometimes, the failure to diagnose EDS has led to children being taken away from their parents.\n\nIn 2010, Americans Rana Tyson and her husband Chad were falsely accused of harming their 4-week-old twin daughters, who had unexplained fractures in their legs.\n\nAlong with their older sister, the baby girls were taken by state authorities in Texas and sent to live with relatives. “It was the worst day of my life,” Tyson tells me in a phone call.\n\nFive months later, a geneticist identified the twins as having a connective tissue disorder, and they were subsequently diagnosed with EDS and a vitamin D deficiency. The family was reunited but “12 years later, it still hurts,” says Tyson.\n\nBloom says some other parents of children with EDS have been wrongly accused of “fabricated or induced illness (FII)” – a rare form of abuse, formerly known as Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy, in which a parent or care giver deliberately causes symptoms or tries to convince doctors that a healthy child is ill.\n\nEllie Pattison, who has hEDS, has been repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder. Ellie Pattison\n\nEllie Pattison, a 19-year-old student who lives in County Durham, England, suffers from severe digestive issues linked to hEDS.\n\nThroughout her childhood, Ellie was repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder, she says, while her mother Caroline was accused of FII on three separate occasions. Caroline successfully fought to keep her daughter at home, says Ellie, but the ordeal has left the whole family with “an unimaginable amount of trauma.” Ellie says she suffered from PTSD and endured years of horrific nightmares, triggered by living with the fear from a young age that she could be forcibly separated from her family.\n\nThis underlines why prompt diagnosis is so important, says Bloom. “Our hope and dream is for people to get diagnosed when their symptoms begin.”\n\nThe search for answers\n\nIn the case of hEDS, a crucial first step is to find out what causes it.\n\nCortney Gensemer, a biomedical scientist in the Norris Lab at the Medical University of South Carolina’s department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology, is trying to solve this mystery. She and research mentor Russell Norris, head of the lab, have been studying a gene mutation they believe causes hEDS (the results of the study are currently under peer review).\n\nLike Poppy, Gensemer was diagnosed with hEDS as a teenager. She says the disease affects every aspect of her work. Looking down a microscope is particularly painful at times – her neck is unstable because of her hEDS, and she’s had metal screws put into some of her neck vertebrae to fuse them.\n\nCortney Gensemer working in the Norris Lab and recovering from neck surgery earlier this year. Cortney Gensemer\n\nNorris kitted the lab out with special equipment, including motion sensor doors (standard lab doors are very heavy), adjustable chairs and ergonomic pipettes that are gentle on the hands. “If I didn’t have all that stuff, I don’t think I’d be able to do it,” says Gensemer.\n\nTo find a hEDS-causing gene, Gensemer says she and Norris sampled DNA from a large family with cases spanning four generations and looked for a mutation that appears only in relatives who have the disease. They identified a “strong candidate gene” and inserted it into mice using gene editing tools.\n\nGensemer and Norris found that the hEDS mice had significantly more lax tissues, and floppier tails than regular rodents. “You can tie a loose knot into the mutant mouse tail. With a normal mouse tail, you can (only) bend it into a circle,” Gensemer says.\n\nThe gene that Gensemer and Norris found won’t account for all hEDS cases, she says. They believe that eventually multiple genes will be identified, and hEDS may be split into different subtypes. This would help to explain why different patients have different symptoms. Crucially, if genetic information sheds light on how the connective tissue is “messed up,” it could lead to effective treatments, says Gensemer.\n\nThe Ehlers-Danlos Society is also looking for genes as well as blood markers, working with a team of experts to sequence and analyze the DNA of 1,000 hEDS patients from around the world. And at the UK’s University of Warwick, Ph.D. candidate Sabeeha Malek, another scientist with hEDS, has proposed that EDS might be caused by a fault in the way that collagen binds to cell membranes in connective tissue. If she’s right, she hopes her work will lead to a skin biopsy test that could identify all forms of the disease.\n\nSabeeha Malek is working to identify biomarkers that could make EDS diagnosis easier. Sabeeha Malek\n\nProgress is being made but on a very small scale. “If you look at any major academic institution, there are multiple labs studying cancer, multiple labs studying heart disease. When you look at a disease that affects one in 500 people, and probably more than that, there should be a lab studying it at every single academic institution,” says Gensemer.\n\nGensemer hopes that as more discoveries are made and data is accumulated it will “change the way the medical community looks at the disease” – and that it will be taken more seriously.\n\nA giant kitten for my zebra\n\nA year has passed since Poppy’s diagnosis. The initial shock has subsided, and while I’m still grieving the loss of her health, we’ve both learned to accept our new reality and have adjusted to living with EDS.\n\nI’ve assembled a team of supportive doctors and therapists and acquired an arsenal of paraphernalia to fight pain and manage symptoms, including braces and kinesiology tape to hold her joints in place; ice packs, heat pads, tiger balm and arnica gel for sore muscles; and a cupboard full of medications and supplements.\n\nWith Poppy often stuck at home, I also got her a giant kitten that she calls Bagel, and he provides the best therapy.\n\nPoppy with Bagel. Tom Booth/CNN\n\nWriting this article has taught me a lot more about EDS: It’s been upsetting to report on the terrible experiences some have suffered, but I’ve been awestruck by the dedication of people, many with the condition themselves, who are working to find solutions.\n\nI don’t know what the future holds for Poppy. Some patients’ symptoms improve with age; others experience an increase in pain and a loss of mobility. I’ve learned there’s a limit to what we can control but there’s a lot we can do, to tackle symptoms and make life easier. And I believe that change is coming.\n\nWith a better understanding of the condition and diagnostic tools on the horizon, my biggest hope is that there will be a cure one day – and that it will come in time for Poppy.", "authors": ["Sarah Lazarus"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/health/copycat-edibles-wellness/index.html", "title": "Copycat packaging of marijuana edibles poses risk to children ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAt first glance, it looks like a single serving bag of Nerds Rope that your child might eat as a treat. But take a closer look. See the word “medicated” and the small white box at the bottom that says 600 milligrams of THC?\n\nThose three letters stand for tetrahydrocannabinol, the part of the marijuana plant that makes people high.\n\nEating even a small fraction of that bag would “overwhelm a child,” said Danielle Ompad, associate professor of epidemiology at NYU School of Global Public Health and senior author of a new study investigating copycat packaging in cannabis sales. The study was published Tuesday in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence.\n\nAnother candy package Ompad examined was nearly identical to the popular candy Gushers. The label says the bag contains 500 milligrams of THC, while a look-alike bag of Doritos contained 600 milligrams. The resemblance to the brand-name products is uncanny, she said.\n\n“The Nerd Rope knockoffs I have personally seen looked just like the licensed product,” Ompad said. “The (knockoff) Doritos were shaped just like the real thing and had a crunch as well.”\n\nEating 500 to 600 milligrams of THC would be a huge dose, even for an adult. “If I ate that whole package, I would be miserable.

It’s not good for anybody,” he added.\n\n“Many cannabis edibles companies are overstepping on marketing in an egregious way, putting consumers at risk and infringing on the trademarks of well-known and trusted confectionery brands,” said Christopher Gindlesperger, the senior vice president of public affairs and communications for the National Confectioners Association, in an email.\n\nThe association has established a set of guidelines for states considering deregulation of cannabis.\n\n“We’re focused on making sure that the appropriate guidelines and policies are set for distinguishing cannabis-containing edibles from traditional confectionery,” Gindlesperger added.\n\nManufacturers of various major candy and chip brands such as Mars Wrigley, Hershey Company, Mondelez Canada and Ferrara Candy Company have undertaken legal actions against a few companies that are selling knockoffs.\n\n“We are deeply disturbed to see our trademarked brands being used illegally to sell THC-infused products, and even more so to hear of children ingesting these products and becoming ill,” said a Mars spokesperson in an email.\n\n“We encourage consumers to reach out to their local authorities with any tips on these illegal products,” the spokesperson said.\n\nA growing problem\n\nWhile anyone might mistake a copycat candy or chip with the real thing, young children are especially vulnerable, Ompad said, as they may be easily drawn to the brightly colored bags often decorated with familiar cartoon characters.\n\nIf a child ingests edibles they can become “very sick. They may have problems walking or sitting up or may have a hard time breathing,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA study published in the journal Pediatrics examined calls to regional poison control centers from 2017 to 2019 and found there were 4,172 cannabis exposure cases in the US among children up to 9 years old. Nearly half (46%) of those calls involved cannabis edibles.\n\nMore than 70% of calls to US poison control centers related to marijuana edibles in 2020 “involved children under the age of 5,” according to New York Attorney General Letitia James, who issued a consumer alert in October 2021.\n\n“In the first half of 2021 alone, the American Association of Poison Control Centers has reported that poison control hotlines have received an estimated 2,622 calls for services related to young children ingesting illegal cannabis products,” the alert said.\n\nNews reports from around the US put those numbers into stark relief.\n\nA 3-year-old was admitted to a New Jersey ICU in December 2020 after eating “cannabis candy which looked identical to a Nerds Rope,” according to Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. A month later, a preteen was hospitalized in New Jersey after eating a large amount of marijuana-laced candy packaged “almost identically” to Sour Skittles.\n\nTwo children under 5 were hospitalized in Oklahoma in March 2021 after eating edibles from bags that looked just like Ruffles, Doritos and Fritos, according to Mark Woodward, public information officer for the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics. And the same month a Florida sheriff’s office posted a warning on Facebook with an image of dozens of knockoff edibles.\n\nNew Jersey has approved the legalization of recreational marijuana, which will soon go into effect, but Oklahoma and Florida have not.\n\nIf a younger child is exposed at home, it could mean adults were careless about leaving edibles lying around, Wykowski said.\n\n“I could sell you a responsibly packaged product that doesn’t look anything like candy,” he said. “But if you leave it out and it looks like a brownie, and your kid walks by and thinks, ‘Oh, I’m a little hungry. Dad left the brownies out,’ and then eats it, whose fault is that?”\n\nIt’s also possible teenagers could be obtaining edibles by faking identification or asking older friends to purchase them, just as they do with alcohol, Ompad said.\n\nUntil the Wild West of cannabis marketing is tamed through regulation, the responsibility falls on parents to protect their children, experts say. Keep all marijuana products out of the reach of children in childproof containers, the CDC recommends. Better yet, lock them up, Ompad said.\n\n“I am not a person who thinks that cannabis should be illegal or that edibles should not be available,” she said. “We just need to do a better job of keeping them away from children and making it clear that they’re edibles and what the adult dose is to get the effect that you want.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/06/27/coronavirus-updates-cases-rise-florida-texas-california/3267589001/", "title": "Coronavirus cases: US reports record daily infections; Texas bars", "text": "Coronavirus cases shot up in states across the country this week as a few states pump the brakes on reopening plans.\n\nTexas Gov.

A spokesperson for President Donald Trump's campaign confirmed to USA TODAY the events, which included stops as part of Pence's \"Faith in America\" tour, were canceled \"out of an abundance of caution\" as cases climb in Florida and Arizona.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pence was scheduled to give remarks at a \"Faith in America\" event in Tucson and to meet with Gov. Doug Ducey about the COVID-19 response. Pence had planned to travel to Florida on July 2 for a bus tour, meeting with Gov. Ron DeSantis about coronavirus, and to deliver remarks both at a \"Fatih in America\" event in Sarasota after touring Oakley Transport Inc. in Lake Wales.\n\nThe Trump campaign faced criticism for holding a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week. Local health officials called for it to be canceled over concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, and several campaign staffers and Secret Service employees have tested positive for the coronavirus since the rally, along with a journalist.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nCuomo pulls sick leave for New York workers who voluntarily travel to high-risk states\n\nDon't go to a state with a high COVID-19 rate, come back to New York and expect to get paid sick leave benefits. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order Saturday that strips the paid sick leave protections for New York employees who voluntarily travel to high-risk states after June 25.\n\n\"If we are going to maintain the progress we've seen, we need everyone to take personal responsibility,\" Cuomo said in a statement.\n\nThe order is the latest crackdown by Cuomo to avoid a surge in coronavirus in New York as its infection rates have been at record lows, but have hit record highs in parts of the South and West.\n\n– Joseph Specter, New York state team\n\nOregon man arrested after he refused to wear face mask in courtroom\n\nAn Oregon man was briefly jailed for contempt after he refused to wear a mask and walked out of the courtroom where he was scheduled to appear for a harassment charge and a traffic violation.\n\nA court clerk advised John Kulbeth to put on a face mask Wednesday, he declined and stood in the back of the courtroom in Sweet Home, Oregon, with his 6-year-old daughter, Baylee, far from everyone else.\n\nWhen Judge Larry Blake entered and saw him in the back of the room, “he proceeded to chew me out, tell me if I was not going to wear a mask he was going to hold me in contempt of court,” Kulbeth told the USA TODAY Network.\n\nKulbeth, who says he has breathing problems which led to him being medically discharged from the Army a decade ago, told the judge he would leave, took his daughter’s hand and walked to the parking lot.

Against that backdrop, the European Union is not expected to allow travelers from the U.S., Brazil and Russia.\n\nBrazil trails the U.S. with the world's second-most confirmed cases and deaths. More than 1.2 million people have tested positive.\n\nIn Russia, with the world's third-most confirmed cases, the country is reporting a steady decline in daily new cases.\n\nIn India, confirmed cases crossed the half-million mark Saturday, jumping by a one-day record of 18,552 infections.\n\nIn Europe, 11 countries have reported a \"very significant resurgence\" in cases recently, Dr. Hans Henri Kluge, regional director for the World Health Organization, warned Friday. Kluge told reporters that health systems could be \"pushed to the brink\" if these increased transmissions of the virus go unchecked.\n\n– Doug Stanglin and the Associated Press\n\nMiami closes beaches for Fourth of July\n\nBeaches in Miami-Dade County will be closed July 3 through July 7, County Mayor Carlos Gimenez announced Friday, amid a surge of coronavirus cases in Florida.\n\nGimenez said his emergency order also bans any gatherings — including parades — of more than 50 people throughout the county \"for whatever reason.\" In those situations, masks and social distancing are required and five groups of no more than 10 people will be allowed, Gimenez said.\n\n\"The closure may be extended if conditions do not improve and people do not follow New Normal rules requiring masks to be worn always inside commercial establishments and outdoors when social distancing of at least 6 feet is not possible,\" Gimenez said. \"I have been seeing too many businesses and people ignoring these lifesaving rules.\"\n\nFlorida reported a record 8,942 new cases on Friday — a 62% increase over the previous daily record of 5,508 reported Wednesday.\n\nJudge: US must free migrant children from detention amid pandemic\n\nA federal judge on Friday ordered the release of children held with their parents in U.S. immigration jails and denounced the Trump administration’s prolonged detention of families during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nU.S. District Judge Dolly Gee’s order applies to children held for more than 20 days at three family detention centers in Texas and Pennsylvania operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some have been detained since last year.\n\nCiting the recent spread of the virus in two of the three facilities, Gee set a deadline of July 17 for children to either be released with their parents or sent to family sponsors. The family detention centers “are ‘on fire’ and there is no more time for half measures,” she wrote.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nUS citizens likely won't be allowed to travel to EU anytime soon\n\nEuropean Union envoys are close to finalizing a list of countries whose citizens will be allowed to enter Europe again, possibly late next week, EU diplomats confirmed Saturday. Americans are almost certain to be excluded in the short term due to the number of U.S. coronavirus cases.\n\nThe envoys were expected to have narrowed later Saturday the exact criteria for countries to make the list, which include the way the spread of the virus is being managed. Another key condition is whether the country has a ban on citizens from European nations.\n\nThe number of cases in the United States has surged over the past week, with an all-time high of 45,300 confirmed new daily infections just reached. President Donald Trump also suspended the entry of all people from Europe’s ID check-free travel zone in a decree in March.\n\nThe EU diplomats confirmed that an official agreement on the criteria — likely to include a limit on the infection rate per 100,000 citizens — is expected late Monday or early Tuesday. The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because the procedure is ongoing and politically very sensitive.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nMore underlying medical conditions that increase risk of severe coronavirus\n\nThe CDC on Thursday updated and expanded the list of who is at increased risk for getting severely ill from COVID-19. The CDC now warns that among adults, risk increases steadily as you age, and it’s not just those over the age of 65 who are at increased risk for severe illness, the CDC said.\n\nThe agency updated the list of underlying medical conditions that increase risk of severe illness, increasing the number of people who fall into higher risk groups. The more underlying medical conditions people have, the higher their risk, the CDC said. The conditions include:\n\nChronic kidney disease\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n\nObesity\n\nWeakened immune system from solid organ transplant\n\nSerious heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies\n\nSickle cell disease\n\nType 2 diabetes\n\nFlorida babies are getting COVID-19 at high rates this month\n\nInfants and young children are rapidly catching the coronavirus and increasingly ending up in the hospital this month, according to an analysis of data from the Florida Department of Health.\n\nSince June 1, more than 1,100 children ages 4 and younger have been diagnosed with the coronavirus — accounting for 70% of the total cases in the age group.\n\nWhile more testing has been opened up to younger people this month, emergency department visits and hospitalizations have dramatically increased in June. More than half the total reported emergency department visits for the state’s youngest have come this month. And 40% of the hospitalizations of children up to 4 have come since June 1.\n\nFlorida hospitals are reporting about 34% capacity of their 620 pediatric intensive care unit beds, according to Florida Agency for Health Care Administration data Friday afternoon.

But it's out there and you can't see it, you can't smell it. There's no way [for consumers] to know whether [mercury] is in the creams or not because it's not on the labels.\"\n\nThe woman, whose name has been concealed in the report to protect her identity, was referred to Batdorff's team after she reported an array of symptoms to multiple doctors, ranging from insomnia and leg pain to muscle weakness, fatigue and, eventually, the loss of her peripheral vision. Clinical tests revealed elevated levels of mercury in her blood and urine.\n\nBatdorff explained that the most common symptoms she sees from potential mercury poisoning is tingling or numbness in a patient's hands or feet. She described the woman's loss of vision as \"a more extreme and permanent symptom.\"\n\n\"She will not recover her vision,\" Batdorff told CNN. \"So being a young woman that now has vision loss is really frightening and pretty concerning.\"\n\nThe toxicologist added that there are likely to be many more people out there who are being exposed to toxic levels of mercury and are not showing symptoms, or at least not yet.\n\nFollowing the referral, Batdorff and the MPCA visited the woman's house twice, about a year apart.\n\nOn the first visit she showed the team skin whitening beauty creams from abroad but said she was no longer using them. The agency found the amount of mercury in two of those products to be several thousand times higher than the permitted levels of 1 part per million (ppm) in cosmetics and urine tests revealed high levels of mercury in her body (23mcg/liter) -- but mercury was not noted as an ingredient on the products, according to the team.\n\nAt that time, the agency did not consider the levels of mercury in her home to be a concern, but over the course of a year, the mother had increasingly elevated levels of mercury in her body, the case report states.\n\nA second home visit in 2022 found that two new beauty products the woman had bought at a local market, one of which was not labelled as skin whitening but is known to be used for this, also contained high levels of mercury. The products found in her home were empty from use, but the MPCA team tested new unopened versions of the same product, finding extremely high levels of mercury of 11,000 and 18,000ppm.\n\n\"There are limited outlets for availability, and we have no reason or evidence to believe there would be any difference in the products,\" said John Gilkeson, Toxics Reduction Specialist at the MPCA, who tested the woman's home and has conducted three visits to the homes of people using skin whitening creams in recent years.\n\nNew urine tests confirmed that the mercury level in her body had risen to 46.6 micrograms/liter -- more than nine times the level considered normal (5 micrograms/liter)| -- and certain areas in her home now also contained elevated levels of mercury, putting her family at risk.\n\nBackground mercury levels below 200 nanograms per cubic meter (ng/m3) are not considered a concern, Gilkeson explained. But the children's bedrooms recorded levels of up to 400 ng/m3 and their towels read up to 600 mg/m3, according to the case report.\n\nLevels of up to 300 mg/m3 were found in the washing machine, where mercury likely accumulated as clothes worn by the mother were laundered, in turn contaminating other clothing and materials that go into the machine\n\nUrine tests on one of her children found that they now had elevated levels of mercury in their body, albeit much lower than their mother at 6.88 micrograms/liter.\n\nJUST WATCHED How mercury found in some beauty products can affect your health and expose your household.

MUST WATCH How mercury found in some beauty products can affect your health and expose your household. 03:21\n\nOne of many families at risk\n\nThe woman's story is one of many in the state of Minnesota and other parts of the US in recent years where women and entire households are believed to have been exposed to inorganic mercury from the prolonged use of skin whitening products that fail to disclose they contain harmful levels of the toxic chemical.\n\nThe woman was \"incredibly frustrated,\" said Batdorff. \"She had bought things that didn't say lightening, thinking that they would be safe,\" said Batdorff.\n\nBeauty products containing mercury remain easily accessible in local malls and markets throughout the US and through online retailers , say experts, helped by the fact they fail to list mercury as an ingredient. Batdorff and other experts are calling for greater awareness, regular testing of products and stricter enforcement of regulations to help combat the problem.\n\nIn 2020, a health advisory was issued in Minnesota after a woman developed kidney damage, a rash and other symptoms including insomnia and depression following the use of skin whitening creams that again failed to disclose they contained mercury.\n\nA widespread issue\n\nScreening studies by the biomonitoring team within the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) in 2015 and 2019 also found elevated levels of mercury in the urine of multiple people who used skin whitening products, including pregnant women. Previously unpublished results from these studies shared exclusively with CNN show that follow-up home visits for some of these women revealed high levels of mercury vapor in the air -- particularly in their washing machines -- with readings as high as 1,800 and 2,000 ng/m3.\n\nLori Copan, Chief of the Exposure Prevention and Education Section at the California Department of Health reviewed the findings for the Minnesota mother and told CNN: \"[The case of this woman] unfortunately is similar to others we have seen in California, with a person experiencing symptoms for years without adequate recognition of potential mercury toxicity from a skin lightening product by health-care providers.\" She added that her team has seen around one hundred cases of toxicity from people using these creams, or their family members.\n\n\"Anyone using a skin lightening product that contains mercury, unfortunately, is going to put the whole household at risk,\" said Batdorff. \"There's no way to make sure that no contamination of the mercury will go to other household members. That's just not how mercury works.\"\n\n'The number one possible source of mercury exposure'\n\nMercury has long been used in skin whitening products due to its ability to block the production of melanin, the pigment that gives color to skin. US Federal Drug Agency regulations and the Minamata Convention on Mercury -- an international treaty to protect human health and the environment from mercury -- limit the use of mercury in cosmetics, excluding those used around the eye area, to 1mg/kg of mercury, also known as 1 part per million (ppm).\n\nThe products found in the woman's home ranged from 4590ppm to 18,000ppm.\n\nAt high levels, the inorganic mercury typically found in these products is extremely toxic. Chronic exposure can lead to kidney and liver damage, as well as neurological damage including personality changes, anxiety, depression, early childhood development issues and, as seemingly shown in this case, vision loss.\n\n\"With inorganic mercury it's that chronic long-term exposure that concerns me the most,\" said Batdorff. \"It's more subtle but ends up building up in our system and is hard to eliminate, especially when it gets into the brain ... and once mercury has crossed over into the brain and our nervous system, it can cause a lot of different side effects.\"\n\nFor Batdorff and other experts, finding people early and removing the sources of mercury before they cause permanent damage is crucial.\n\n\"When we're thinking about exposures in pregnant women, women of childbearing age and babies and children, you know, we don't want people in those groups to be having higher mercury exposure,\" said Jessica Nelson, Program Director for the Minnesota Biomonitoring program within MDH, who led the 2015 and 2019 studies.\n\n\"We need to be sure women know that products can have mercury in them. And we need to focus on women who speak languages other than English and different ways of sharing the information, ideally through community partners.\"\n\nSkin whitening: Toxic ingredients Steroids\n\nHydroquinone\n\nMercury Three ingredients dominate the harmful skin whitening products used worldwide. Steroids\n\nHydroquinone\n\nMercury Topical steroids are used to treat a range of skin conditions, including psoriasis and eczema, due to the drugs' anti-inflammatory effects. Skin whitening is a potential side effect, which has led to topical steroid misuse. The long-term use of steroids, or use without monitoring by a doctor, can lead to various side effects, such as rashes, pustules, hair growth on the skin, and infections. The over-the-counter sale of potent corticosteroids is banned in many countries and territories worldwide, including the US, the UK, India and Hong Kong. Hydroquinone is used to treat pigment disorders by reducing levels of melanin in the skin.

Mercury salts block the production of melanin, leading to a lighter skin tone. Mercury is found in both inorganic and organic forms in cosmetics. The Minamata Convention on Mercury established a limit of 1 mg/kg (1 ppm) for cosmetics, including skin whitening products. Products tested in a variety of countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and North America have contained up to 40,000 parts per million (ppm) of mercury.

The aim was to inform people, including shop owners and customers, about the risks of mercury found in many skin whitening and other beauty products as well as to test the wide range of items sold across the malls to help identify the products posing the most risk, and their countries of origin.\n\nThe team spoke with more than 200 vendors and customers and disposed of around 900 products containing high levels of mercury -- many of which were manufactured in Pakistan -- over the three months that the program ran, said Fatou Barry, program assistant on the project, who visited the mall almost daily during this time.\n\nBarry said most vendors had no awareness of the products containing harmful ingredients like mercury and were \"shocked\" when they realized the risk to their community. Many others, however, closed their stores when they learned city officials were visiting, Barry said.\n\nIn a reflection paper describing the strategy and impact of her team's efforts, Barry wrote that the biggest taken away from the whole experience was how important it was to keep showing up and engaging with the community. \"Passively sending or posting flyers wasn't nearly as effective as coming in and going [from] vendor to vendor,\" she wrote.\n\nSkin whitening: The culture US Skin color preferences go back to slavery, when lighter-skinned people who were enslaved were likely to be related to their master and favored to work indoors, while darker-skinned people were sent to the fields.

The community outreach and engagement,\" she outlined. \"They all need different voices at the table about how to do that best and most effectively.\"\n\nIn addition to these approaches, Adawe stressed the need for better enforcement of regulations. \"The products are widely available in ethnic malls like Karmel and the state has not actively regulated these products,\" she said. \"I visited [a few months ago] to check if the products we tested that contained mercury are still available...and saw all the mercury containing skin-lightening products displayed on the shelves.\"\n\nThe MPCA is responsible for enforcing regulations on these products in the state, and issuing penalties. In response to Adawe's concerns, a spokesperson for the agency told CNN that the MPCA \"prioritizes education and outreach efforts to help vendors identify and remove products from shelves and will take enforcement actions when appropriate.\"\n\nThey added that \"skin-lightening creams present a unique challenge because their labeling doesn't often list mercury as an ingredient and each product must be tested to determine if mercury is present above the regulatory limit.\"\n\nTo further increase knowledge among affected communities, MDH has an awareness and education grant of up to $200,000 to fund various community organizations, NGOs and city health departments working in this space, including Adawe's.\n\n\"Through Beautywell we do training for health care providers and public health workers to understand about colorism, skin-lightening practice and ways they can identify the health impact of this practice,\" explained Adawe. \"The use of skin-lightening products in the Somali community is high and so we need to continue do health education in this community and teach women to embrace their skin color.\"\n\n----\n\nWant to know more about which products contain mercury?\n\nIf you would like to find out more about skin whitening and beauty products that may contain mercury, these reports and public health lists identify a wide range available worldwide.\n\nThe Zero Mercury Working Group has also created an online database of products known to contain mercury.\n\n----\n\nCredits:\n\nEditors: Eliza Anyangwe, Lucy Benson\n\nDesign: Tiffany Baker, Tal Yellin, Will Mullery\n\nVideo: Elisa Solinas, Agne Jurkenaite, Ladan Anoushfar", "authors": ["Meera Senthilingam"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/02/27/falling-sperm-counts-threaten-humanity-chemicals-blame-book-says/6842950002/", "title": "Falling sperm counts threaten humanity; chemicals to blame, book ...", "text": "Humanity is facing not only a coronavirus pandemic and a climate crisis, but its existence is also threatened by falling sperm counts because of chemical exposures, a prominent epidemiologist warns in a new book.\n\n\"Chemicals in our environment and other lifestyle factors in our modern age have harmed our reproductive health to the extent that, in the future, it may not be possible for most people to reproduce in the old-fashioned way,\" said Shanna Swan, an environmental and reproductive epidemiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York with more than four decades of experience in the field.\n\nSperm counts among men in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand declined more than 59% from 1973 to 2011, according to a meta-analysis Swan co-wrote in 2017. At the current rate, half of men in those countries would have no sperm by 2045, while many others would have very low counts, Swan told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Some of what we’ve been thinking of as fiction, from stories such as 'The Handmaid’s Tale' and 'Children of Men,' is rapidly becoming reality,\" Swan writes in her new book with science writer Stacey Colino out this week, \"Count Down: How Our Modern World Is Threatening Sperm Counts, Altering Male and Female Reproductive Development, and Imperiling the Future of the Human Race.\"\n\nIn the book, Swan argues that chemicals pervasive in our world are interfering with the hormones in our bodies and contributing to harmful reproductive health outcomes in men and women. These \"endocrine-disrupting chemicals\" include chemicals that are water-soluble and wash out of our bodies, such as phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), as well as \"forever chemicals\" that do not degrade, such as perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).\n\nForever chemicals:Toxic 'forever chemicals' found in drinking water throughout US\n\nLatest COVID-19 updates:US administers about 2.4 million shots in a day, a new high; Johnson & Johnson vaccine expected to be authorized\n\nThe chemicals enter our bodies through foods and drink, microscopic airborne particles we inhale, and in the products we absorb through our skin, Swan said. They're found in plastic and vinyl, floor and wall coverings, medical tubing and medical devices, children's toys, nail polishes, perfumes, hair sprays, soaps, shampoos and more.\n\nPhthalates, for example, are commonly consumed through foods, she said.\n\n\"They’re added to plastic to make them soft and squishy – think shower curtains, rubber duckies, soft tubing. The processed food we eat passes through soft tubing to get into its packaging. When these chemicals in the plastic come in contact with food, the phthalates leave the plastic and leach into the food. When we eat the food, they get into our bodies,\" she said.\n\nEndocrine-disrupting chemicals can interfere with hormones in several different ways. Phthalates may \"trick the body\" into thinking it has more testosterone than it actually does, causing the body to stop producing testosterone and increasing the chances the man will be infertile or have a lower sperm count, Swan said.\n\nDr. Pat Hunt, a geneticist at the Washington State University School of Molecular Biosciences, has been studying the effect of chemical exposures on male and female fertility since a laboratory accident in 1998 alerted her to the harmful effects of household products.\n\n\"Over the years, I've watched the opinions of my scientific colleagues change as the evidence has become increasingly convincing,\" Hunt said. \"There’s no question that sperm counts have fallen. The hypothesis that sperm counts have fallen due to exposure to these chemicals has also gained more and more credence.\"\n\nSome trade groups, however, question the connection between endocrine-disrupting chemicals and adverse health outcomes, and some scientists have criticized studies for a lack of evidence demonstrating a direct causation between the two.\n\nVinyl Verified, an organization working to promote public perception of vinyl, writes on its website that \"a select number of competitive interests and agenda-driven activists have advanced a dishonest campaign to mislead consumers, and deny them their right to make their own decisions about vinyl.\"\n\nAnd some scientists question whether sperm counts are falling at all. Allan Pacey, a professor of andrology at Britain’s University of Sheffield, said that while he believes prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals can affect male fetal development, he remains \"unconvinced by the data which suggests that sperm counts have fallen worldwide because of this.\"\n\n\"I think science and medicine has accepted this hypothesis uncritically,\" Pacey said. \"Extraordinary claims generally require extraordinary evidence – however, apparently not in this case.\"\n\nPacey takes issue with the way scientists have reached their conclusions – by conducting retrospective analyses of semen analysis data performed in the past. Pacey said this method of analysis is \"weak\" because the methods of laboratory andrology, such as training, have changed over time.\n\nThe 2017 study Swan co-wrote was \"an improvement\" because it used more control measures, but the study still not did present \"extraordinary evidence,\" Pacey said. \"I cannot prove this, but neither can they.\"\n\nLinda Birnbaum, former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences as well as the National Toxicology Program, said the 2017 study was \"impressive\" and noted Swan's work also draws on studies in animals, boys and young men.\n\n\"There are repeated studies by different investigators in different locations that support that sperm counts are falling,\" Birnbaum said. \"It’s complex what might be causing it. I don’t think there’s any one thing. But I do think endocrine-disrupting chemicals one part of the puzzle.\"\n\n'People are not choosing to lower their sperm count'\n\nWorldwide fertility dropped by 50% from 1960 to 2015, Swan writes. She acknowledges a host of socioeconomic factors are contributing to the decline, such as people choosing to have children later in life and having smaller families.\n\nBut what's surprising is that fertility is dropping across age groups, Swan writes. Not only are sperm counts in men gradually declining, but boys are also seeing higher rates of genital abnormalities. Among women, the risk of miscarriage has been rising across all ages.\n\n\"Part of this picture has an element of choice in it, and part of it doesn’t,\" Swan said. \"People are not choosing to lower their sperm count.\"\n\nLifestyle factors – including diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol or drug use – can alter hormone levels and are playing a role in the decline, Swan said. But Swan said she's most concerned about chemical exposures, particularly for pregnant women and children.\n\n\"The other lifestyle factors matter in a transient way,\" Swan said. \"The reason I’m so focused on these early exposures to endocrine disruptors is because that’s never going to change, and it’s going to be passed on to later generations. They’re much more important to the story, although they’re much less easy to control.\"\n\nEndocrine-disrupting chemicals don't just affect reproductive health. They have also been linked to \"numerous adverse health effects in almost all biological systems,\" including the immunological, neurological, metabolic and cardiovascular systems, Swan writes.\n\n\"We can see tiny changes during development that, in an adult, can increase the rate of cancers,\" Hunt said. \"We’re setting up our children to have metabolic problems as adults, and I find that incredibly sobering and worrying.\"\n\nAnd we're not just hurting ourselves. We're harming animals, too.\n\n\"These ubiquitous environmental chemicals have taken a toll on the animal kingdom in many different ways,\" Swan writes. \"As a species, we’re failing to propagate and repopulate ourselves, and we’re hindering the ability of other species to do so.\"\n\nRemove, replace and regulate\n\nIn her book, Swan lays out an action plan to help people change their daily habits and reduce exposures. Instead of the traditional \"three Rs\" typically touted to promote reducing exposure to plastics and other environmental chemicals, Swan suggested promoting three new ones: \"Remove, replace and regulate\" endocrine-disrupting chemicals.\n\n\"The chemicals themselves have to be remodeled – substituted for chemicals that cannot interfere with human hormone systems. That’s absolutely critical,\" Swan said. \"They have to not be harmful at very low doses. And they have to not be persistent in the environment.\"\n\nHunt said her research on the effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals has caused her to think about life \"completely differently.\"\n\n\"You can’t possibly eliminate plastics from your life, but you can buy different products,\" Hunt said. \"The plastics in my kitchen are silicone, and I use a lot of glass. There’s a rule in my house that plastics of any sort don’t go into the dishwasher and never go into the microwave. And I read labels obsessively.\"\n\nSwan also calls for much larger, societal changes, including greater government regulation of chemicals.\n\n\"We need to rethink our whole approach to chemical safety,\" Hunt said. \"We place the onus right now on federal regulatory agencies to demonstrate that these chemicals are harmful. The onus should be on demonstrating that they’re safe before they go into use, not demonstrating that they’re dangerous after they go into use.\"\n\nSwan said that for decades the U.S. has gone through cycles of public outcry about particular chemicals, such as BPA, only to replace the chemical with ones that are also harmful.\n\n\"This is a practice we call regrettable substitution, or, informally, whack-a-mole. You knock down one bad chemical for another one that has a new name but does the same thing,\" she said.\n\nSwan said she is launching a campaign tied to the book to educate the general public, along with the medical community, about the dangers of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Swan said she hopes to reach communities of color in particular, because many are disproportionately affected by the chemicals.\n\n\"Communities of color are differentially overexposed, for example, by decreased availability of fresh, unprocessed foods and their proximity to poorer air and water quality,\" Swan said. \"These communities have higher exposure and experience a higher impact from these chemicals. There’s an equity issue here.\"\n\n'These things are not separate'\n\nSwan said the discussion around the reproductive health crisis in 2021 is comparable to where the discussion around climate change was 40 years ago. \"Initially there was denial, and gradually people began to accept that this was a problem,\" Swan said.\n\nIn 1992, when a paper in the British Medical Journal suggested sperm counts had gradually declined over the past five decades, the paper \"was not taken seriously. It was criticized and pretty much ignored,\" Swan said. But in 2017, when Swan co-wrote the meta-analysis reaching the same conclusion, the paper became one of the most-referenced scientific papers worldwide that year.\n\n\"Where they had denied the problem in 1992, they were saying yes, it’s a problem,\" she said. \"Now, we need to move on to the next phase where we take responsibility as a society, as a planet.\"\n\nSwan said discussions of reproductive health should be included in discussions surrounding climate change and COVID-19. Many endocrine-disrupting chemicals, for example, are made from petroleum-producing byproducts. Moreover, recent papers have also shown that chemical exposures increase the risk of severe disease from COVID-19.\n\n\"These things are not separate, and I think they should be considered together,\" Swan said. \"We have to recognize that we have a trifecta of risks coming down on us.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/03/01/fact-check-drinking-water-unsafe-babies-under-6-months-old/11375902002/", "title": "Fact check: Drinking water is unsafe for babies under 6 months old", "text": "The claim: Babies can’t have water before they’re 6 months old\n\nA Feb. 26 Facebook post (direct link, archive link) claims a necessary fluid for adults is hazardous for children under a certain age.\n\n“BABIES CANT HAVE WATER BEFORE 6 MONTHS,” reads the post. “Please educate yourself before you harm your baby.

They recommended the exclusive use of breast milk or formula for the first six months.\n\nWater intake besides breast milk, formula is too much for babies\n\nParents should avoid giving water to newborns, doctors said.\n\n“Supplemental water is a potential health hazard in newborns and is not recommended in the first 6 months of life, period,” said Dr. Steven Halm, a pediatrician and dean of Des Moines University’s College of Osteopathic Medicine.\n\nBreast milk is the optimal source of nutrition for the first six months, Halm said. Other options include a combination of breast milk and formula, or formula alone – but never water alone.\n\nThat's because a baby’s kidneys are developing in the first six months and cannot handle much water, said Dr. Hailey Nelson, a pediatrician at Valley Children’s Healthcare in California. Breast milk and formula already have water in them, which makes additional intake both unnecessary and unsafe.\n\n“If you give it to them, you can actually throw off their electrolytes – it’s hazardous,” Nelson said.\n\nIn circumstances such as a baby formula shortage, as seen in the U.S. in 2022, Nelson said some parents may decide to dilute their baby formula with more water than necessary to make it last longer. But doing so is a mistake that may harm the baby.\n\nWater intoxication in babies can lead to seizures, brain swelling and even death, according to the St. Louis Children's Hospital.\n\nFact check: Brief shoe wearing not a danger to babies, but it isn't needed, experts say\n\nDr. Arun Chopra, chief of pediatric service at Hassenfeld Children's Hospital at NYU Langone Health, warned that parents should resist the urge to give their baby water even it's hot outside or the child is sick.\n\nThe amount of water that would cause complications for a newborn vary by factors including the child's age and how well their kidneys can function.\n\n\"Six months isn't a magical day, but that's the age at which most babies are going to tolerate it,\" he said.\n\nThe same guidance has been published by the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics, which recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a child’s life.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the user who shared the claim for comment.\n\nVERIFY also reported the claim is true when it circulated in 2022.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

We value diverse perspectives, are open to new ideas and respect intellectual freedom. So it should come as no surprise that the thought of banning a book would make us riled.\n\nWhat happens when a book is challenged in school boards and public libraries? Titles can be removed from school curriculums or library shelves. Most public schools and libraries have boards made up of elected officials or members appointed by elected officials. It is by the power of these officials that a book can go from challenged to banned in a school district or public library. Even if it happens only once, it is one time too many.\n\nSure, there is the argument that we can bypass places such as public libraries and purchase a book. But that is true only for those with the financial resources to do that. For many, particularly children and young adults, school and public libraries are the only means to access literature.\n\nWith that in mind, USA TODAY staff looked at challenged and banned books and chose those that are meaningful to them. In the books' defense, we've written why they deserve a place in our schools, libraries and society.\n\nBanned books explained:Book bans are on the rise.

Johnson\n\nWe’re failing young queer readers, specifically Black and young people of color, if a book like activist George M. Johnson’s “All Boys Aren’t Blue” stays on banned-book lists. Published in 2020, this memoir-manifesto follows the author’s journey of growing up a queer Black person and is an indispensable piece of literature for high school readers. Johnson explores their childhood, adolescence and college years while revisiting traumatic and transformative experiences and weaves in important statistics about the LGBTQ community. Johnson candidly – and some might think, explicitly – explores their sexuality and unpacks their experiences with sexual assault in a way that’s necessary for readers to heal. The American Library Association listed the book No. 3 on its list of the 10 most-challenged books of 2021. Both a primer for teens looking to be allies to the LGBTQ community and a YA book meant to make young queer readers feel seen, Johnson’s “All Boys Aren’t Blue” is a force to be reckoned with. – Pamela Avila\n\n'Gender Queer' by Maia Kobabe\n\nWhy do we tell teens to shave their legs if we resent having been told to ourselves? This question, among so many others, has been haunting me since I read “Gender Queer,” Maia Kobabe’s autobiographical graphic novel that explores the author's experience coming out as nonbinary and asexual. Through the novel, Kobabe vividly unravels small personal moments common to so many young people, exploring the discomfort inherent in everyday experiences like routine Pap smears. Kobabe raises a lot of excellent questions about the social mores of gender and the avidity with which society feels compelled to assign gender even though it is unique to individuals. Reading “Gender Queer” for the first time was like experiencing a jolt of adrenaline. It’s a book about Kobabe’s journey, but it allowed me to reframe mine, offering me the space to excavate my past and challenge my own self-concept. “Gender Queer” encourages growth and self-acceptance, and its removal from libraries is a huge disservice to teens. – Madison Durham\n\n'The Hate U Give' by Angie Thomas\n\nOne of the most challenged books in the country is this award-winning, bestselling middle-grade novel. Since the book’s release in 2017, it has been no stranger to controversy. The book’s critics say there’s too much sex and profanity. Some said it breeds contempt for police. The crux of the story, however, is systemic racism. Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter loses her best friend, Khalil, after he is shot and killed by a police officer. It’s a familiar story: Khalil, a Black kid, was unarmed when the white officer shot him. Khalil’s death becomes national news. Protests ensue. And a narrative forms, painting Khalil as a troublemaker and drug lord. Starr is caught between two worlds: her poor neighborhood and the rich prep school she attends. It’s the same story many Black children have lived. After Khalil’s death, Starr finds her voice of activism and pride in her Black identity. The banning of Thomas’ book is another reminder many people are uncomfortable with the message of the Black Lives Matter movement. – Tracee Herbaugh\n\n‘Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda’ by Becky Albertalli\n\nSixteen-year-old Simon Spier has a crush on an anonymous gay classmate who goes by the name Blue online, and with whom he has been exchanging increasingly flirtatious emails. One problem: Neither knows the other’s real identity. Another problem: Simon is still closeted. But when a nosey classmate finds Simon’s emails and threatens to out him, cautious Simon needs to step outside his comfort zone before he’s pushed out. What’s so welcome about Albertalli’s tale of high school high jinks, secret crushes and fraught friend-group dynamics is how ordinary and familiar it is. This sweet and funny high school story is light on trauma and big on laughs, and a balm to queer readers who want to see themselves reflected in happy coming-out stories. (It also has a rather good film adaptation, “Love, Simon,” starring Nick Robinson and Jennifer Garner.) – Barbara VanDenburgh\n\n'Kafka on the Shore' by Haruki Murakami\n\nThis is one of the most hauntingly, mind-bendingly beautiful books I've ever read. The surreal novel weaves two parallel plots that meld music and metaphysics, time and fate, and loss and alienation as it follows the young Kafka Tamura, who is fleeing an Oedipal curse, and Satoru Nakata, an old man with a knack for talking to cats. \"Kafka on the Shore\" is an imaginative literary puzzle sure to challenge students and their conceptions of what a novel could, or should, be. Chock-full of surreal happenings, nothing is clearly defined in this book. Murakami leaves the story open-ended for readers, giving them space to decide what to draw from it – a level of freedom they may not often be afforded when dissecting more “classic” novels typically included in curriculums. In a setting where students are often instructed to find \"the right answer,\" \"Kafka on the Shore\" is a breath of fresh air that can stretch their imaginations. – Christine Fernando\n\n'Twilight' by Stephenie Meyer\n\nWhen I was 13 years old, I snuck into my sister’s room and grabbed a copy of \"Twilight.\" It was just before the \"Breaking Dawn – Part 1\" movie release, and \"Twilight\" fever had hit my school. The story of Bella, Edward, vampires and forbidden love features all the hallmarks of coming-of-age literature and introduced me to themes I hadn’t seen in media yet. \"Twilight\" brought me together with my peers to talk about reading, giving me new worlds to explore and new friends to talk about them with. Banning \"Twilight\" severely limits the opportunity for students to take reading into their own hands and enjoy a coming-of-age story full of fantasy and imagination. – Chris Panella\n\n'I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter' by Erika L. Sanchez\n\nFor young women struggling with mental health struggles, the loss of a loved one, the loss of innocence and outdated expectations that often come with growing up in a Latino household, Sanchez’s 2017 YA novel “I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter” can be a lifeline. In August, Madison County Schools in Mississippi removed 10 books from general library circulation, including Sanchez’s. High school is a tough time, and young people in particular pick up a book to escape reality or to make sense of the changing world around them – reading makes them feel safe enough to express how they’re feeling. And making a book like Sanchez’s inaccessible hinders the representation young Latino readers need. – Avila\n\n'The Odyssey' by Homer\n\nOdysseus’ 10-year journey after the Trojan War back home to Ithaca to his wife, Penelope, and son, Telemachus, has a lot going on – a lot dark going on. Witches, slavery, tricks, betrayal, Cyclopses, grim and gory deaths, cannibal giants, varied monsters, murderous guests and mass slaughter all feature in the epic (in the original sense) tale from the eighth century BCE. It’s a wild ride with bad role models, and there couldn’t be a more classic example of the Books by Dead White Men vein of literature. That being said: “The Odyssey,” both the book itself and the themes it explores, are so deeply woven into the fabric of our modern culture that the name itself is a genre. Knowing \"The Odyssey\" is like getting a peek into the source code of innumerable (truly) works of literature spanning 28 centuries, giving any reader a deeper, more nuanced understanding of not just countless works of art but of culture itself. (And as it happens, it’s a fantastic, gripping story that’s a joy to read in its own right.) – Jennifer Ernst Beaudry\n\n'Speak' by Laurie Halse Anderson\n\nIt's funny that \"Speak\" is so challenged, considering I was in high school when I read it. Apparently, it \"exposes children to immorality\" – reasoning you don't know whether to laugh or cry at. Adults who think teenagers aren't already exposed to everything probably don't remember what it was like being a teenager. Sexual assault, unhappy families and the nuances of high school life are real-world issues that teens are already aware of. Kids need books that start difficult conversations, that demonstrate the importance of using your voice and having someone who listens, that show you can rise above adversity. \"Speak\" is beautiful in its spare prose and simplicity. Many can relate to, and laugh with, Melinda's dry humor and cynical voice. It's a necessary story that gives permission to students whose voices are silenced to take up space – and speak. – Nusrat Sultana\n\n'Nineteen Minutes' by Jodi Picoult\n\nI was in eighth grade when the Columbine shooting happened, back when the concept of a school shooting was new. Children and teens today live in a very different reality, with active shooter drills and school shootings as part of their everyday life and consciousness. Parents have challenged this book because of its depictions of a school shooting; the bullying and romantic partner violence that led up to it; and the trauma and suicides that came after. Children are bullied. Teenagers are in abusive relationships. They get pregnant and grapple with decisions about abortion. Adolescents struggle to define their sexuality. Young people contemplate suicide and kill themselves. Banning books about these topics doesn’t make them cease to exist. The story, so beautifully told, touches on all of these topics because these are the traumas teens battle, some of which have directly contributed to violence in schools. If we’re unwilling to let young people read about, think about, process and dissect the very traumas they experience all around them, how can ever hope to solve these problems? – Katie Wedell\n\n'Blubber' by Judy Blume\n\nI read “Blubber” in fifth grade, and it's the most pivotal book of my youth. The book’s main character is a young fifth grader, Jill, who joins the more popular kids in the class to ostracize Linda, a girl nicknamed Blubber because of her size. The main reason the book has been banned is because nothing happens to Jill and her fellow bullies. That is precisely why I needed this book. In the fifth grade, I was Linda. “Blubber” was inspired by an incident in the author’s daughter’s own fifth grade class, and what Blume saw was not the exception but often the rule. In real life, bullies often get away with their behavior. While the similarity between myself and Blubber stung, it also provided solace. I was not alone. This was not something that happened only to me. Others knew how I felt. And that meant everything. It is always satisfying to read stories with happy endings, but it is just as important to read ones that don’t. Because in life, there are bullies and unresolved endings, and that is something that every fifth grader should know. – Mary Cadden\n\n'Lord of the Flies' by William Golding\n\nGolding uses preteen boys to show readers how a group of people will mistreat those they simply don’t like and even beat a child to death out of fear arising from a conspiracy theory. The use of boys as main characters may make it easier for some to understand the forces that can erode a society, or may make readers feel alarmed about the “end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart.” Either way, this book can prompt young readers think deeply about governance and societal leadership in a way that will inform them throughout their lives. – Erin Mansfield\n\n'Of Mice and Men' by John Steinbeck\n\n\"Of Mice and Men\" revolves around the friendship between two migrant workers during the Great Depression. I remember reading the book for my high school English class and thinking about loneliness as well as companionship. The two protagonists are brought together by a shared dream of purchasing land that's eventually shattered by the predatory social environment for migrant workers at that time. With this book, school-age readers have the opportunity to examine the conflict between reality and the American dream, in addition to human friendships. – Rayna Song\n\n'A Light in the Attic' by Shel Silverstein\n\nSilverstein’s collections of poetic nonsense was a classic on our living room bookshelf. His fantastical black-and-white sketches begged a wild imagination and a healthy sense of humor. They posed impossible scenarios, built as much for wordplay as they were for plot. \"A Light in the Attic\" has been banned in some schools over claims it promotes disrespect and violence. To argue this is to argue that children are unable to understand hyperbole. I am a deep believer that adolescent minds should be taken seriously, that they always understand more than we think and that they grow best when we overestimate them. The greatest children’s authors know this. I want the next generation to learn just as I did from Silverstein the joy of twisting words in different ways, of laughing at themselves, and of finding poetry and humor in everyday life. – Anna Kaufman\n\n'Eleanor & Park' by Rainbow Rowell\n\nRowell’s novel captures what it means to be a misfit teenage girl in a world that wants to cast you aside. As a teenager, this book made me feel seen as it keys into the nuances of being an outcast while coming into your own. This book has been banned for coarse language and sexuality, but it covers difficult topics such as racism, domestic abuse and body image that are enlightening for teen and adult readers alike. With high school years being a turbulent time for many, \"Eleanor & Park\" provides a much-needed perspective on surviving your teenage years in the face of adversity. – Samantha Mangino\n\n'Two Boys Kissing' by David Levithan\n\nI revisited “Two Boys Kissing” almost 10 years after first reading it, and – in the best possible way – it was more of a gut-punch than I'd recalled. The narration by a Greek chorus of men who died of AIDS is an emotional reminder of the strong bonds of chosen family. This book feels especially timely as progress on LGBTQ rights faces renewed political backlash and as monkeypox spreads mainly through our community. Reading “Two Boys Kissing” today shows how much has changed in the past decade while highlighting what work there still is to be done – and what we may be in danger of losing if we become complacent about our progress. The young characters remind us what is at stake and who most needs to hear these stories and feel a community’s love today. – Zach Wichter\n\n'Something Happened in Our Town: A Child’s Story About Racial Injustice' by Marianne Celano, Marietta Collins, Ann Hazzard\n\nAs this book follows a Black family and a white family discussing the police shooting of a Black man, its first page reads, “the grown-ups didn’t think the kids knew about it.” Amid nationwide conversations about race, many parents assume children are in the dark or unable to have meaningful discussions about racism. But children hear the murmurings and have questions. Shutting those down means lost opportunities for learning. A growing body of research shows children begin to notice race years before adults want to talk about it with them. Delaying these conversations and ignoring the realities of racism could make children more susceptible to racist beliefs. After all, it’s the adult’s responsibility to help children make sense of their social world. “Something Happened” approaches these conversations with care and includes child-friendly discussion guides curated by child psychologists to help encourage vital parent-child conversations about race. – Fernando\n\n'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' by Stephen Chbosky\n\nEvery person I’ve spoken to who read “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” when they were in high school remembers it as a teenagehood-defining book. Chbosky writes beautifully and timelessly from the mind of high school freshman Charlie, an introvert who gets taken under the wing of a group of upperclassmen and learns the value of letting others into his life. Some of the content throughout can be intense or inappropriate for younger readers – topics include alcohol, drugs, sex, abortion, mental health struggles, suicide and sexual abuse. But these are all things high schoolers can and often do experience, and blocking them from a story that explores them in a thoughtful, empathetic way doesn’t do anyone any good. More, it holds teenage readers back from discovering a story that may guide them through a tumultuous period. Years later, I count myself one of the lucky many to have found this story when I did. – Hannah Yasharoff\n\n'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings' by Maya Angelou\n\nAngelou’s beautifully written autobiographical novel touches on two important and painful subjects that often get it banned from schools: rape and racism. While they may not be the most comfortable topics, they’re still as prevalent in 2022 as they were in 1969, when the book was published. It features some graphic depictions, but the sad truth is these topics are not new to many young adults, and reading about Angelou’s healing journey is instrumental in letting them know they’re not alone. Simply banning a book that depicts rape and racism doesn’t shield readers from facing them in their lives; it just removes another resource that may help them move forward. – Kate Ellsworth\n\n'The House on Mango Street' by Sandra Cisneros\n\nThere are some novels that read like poetry, and \"The House on Mango Street\" is on that list. Cisneros uses short vignettes to show key moments in the life of Esperanza, a 12-year-old Latina girl growing up in Chicago, poised in the awkward time between childhood and adolescence. The writing is truly lovely, and the use of vignettes creates a feeling of being inside someone’s memories. Through Esperanza, Cisneros creates a portrait of a community, both the love and support as well as the restrictive and painful aspects. The latter includes moments of domestic and sexual abuse, and as Esperanza ages within the novel, her understanding and descriptions of those situations become more explicit, although never graphic. It is easy to understand why the book has won multiple awards, as Cisneros plays with narrative form and storytelling, and questions what it means to belong in a fascinating and wonderful way. – Rebecca Viser\n\n'Maus' by Art Spiegelman\n\nSpiegelman's semi-autobiographical novel about his parents' experiences in Auschwitz and his family's subsequent lifelong traumas is a masterpiece of Holocaust literature and should be essential to all school-age readers. Though \"Maus\" is not a children's book, its graphic medium and depiction of Jews and Germans as mice and cats makes the topic more approachable for younger readers still trying to get their heads around the unfathomable historical horror. The only way to avoid a second Holocaust is to teach the first. –VanDenburgh\n\n'Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry' by Mildred D. Taylor\n\nAmerican public school reading curriculum is heavily white. I can attest to that with my own experience: In my 12 years as a student in American public schools, I was assigned only one novel by an African American writer, and that was Taylor’s Newbery Medal-winning story of the Logan family, sharecroppers in rural Mississippi whose love for one another helps them survive the cruelties of the Jim Crow South. I grew up a pretty privileged white kid with no personal experience of racism, and I can keenly recall how hot I burned with the unfairness of it reading “Roll of Thunder” for the first time in the second grade. If we want to create more anti-racists, we need to assign more diverse books in schools, and “Roll of Thunder” is still a great place for young readers to start. – VanDenburgh\n\n'Animal Farm' by George Orwell\n\nI first read it in middle school in Phoenix, only a few years after my family had escaped communist Vietnam in 1975. I checked it out of my school library because of the title and was ready for enchanted spiders and pigs like in “Charlotte's Web” by E.B. White. Instead, in Orwell’s attack on the Soviet Union, I recognized all too well what my family was hearing from relatives who hadn’t been able to flee the fall of Saigon. Daily indoctrination classes, South Vietnamese officers sent to reeducation camps and their homes confiscated and given to communist officers. Those who could still afford radios risked imprisonment to listen to Voice of America because you couldn’t believe the state-run media. Orwell wrote “Animal Farm” because he wanted to tell the story of the Russian Revolution in a way anyone could understand. And children everywhere need to. – Thuan Le Elston\n\n'Beyond Magenta: Transgender Teens Speak Out' by Susan Kuklin\n\nA 2019 study revealed that about 3% of American teens (ages 13 to 17) identify as transgender or gender-nonconforming. In this book, Kuklin interviews six trans teens about their childhoods, their coming-out experiences and where they are today. It brings hope to trans teens that there is a future for them, and it provides a clear look into their minds for loved ones to truly understand their points of view. Despite this book receiving many awards, it was in the top 10 Most Challenged Books lists for 2015 and 2019 for “its effect on any young people who would read it.” To the contrary, this book provides a unique perspective on gender and sexuality to help teens learn about themselves from other people their age. I believe this book does a great service to the young LGBTQ community. – Melissa Rorech\n\n'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' by Sherman Alexie\n\nI first read the story of Junior as he leaves his school on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Washington for an all-white school during Banned Books Week in middle school. As Junior struggles to find his place in a school where the only other Indian is the mascot, he grapples with generational poverty and discrimination. While I cannot fully understand Junior’s experience, I, as a person of color at an extremely white school, saw myself in his battle to explore identity in an environment that seeks to erase it. While the classroom offered a whitewashed, sanitized reality of Native Americans’ experiences, this book offered me a glimpse into the systemic oppression Native communities have faced since colonization. It shows tribes as part of the current fabric of our nation rather than merely part of history. And it examines a dimension of diversity that’s often forgotten: disability. In the hands of a trusted teacher who can guide students through difficult conversations, this story has the power to push readers into uncomfortable but important spaces and allow students whose experiences are often ignored in classrooms to be seen – all through the lens of an uproariously funny teen. – Fernando\n\n'Goosebumps' (series), by R.L. Stine\n\nIt’s fun to be scared. Granted, in controlled environments – movie theaters, haunted houses, or between the covers of a book. Or in the case of Stine’s beloved horror series, dozens of books starring a bevy of spooky frights: werewolves, ghosts, haunted Halloween masks and even an evil ventriloquist's dummy. These books have long been challenged in school libraries for being too scary, but those who object clearly don’t remember what it was like to be a kid with a vivid imagination. In a world so full of real horrors, the pretend ones offer escape and catharsis. Besides, if my generation could survive the “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” illustrations, what possible danger could a few “Goosebumps” books be? – VanDenburgh\n\n'Bridge to Terabithia' by Katherine Paterson\n\nFarm boy Jess Aarons and imaginative, bright-eyed new girl Leslie Burke become friends and create Terabithia, a fantasy kingdom in the woods. Inspired bythe magic they brought to that wooded glade, I once made my own Terabithia in a circle of tall trees in my backyard while playing outside with my friends. But (spoiler alert) after Leslie fell to her death when the rope they used to swing to Terabithia snapped, I was shocked. I didn’t know then that Leslie’s death and Jess’ experience of it would feel much like how my own loss would feel in the many years to come – random and senseless. Seeing Jess in the aftermath of Leslie’s death prepared many of us for what loss would feel like, the unsparing pendulum swinging between the good days and the bad. Their story also taught me the power of joyful imagination and creativity, that people are complicated (even the bullies) and that, despite the devastating reality of death, there is hope for life after loss. – Fernando\n\n'Brave New World' by Aldous Huxley\n\nFew classic sci-fi novels bear a more direct resemblance to modern times than \"Brave New World.\" Huxley explores a future in which the government’s obsessive need for economic growth creates an endless consumerist cycle and a society divided into a rigid caste system that separates people by jobs, intelligence and appearance. The world is painted as a utopia but only because its citizens are kept complacent by entertainment and mood-altering drugs. They believe they receive everything they want, but their places in society have been carefully curated by the government (and cloning technology). There’s no room to be an individual in Huxley’s futuristic England, and anyone who tries is punished. Consumerism. Prejudice. Happiness above truth. These are all things we continue to grapple with as a modern, global society. It’s as if Huxley traveled through time to 2021 before writing his novel. – Joanna Nelius\n\n'Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret' by Judy Blume\n\n“Why would anyone want to ban ‘Are You There God’?” my sixth grade daughter asked. “It’s my favorite book.” Grace is 11, the same age I was when I read Blume’s classic novel – only it was too new to be called a “classic” back then – about preteen girls grappling with puberty (breasts and periods, anyone?), religion and sexuality. As with Grace today, it was my favorite book then. I found comfort and familiarity in Margaret, her friends and her conversations with God. Their world was my world, and Blume paints an unvarnished picture of what life is like for maturing girls. Those frank discussions of sensitive topics – often challenging for tweens and adults alike – are why girls love the book and adults challenge it. And why this mom is thrilled that it’s still one sixth graders reach for and cherish, a generation later. – Kristen DelGuzzi\n\n'The Catcher in the Rye' by J.D. Salinger\n\nTwenty years ago, a school board member in small-town South Carolina checked out Salinger's work from the high school libraries in his district. He planned to pay for the copies instead of returning them, he told the local newspaper. He didn't want students to read the “filthy, filthy\" book and said the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, was a poor role model. He already had tried once to ban it. His second attempt failed as well – though it wasn’t part of any curriculum. When I agreed to write about \"The Catcher in the Rye\" as part of this year’s Banned Book Week, I had no idea that the most infamous protest against it happened at my high school. Or that it played out when I was a sophomore, only a few years younger than the fictional Caulfield, in the throws of the kind of angst and ennui that defined Salinger’s prose. I didn’t read it until my mid-20s. Afterward, I realized I’d missed the moment. My rebellious years were behind me and I’d forgotten how isolating they could be. How much I could have used a book like that at the time. Finally, learning why it had been kept from me has reignited some of that disquiet. It’s not lost on me that old men who think they know best and stand in the way of students reading great literature are exactly the sort of people Caulfield railed against. So let me now be the proverbial catcher for the next generation: Kids, read it all. Especially the ones The Man tells you not to. – Cara Kelly\n\n'Persepolis' by Marjane Satrapi\n\nWhen I first read “Persepolis” in college, I was immediately enchanted with the punk rock protagonist of the graphic memoir. I never lived through the Islamic Revolution in Iran, but to see Satrapi depict how the revolution disrupted people, families and communities has always stuck with me. I’m very much a supporter of women and girls who like to talk back, as Beyonce once sang, and who challenge the status quo. I’m not sure how anyone can read “Persepolis” and not be touched by how loving Satrapi’s family is even when they fear for her safety. Satrapi showed us what life was like as a young, rebellious woman growing up in Iran during the 1980s. For those who found a way to survive, they lived life as best they could. And like so many other young women coming of age, Satrapi had sex (gasp!) and cursed and used drugs. Experimenting is what young people do. It’s an insult to her vulnerability that some have tried to ban her book. – Mabinty Quarshie\n\n'The Glass Castle' by Jeannette Walls\n\nI first read \"The Glass Castle\" on assignment as a rookie reporter in my college town. The memoir had been selected by the university and county library as a summer book. It was an appropriate choice for two institutions little more than 100 miles from Welch, West Virginia, the closest thing the author has to a hometown. Many of the issues Walls faced as a kid are endemic to the area: poverty, substance abuse, violence. She tackled them head-on – so much so that her detailed descriptions have been used as fodder to ban the book from school curriculums. That shortsightedness misses how masterfully Walls infuses the truth about her problematic childhood with a sense of pride and perseverance. As a reporter in the Appalachian mountains, I knew kids there and across America were suffering the same social ills (and still do, made worse by the opioid epidemic, COVID-19 and financial downturns). Walls' writing tells them that they shouldn’t be ashamed of their circumstances and the decisions of adults around them, and that they don’t have to carry the stigma of poverty or abuse. I can think of few more meaningful messages. Save, maybe, the one she inscribed in my copy: “Just tell the truth!” – Kelly\n\n'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time' by Mark Haddon\n\nThis was among the first books I read with a neurodiverse character at its core. Instead of letting Christopher sit on the periphery, Haddon brings the reader into Christopher’s perception of the world by writing the text in ways that make it more representative of his lived experience. The novel directly shows how Christopher perceives things, including how signs at a busy airport become overwhelming walls of text. This allows Haddon to bring into question whether what most people think of as “normal” is actually better. Christopher’s world is more compassionate and empathetic toward animals, including his pet rat, Toby, and the dog whose mysterious death he sets out to solve. Aside from being a phenomenal bildungsroman, the novel stands the test of time. I read it first as a teenager, and again in my senior year of college. Both times I walked away feeling as though I’d learned more than you’d think a fictional book could ever teach. – Lindsey Vickers\n\n'The Things They Carried' by Tim O'Brien\n\nThe Vietnam War may have started more than 60 years ago, but that doesn't make the war stories of \"The Things They Carried\" any less relevant for young readers today. It's not an easy read – but that's the point. Learning about the day-to-day struggles soldiers have to endure is not supposed to be easy. It's supposed to be uncomfortable. It's supposed to be vulgar, explicit, and confusing because that's exactly what soldiers face. The novel provides an unfiltered view of war that vastly contrasted the way people felt about World War II. It represents a pivotal point in history and mirrors the public sentiment of the ’70s when people stopped romanticizing war and started critically examining why we go to war and how it affects those who fight. This book presents a much-needed glimpse into the real lives of soldiers, and while it may not be a feel-good read, it’s a necessary one. – Ellsworth\n\n'The Golden Compass' by Philip Pullman\n\nThe same reason as to why “The Golden Compass” was banned is the reason it should be a must-read. The novel is often described as the antithesis of “The Chronicles of Narnia,” which is known for its Christian allegories, because of its supposed message of atheism. Pullman’s first book in \"His Dark Materials\" fantasy trilogy pushes the boundaries with young characters seeing through the lies of organized religion (in this case the Magisterium) and eventually killing “God” himself. Regardless of the readers’ religion, it’s important for children to learn to question any and all institutions. Through a more contemporary lens, readers will surely appreciate Pullman’s themes even if they don’t agree with his conclusions. – Josh Rivera\n\n'Beloved' by Toni Morrison\n\nMotherhood in the U.S. has never been easy. We are a nation that reveres motherhood without providing the resources moms need to thrive. Just look at how many mothers suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. Now imagine the trauma of being an enslaved Black mother who doesn’t even control her own body, much less her children's. “Beloved” shows us the impossible choices Black mothers were forced to make during slavery. Who could blame Sethe, the protagonist, for doing anything to prevent her children from being enslaved – even to the point of death? I certainly can’t. Slavery has never been pretty, and it never will be. There are moments of incredible pain and violence inflicted upon Black men and women in “Beloved.” We can’t look away from these horrors because a few people refuse to accept that racism was a fundamental part of U.S. history. Holding up the nation’s sins to our faces was a heroic choice Morrison made in her writing. And we were all the better for it. – Quarshie\n\n'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee\n\nWhen the school board in Biloxi, Mississippi, argued \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" should be kept out of the classroom in 2017 because it makes people \"uncomfortable,” they actually nailed the best reason to keep it on the shelves. Everything in the book is uncomfortable, and not because it accurately describes overt racism in sometimes noxious language. It’s uncomfortable because it holds up a mirror to our present: the ease with which neighbors will embrace lies and willingly fall in with a mob; a legal system working overtime to send a Black man to prison; how fear informs our uninformed view of the mentally ill; and the brutal dividing line between the poor and the privileged. This is a provocative book, not a perfect one. But the shortcomings of 1930s race, society and language it depicts which so distress critics – and made the Biloxi school board so uncomfortable – are not failings of the author’s words. They are the continued failings of our world. Now is not the time to look away. – Patricia Beall\n\n'The God of Small Things' by Arundhati Roy\n\nWinner of the Man Booker Prize, \"The God of Small Things\" focuses on twins and their family in Kerala, India. Roy explores how her characters’ lives – both past and present – are shaped by their social, political, religious and environmental surroundings. She provides readers with an insightful look into India’s colonial history, discriminatory caste system and the rise of the Communist Party in the nation in the late ’60s while challenging notions of forbidden love to present a complex portrait of an era and its societal consequences years later. It's an important read for students to understand the legacy of colonialism and the devastating impacts of discrimination. – Grace Hauck\n\n'The Outsiders' by S.E. Hinton\n\nWhen Johnny Cade implores Ponyboy Curtis to “stay gold,” it’s more than a wish from a dying friend. It’s a prayer of sorts to be carried throughout life, an adage to turn to when we need to offer encouragement or uplift ourselves. That line, taken from Robert Frost’s poem “Nothing Gold Can Stay,” is the moral centerpiece of Hinton’s “The Outsiders” and its study of innocence lost. Pitting the blue-collar “Greasers” against the wealthy “Socs” is a frequently employed trope, but the melancholy that pervades Hinton’s debut novel (which she wrote in high school!) resonates beyond a seemingly simplistic setup of contrasting socioeconomic status. Some find the murder in the book – Johnny and Ponyboy get jumped by the Socs and Johnny knifes one in self-defense – unsuitable for teen readers. But when Johnny later tries to rescue some schoolchildren from a burning church (and dies from his injuries), the point is made. Golden is eternal. – Melissa Ruggieri\n\n'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' by Mark Twain\n\nBecause of needed context, I wouldn’t read it before “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.” But “Tom” was a fling; “Huck” still holds my hand when I write. I can’t remember when I first read them, but English is my second language, and both helped me learn not only how English has changed but also how America has changed. When I met Huck, I heard only the boy’s voice and saw only what he understood. Upon rereading and realizing what Jim had been saying all along, I entered another universe through the eyes of a Black enslaved man, ripped from his family and fighting through his fear to survive. I never forgot how Twain gave depth to such different voices in “Huck.” He helped me write and rewrite my own novel. Keep “Huck,” for its teaching mechanics as well as its wise heart. – Elston\n\n'50 Shades of Grey' by E.L. James\n\nIn a time in which we consider ourselves forward thinkers, it is shocking to still consider any conversation revolving around sex taboo. \"50 Shades\" is one of the most well-known and controversial erotica novels, but there are a vast number of authors trying to broach the subject, many worrying their writing is good only behind closed doors. In writing \"50 Shades,\" James gives those writers a voice – those that have been waiting for the right moment to share their deepest, darkest desires with the world. It is necessary to normalize thoughts about sex and not slap tape across our lips to keep from expressing our tastes in the bedroom. – Nishka Dhawan\n\n'The Color Purple' by Alice Walker\n\nThe world would be a poorer place without Walker’s “The Color Purple.” Taking inspiration from her literary foremother Zora Neale Hurston, Walker centers on Southern Black women, who are all too often misrepresented in American culture. I was a little girl when I first picked up “The Color Purple” but it would take until I was an adult to fully comprehend the courage it took for Celie to let go of all the oppressive teachings she internalized and find her own freedom. Oftentimes, what people call “controversial” in literature is simply an author refusing to ignore the truth. Walker gave a gift to Black women and everyone else with “The Color Purple.” Celie’s relationship with Shug Avery may be a relationship that makes some people uncomfortable. But for Black LGBTQ people, it’s a necessary and affirming literary coupling. Don’t we all deserve to see our lives and truths reflected in the literature we read? – Quarshie\n\n'The Giver' by Lois Lowry\n\nA must-read dystopian novel for any teen, I first read this book in middle school, and then I reread it in high school and college. The main character, a tween named Jonas, is given the important role as ‘Receiver of Memory,’ where he is supposed to retain the beautiful and dark moments others in his community can't see. He can see color in a black-and-white world as well as the environment, animals, human emotions and past experiences. The book sheds light on the importance of freedom and living life as one chooses to, but the message goes deeper than that. Valuing our relationships with our friends, family, and colleagues in the real world is a gift. Oftentimes, we lose sight of what makes our life beautiful, even though it is right in front of us. And those lessons are conveyed elegantly in this book, from start to finish. Life is spontaneous and crazy, and there shouldn’t be someone telling us how to live our life when we have the ability to carve our own destiny. Banning this book would be a loss for children, not a gain – Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'A Separate Peace' by John Knowles\n\nI first read Knowles’ 1959 novel “A Separate Peace” at 14 as a closeted gay teenager. I next read “A Separate Peace” at 29 as an out gay adult. I provide this context because it absolutely shaped the way I read the story about wealthy teens at a New England boarding school at the start of World War II, and understood the relationship between Gene and Finny – one of platonic love bordering on romantic, one of pride bordering on envy and one of playing around bordering on violence. As clarified in David Levithan's afterword included in my edition, Knowles did not intend on homoeroticism between the characters. But Levithan gets to the heart of how I felt: “Knowles did not write about two boys who know they are gay or have conscious gay feelings, but he certainly created a compelling resonance for boys who do.” Thank you, Knowles, either way. – David Oliver\n\n'The Bluest Eye' by Toni Morrison\n\nSetting aside every major literary award bestowed upon her, Morrison’s oeuvre is too important to American literature to ever be cast aside or banned. I was a teenager the first time I read “The Bluest Eye,” too young to truly grasp the horror of what Morrison was writing about. Now, as a dark-skinned Black woman rereading it, I understand the suffering that Pecola Breedlove was subjected to. Little Black girls deserve literature that doesn’t shy away from the pain that white supremacy and patriarchy inflicts upon them. If we can’t read and contemplate the horrors that are inflicted upon our children, how will we ever make the world a better place? Yes, “The Bluest Eye” takes an unflinchingly look at sexual violence and incest. But in a nation still reeling from the #MeToo movement, we cannot afford to look away. Black women, like Native American women, are at a disproportionate risk for sexual violence. The literature written about African American women shouldn’t ignore these horrifying statistics either. – Quarshie\n\n'The Handmaid\\'s Tale' by Margaret Atwood\n\nAtwood said she didn’t include any events in the book that hadn’t already happened in history or any technology not already available. “No imaginary gizmos, no imaginary laws, no imaginary atrocities,” she wrote in The New York Times in 2017. The result is a book about a theocratic dictatorship that takes over the United States after climate change and declining birth rates threaten to cripple the nation’s economy. Fertile women are reproductive slaves, forced to bear children for the elite. In the 1980s, when it was published, the book read as a response to the political rise of Christian fundamentalists, the bombing of abortion clinics and the control of those behind the Iron Curtain. As we sit in 2021 with climate change threatening our coastlines and crops, a rising threat of nationalism and attempts to chip away at the hard-fought rights of women, minorities and the LGBTQ community, the plot seems evermore an apt prediction. What could be more important now than a book that explores the dangers of totalitarianism as we watch democracy challenged on the very steps of Congress? A book that explores the power of women as the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements push the next wave of feminism forward? A book with dire warnings about what can happen when resources get scarce, as drought and wildfires have become the new norm for a swath of our country? Because of its plausibility, \"The Handmaid’s Tale\" is timeless and relevant. It was a necessary book in the 1980s, and it's still a necessary book in 2021. – Wedell\n\n'1984' by George Orwell\n\nI read \"1984,\" one of the most thought-provoking and interesting dystopian books I have come across, back in high school when it was assigned reading for my English class. There is simply no other book that can show readers what it would be like to live in a society where the freedom to think and make choices for oneself is not allowed. The book sheds light on why it is important for people to express themselves and make choices, and why freedom of expression is important in society. Another important theme that struck my attention was misinformation and disinformation being spread by the ruling party. As an early career reporter, I strive to make sure the public knows the truth and the facts. This book is a must-read for any high schooler because it teaches lessons you wouldn’t get from any other book – Kochi\n\n'The Hunger Games' (series), by Suzanne Collins\n\nI fell down the \"Hunger Games\" rabbit hole during the pandemic. What started as something to pass time turned into a deep dive into Collins' post-apocalyptic world of Panem, a society deeply divided by wealth disparity, where the elite are more concerned with pageantry than basic human rights. I couldn’t help but notice some striking parallels between the dystopia and our pandemic-riddled nation. The rich got richer. The poor got poorer. And although we don’t send a boy and girl from each district to their televised demise, the constant loop of the trauma of Black and brown bodies being killed by police felt similar in the summer of 2020. The tale may have beenoutrageously dystopian when Collins published her first installment in 2008, but it is not as outrageous in the lens of 2021. Some Twitter users even compared the 2021 Met Gala in New York to a lavish party in District 1 as many communities grapple with the lasting effects of COVID-19. That’s exactly why this book shouldn’t be banned. – Cydney Henderson\n\n'A Wrinkle in Time' by Madeleine L’Engle\n\nThe first time I read “A Wrinkle in Time,” I was even younger than the sci-fi classic’s 13-year-old heroine, Margaret (Meg) Murray. At the time, I didn’t know how much I needed a heroine like her in my life. As I’ve reread the book (and read it to my own kids) many years later, I’ve sent up a brief word of thanks that I was introduced to Meg. She is thrust into impossible peril with unfathomable stakes, and she overcomes it. Resentfully, even angrily, she saves her family, not despite her flaws but because of them. A wild, strange, sprawling tale, “A Wrinkle in Time” let me know, just as it has for generations of young readers, that there’s immense power in being yourself; that the galaxy is weird, wide and wonderful; that love is the answer no matter the question; and that you can be terrified and do brave things anyway – in fact, you must. – Beaudry\n\n'Born a Crime' by Trevor Noah\n\nNoah’s 2016 memoir, \"Born A Crime,\" is at its core a love letter to his mother, whose romantic relationship with a Swiss man was a punishable offense in South Africa’s apartheid state. She rears Trevor through apartheid and its chaotic collapse, and eventually through her own abusive relationship with his stepfather by a mix of tough love, gallows humor and religion. Yet \"Born A Crime\" forces the reader – particularly American-born consumers – to look critically into corners where we too easily looked away. Certainly, apartheid was touched on in our history or government classes. Too often, though, its abstract presentation – brutal colonization, minority rule, a worthy martyr named Nelson Mandela – never encouraged us to get too close, lest we recognize our own pathologies. \"Born A Crime\" is breezy and sweet and often hilarious, a dubious target for censure, it would seem. Yet it does not equivocate in recounting a brutal chapter of history. – Gabe Lacques\n\n'Harry Potter' (series) by J.K. Rowling\n\nIt's a shame that Rowling tarnished her own legacy in recent years by attacking transgender people – for fans, her hate speech felt like a betrayal of the very values her books espoused. \"The Harry Potter\" novels have been frequently challenged by religious groups for supposedly promoting witchcraft. But snatching these books out of the hands of children because of that supernatural bogeyman would be doing them an awful disservice. The series taught a generation of readers about empathy, friendship and courage in the face of political danger – themes that Rowling would do well to apply to her own recent comments. Harry Potter is a powerful example of fiction's ability to make us more thoughtful and discerning people, and for that, it should not be banned. The books should continue to be shared and obsessed over, as they've been by readers of all ages for the past two decades. – Jason Lalljee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/29"}]}

The National Labor Relations Board will accept the secret ballots through 7 p.m. Friday.\n\nOn one side are workers who say they need a union to give them a voice in their workplace, to protect against arbitrary treatment, and to bargain for better benefits and pay.\n\nOther Nissan employees reject the idea of a union speaking for them. They fear the UAW would be an economic albatross, burdening an employer who pays them well.\n\nOutside analysts assume the union is an underdog, since the UAW has never fully organized a foreign-owned auto plant in the southern United States. But no one knows for sure.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n“The vote will tell us the truth,” said Bo Green, a Nissan worker who opposes the union.\n\nThe UAW’s only foothold among these carmakers in the South so far is a local representing maintenance workers at a Volkswagen AG plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. But globally, Nissan’s Canton Vehicle Assembly Plant and two plants in Tennessee are the exceptions — everywhere else in the world, the company’s factories have unions.\n\nIt’s not an overstatement to say the world is watching — French politicians have been involved, and crowding into a sweaty union meeting Tuesday night were actor Danny Glover, a Brazilian unionist and a Japanese journalist.\n\nAbout 6,400 people work for Nissan and its suppliers in Canton, where Frontier and Titan pickups, Murano SUVs and NV vans are assembled. But only direct employees can vote. Excluded are managers, engineers, clerical workers, guards, and hundreds of contract laborers who do the exact same work on the factory floor.\n\nUnion supporters say the UAW can prevent arbitrary treatment by managers and empower workers to bargain for better pay, working conditions and safety protections. They point to a worker in Mississippi who lost several fingers on an assembly line, and another in Tennessee who was killed on the job.\n\nForeign automakers came to these states in part to avoid unions and keep wages low. Mississippi, for its part, granted the Japanese-based company subsidies and tax breaks that could be worth more than $1 billion over 30 years.\n\nWhen he was Senate Majority Leader, Mississippi Republican Trent Lott promised that Nissan would “revolutionize” the state’s economy, and Mississippi’s business and political leaders still mostly line up with Nissan management. Republican Gov. Phil Bryant calls UAW supporters “socialists.”\n\n“I don’t think we need a union to come in there and tell us how to make a better automobile,” Bryant said during a speech last week. “They can get back on the Bernie Sanders bus and go back to New York, and I’ll pay their way.”\n\nThe independent senator from Vermont and many of Mississippi’s African-American politicians back the UAW, which spent years cultivating ministers and other local leaders. With the Canton plant’s majority African American workforce in mind, the union has promoted historic ties between the labor and civil rights movements. In response, Nissan has saturated local television with campaign-style ads and posted “vote no” signs along roads for miles around.\n\n“It’s kind of brutal, the constant bombardment of ‘The UAW is the most terrible thing ever,’” said union supporter Earnest Whitfield, who works with machines that stamp steel into parts for the cars and trucks.\n\nUAW Secretary-Treasurer Gary Casteel accuses Nissan of breaking federal labor law by pressuring workers to vote “no,” and the NLRB has alleged eight violations of federal law. Rodney Francis, the plant’s human resources director, told The Associated Press on Monday that Nissan is merely trying to dispel the union’s “false promises.”\n\nIt’s illegal for managers to threaten layoffs ahead of a union election.\n\n“Look at the UAW’s record on strikes and plant closing and layoffs,” Francis said. “Unions make the company less able to be flexible and to meet the market demand.”\n\nGreen predicts the plant will close if the UAW gets in. He says three relatives lost jobs when GM closed its plant in Shreveport, Louisiana, but Nissan has never laid off a direct employee.\n\n“You’ve got one company that’s doing good. They don’t got the UAW,” said Green. “You’ve got another company that’s doing poorly. They’ve got the UAW.”\n\nAnalysts say Nissan won’t likely abandon a $3.3 billion investment in the plant, which has an annual capacity of 450,000 vehicles, about 8 percent of Nissan’s worldwide production. And union supporters say management is to blame for the historic downturns of the Detroit Three.\n\n“All of a sudden, if we have a union, is management going to stop managing the way they have in the past?” Whitfield asked.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/08/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/02/11/tennessee-volkswagen-uaw-incentives-threat/5388341/", "title": "Tenn. lawmakers issue incentive threat in VW union move", "text": "Brent Snavely\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nAbout 1%2C500 Volkswagen workers will vote from Wednesday through Friday\n\nThe vote is UAW%27s best opportunity to win support at a foreign-owned assembly plant since Honda began building cars in Ohio more than 30 years ago\n\nVolkswagen plans to expand in Chattanooga or at a Mexican plant to produce a midsize SUV\n\nThe crusade by anti-union forces in Tennessee, including the state's governor and senior senator, is as much a fight with Volkswagen management as with the UAW.\n\nNot only are Republican legislators accusing Volkswagen of backing the UAW, some of their leaders on Monday threatened to withhold tax incentives for future expansion of the 3-year-old assembly plant in Chattanooga if workers vote this week to join the UAW.\n\nAbout 1,500 workers will vote from Wednesday through Friday in an election that the National Labor Relations Board will conduct.\n\nThe company plans to expand in Chattanooga or at a Mexican plant to produce a midsize SUV.

Bob Corker and prominent anti-tax lobbyist Grover Norquist led the automaker's management to issue a statement over the weekend that \"outside political groups won't divert us from the work at hand: innovating, creating jobs, growing and producing great automobiles.\"\n\nNorquist and a group called Center for Worker Freedom have rented about a dozen digital billboards in the Chattanooga area trumpeting anti-union messages. One shows an image of the long-abandoned Packard ruins with the message: Detroit: Brought to You by the UAW.\n\nThe company has allowed anti-union groups into the plant to talk to workers and distribute printed material.\n\nDavid Smith, a spokesman for Haslam, said the governor believes it will become more difficult for Tennessee to recruit new manufacturers to the state if the Volkswagen workers are represented by the UAW.\n\n\"Any discussions of incentives are part of additional and continued talks with VW, which we look forward to,\" Smith said.\n\nA group called Southern Momentum echoed that position in a statement on Monday.\n\n\"Further financial incentives — which are absolutely necessary for the expansion of the VW facility — simply will not exist if the UAW wins this election,\" said Maury Nicely, a Chattanooga, Tenn., labor lawyer opposed to VW's cooperation with the union.\n\nDemocratic legislators, who are a minority in both chambers of the Tennessee General Assembly, defended Volkswagen's prerogative to manage the plant as it chooses.\n\n\"In my 20 years on the hill, I've never seen such a massive intrusion into the affairs of a private company,\" said Tennessee Rep.

The UAW said it would cooperate with efforts to win production of a new SUV in Chattanooga, and that it would drop its National Labor Relations Board challenge of the February union vote.\n\nIn return, Volkswagen committed to recognizing the UAW, which would give it the authority to bargain on behalf of both members and non-members, according to the letter signed by Mike Cantrell and Steve Cochran, the president and vice president of Local 42.\n\nTennessee's right-to-work laws mean no worker can be forced to join a union, though the UAW says more than half of eligible workers have signed up.\n\nBut Sean Moss, the interim president of the independent worker group, says the UAW is exaggerating its strength and that more white and blue collar workers are gravitating toward the American Council of Employees.\n\n\"What we're offering is to have the local employees in the local plant dictate their own path moving forward,\" Moss said. \"There's no interest coming from Detroit, there's no interest coming from Washington.\n\n\"Everything is going to be centered on the plant,\" he said.\n\nThe UAW in February lost the contentious union election at the Volkswagen plant by a 712-626 vote amid warnings from Republican politicians — including U.S. Sen. Bob Corker and Gov. Bill Haslam — that $300 million in incentives for expansion could be imperiled if the union won.\n\nCorker drew the ire of the UAW for repeatedly suggesting before the February union vote that he had inside information that the rejection of the union would result in the company deciding to expand the plant within two weeks.\n\nIt was later revealed that the state's $300 million incentive package offered to Volkswagen had contained the caveat that the money was subject to labor talks \"being concluded to the satisfaction\" of the state. Haslam declined to specify which scenarios would have satisfied the state.\n\nVolkswagen ultimately announced in July that it will invest $600 million to expand the factory to build a new seven-seater SUV as it seeks to reverse flagging U.S. sales.\n\nThe company did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for Haslam and Corker also declined comment.\n\nThe automaker wants to create a German-style works council at the Chattanooga plant to represent both salaried and blue-collar workers. But the company's interpretation of U.S. law indicates that it must work with an independent union to operate a works council.\n\nThe UAW's case at the Tennessee plant has been bolstered by support from labor representatives who control half the seats on the Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker's supervisory board.\n\nThe UAW, its German counterpart IG Metall and the Volkswagen Global Group Works Council in September signed an agreement outlining their joint efforts to gain labor representation at the Chattanooga plant, including the goal of the UAW gaining \"exclusive majority status and recognition of this by Volkswagen.\"\n\nThe strong links between the UAW and the powerful labor interests at Volkswagen could make it difficult for rival employee groups they call management-friendly \"yellow unions\" to gain favor with the company.\n\nOrganizing foreign-owned auto plants has been seen as key for the UAW to revive its fortunes.

Sandra Hightower of the National Labor Relations Board confirmed that the board received the UAW's election petition in its New Orleans office.\n\nThe union has long struggled to organize foreign-owned auto plants across the South, working for years to build support for a vote among the 6,500 employees at the Mississippi complex.

The labor board has backed some of those claims in pending litigation.\n\nUAW Secretary-Treasurer Gary Casteel told AP in an April phone interview that the union didn't want to go forward in a situation where Nissan was violating labor laws to intimidate workers but said the decision on when to move ahead was ultimately a \"balancing act.\"\n\nThe pro-union campaign has sought to link support for the union with civil rights for African-Americans. Workers at Nissan's plant in Smyrna, Tennessee, rejected the UAW in 1989 and 2001 votes, but no election has been held at the Mississippi plant in Canton. The Mississippi campaign has featured support from the NAACP and actor Danny Glover, as well as a rally in March headlined by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent and former Democratic presidential candidate.\n\n\"We see organized labor as a mechanism to give workers and African-Americans a voice around their quality of life,\" said Derrick Johnson, president of the Mississippi branch of the NAACP.\n\nHightower said the UAW asked to represent all production and maintenance workers at the Canton plant, a group that could include contract workers employed by two other companies — Kelly Services and Minact. Kelly traditionally employed a large share of assembly workers, but Nissan has moved more than 1,000 to its own payroll in recent years, increasing their pay and benefits.\n\nThe labor board would seek to schedule an election \"as soon as possible,\" Hightower said. However, she noted that pending unfair labor practice complaints filed by the UAW could block the vote. The UAW filed a new round of charges June 26.\n\nThirty percent of workers must sign petitions seeking an election. Hightower could not immediately say how many workers have signed.\n\n\"We have a pile of paper,\" she said.\n\nBishop Thomas Jenkins of New Dimensions Church in Jackson recorded a video and spoke at a Sunday workers meeting at the UAW office. He said he has long advocated for better wages and working conditions in Mississippi.\n\n\"We've been talking about this for a long time,\" Jenkins told the AP in a phone interview Monday. \"It's time to go forth.\"\n\nThe move is likely to provoke a reaction from conservative political and economic leaders in Mississippi, who have long been hostile to unions. Republican Gov. Phil Bryant, who signed a package of bills intended to make unionization harder in 2014, is among those who have spoken out against the UAW. About 8 percent of Mississippi workers were represented by unions in 2016 according to U.S. Labor Department statistics, compared with 12 percent nationwide.\n\n\"Nissan has been and continues to be a proven success story for the state of Mississippi and its workers,\" said Scott Waller, interim president of the state's chamber of commerce, called the Mississippi Economic Council. \"Meanwhile, the UAW has struggled to hold membership. This would not be good for the state for Mississippi.\"\n\nThe union lost a 2014 vote among all workers at Volkswagen AG's plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, but then won a vote among 160 maintenance workers. That was the first-ever win for the UAW at a foreign-owned auto plant in the U.S. South.

The union promises it would help negotiate better working conditions, benefits and wages at the plant. However, managers warn that the UAW will ultimately hurt both the company and the workers.\n\nUnion supporters tried to pressure Nissan for years into staying neutral, or at least toning down its anti-union stance. But managers, while saying workers get to decide, are pushing against the UAW. The company is broadcasting anti-union videos inside the plant, and the UAW says supervisors are pulling workers into private meetings to gauge UAW support and persuade workers against unionizing.\n\n► More:1968 issues still haunt Memphis sanitation workers union\n\nThe UAW has tried to bolster support among the majority-African American workforce by linking union support to civil rights, but even union supporters admit management's message is causing some pro-UAW workers to waver.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"People who were for the union are now undecided,\" said Shanta Butler, a union supporter.\n\nThe stakes are high. The UAW has never organized an entire foreign-owned auto plant in the South, although it did win an election among maintenance technicians at a Volkswagen AG plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Foreign automakers came South in part to avoid unions, and most benefit from lower labor costs.\n\nWorkers at Nissan's plant in Smyrna, Tennessee, rejected the UAW in 1989 and 2001 votes, but this is the first election in Canton. Though unions have struggled to crack southern auto plants owned by foreign companies, unions have prevailed nationwide in 65 percent of elections from October through June, National Labor Relations Board figures show.\n\nThe top Nissan executive in Canton appeared in the first video urging rejection of the UAW barely a day after the union announced that it had filed a petition with the labor board to hold the election.\n\n\"We know the union will make promises it can't keep to get you to vote for the UAW,\" Marsh said in a recorded video message to workers. \"But when you see the UAW's empty promises for what they really are, and get the complete facts, the choice is clear.\"\n\nAnti-union messages from managers aren't unusual in labor elections, but the pressure can be very uncomfortable for workers.\n\n\"It is often very tense,\" said Vanderbilt University sociologist Dan Cornfield, who has studied unions. \"It's tense because both sides feel a lot is riding on it for them.\"\n\nUAW Secretary-Treasurer Gary Casteel said the union's goal is to help wavering union supporters \"have enough fortitude\" to stick with the union in the face of anti-union messages. Nissan contends the UAW history of strikes and other actions have caused economic losses for workers and automakers; Nissan maintains its workers already have good pay and benefits.\n\n\"I've never seen a more aggressive campaign,\" Casteel said in a phone interview. \"I've seen a lot as aggressive.\"\n\nCasteel called management's efforts \"intimidation,\" but Nissan spokeswoman Parul Bajaj rejected that description. Managers have said they're giving workers the facts about the UAW.\n\n\"Nissan respects and values the Canton workforce, and our history reflects that we recognize the employees' rights to decide for themselves whether or not to have third-party representation,\" Bajaj said.\n\n► More:Nashville construction workers call for safer job sites, more job security\n\nThe union hasn't alleged any new violations of federal labor law. Following earlier UAW allegations, the NLRB charged, among other things, that managers illegally questioned workers and threatened to close the plant if it unionized. That legal case is unresolved.\n\nThe 14-year-old plant is where Frontier and Titan pickups, Murano SUVs and NV vans are assembled. Its annual capacity of 450,000 vehicles is about 8 percent of all Nissan vehicles made worldwide last year.\n\nUAW supporters have protested against Nissan's opposition to the UAW around the world, especially in France. The French government owns nearly 20 percent of the Renault Group, Nissan's business partner. Carlos Ghosn, Renault Nissan Alliance chairman, told French lawmakers in 2016 that the alliance \"has no tradition of not cooperating with unions.\"\n\nCasteel said the union may raise Nissan's opposition with French officials, often much more sympathetic to organized labor than their American counterparts.\n\nIt's unlikely pressure on Mississippi workers will lessen before they vote.\n\n\"They always say the same old things and they always do the same old things,\" Casteel said. \"The reason they do them is because they work.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2023/11/29/uaw-public-organize-automakers/71731333007/", "title": "UAW launches unprecedented push to organize 13 automakers in US", "text": "After winning record labor contracts this month with the Detroit Three car companies, the United Auto Workers is now taking on all nonunion automakers operating in the United States in a massive and unprecedented public organizing campaign.\n\nOn Wednesday, the UAW said workers at more than a dozen nonunion automakers across the United States have announced simultaneous campaigns to join the UAW.\n\nThat means \"thousands of non-union autoworkers are signing cards at the new UAW webpage UAW.org/join and are publicly organizing to join the UAW,\" the union said in a news release. The organizing drive will cover nearly 150,000 autoworkers across 13 automakers, according to the release.\n\nAccording to a UAW flyer made available to the Detroit Free Press and expected to be made public on social media and in factories in coming days, here's how the organizing process will work:\n\nOnce 30% of workers at a plant sign union cards on the UAW's website, a committee of plant autoworkers will go public to say the facility is working toward unionizing.\n\nOnce half the workforce signs the cards, a public rally with UAW President Shawn Fain and other leaders will be held to demonstrate support for union representation.\n\nAfter 70% of the workforce has signed the cards, an organizing committee made up of plant workers will demand that the company recognize the union. If it does not, the UAW will file cards with the National Labor Relations Board and takes it to a plant vote.\n\nTo complement the effort, the union is launching Wednesday a three-minute video on social media outlining the benefits of belonging to the union.\n\n“Big Three autoworkers at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis just won big raises, more job security and cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) for one simple reason: They’re organized,\" Fain said in the video, which was shared with the Detroit Free Press before its public release. \"To all the autoworkers out there working without the benefits of a union, now it’s your turn.”\n\nWorkers have reached out to join\n\nIn the video, Fain points out that electric vehicle makers Tesla, Rivian and Lucid have reported big profits in recent years and Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Subaru and Mazda — the Japanese and South Korean six — made $470 billion in profits combined over the past decade, \"with more than 40% of their revenue coming from their North American operations.\" He added that the German Three: Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes Benz, have made $460 billion in profits in the past decade. He said workers deserve \"a record cut of those record profits.\"\n\nAs the Detroit Free Press has reported, the UAW conducted a targeted Stand-Up strike from Sept. 15 to Oct. 30 against the Detroit carmakers. The union won 4½-year contracts at all three companies that included a 25% base wage increase over the life of the contract, a return of COLA, new plant investments and more.\n\nIn the video, Fain said since beginning the Stand-Up strike, the response from nonunion workers has been \"overwhelming.\"\n\n“Workers across the country from the West to the Midwest and especially in the South are reaching out to join our movement and to join the UAW,\" Fain said. \"The money is there, the time is right and the answer is simple: You don’t have to live paycheck to paycheck, you don’t have to worry about how you’re gonna pay your rent or feed your family while the company makes billions. A better life is out there and it starts with you: UAW.”\n\nSome foreign automakers have reacted\n\nThis is not the first time the UAW has tried to organize nonunion U.S. auto factories, most of them built by Asian and European automakers in Southern U.S. states where \"right-to-work\" labor laws make it optional for workers to pay union dues. But despite failing to organize in the past, automakers in those states are concerned enough about it to react after the UAW settled its contract with the Detroit automakers. Several nonunion automakers responded by raising pay and shortening wage progressions.\n\nAs the Free Press reported earlier this month, Japanese automaker Toyota raised wages by 9% to 10% after UAW members won the contracts with the Detroit Three. Likewise, South Korean automaker Hyundai said it would raise factory worker pay 25% by 2028, matching the general wage increase won by the UAW during that period. Japanese automaker Honda said it, too, will increase wages 11% during the same period.\n\nBut Fain said nonunion autoworkers still remain far behind UAW autoworkers in wages and benefits, and rights on the job.\n\nThe UAW said one of the strongest campaigns at the moment is at Toyota’s Georgetown, Kentucky, assembly complex, where 7,800 workers make the company’s Camry sedan and highly profitable RAV 4 and Lexus ES SUVs. Even though Toyota has given a wage increase, 29-year-old Toyota Georgetown employee Jeff Allen has had two work-related surgeries and is concerned about health benefits, the UAW said in a release. Allen reportedly said the raise won’t dissuade workers from organizing.\n\n“We’ve lost so much since I started here, and the raise won’t make up for that,” said Allen in the release. “It won’t make up for the health benefits we’ve lost, it won’t make up for the wear and tear on our bodies. We still build a quality vehicle. People take pride in that, but morale is at an all-time low. They can give you a raise today and jack up your health benefits tomorrow. A union contract is the only way to win what’s fair.”\n\nA Toyota spokesperson did not immediately provide a comment to the UAW's organizing efforts. Requests for comment were sent to Hyundai, Mazda, BMW, Volvo, Lucid and Rivian but not immediately answered Wednesday.\n\nVolkswagen spokesman Michael Lowder declined to comment. Mercedes-Benz also declined to comment.\n\nNissan spokeswoman Amanda Plecas said in an email that Nissan \"respects the right of employees to determine who should represent their interests in the workplace. However, we believe our workplace is stronger without the involvement of a third party.\"\n\nIn an email, America Honda Motor Co. spokesperson Chris Abbruzzese said, “Over the past 40 years, no automaker has been more successful in growing its U.S. production operations than Honda, something we have done based on our approach of teamwork, respect and open communication, in addition to maintaining competitive wages and benefits. We do not believe an outside party would enhance the excellent employment experience of our associates, nor would it improve upon the outstanding track record of success and employment stability Honda manufacturing associates in America have achieved.”\n\nAt Subaru of Indiana Automotive in Lafayette, Indiana, about 6,000 people build the Ascent, Crosstrek, Legacy and Outback vehicles, according to www.Subaru-SIA.com website. Spokesman Craig Koven told the Free Press in an email, \"Prior to recent industry developments, Subaru of Indiana Automotive has consistently demonstrated a commitment to proactively do the right thing for its associates.\"\n\nIn a statement, Koven said, \"As part of our semi-annual wage review conducted this time each year, current industry conditions were taken into consideration. In January, we will implement increases at each step of our wage scales — including the largest production increase in company history. With this change, our top production wage will have increased seven times and more than 24% since 2019.\"\n\nHe said the plant remains \"the only known non-U.S. auto manufacturer to provide premium-free healthcare, as well as the sole auto manufacturer to make company-matching contributions to flexible spending accounts.\"\n\n'Unprecedented' public organizing\n\nOn Wednesday, General Motors leaders said North American labor costs will increase by $1.5 billion this year compared with 2019 contracts due to the new UAW contract, but the automaker said it is looking across the company for ways to offset the increase. CEO Mary Barra said the new contract with the UAW will add about $500 in cost to GM per vehicle in 2024 and about $575 per vehicle on average over the life of contract, Barra said.\n\nFord has not assigned a total dollar value to the negotiated UAW package, but CFO John Lawler did estimate an $850 to $900 added cost per unit in labor costs. It is unclear what either cost increase at GM or Ford will mean for sticker prices.\n\nThe UAW is referring to this movement as an \"unprecedented effort to publicly organize the entire nonunion auto sector at once.\"\n\nIt marks a departure from past organizing efforts where the union went plant by plant. The union said this \"new aggressive strategy is reflective of a new era of working-class leverage and workplace organizing.\"\n\nMore:GM labor contracts will add $1.5 billion to costs, but here's how GM expects to offset it\n\nContact Jamie L.

It filed seven unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board on Friday alleging Nissan intimidated workers and muddied the election so much that it was unfair. But labor experts say the UAW would face even tougher odds even if the NLRB overturns the election results and forces Nissan to agree to a new election.\n\nUnions historically perform worse, not better, when a second election is held. Nissan has proven it knows how to defeat the UAW and has done so three times now -- once in Canton and twice at its plant in Smyrna, Tenn. in 1998 and 2001.\n\n\"I don’t know that the UAW's chances get better as time goes on,\" Dziczek said.\n\nThe UAW's loss also comes as it continues to deal with a federal investigation into corruption at the UAW-Chrysler National Training Center in Detroit. Last month, the widow of former UAW vice president was indicted for conspiracy to commit fraud along with two former Fiat Chrysler Automobiles officials.\n\nFor now, though, the UAW can distance itself from its loss. The strategy that it deployed against Nissan is vastly different from the UAW's big organizing drives at makers' plants.\n\nIn Mississippi, the UAW waged a campaign that married worker rights with civil rights in the hope it would resonate with a workforce of 6,400 that includes many African Americans. It enlisted the support of the NAACP, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., actor Danny Glover, local clergy and politicians. The UAW and those supporters waged a pro-union campaign that compared itself to the civil rights movement.\n\nSome of the pastors and community rights activists who have spoken in favor of the UAW in recent years were paid thousands of dollars. Nevertheless, the campaign was successful to the degree that it put tremendous public pressure on Nissan to work with the UAW and declare neutrality on union organizing activities -- a legal term that means the company decides not to oppose the union.\n\nBut Nissan never caved. It held its ground and waged a fierce anti-union campaign.\n\nYou'd have to look back to the 1960s -- perhaps the 1940s -- to find an organizing campaign that the UAW tied so closely to civil rights, said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California-Berkeley who specializes in labor issues.\n\n\"I have seen it before, but it’s become increasingly rare in recent years,\" Shaiken said. \"You would have to look at something right at the birth of the UAW.\"\n\nBut the tactic didn't work. When union backers passed out T-shirts implying that a vote against a union was a vote for slavery, some workers pushed back.\n\n\"That's an insult to me. I am nowhere near enslaved,\" said Marvin Cooke, a Nissan paint technician who earns $27 an hour, far above the Mississippi average. An opponent to unionizing, he dismissed the UAW.\n\n\"I think the union is trying to ruin our plant,\" Cooke said.\n\nContributing: Anna Wolfe, The (Jackson, Miss.)

The election at the VW plant in Chattanooga is scheduled for April 17-19.\n\nArt Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, in a statement Thursday, highlighted the impact that last year's targeted strike by the UAW against Ford, General Motors and Stellantis has had on the union's organizing in the South.\n\n“There has been more momentum for the UAW in the past year than for the last 10 years.

Kay Ivey on the platform formerly known as Twitter but which is now listed as X.\n\nA news release about the effort at Mercedes-Benz said a supermajority of workers have filed a petition with the NLRB seeking a vote.\n\nOn Friday, NLRB spokesman Matt Hayward said in an email that the petition was filed with the board's Region 10 office in Atlanta to represent about 5,200 full-time and regular part-time production and maintenance employees at plants in Vance and Woodstock, Alabama, noting that a hearing would be held on April 15 if the union and employer do not stipulate to the terms of the union election. The NLRB website indicates that all professional employees, guards, managers and supervisors would be excluded. The facilities are both east of Tuscaloosa.\n\nThe plant in Vance, the automaker's first major such facility built outside Germany, produces a half-dozen models, including the GLE and GLS SUVs, and has 6,100 employees, and the facility in Woodstock is a battery plant, according to the company. It wasn't clear Friday how many workers are located in Woodstock.\n\nThe news release on the unionization effort quoted Moesha Chandler, a Mercedes assembly team member, who said \"we are voting for safer jobs at Mercedes. ... I’m still young, but I’m already having serious problems with my shoulders and hands. When you’re still in your 20s and your body is breaking down, that’s not right. By winning our union, we’ll have the power to make the work safer and more sustainable.”\n\nA UAW video posted on YouTube featured Chandler and other workers along with the theme \"Stand up Mercedes\" and Fain at a rally calling on a crowd to have faith that they can win:\n\n\"Working-class people have the power to change the world. That's what you're fighting for right now. Work-life balance. Good health care that you can afford. A better life for your family. A better life for all of Alabama.\"\n\nThe news release, provided by public relations firm Feldman Strategies, described the effort to date and accused the company of leading an aggressive anti-union campaign, which the company has denied.\n\n\"By late February, less than two months after Mercedes workers went public with their drive to join the UAW, a majority of them had signed union cards. The Mercedes workers hope to be voting in their union election by early May. The NLRB is expected to quickly set the date for the election,\" the release said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the UAW said it filed charges against Mercedes-Benz for violating Germany's new law on global supply chain practices related to actions at the Alabama plant, which is run by one of its subsidiaries. The union said the complaint details how the company \"has intimidated, threatened and even fired Alabama workers in violation of U.S. labor law and International Labour Organization Conventions.\"\n\nThe UAW said the company fired a union supporter with cancer over having his phone with him at work so he could get updates on a scarce chemo drug. The supporter had been allowed to have his phone for that purpose, the union said, but \"a supervisor who has intimidated union supporters claimed there was a zero-tolerance policy on cellphones and had him fired.\"\n\nIn addition, the release described mandatory plant-wide meetings, including one that featured former University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban, which either discouraged unionizing or prevented union supporters from distributing UAW hats.\n\nThe UAW has also filed unfair labor practice charges against the company with the NLRB.\n\nThe email from the NLRB spokesman noted that the board \"has docketed four unfair labor practice charges ... filed by UAW against Mercedes-Benz. The union’s charges, still under investigation, allege that the employer unlawfully fired three employees for engaging in protected activities, imposed discipline on employees for discussing unionization at work, and prohibited the distribution of union materials and paraphernalia.\"\n\nAndrea Berg, a spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz, provided a statement saying the company was declining comment on the complaint when asked about the case in Germany because it hadn't been received. But the statement also said the subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz U.S. International, \"has not interfered with or retaliated against any team member in their right to pursue union representation. MBUSI does not believe these claims have merit and looks forward to presenting the case to the NLRB.\"\n\nThe company said that \"following the UAW’s nationwide campaign to increase its membership, MBUSI wants to ensure its team members make an informed decision. MBUSI has a strong record of success over the past 25+ years operating as one team in Alabama ... (and) has a proven record of competitively compensating team members and providing many additional benefits.\"\n\nFree Press staff writer Jamie L.

If they vote for the union, this would be the first works council in the U.S. and the first time in decades that the UAW organized a foreign-owned auto plant not part of a joint venture with a Detroit automaker.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board scheduled the secret ballot as a result of a deal between Volkswagen and the union. \"Volkswagen is known globally for its system of cooperation with unions and works councils,\" UAW President Bob King said in a statement. \"The UAW seeks to partner with (the company) and a works council to set a new standard in the U.S. for innovative labor-management relations that benefits the company, the entire workforce, shareholders and the community.\"\n\nA works council has specific rights and responsibilities similar to the German \"Betriebsrat.\" Under the model, a works council represents employees on a wide range of internal matters at the plant, while their union represents them on terms and conditions such as hours, pay and benefits.\n\nThe company said Chattanooga is the only major Volkswagen assembly facility without a union and that a works council at the Chattanooga plant would get a seat at the VW Global Group Works Council.\n\nVolkswagen plans to spend $7 billion in North America in the next five years as it expands production and adds new products, including a new midsize SUV. Martin Winterkorn, CEO of Volkswagen, has said the SUV is being considered for Chattanooga and that the outcome of a UAW vote would have no impact on the decision.\n\nWhile Volkswagen doesn't oppose the formation of a union at the Tennessee plant, leading political figures in the state do, including Republican Gov. Bill Haslam and Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. — a former mayor of Chattanooga.\n\nRepublican interest groups also have pressured workers to vote against the UAW and have purchased billboards in Tennessee to campaign against the UAW.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/02/03"}]}

Another man wraps his arms around a massive Bible pressed against his chest like a shield. All throughout the crowd, people wave “Jesus Saves” banners and pump their fists toward the sky.\n\nAt first glance, these snapshots look like scenes from an outdoor church rally. But this event wasn’t a revival; it was what some call a Christian revolt. These were photos of people who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, during an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe insurrection marked the first time many Americans realized the US is facing a burgeoning White Christian nationalist movement. This movement uses Christian language to cloak sexism and hostility to Black people and non-White immigrants in its quest to create a White Christian America.\n\nA report from a team of clergy, scholars and advocates — sponsored by two groups that advocate for the separation of church and state — concluded that this ideology was used to “bolster, justify and intensify” the attack on the US Capitol.\n\nDemonstrators pray outside the US Capitol in Washington on January 6, 2021. Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMuch of the House January 6 committee’s focus so far has been on right-wing extremist groups. But there are plenty of other Americans who have adopted teachings of the White Christian nationalists who stormed the Capitol — often without knowing it, scholars, historians, sociologists and clergy say.\n\nWhite Christian nationalist beliefs have infiltrated the religious mainstream so thoroughly that virtually any conservative Christian pastor who tries to challenge its ideology risks their career, says Kristin Kobes Du Mez, author of the New York Times bestseller, “Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation.”\n\n“These ideas are so widespread that any individual pastor or Christian leader who tries to turn the tide and say, ‘Let’s look again at Jesus and scripture,’ are going to be tossed aside,” she says.\n\nThe ideas are also insidious because many sound like expressions of Christian piety or harmless references to US history. But White Christian nationalists interpret these ideas in ways that are potentially violent and heretical. Their movement is not only anti-democratic, it contradicts the life and teachings of Jesus, some clergy, scholars and historians say.\n\nSamuel Perry, a professor of religious studies at the University of Oklahoma who is authority on the ideology, calls it an “imposter Christianity.”\n\nHere are three key beliefs often tied to White Christian nationalism.\n\nA belief that the US was founded as a Christian nation\n\nOne of the banners spotted at the January 6 insurrection was a replica of the American flag with the caption, “Jesus is My Savior, Trump is My President.”\n\nErasing the line separating piety from politics is a key characteristic of White Christian nationalism. Many want to reduce or erase the separation of church and state, say those who study the movement.\n\nOne of the most popular beliefs among White Christian nationalists is that the US was founded as a Christian nation; the Founding Fathers were all orthodox, evangelical Christians; and God has chosen the US for a special role in history.\n\nThis painting chronicles lawmakers' signing of the Constitution of the United States in 1787. MPI/Getty Images\n\nThese beliefs are growing among Christians, according to a survey last year by the Barna Group, a company that conducts surveys about faith and culture for communities of faith and nonprofits. The group found that an “increasing number of American Christians believe strongly” that the US is a Christian nation, has not oppressed minorities, and has been chosen by God to lead the world.\n\nBut the notion that the US was founded as a Christian nation is bad history and bad theology, says Philip Gorski, a sociologist at Yale University and co-author of “The Flag and the Cross: White Christian Nationalism and the Threat to American Democracy.”\n\n“It’s a half truth, a mythological version of American history,” Gorski says.\n\nSome Founding Fathers did view the founding of the nation through a Biblical lens, Gorski says. (Every state constitution contains a reference to God or the divine.)\n\nBut many did not. And virtually none of them could be classified as evangelical Christians. They were a collection of atheists, Unitarians, Deists, and liberal Protestants and other denominations.\n\nA Trump supporter holds a Bible as he gathers with others outside the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. John Minchillo/AP\n\nThe Constitution also says nothing about God, the Bible or the Ten Commandments, Gorski says. And saying the US was founded as a Christian nation ignores the fact that much of its initial wealth was derived from slave labor and land stolen from Native Americans, he says.\n\nFor evidence that the United States was founded as a secular nation, look no further than the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli, an agreement the US negotiated with a country in present-day Libya to end the practice of pirates attacking American ships. It was ratified unanimously by a Senate still half-filled with signers of the Constitution and declared, “the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on Christian religion.”\n\nDoes this mean that any White Christian who salutes the flag and says they love their country is a Christian nationalist? No, not at all, historians say. A White Christian who says they love America and its values and institutions is not the same thing as a White Christian nationalist, scholars say.\n\nGorski also notes that many devout Black Americans have exhibited a form of patriotism that does not degenerate into Christian nationalism.\n\nAmerican social reformer and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, circa 1880. Graphic House/Getty Images\n\nGorski points to examples of the 19th century abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, and the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Both were devout Christians who expressed admiration for America and its founding documents. But their patriotism also meant that “they challenged the nation to live up to its highest principles, to become a place of freedom, equality, justice and inclusion,” he says.\n\nThe patriotism of White Christian nationalists, on the other hand, is a form of racial tribalism, Gorski says.\n\n“It’s a ‘My tribe. ‘We [White people] were here first. This is our country, and we don’t like people who are trying to change it or people who are different’ form of nationalism,” Gorski says.\n\nA belief in a ‘Warrior Christ’\n\nVideos from the January 6 attack show a chaotic, tear-gas-soaked scene at the Capitol that looked more like a medieval battle. Insurrectionists punched police officers, used flagpoles as spears and smashed officers’ faces against doors while a mob chanted, “Fight for Trump!” The attack left five people dead and nearly 140 law enforcement officers injured.\n\nThe incongruity of people carrying “Jesus Saves” signs while joining a mob whose members are pummeling police officers leads to an obvious question: How can White Christian nationalists who claim to follow Jesus, the “Prince of Peace” who renounced violence in the Gospels, support a violent insurrection?\n\nA protester holds up a Bible amid the crowd storming the US Capitol Rotunda in Washington on January 6, 2021. Ashley Gilbertson/VII/ Redux/\n\nThat’s because they follow a different Jesus than the one depicted in the Gospels, says Du Mez, who is also a professor of history and gender studies at Calvin University — a Christian school — in Michigan. They follow the Jesus depicted in the Book of Revelation, the warrior with eyes like “flames of fire” and “a robe dipped in blood” who led the armies of heaven on white horses in a final, triumphant battle against the forces of the antichrist.\n\nWhite Christian nationalists have refashioned Jesus into a kick-butt savior who is willing to smite enemies to restore America to a Christian nation by force, if necessary, Du Mez and others say.\n\nWhile warlike language like putting on “the full armor of God” has long been common in Christian sermons and hymns, it has largely been interpreted as metaphorical. But many White Christian nationalists take that language literally.\n\nThat was clear on January 6. Some insurrectionists wore caps emblazoned with “God, Guns, Trump” and chanted that the blood of Jesus was washing Congress clean. One wrote “In God We Trust” on a set of gallows erected at the Capitol.\n\n“They want the warrior Christ who wields a bloody sword and defeats his enemies,” says Du Mez. “They want to battle with that Jesus. That Jesus brings peace, but only after he slays his enemies.”\n\nAnd that Jesus sanctions the use of righteous violence if a government opposes God, she says.\n\n“If you deem somebody in power to be working against the goals of a Christian America, then you should not submit to that authority and you should displace that authority,” she says. “Because the stakes are so high, the ends justify the means.”\n\nSupporters of then-President Donald Trump gather on the Ellipse near the White House to hear him speak on January 6, 2021. Mark Peterson/Redux\n\nThat ends-justify-the means approach is a key part of White Christian nationalism, says Du Mez. It’s why so many rallied behind former President Trump on January 6. She says he embodies a “militant White masculinity” that condones callous displays of power and appeals to Christian nationalists.\n\nBut with few exceptions, White Christian nationalists do not accept this “militant masculinity” when exhibited by Black, Middle Eastern and Latino men, Du Mez writes in “Jesus and John Wayne.” Aggression by people of color “is seen as a threat to the stability of home and nation,” she writes.\n\nWisconsin Republican Senator Ron Johnson echoed this double standard last year when he said on a radio talk show that he never really felt threatened by the mostly White mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6.\n\n“Now, had … President Trump won the election and those were tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters, I might have been a little concerned,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson later elaborated, saying “there was nothing racial about my comments– nothing whatsoever.”\n\nThis embrace of a warrior Christ has shaped some White evangelicals’ attitudes on issues ranging from political violence to gun safety laws.\n\nA survey last year by the Public Religion Research Institute revealed that of all respondents, White evangelicals were the religious group most likely to agree with the statement, “true American patriots might have to resort to violence in order to save the country.”\n\nThere are also some White Christian nationalists who believe the Second Amendment was handed down by God.\n\nGun rights activists carrying semi-automatic firearms pose for a photograph in the state Capitol Building on January 31, 2020, in Frankfort, Kentucky. Bryan Woolston/Getty Images\n\nSamuel Perry, co-author of “Taking America Back for God: Christian Nationalism in the United States,” wrote in a recent essay that among Americans surveyed who believe “The federal government should declare the United States a Christian nation,” over two-thirds rejected the idea that the federal government should enact stricter gun laws.”\n\n“The more you line up with Christian nationalism, the less likely you are to support gun control,” wrote Perry. “Guns are practically an element of worship in the church of white Christian nationalism.”\n\nA belief there’s such a person as a ‘real American’\n\nIn the 2008 presidential election, vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin introduced a new term to the political discourse. She talked about “the real America” and the “pro-America areas of this great nation.” Since then, many conservative political candidates have used the term “real Americans” to draw contrasts between their supporters and their opposition.\n\nSuch language has been co-opted into a worldview held by many White Christian nationalists: The nation is divided between “real Americans” and other citizens who don’t deserve the same rights, experts on White Christian nationalism say.\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin speaks at the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nGorski, author of “The Flag and the Cross,” says he found in his research a strong correlation between White Christian nationalism and support for gerrymandering—an electoral process where politicians manipulate district lines to favor one party or, some critics say, race over another. He found similar support among White Christian nationalists for the Electoral College, which gives disproportionate political power to many rural, largely White areas of the country.\n\nWhen White Christian nationalists claim an election was stolen, they are reflecting the belief that some votes don’t count, he says.\n\n“It’s the idea that we are the people, and our vote should count, and you’re not the people, and… you don’t really deserve to have a voice,” Gorski says. “It doesn’t matter what the voting machines say, because we know that all real Americans voted for Donald Trump.”\n\nWhy White Christian nationalism is a threat to democracy\n\nThose who want the US to become a Christian nation face a huge obstacle: Most Americans don’t subscribe to their vision of America.\n\nThe mainstreaming of White Christian nationalism comes as a growing number of Americans are rejecting organized religion. For the first time in the US last year, membership in communities of worship fell below 50%. Belief in God is at an all-time low, according to a recent Gallup poll.\n\nA parishioner bows his head to pray while celebrating midnight Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral on December 24, 2021, in New York City. Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images\n\nAdd to that the country’s growing racial and religious diversity. People who identify as White alone declined for the first time since the census began in 1790, and the majority of Americans under 18 are now people of color.\n\nOn the surface, White Christian nationalism should not be on the ascent in America.\n\nSo White Christian nationalists look for salvation from two sources.\n\nOne is the emboldened conservative majority on the US Supreme Court, where recent decisions overturning Roe vs. Wade and protecting school prayer offer them hope.\n\nCritics, on the other hand, say the high court is eroding the separation of church and state.\n\nNot all Christians who support the high court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade and its school prayer decision are White nationalists. For example, plenty of Roman Catholics of all races support racial justice yet also backed the overturning of Roe.\n\nBut White Christian nationalists are inspired by those decisions because one of their central goals is to erase the separation of church and state in the US.\n\nA recent study concluded that five of the justices on the Supreme Court are the “most pro-religion since at least World War II,” and that the six conservative justices are “all Christian, mostly Catholic,” and “religiously devout.”\n\nThe sun sets in front of the Supreme Court on June 28, 2022, in Washington. A Supreme Court decision last month overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling and erased a federal right to an abortion. Nathan Howard/Getty Images\n\nWhile some Americans fear the dangers of one-party rule, others like Pamela Paul, a columnist, warn of the Supreme Court instituting one-religion rule.\n\n“With their brand of religious dogma losing its purchase, they’re imposing it on the country themselves,” she wrote in a recent New York Times editorial.\n\nGorski, the historian, says White Christian nationalism represents a grave threat to democracy because it defines “we the people” in a way that excludes many Americans.\n\n“The United States cannot be both a truly multiracial democracy – a people of people and a nation of nations – and a white Christian nation at the same time,” Gorski wrote in “The Flag and the Cross.” “This is why white Christian nationalism has become a serious threat to American democracy, perhaps the most serious threat it now faces.”\n\nThe other source of hope for White Christian nationalists is a former occupant of the White House. Their devotion to him is illustrated by one of most striking images from the January 6 insurrection: A sign depicting a Nordic-looking Jesus wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat.\n\nIf Trump returns to the presidency, some White Christian nationalists may interpret his political resurrection as divine intervention. His support among White evangelicals increased from 2016 to 2020.\n\nAnd what the men carrying wooden crosses among the Capitol mob couldn’t achieve on January 6, they might yet accomplish in 2024.", "authors": ["John Blake"], "publish_date": "2022/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/25/pending-lawsuits-donald-trump-presidency/92666382/", "title": "How 75 pending lawsuits could distract a Donald Trump presidency", "text": "Nick Penzenstadler and John Kelly\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nOn the first anniversary of the start of his presidential campaign, Donald Trump spent much of the day in a setting he knows well — a room full of high-priced lawyers battling out a civil lawsuit.\n\nTrump paused his campaigning June 16 to answer questions under oath in one of his lawsuits against two celebrity chefs. He had sued Geoffrey Zakarian and José Andrés after they backed out of a restaurant deal in response to Trump’s inflammatory statements about Mexican immigrants.\n\nThe two-hour deposition was at least the third time Trump had to leave the campaign trail to be deposed by attorneys in one of his organization’s many lawsuits.\n\nJust two weeks before Election Day, at least 75 of the 4,000-plus lawsuits involving Trump and his businesses remain open, according to an ongoing, nationwide analysis of state and federal court records by USA TODAY. Trump is running well behind Democrat Hillary Clinton in most polls — about 5 points behind in the popular vote in RealClearPolitics' rolling average of national polls. But if Trump were to win, the number of unresolved cases is unprecedented for a presidential candidate, according to political scientists and historians.\n\nTrump faces significant open litigation tied to his businesses: angry members at his Jupiter, Fla. golf course say they were cheated out of refunds on their dues and a former employee at the same club claims she was fired after reporting sexual harassment. There’s a fraud case brought by Trump University students who say the mogul’s company ripped them off for tens of thousands in tuition for a sham real estate course.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTrump is also defending lawsuits tied to his campaign. A disgruntled GOP political consultant sued for $4 million saying Trump defamed her. Another suit, a class action, says the campaign violated consumer protection laws by sending unsolicited text messages.\n\nIf elected, the open lawsuits will tag along with Trump. He would not be entitled to immunity, and could be required to give depositions or even testify in open court. That could chew up time and expose a litany of uncomfortable private and business dealings to the public.\n\nOne Trump case, over non-payment of tips to caterers at Trump SoHo Hotel in New York City, is scheduled to go to trial a week before Election Day.\n\nEven in the waning days of the campaign, in a speech Saturday in Gettysburg outlining his first actions if he wins the White House, Trump threatened to sue all of the women who’ve accused him of unwanted sexual advances, saying all of them are lying.\n\nThe open cases raise questions about potential conflicts of interest that could become difficult for Trump to navigate.\n\nFor instance, could his judicial appointments be influenced by his own court cases? This summer, he attacked a federal judge who is presiding over the lawsuit against Trump University, saying District Judge Gonzalo Curiel is biased against Trump because the judge is of Mexican descent and Trump proposes a “great wall” along the Mexican border.\n\nDive into Donald Trump's thousands of lawsuits\n\nAnother potential issue: Would lawyers, parties in cases and even judges seek to curry favor with a powerful individual in a way that might alter the outcome?\n\nNorm Eisen, who founded the nonpartisan watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in 2003 and later was the top White House ethics lawyer for President Obama in 2009 and 2010, ticked off a series of potential conflicts.\n\nThe lawsuits against Trump University could raise questions about who Trump would appoint as Education secretary, Eisen said. “Somebody with favor to for-profit colleges?”\n\nTrump’s development of the Old Post Office building in Washington is being overseen by the federal government, which leases the historic building to Trump, and lawsuits involving the development could involve government officials.\n\n“Will he really put someone in charge that would testify against his business?” Eisen wonders.\n\n“And the mother of all conflict could be the IRS audit,” he said. “What if they suggest civil penalties, or even criminal proceedings?”\n\nAlan Garten, general counsel for Trump and his business interests, downplayed the significance of the cases.\n\nGarten said only about 30 significant cases are open. The others are run-of-the-mill cases involving one Trump holding or another, frivolous causes or suits destined to be dismissed. “The reality is we’re an operating company. We’ll treat all cases the same way if he’s elected or not — and the results shouldn’t be different in the eyes of the law.”\n\nTrump and the Law\n\nClinton has her own share of litigation heading toward Election Day. Media groups are suing her trying to get more emails from her private server. They’ve also argued for the release of deposition videos.\n\nThe email lawsuit is among about 30 open civil cases Clinton faces. Dozens will likely be tossed out because of immunity doctrines as she acted in her official role as secretary of State. In nearly all cases, Clinton is named solely in her government capacity, often among a laundry list of other public officials. In a small fraction, like with the email server, some argue she should be held accountable as a private individual.\n\nClinton’s campaign staff did not respond to questions about the open cases.\n\nUSA TODAY Network reporters spent more than six months gathering court records in more than 4,000 lawsuits involving Trump and his companies. They traveled to courthouses, studied thousands of pages of records and contacted lawyers, litigants and witnesses across the country. For comparison, the newspaper also pieced together the record of Clinton’s court cases.\n\nThe exclusive analysis found an unprecedented mountain of legal battles for a presidential candidate, ranging from skirmishes with pageant contestants to multimillion dollar real estate lawsuits. The cases offer clues to the leadership style the billionaire would bring to the White House.\n\nThe review shows that Trump frequently responds to even small disputes with overwhelming legal force, not hesitating to use his tremendous wealth and legal firepower against adversaries with limited resources.\n\nHe has repeatedly refused to pay people and small businesses for their work, forcing them to spend time and legal fees if they want to recover their losses.\n\nAt least 60 lawsuits — plus hundreds of additional liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by reporters — documented cases where people accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them what they were owed for their work. Among them: painters, glassmakers, real estate agents, bartenders and hourly workers at Trump resorts coast to coast. Even his own lawyers.\n\nUSA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills\n\nThe review also shows Trump and his companies have been accused for years of mistreating women. In at least 20 separate lawsuits, plaintiffs accused Trump and managers at his companies of discriminating against women, ignoring sexual harassment complaints and even participating in the harassment themselves. Women in those disputes have testified they were fired for complaining.\n\nTrump’s companies have been engaged in battles over taxes almost every year from the 1980s until as recently as last spring, when New York had to take legal action to collect $8,578 in unpaid taxes on the Trump-owned company that owns the trademark Boeing 757 that jetted the mogul to campaign rallies across the country.\n\nThe review found that people who say something Trump doesn’t like will frequently get threatened with a lawsuit. “I’ll sue you” was a Trump mantra long before “Build a wall.” The analysis of lawsuits, however, showed that he rarely follows through with his threatened lawsuits over people’s words and almost always loses when he does. The lone win was a lawsuit against Miss Pennsylvania — over her claim on Facebook that Trump’s Miss USA pageant was rigged.\n\nIf Trump is elected president, it won’t change the way his lawsuits are handled.\n\nHis companies face open cases of sexual discrimination and fraud, unpaid bills and contract disputes. In any of the open cases, litigants would have the right to demand testimony from Trump or people close to him, some of whom could become senior White House aides.\n\nSuch legal action can — and often does — unlock private financial and other records that could then become public. Even if Trump broke no laws or committed no wrongdoing, that kind of inside information could be used by political opponents to try to embarrass him or weaken him politically.\n\nClinton could face similar challenges as litigation over her refusal to turn over emails from her time as secretary of State moves forward.\n\n“It could pose a problem for both sides in the presidency,” said Julian Zelizer, a history professor at Princeton University. “They could produce damaging information, and given the partisan environment, any kind of scandal or investigation could be used to stifle a president.”\n\nThose kinds of tactics have impacted past presidencies.\n\nPresident Grant was among the early commanders in chief beset by scandal. He was forced to testify under oath at the White House in a high-profile federal prosecution of an illegal whiskey running scheme that ensnared some of his closest political associates.\n\nGrant’s testimony helped get his top aide off the hook and further soiled the public perception of his administration. Today, he is widely considered one of the least effective presidents in U.S. history.\n\nIn more modern times, President Nixon’s administration was ensnared by repeated legal woes, scandals, botched cover-ups and ultimately his resignation.\n\nBill Clinton faced legal issues tied to Whitewater, Paula Jones and ultimately White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\n\nClinton was forced to give a deposition in one sex-scandal case involving Jones and later faced an impeachment trial over his relations with Lewinsky at the White House. In the latter, Clinton became the first sitting president to testify before a grand jury investigating his own conduct, which became a years-long distraction.\n\nYet, no president had litigation in the volume of a potential President Trump.\n\n“Because of the Supreme Court case related to Bill Clinton, there’s no automatic shield for the president from civil action,” said Samuel Issacharoff, a law professor at New York University. “If he were president and called to testify and hostilities break out in the Middle East a court would probably postpone — but of course it’s a major dislocation to be going through these civil trials while he’s running an administration.”\n\nAmong the many Trump lawsuits, the most problematic could be the Trump University cases.\n\nFormer students from across the country have sued in two class actions, accusing the school of charging them up to $35,000 and lying about the value of the lessons they would receive.\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued in 2013 and has since described Trump University as a “fraud” and a “scam.”\n\nWhile the open cases are civil, some legal scholars raise the prospect that a court could ultimately find Trump University or even Trump personally liable for fraud. In the worst case, a finding that fraud took place — even by a civil court — could provide Congress with the grounds to consider impeachment proceedings.\n\n“These claims are different in an important way than most of his other cases,” said Christopher Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah who’s researched the Trump University cases. Even though the burden of proof would be lower in civil court to prove Trump liable for fraud or racketeering, Peterson said, “The evidence that you would use to prove those claims would be interchangeable. It’s the same kind of claims that you would get the mob for in a concrete scam.”\n\nAt a minimum, if the cases go forward, additional testimony by instructors and students about predatory sales tactics would become public.\n\nTrump’s already been deposed about the university. He downplayed his role, but could be called to testify at a trial.\n\nIf that happens, Trump would become the first modern sitting president to do so in open court. Bill Clinton gave testimony to a grand jury investigating the Monica Lewinsky scandal in 1998.\n\nFor years Trump’s legal team has successfully kept secret much of the financial information disclosed in his court cases.\n\nThe vast majority of settlement payments Trump has made to litigants is secret under non-disclosure agreements.\n\nTrump’s attorneys also regularly ask judges to seal records that come out during the cases, something that is often done for plaintiffs and defendants in civil cases.\n\nIf Trump is elected President, the already immense pressure to release records could escalate even further.\n\n“You don’t know what you don’t know,” said Katie Townsend, litigation director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a plaintiff seeking to liberate some of the sealed records. “Either way these documents would be newsworthy, before or after the election.”\n\nAlready Trump’s candidacy has prompted court battles to get records in his cases unsealed.\n\nIn September, a judge ruled against USA TODAY and The New York Times in an attempt to unseal court files from Trump’s 1990 divorce from his first wife, Ivana.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel ruled over the summer to keep private the video recording of depositions in the Trump University cases, partly for fear they would add to the political tint of the case and since transcripts are already available.\n\nBut in September, Trump attorneys lost battles to keep videotapes sealed in cases involving his Washington hotel and Jupiter, Fla., golf club.\n\nAnd a group of journalists are battling to unseal the settlement in a 1983 case tied to the destruction of Bonwit Tower in midtown Manhattan to make way for Trump Tower. The suit alleged undocumented Polish workers performed the work off-the-books. The settlement is still secret. A judge ruled against unsealing those records this summer, but the journalist group is appealing.\n\nIn June, in the days after the deadliest mass shooting in American history, as both presidential candidates and the rest of the nation were coming to grips with the terror attack on Orlando’s Pulse nightclub, Trump was also being deposed in Washington in one of his two lawsuits against the chefs, Zakarian and Andrés.\n\nThe duo wanted no part of the eatery they’d planned to open in Trump’s luxury hotel in the Old Post Office Building just down the street from the White House. Their reason: their reputations and their brand were badly damaged by associating with Trump after his comments a year earlier branding Mexican immigrants as rapists, murderers and criminals.\n\nAs they sought to establish the idea that such statements could be bad for any business, the chef’s attorneys asked Trump about the fallout for his businesses from his incendiary comments. They pressed him about whether he thought his words might keep Hispanics from going to a restaurant in one of his hotels or to any of his other properties. Trump’s response: The election and the attention he’s getting for the words he’s using are only going to be good for business.\n\n“I’m running for office. I obviously have credibility because I now, as it turns out, became the Republican nominee running against, we have a total of 17 people that were mostly senators and governors, highly respected people,” he said under oath.\n\nAfter explaining the “very dishonest” media distorted his remarks about Mexican immigrants, he added: “I think, you know, most people think I’m right.”\n\nHis booming popularity would only help the restaurant succeed, he testified. But, he conceded, the comments could turn some Hispanic patrons off.\n\n“It is always possible,” Trump said. \"I just don’t know. I mean, I don’t know how to answer that question. It’s possible.\"\n\nExclusive: Trump's 3,500 lawsuits unprecedented for a presidential nominee\n\nUSA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills\n\nTrump, companies accused of mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes over taxes tied to Trump and his companies\n\nDive into Donald Trump's thousands of lawsuits\n\nAs campaign rolls on, so do Trump's lawsuits in Florida\n\nTrump casino empire dogged by bad bets in Atlantic City\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK is tracking Trump court files\n\nContributing reporting to the Trump and the Law investigation: Nick Penzenstadler, John Kelly, Steve Reilly, Kevin McCoy, Susan Page and Kelly Jordan of USA TODAY; David McKay Wilson of The Journal News in Westchester County, N.Y.; Karen Yi of the Asbury Park Press; and Greg Stanley of the Naples Daily News.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/09/06/wikileaks-julian-assange-court-showdown-over-extradition-us/5701935002/", "title": "WikiLeaks' Julian Assange in court for showdown over extradition to ...", "text": "The extradition hearing of WikiLeaks founder and publisher Julian Assange resumes in London on Sept. 7 after being postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWashington wants British authorities to extradite Assange to the U.S. to face a court over charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. The Department of Justice has indicted him on 18 counts, alleging 17 forms of espionage and 1 instance of computer misuse crimes connected to WikiLeaks' dissemination of secret U.S. military documents provided to him by former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.\n\nAssange, 49, denies the charges and claims the U.S. documents WikiLeaks published in 2010 exposed war crimes and human rights abuses by the U.S. military in Iraq. WikiLeaks says the U.S. is trying to criminalize journalistic activity and if Assange is extradited it could have serious implications for First Amendment protections.\n\nIn-depth: Julian Assange infuriated Washington. Now he's facing life in prison\n\nThe hearing is expected to run until Oct. 2.\n\nHow did we get here? Here are highlights of Assange's case and related events that have kept the Australian national in the news for over a decade:\n\n• Assange has been locked up at London's Belmarsh Prison, a facility that houses some of Britain's most dangerous lawbreakers, since May 2019. His lawyers say he is unwell with various respiratory problems and that his mental health is suffering.\n\n• Nils Melzer, the United Nations' special rapporteur on torture, said in a recent USA TODAY interview that when he visited Assange in May last year he was displaying symptoms akin to \"psychological torture\" likely caused by prolonged exposure to extreme stress, chronic anxiety and isolation.\n\n• Assange is in jail because he was found guilty of skipping bail in 2012, when he fled to Ecuador's embassy in London for diplomatic refuge rather than turn himself in to British authorities for possible extradition to Sweden. At the time, investigators in the Scandinavian country wanted to question him over sexual assault allegations.\n\n• Swedish prosecutors in 2019 dropped the sexual assault allegations against Assange, which included a claim of rape. Assange consistently denied the allegations and the UN's Melzer said that the police reports that underpinned the allegations were riddled with contradictions and possibly even exculpatory evidence, such as text messages that indicate one of the claimants didn't want to accuse Assange of anything and that it was the police who \"made up the charges.\"\n\n• Assange's seven-year residency at Ecuador's poky red-brick embassy building, just yards from the famous luxury Harrods department store, came to an end amid a string of alleged transgressions by both sides. Ecuador says it kicked him out partly because of his unsocial behavior and because he was a constant source of distraction for embassy staff. Assange denies this and claims the U.S. was put under pressure by the Trump administration to expel him in return for improved relations with Quito.\n\n• When Assange left Ecuador's embassy in 2019 he was dragged by British police officers to a waiting van. He was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison for breaching bail in 2012. While he has now served this period, he remains in detention for the extradition hearing because prosecutors argued that he is a flight risk.\n\n• Assange describes himself as a political refugee. He maintains that he is a journalist and should be immune from prosecution and that his work revealed embarrassing and highly damaging facts about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the detainees held at the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Assange's detractors say he doesn't write stories or interview anyone or provide sufficient explanatory context to the material WikiLeaks releases and that the dissemination of raw, unfiltered documents and data – the publication of stolen classified materials – should not count as journalism.\n\n• The First Amendment typically restrains the government from jailing, fining or imposing liability for what the press publishes. It does not shield journalists from criminal liability. Seventeen of the U.S. indictments against Assange are under the Espionage Act of 1917 and one is under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The Trump administration's use of the espionage act breaks new legal ground because it is the first time it has been used to target a media organization as opposed to a government whistleblower, according to U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, a press freedom advocacy organization.\n\nDEBATE: WikiLeaks' Julian Assange: Journalist or criminal hacker?\n\n• Assange faces up to 175 years in prison if he is convicted in a U.S. court. The British government has pledged not to send Assange to the U.S. if he faces the death penalty.\n\n• In addition to publishing secret U.S. information, WikiLeaks has also been accused of playing a role in Russia's efforts to help Donald Trump's campaign against Hillary Clinton during her failed 2016 presidential run. A Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee report into the matter concluded that WikiLeaks likely knew it was assisting Russian intelligence when it published hacked emails from Clinton's time as secretary of State. The committee's review claimed that WikiLeaks has had a \"relationship\" with the Russian government since at least 2012 – Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006 – and that it \"reflects an alignment\" in \"seeking to undermine U.S. institutions and security.\" Assange has long insisted the hacked emails didn't come from Russian intelligence.\n\n2016 election: U.S. biggest election meddler of them all, new book claims\n\n• The Senate committee's report additionally concluded that then-Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone tried to get WikiLeaks to tell him about its planned information releases connected to the 2016 election. Stone visited Ecuador's embassy at least once after Trump was elected. As part of testimony given during Assange's extradition hearing in February, Assange’s lawyer told the court that Trump offered a pardon, allegedly delivered via former Republican lawmaker Dana Rohrabacher, to Assange if the WikiLeaks chief agreed to say Russia had nothing to do with hacking emails from Democrats during the 2016 presidential election. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham called the claim by Assange’s lawyer \"a complete fabrication and a total lie.\" She also said Trump \"barely knows Dana Rohrabacher.\" Rohrabacher visited Ecuador's embassy in 2017. He confirmed that he discussed the idea of a pardon with Assange but claimed he never discussed the matter with Trump himself.\n\n4 men, 4 takeaways:Senate intelligence report on Russian election meddling", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/europe/ukraine-azov-movement-far-right-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Azov movement analysis: A far-right battalion has a key role in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin framed the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a “special mission” to protect Russian speakers from genocide at the hands of ​”neo-Nazis.”\n\nIn a speech broadcast minutes before the invasion began on February 24​, Putin said: “We will seek to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine,” ignoring the fact that the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is Jewish.\n\nFor the Kremlin, Exhibit A in this special mission is the far-right Azov movement, part of the military and political landscape in Ukraine for nearly a decade. ​\n\nMembers of the Azov regiment and veterans march with torches to celebrate Defender of Ukraine Day in Kyiv on October 14, 2016. Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAzov’s military and political wings formally separated in 2016, when the far-right National Corps party was founded. The Azov battalion had by then been integrated into the Ukrainian National Guard.\n\nAn effective fighting force that’s very much involved in the current conflict, the battalion has a history of neo-Nazi leanings, which have not been entirely extinguished by its integration into the Ukrainian military. ​\n\nIn its heyday as an autonomous militia, the Azov Battalion was associated with White supremacists and neo-Nazi ideology and insignia. It was especially active in and around Mariupol in 2014 and 2015. CNN teams in the area at the time reported Azov’s embrace of neo-Nazi emblems and paraphernalia.\n\nAfter its integration into the Ukrainian National Guard, amid discussions in the US Congress about designating the Azov Movement a foreign terrorist organization, Ukraine’s then minister of internal affairs, Arsen Avakov, defended the unit. “The shameful information campaign about the alleged spread of Nazi ideology (among Azov members) is a deliberate attempt to discredit the ‘Azov’ unit and the National Guard of Ukraine,” he told the online newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda in 2019.\n\nThe battalion still operates as a relatively autonomous entity. It has been prominent in defending Mariupol in recent weeks, and its resistance has been widely praised by members of the government.\n\nFor Putin, who has falsely claimed Ukraine’s government is run by “drug addicts and neo-Nazis,” Azov presents an obvious target. Moscow has given the regiment an outsized role in the conflict, routinely accusing it of human rights abuses.\n\nOn March 7, Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations blamed the Azov regiment for blocking an evacuation corridor in the besieged port city, saying they were using “citizens as a human shield.” That claim has been repeated consistently in Russian media.\n\nThe same day, Azov major Denis Prokopenko said in a video shared on the regiment’s Twitter account that the “attempts to organize a safe corridor for the (relocation) of civilian people… failed because of several actions of the enemy (Russian forces) in the assembly area.”\n\nAfter the bombing of a Mariupol theater that was sheltering civilians and had “children” written in Russian on the ground on either side of the building, the Russian Defense Ministry accused “militants of the nationalist ‘Azov’ battalion” of carrying out the attack. ​\n\nIn the Russian disinformation playbook, the Azov movement is a tempting target – one where fact and disinformation can be elided.\n\nKyiv citizens take part in military training for civilians conducted by Azov regiment veterans on February 6, 2022. Maxym Marusenko/NurPhoto/AP\n\nThe existence of an identifiably Azov element within the Ukrainian armed forces – and an effective element at that – poses uncomfortable questions for the Ukrainian government and its Western allies, which continue to send arms to the country.\n\nCNN has reached out to ​Ukraine’s defense ministry for comment.\n\nIn the not-too-distant past, Azov’s leadership openly espoused ​White supremacist views and cultivated links with similarly minded groups and individuals in the West.\n\nIn 2010, Andriy Biletsky, now leader of the National Corps, the Azov movement’s political wing, reportedly said his goal was to “lead the White races of the world in a final crusade.”\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the Azov regiment said it “appreciates and respects Andriy Biletsky as the regiment’s founder and first commander, but we have nothing to do with his political activities and the National Corps party” – adding the former commander never made such comments.\n\nThe statement said that Azov’s “motivation has always angered Russia. Therefore, disinformation attacks on the AZOV Regiment have not stopped since 2014.”\n\nIt added that the movement has “repeatedly denied allegations of fascism, nazism and racism,” and have Ukrainians of all different backgrounds including “Greeks, Jews, Crimean Tatars, Russians” who “continue to serve in AZOV.”\n\n“Most of them are Russian-speaking, most are Orthodox. But there are Catholics and Protestants, Pagans and those who profess Islam and Judaism, and there are atheists,” Azov asserted.\n\nIt noted that the Azov regiment’s role is as “a special unit of the National Guard of Ukraine, and is subordinated exclusively to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief – the President of Ukraine, by the way, a Jew.”\n\n“It would be absurd to think that we are united by the idea of white racism or nazism,” the Azov statement added.\n\nDespite the Azov movement’s international notoriety, Ukraine “is not a cesspit for Nazi sympathizers,” according to Alexander Ritzmann, a senior adviser at the Counter Extremism Project (CEP), based in Berlin.\n\nHe noted that in the last elections in Ukraine in 2019, Azov’s political wing only won 2.15% of the vote, and Biletsky lost his seat in parliament.\n\nPlus – Ritzmann says – there are far-right actors prominent in Russia, too. “There is a far-right extremist problem on both sides in the conflict, but there seems to be a bias in only reporting on Ukraine’s far-right problem,” he said.\n\nAzov’s beginnings\n\nThe Azov Battalion was formed in 2014, the same year Russian-backed rebels began seizing territory across Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, and Russia invaded and captured Crimea. At the time, Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense encouraged volunteer battalions to join the resistance campaign and help its struggling army.\n\nThe battalion’s role in recapturing Mariupol in June 2014 from Russian-backed forces brought it “hero status” in Ukraine, said Ritzmann.\n\nBut that status came with baggage – the far-right views of some members and neo-Nazi insignia. These included the black sun, “a pagan symbol appropriated by Nazis for their pseudo-religion,” and the Wolfsangel, “a symbol that far-right extremists have also adopted,” Ritzmann said.\n\nAndriy Biletsky, the leader of the National Corps political party, reportedly said his goal was to \"lead the White races of the world in a final crusade.\" Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA/Getty Images\n\nAzov’s leaders have denied the neo-Nazi associations, saying the Wolfsangel “N” and “I’ mean “national idea.”\n\nEven though the Azov Battalion was co-founded by Biletsky, who previously led the radical right group Patriot of Ukraine, the group was armed by the state and partly funded by local oligarchs in eastern Ukraine. That funding included money from the Jewish tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky, Ritzmann said. The US State Department sanctioned Kolomoisky in March 2021. The previous year, the US Justice Department placed him under investigation on accusations of embezzlement and fraud. ​\n\nCNN has reached out to Kolomoisky’s lawyer for comment.\n\nIn 2016, the United National High Commissioner of Human Rights accused armed groups on both sides of the Donbas conflict, including Azov, of human rights abuses.\n\nInternational outreach\n\nWhen the Azov Battalion was brought under the command of the Ministry of Internal Affairs as a regiment in 2014, “politically motivated fighters like (Andriy) Biletsky left and founded the Azov movement so they can do their ultra-nationalist, far-right work, which they were not allowed to do in the Ukrainian military,” Ritzmann said.\n\nThe political party Biletsky formed, the National Corps, which the US Department of State described in 2018 as a nationalist hate group, “is essentially the spine of what we today call the Azov movement,” Kacper Rekawek, a research fellow with the Center for Research on Extremism (C-REX) at the University of Oslo, told CNN.\n\n“The Azov movement is a dangerous key player of the transnational extreme-right and has served as a network hub for several years now, with strong ties to far-right extremists in many European Union countries and the United States,” Ritzmann said.\n\nNationalist activists light flares and shout anti-Russian slogans during a demonstration in front of President Volodymyr Zelensky's offices in Kyiv on October 14, 2020. Sergei Supinsky/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOlena Semenyaka, the head of the National Corps’ international department, attended a festival in 2018 organized by German neo-Nazis; and in 2019 she spoke at the far-right Scanza Forum in Sweden alongside British neo-Nazi Mark Collett.\n\nSince forming in 2014, the ​Azov movement has grown to include a militia, summer camps for kids and paramilitary training centers. It runs activities, including music festivals, political events and mixed-martial-arts tournaments, as it promoted itself in the international far-right space.\n\nThe National Corps has repeatedly demonstrated its disdain for liberal values in its treatment of minority groups – with few repercussions.\n\nA 2018 US State Department report found that the movement’s militia “attacked and destroyed a Romani camp in Kyiv after its residents failed to respond to their ultimatum to leave the area within 24 hours,” in full view of the local police.\n\nThe ‘Death Star’\n\nWhile the far-right worldview of the Azov movement is clear, there has been an intense debate on whether the Azov Battalion should be classed a “foreign terrorist organization” by the US Department of State.\n\n“People always assume it (the Azov regiment and Azov movement) is one Death Star,” Rekawek said. “Year by year, the connections (between the regiment and the movement) are looser,” he said, explaining that the battalion’s ranks now include Ukrainians who have no affinity with its neo-Nazi past.\n\nRitzmann says the far-right element in Ukraine’s army is no different to what’s been detected in other militaries, such as in Germany and the US.\n\n“Presumably, far-right extremists serve in the Ukrainian military as they do in all other militaries – valid data regarding the exact numbers are not available,” he said.\n\n“Back in 2015, the Azov Regiment itself claimed to have between 10% and 20% far-right extremists in their ranks,” but those figures are possibly smaller today, he said.\n\nBut the regiment still uses the Wolfsangel symbol, and leaders of the Azov movement, who used to be commanders in the unit, continue to visit it, said Oleksiy Kuzmenko, a Ukrainian-American investigative journalist focusing on the Ukrainian far-right.\n\n“The current leader of the Azov Regiment, Denis ‘Redis’ Prokopenko, is part of the core of the Azov movement since 2014, and served under commanders who went on to lead the Azov movement political and street wings,” Kuzmenko told CNN.\n\nProkopenko’s deputy, Svyatoslav “Kalyna” Palamar, has explicitly praised the movement’s founder, Biletsky, as “a leader who ‘finds sponsors that really invest money’ into the regiment,” Kuzmenko said.\n\nIn this photo taken outside Kyiv on July 14, 2017, a student at a paramilitary camp for children calls the rank to attention. Efrem Lukatsky/AP\n\nKuzmenko points out that as of 2021, the regiment was “actively involved in the training of the movement’s youth leaders,” and its website has a link to the movement’s YouTube channel.\n\n“Ukraine and (the) West’s inaction on these issues paved the way for Putin to quite literally weaponize them against Ukraine in an attempt to justify his aggression,” Kuzmenko said.\n\n“While it’s correct to point (out that) Ukraine’s far-right has minimal electoral support, they (Azov) have enjoyed near impunity for violence aimed at minorities, were unchecked in their efforts to build influence in military and security forces, and have been normalized by Ukraine’s senior leaders,” he said.\n\nIn a statement to CNN on Wednesday, Prokopenko said: “Whoever calls us Nazis is deeply mistaken. We have young brave soldiers who give their lives for the independence of Ukraine and throw themselves under enemy tanks.”\n\nForeign fighters\n\nSince it formed, the Azov movement has recruited foreign fighters motivated by White supremacism to fight in Ukraine, experts say. Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country, and Zelensky’s call for foreign volunteers to join the fight, have raised concerns about radicalization in the war.\n\n“My concern is that people, especially far-right extremists in Europe, (will gain) combat experience and training in the Ukrainian theater and then use that for terrorist attacks in Europe proper,” Colin P. Clarke, senior research fellow at the New York- based ​foreign policy research nonprofit the Soufan Center, told CNN.\n\nValentyna Konstantynovska, aged 79, holds a weapon during basic combat training for civilians organized by the Azov regiment on February 13, 2022. Vadim Ghirda/AP\n\nIn 2020, Buzzfeed reported that Ukraine deported two members from the US-based neo-Nazi group the Atomwaffen Division, who were trying to gain combat experience with Azov.\n\nRekawek, an expert on foreign fighters at C-REX, said Azov has only been able to recruit 20 foreign fighters since the start of the 2022 invasion. CNN has not been able to verify those figures independently.\n\nFor its part, Russia also has a thriving ultra-nationalist scene that is tolerated by the authorities.\n\nThe Russian Imperial Movement (RIM), an extreme-right militia based in St. Petersburg, ​was, in 2020, the first White supremacist group to be categorized as “Specially Designated Global Terrorists” by the US State Department. While the RIM has worked in opposition to Putin’s regime, it has supported the Russian side in the war against Ukraine – training Russian militants to join pro-Russian separatists in the conflict, according to the Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC) at Stanford University.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin meets with French Front National party leader Marine Le Pen at the Kremlin in Moscow on March 24, 2017. MIKHAIL KLIMENTYEV/AFP via Getty Images\n\n“They have never confronted their own nationalists,” said Rekawek. ​Experts say Russia has also been a player in Europe’s far-right space, with France’s Marine Le Pen and Italy’s Matteo Salvini enjoying close links with Putin before the 2022 invasion.\n\nAnd of the “few hundred western individuals with extreme right-wing or ‘nationalist’ convictions” who traveled to fight in the Ukraine conflict around 2014, “most of those extremist volunteers fought on the side of the pro-Russian separatists,” according to a CEP report published in March.\n\nRitzmann has found pro-Russian groups calling for volunteers in his research. This includes “the Russian security contractor Wagner Group, which has a history of displaying Nazi insignia,” he said in the CEP report.\n\nBut amid the tide of millions of refugees and untold damage to Ukrainian cities, some experts say Russia’s fixation on a minor player like the Azov movement serves a purpose – allowing the Kremlin to frame the conflict as an ideological and even existential struggle. However remote from reality that may be.\n\nThis story has been updated to include a statement from the Azov regiment.", "authors": ["Tara John Tim Lister", "Tara John", "Tim Lister"], "publish_date": "2022/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/22/politics/dark-money-donation-conservative-group-invs/index.html", "title": "Massive dark money donation: New conservative group got $1.6 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA new group led by a prominent conservative lawyer has received $1.6 billion from one donor – the largest single contribution to a politically focused nonprofit that’s ever been made public, and a fortune that could be used to fuel right-wing interests.\n\nThe nonprofit, Marble Freedom Trust, received the contribution in the form of stock and then funneled more than $200 million to other conservative organizations last year, a tax form CNN obtained from the IRS shows.\n\nMarble Freedom is led by Leonard Leo, the co-chairman of the conservative Federalist Society, who advised former President Donald Trump on his Supreme Court picks and runs a sprawling network of other right-wing nonprofits that don’t disclose their donors, which are often referred to as dark money groups.\n\nA CNN review of financial documents connected the donation to Barre Seid, a low-profile, 90-year-old Chicago electronics company executive and philanthropist who has previously been tied to smaller anonymous contributions to other right-wing groups. The New York Times, which first reported the contribution on Monday, also identified Seid as the donor.\n\nThe massive donation instantly makes the Utah-based group one of the most well-funded organizations bankrolling conservative causes in the US – a staggering distinction for a group with zero public profile or even a website. In comparison, the single contribution is more than double the total amount raised by Trump’s presidential campaign committee during the entire 2020 election cycle.\n\nRobert Maguire, the research director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, called the donation “stupefying,” and “by far” the largest known contribution to a dark money political group.\n\n“I’ve never seen a group of this magnitude before,” Maguire said. “This is the kind of money that can help these political operatives and their allies start to move the needle on issues like reshaping the federal judiciary, making it more difficult to vote, a state-by-state campaign to remake election laws and lay the groundwork for undermining future elections.”\n\nLeo said in a statement that “it’s high time for the conservative movement to be among the ranks of George Soros, Hansjörg Wyss, Arabella Advisors and other left-wing philanthropists, going toe-to-toe in the fight to defend our Constitution and its ideals” – referring to two liberal-leaning billionaires and a consulting firm that manages several smaller dark money groups on the left.\n\nSeid did not respond to requests for comment left on phone numbers listed for him and his longtime assistant.\n\nHuge anonymous donation has ties to Chicago executive\n\n“Dark money” generally refers to nonprofits that get involved in politics but do not disclose their donors, a practice that significantly ramped up after the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision in 2010. Many dark money groups, like Marble Freedom, are 501(c)4 organizations – nonprofits that are allowed to participate in politics as long as it is not their primary activity.\n\nGroups on both sides of the political spectrum have increasingly turned to dark money in recent years to sway voters or push agendas without revealing their ultra-wealthy benefactors – but the Marble Freedom donation dramatically eclipses even the largest of the previously known groups.\n\nMarble Freedom’s tax return covers its initial year of existence between May 2020 and April 2021. The gift of just over $1.6 billion came in the form of 100% of the stock of a privately held company, which Marble Freedom then sold to another company, according to the tax form.\n\nThe arrangement likely saved Seid a large amount of money in taxes, according to Marcus Owens, an attorney and former director of the IRS division on tax-exempt organizations, who reviewed the form for CNN. If Seid had personally sold the stock in the company, he would likely have had to pay capital gains tax on the proceeds of the sale. By donating the stock to Marble Freedom, he avoided having to pay that tax, and the nonprofit would be exempt from paying it.\n\nMarble Freedom wrote that it was withholding information about which company was donated and who it sold to because “disclosing it would effectively disclose the identity of its donors.”\n\nBut details about the donation connect it to the sale of the Chicago-based electrical device firm Tripp Lite, whose longtime chairman was Seid.\n\nAfter receiving the donated stock, Marble Freedom sold the company on March 17, 2021, according to the tax form. The same day, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents, the American-Irish power company Eaton acquired Tripp Lite for $1.65 billion.\n\nDuring the sale, “the sole shareholder of Tripp Lite” was represented by New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, Law360 reported at the time. Less than two weeks later, Marble Freedom paid Sullivan & Cromwell $940,000 in legal fees, the tax form shows. A spokesperson for Eaton said the company would not provide more details about the acquisition, and several lawyers involved in the transaction did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSeid served as chairman and CEO and listed himself as the “owner” of Tripp Lite in federal campaign donation records from 2008. He worked at the company, which produces power strips, surge protectors and other devices, for more than 50 years, according to a Facebook post from Tripp Lite. He grew up in Chicago, the son of immigrants from Russia, according to Census records, and graduated from the University of Chicago.\n\nSeid has previously had a history of donating anonymously to conservative political groups and causes. An internal 2015 document from the Bradley Foundation, a right-wing nonprofit, stated that the conservative think tank Foundation for Government Accountability had received support from “Barre Seid (anonymously).” The document was part of a trove of records from Bradley that was hacked and released, and was later included as an exhibit in Senate testimony.\n\nIn addition, Salon reported in 2010 that “Barry Seid” was listed in tax documents as the identity of an anonymous donor who gave nearly $17 million to a group that produced an anti-Islam documentary and sent DVDs of the movie to millions of households during the 2008 election. An assistant for Seid told Salon that he did not contribute to the organization, although she didn’t address whether he made the donation by routing it through another group.\n\nAnd publicly released emails suggest that Seid may also be the anonymous donor who pledged $20 million over five years to George Mason University’s law school in order to rename it for former Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. The emails were obtained through a public records request and published by George Mason Law alum Allison Pienta in 2019. The school has refused to identify the donor but has said that Leo coordinated the gift.\n\nSeid and his wife make public donations through another nonprofit, the Barbara and Barre Seid Foundation, which mostly funds Chicago-based cultural organizations and universities but has given to conservative and libertarian groups such as the Cato Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Heartland Institute. Seid also donated to various political campaigns in Illinois and elsewhere in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nBig spending and opaque groups\n\nEven in its infancy, Marble Freedom Trust has already funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to other dark money groups.\n\nLeo, Marble Freedom’s chairman and trustee, is one of the most influential figures in the world of conservative dark money. A longtime executive at the Federalist Society, a national network of right-leaning lawyers, Leo has led or served on the board of more than a dozen different nonprofits. Several of his groups have been associated with political campaigns promoting conservative Supreme Court nominees, operating in complex networks of spending.\n\nThe new $1.6 billion donation “solidifies Leo as just an absolute gravitational force within the conservative political and legal world,” Maguire said. “He was already the man behind the scenes raising money for reshaping the American judiciary, and this amount of money just takes it to a stratospheric level.”\n\nOn the Marble Freedom tax form, Leo is listed as being paid a $350,000 annual salary for 25 hours a week of work for the group.\n\nThe form states that the group’s mission is to “maintain and expand human freedom consistent with the values and ideals set forth in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.” While politics can’t be its primary focus, it can use at least some of its huge resources to influence this year’s midterms or future elections.\n\n“This is such a significant amount that it would be a game-changer if they do decide to devote even a portion of that to election-related spending,” said Anna Massoglia, the Editorial and Investigations Manager at OpenSecrets, a group that researches campaign finance.\n\nMarble Freedom reported making four donations to other nonprofits – transactions that appear to have taken place between the sale of the stock in mid-March 2021 and the end of April 2021.\n\nThe largest contribution was a $153 million gift to the Rule of Law Trust, a dark money nonprofit led by Leo that has funded other conservative organizations. The group’s tax returns show it received just under $80 million in donations in 2018 and no contributions in 2019 or 2020, so the gift from Marble Freedom represents a massive funding boost for the organization.\n\nMarble Freedom contributed $41.1 million to Donors Trust, a nonprofit that distributes money to conservative and libertarian groups in addition to nonpolitical organizations. The group is a donor-advised fund, which means its contributors can recommend where their donations to the fund are sent.\n\nIn the past, Donors Trust has funneled millions of dollars to groups that have amplified false claims about election fraud and advocated for more restrictive voting rules. The group has previously said that its donations are intended to “serve the public good.”\n\nMarble Freedom also donated $16.5 million to The Concord Fund, a nonprofit that has advocated for conservative nominees to the Supreme Court and other judgeships and is associated with a group that has pushed restrictive voting laws. Concord, which was previously known as the Judicial Crisis Network, raised $20.4 million from July 2019 to June 2020, according to its most recent tax return.\n\nIn addition to the three groups with political connections, Marble Freedom gave $18 million to Schwab Charitable Fund, another donor-advised fund.\n\nMarble Freedom lists two other board members in addition to Leo, both of whom are unpaid. One is Tyler Green, the former solicitor general of Utah, who has represented the Republican National Committee and other GOP groups in multiple voting-related lawsuits in recent years. Green, who is listed as Marble Freedom’s administrative trustee, is also a former law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. The trust’s address is listed as a home in North Salt Lake, Utah, that Green owns.\n\nThe board’s third member is Jonathan Bunch, a former Federalist Society vice president who has been involved with various groups led by Leo. Bunch is listed as Marble Freedom’s successor trustee. Green and Bunch did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt the end of April 2021, Marble Freedom had more than $1.4 billion in assets – positioning it to play a major role in conservative causes potentially for years to come.\n\n“This group is emblematic of the corrosion and the breakdown of our campaign finance system,” Maguire said – and how it gives “wealthy donors, whether they be corporations or individuals, access and influence over the system far greater than any regular American can ever imagine.”", "authors": ["Casey Tolan Curt Devine Drew Griffin", "Casey Tolan", "Curt Devine", "Drew Griffin"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/06/15/tulsa-rally-trump-campaign-provide-face-masks-temperature-checks/3191388001/", "title": "Tulsa rally: Trump campaign to provide face masks, temperature ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Supporters who plan to attend President Donald Trump's election rally in Oklahoma this week will be given temperature checks, hand sanitizer and face masks before entering the venue as safety measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the Trump campaign said Monday.\n\nTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale announced the precautions in a tweet in what appeared to be the first steps the campaign has taken to address coronavirus concerns at the president's first rally in more than three months. Last week, the campaign attempted to shield itself from any virus-related lawsuits from people who might get sick at the rally by including a liability disclaimer on the sign-up page for free tickets to the event.\n\nParscale said more than 1 million people had requested free tickets for the event at the BOK Center in Tulsa, which holds around 19,000 people.\n\nThe president and his aides have made clear he will move forward with the rally Saturday despite warnings from city officials and new guidance from health professionals that large gatherings such as the rally pose a threat of spreading COVID-19.\n\nIn a Monday tweet, Trump pointed to the large crowds of demonstrators at protests over police brutality and the death of George Floyd, describing them as \"rioters and looters\" who did not practice health protection.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"The Far Left Fake News Media, which had no Covid problem with the Rioters & Looters destroying Democrat run cities, is trying to Covid Shame us on our big Rallies. Won’t work!\" he wrote.\n\nBruce Dart, director of the Tulsa City-County Health Department, told the Tulsa World newspaper last Saturday that he welcomes Trump's visit, \"but not during a pandemic.\"\n\n“I think it’s an honor for Tulsa to have a sitting president want to come and visit our community, but not during a pandemic,” Dart told the World. “I’m concerned about our ability to protect anyone who attends a large, indoor event, and I’m also concerned about our ability to ensure the president stays safe as well.”\n\nThe World itself ran an editorial asking Trump not to come, citing the city's struggle with the twin crises of the coronavirus pandemic and protests over police brutality and racial injustice.\n\n\"We don’t know why he chose Tulsa, but we can’t see any way that his visit will be good for the city. Tulsa is still dealing with the challenges created by a pandemic,\" the newspaper said.\n\nThe editorial also said it was \"the wrong place for the rally,\" pointing out the city marked the 99th anniversary of Tulsa race massacre in which a white mob ravaged a thriving African-American business community in the Greenwood District known as the \"Black Wall Street.\" An estimated 300 people were in one of the worst instances of racial violence in U.S. history.\n\nTulsa rally controversy: Trump says rally will be a 'celebration' of his campaign\n\n\"There’s no reason to think a Trump appearance in Tulsa will have any effect on November’s election outcome in Tulsa or Oklahoma. It has already concentrated the world’s attention of the fact that Trump will be rallying in a city that 99 years ago was the site of a bloody race massacre.\"\n\nTrump has never held a rally in Tulsa, and Oklahoma is a state he won by 36 percentage points in the 2016 election.\n\nIn a rare reversal last week, Trump abruptly moved the event, originally scheduled for Friday, June 19th, after critics suggested the campaign was being insensitive by holding it on the holiday known as Juneteenth, or the commemoration of the abolition of slavery in the U.S.\n\nThe president announced in a late Friday night tweet that the rally would take place on Saturday, June 20, instead of June 19, \"out of respect for this Holiday, and in observance of the important occasion and all that it represents.\"\n\nThough the campaign initially suggested the decision to hold the rally on Juneteenth was intentional, Trump told Fox News on Friday that it was not deliberate and said it instead would be a \"celebration\" of his campaign rallies.\n\nMore: Trump stirs anger with plans for Juneteenth rally in Tulsa, site of huge massacre of African Americans\n\nThe rally safety precautions also come after the Centers for Disease Control issued new guidelines on Friday, characterizing \"large in-gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area\" in the \"highest risk\" category.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, expressed concern for people attending both Trump's rally and the police brutality protests still smoldering across the country. He hold ABC's Jonathan Karl attending such large-scale events is \"risky\" and a \"danger\" to both those holding and attending the event.\n\n\"When you start to chant and shout, even though the instinct is to pull the mask down, which you see, don't do that because there is a risk there and it's a real risk,\" he said.\n\nLast week Parscale suggested he was considering adding a second event to address the number of requests for tickets for the rally, but no events have been added. The online sign-up page to request free tickets for the Tulsa rally includes a liability waiver, saying the campaign or other parties associated with the event cannot be held liable for exposure to coronavirus.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/07/trump-vulnerable-he-faces-lawsuits-without-presidential-immunity/6056288002/", "title": "Trump lawsuits: Taxes, fraud to face without 'presidential immunity'", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has long been the subject and instigator of lawsuits, both before his presidency and while he has been in the White House. That will not change after he leaves.\n\nA number of lawsuits and investigations awaits Trump once he returns to private life. Some could stain his family's reputation. Some could affect his business. And some could damage him personally as the protection provided by the presidency goes away.\n\nTrump lost to President-elect Joe Biden after a contentious and prolonged race to win the White House. As of Saturday afternoon, Biden had 290 electoral votes, more than the 270 needed to secure the election after flipping several battleground states that Trump won in 2016. In the popular vote, Biden had 74,857,880 votes to Trump's 70,598,535.\n\n\"The short answer is that once he leaves the office, his cloak of immunity, actual or implied by (Justice Department guidelines), will disappear,\" said David Weinstein, a former Florida federal prosecutor.\n\nThe Justice Department has a long-standing policy that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted for criminal offenses. Former special counsel Robert Mueller cited the policy when investigators elected not to make a determination on whether Trump obstructed justice during the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nBut that immunity is for actions he took while in office, and \"it stops there,\" Weinstein said.\n\nThe most significant threats against Trump once he leaves office are brewing in his hometown, New York City.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has been conducting a criminal investigation into Trump and his company's business dealings. New York Attorney General Letitia James is investigating whether Trump and his company committed tax fraud.\n\n\"He’s very vulnerable to prosecution,\" said Jimmy Gurule, a former Justice Department official in the George H.W. Bush administration, referring to Vance's investigation, which is seeking Trump's tax returns and other financial documents. \"I think the threat is very real and very substantial.\"\n\nAside from the threat of prosecution and the unearthing of tax returns he has long kept private, Trump is facing a litany of other lawsuits that could put his family in an unflattering spotlight and force him to provide DNA evidence to the attorneys of a woman who accused him of rape.\n\nHe could also be compelled to testify under oath. During his presidency, his attorneys have repeatedly invoked immunity and executive privilege to keep Trump from having to testify, but neither protections will exist once he returns to private life.\n\nHere's what you need to know about some of the investigations and lawsuits that will follow Trump after he leaves the White House:\n\nThe Manhattan criminal inquiry\n\nVance's office is investigating alleged hush-money payments made during the 2016 campaign to two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump before he became president. Manhattan prosecutors are also looking into possible criminal activity within the Trump Organization.\n\nProsecutors are seeking eight years of Trump's taxes and other financial documents as part of the grand jury investigation. Trump, who has called the investigation a \"political prosecution,\" sued to shield his tax records, instigating a protracted legal battle that has reached the Supreme Court.\n\nBattle over tax returns:Supreme Court says President Trump cannot keep tax, financial records from prosecutors\n\nThe Supreme Court, in a 7-2 landmark ruling, has rejected claims by Trump's attorneys that he is absolutely immune from criminal investigations while president.\n\n\"Two hundred years ago, a great jurist of our Court established that no citizen, not even the President, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. \"We reaffirm that principle today and hold that the President is neither absolutely immune from state criminal subpoenas.\"\n\nThe court sent the case back to the lower court to resolve other legal issues. And last month, a federal appeals court, again, ruled that Trump must disclose his financial documents to Vance's office, rejecting his lawyers' additional claims that the subpoenas were too broad and were issued to harass him.\n\nTrump, again, appealed to the Supreme Court, which has not yet decided whether to hear the case a second time.\n\nThe New York attorney general's fraud investigation\n\nJames' office is investigating whether the Trump Organization improperly inflated the value of its assets in financial statements to secure loans and get tax benefits. The investigation began in 2019 after Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, told Congress that the president had lied about his assets.\n\nJames took legal action last summer to force members of the Trump Organization, including Eric Trump, the president's middle son who runs the company, to testify and produce documents.\n\nIn September, a New York state judge ordered the Trump Organization to turn over documents to James' office, including financial records related to a property in Westchester County, New York.\n\nEric Trump has sought to postpone an interview with prosecutors until after the election, citing his desire to campaign for his father. But a judge ordered him to appear for an interview under oath, which he did in October. Details of his testimony were not made public.\n\nJames, a Democrat, has been a vocal critic of Trump and ran for state attorney general on a promise to investigate him, his family and his company.\n\nTrump's defamation lawsuits\n\nTrump is facing two defamation lawsuits brought by women who accused him of sexually assaulting them and then disparaging them as he denied the allegations. In both cases, Trump has argued – unsuccessfully – that the presidency shields him from litigation.\n\nFormer Elle magazine writer E. Jean Carroll accused Trump of raping her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in New York City in the mid-1990s. She sued him for defamation in 2019, after Trump accused her of lying to boost the sale of her memoir in which she described the incident. Carroll is also seeking DNA evidence to see if Trump's genetic material is on a dress she said she wore during the alleged rape.\n\nThe Justice Department in September sought to represent Trump in the case, arguing that the president was acting in his official duties when he denied Carroll's allegations.\n\nE. Jean Carroll defamation case:Justice Department can't represent President Trump in E. Jean Carroll defamation case, judge rules\n\nThe intervention was seen as an effort to shield the president from the potentially damaging legal action in the midst of a reelection campaign. A federal judge blocked the Justice Department from intervening, ruling that his comments about Carroll \"have no relationship to the official business of the United States.\"\n\nFormer \"Apprentice\" contestant Summer Zervos filed a similar lawsuit in New York state court. Zervos said Trump forced himself on her a decade earlier by kissing and groping on multiple occasions.\n\nShe went public with the allegations in 2016, when Trump was running for president. Trump later said the incidents never happened and called Zervos a liar. Zervos sued for defamation in 2017.\n\nSummer Zervos defamation case:Former 'Apprentice' contestant battles Trump in defamation lawsuit hearing\n\nIn 2019, the court rejected Trump's attorneys arguments that he's constitutionally immune from state lawsuits while in office. The court, though, put its ruling on hold while Trump appeals to New York's state court. The move postponed a possible deposition of Trump.\n\nThe New York appeals court has yet to hold a hearing on the case.\n\nTrump family dispute\n\nMary Trump, the president's niece, has accused him and his siblings of cheating her out of millions of dollars in inheritance while squeezing them out of the family business.\n\n\"Fraud was not just the family business – it was a way of life,\" according to a lawsuit filed in September in New York state court.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that Trump, his brother Robert, and sister, former federal judge Maryanne Trump Barry, portrayed themselves as Mary Trump's protectors while secretly taking her share of minority interests in the family's extensive real estate holdings. Robert Trump died in August.\n\nMary Trump sues uncle:After tell-all book, Mary Trump sues President Trump and his siblings, claims they cheated her of millions\n\nThe lawsuit came after Mary Trump, daughter of Trump's older brother, Freddy, published a memoir portraying a dysfunctional family preoccupied with petty grievances, backstabbing and money.\n\nAlleged misuse of nonprofit funds, Trump hotel\n\nA lawsuit by Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine accuses Trump's inaugural committee and two other entities Trump owns of misusing the committee's money to enrich the president.\n\nRacine's offices alleges that the committee, a nonprofit organization, contracted with the Trump family to grossly overpay for event space in Trump's hotel in Washington, D.C.\n\nFor example, the committee paid more than $1 million for event space and food over four days at the hotel, which Racine's office said was above market value and the hotel's own pricing.\n\nAllegations of misusing funds:DC attorney general sues Trump inaugural committee, businesses over $1 million spent at Trump hotel\n\n\"District law requires nonprofits to use their funds for their stated public purpose, not to benefit private individuals or companies,\" Racine said in a statement early this year. \"In this case, we are seeking to recover the nonprofit funds that were improperly funneled directly to the Trump family business.\"\n\nThe Trump International Hotel said that Racine's claims were false and misleading and that the rates charged to the committee were not inflated.\n\nSuit over Michael Cohen's legal bills\n\nCohen, Trump's longtime personal attorney, has claimed Trump and his company had agreed to pay for his legal bills as he became a focus of investigations by New York City prosecutors and the Russia special counsel's office during the first half of Trump's presidency.\n\nBut Cohen said the Trump Organization abruptly stopped paying after he turned on the president and began telling friends and family he would cooperate with prosecutors. His legal bills totaled nearly $2 million.\n\nCohen turns on Trump:Michael Cohen sues Trump Organization for legal fees incurred after turning on Trump\n\nCohen is one of half a dozen former Trump aides and associates who were indicted as a result of Mueller's Russia investigation. He pleaded guilty to several crimes, including lying to Congress and violating campaign finance rules for orchestrating hush-money payments to two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump.\n\nOnce Trump's self-described fixer tasked with keeping his boss' darkest secrets, Cohen is now a vocal critic of the president. Trump, he told lawmakers during a testimony last year, is a \"racist,\" a \"con man\" and a \"cheat.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/10/meet-evangelicals-prophesied-trump-win/93575144/", "title": "Meet the evangelicals who prophesied a Trump win", "text": "Josh Hafner\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nTuesday morning, as every major election model predicted a defeat for Donald Trump, a South Carolina minister named Rick Joyner wrote on Facebook that he foresaw a different outcome.\n\n“This is the poll that counts,” Joyner wrote of the election, “and all of the signs point to a strong Trump victory tonight.”\n\nHe continued: “If you don’t think the polls reveal that, you’re right.”\n\nMany evangelicals view Joyner, the founder of MorningStar Ministries in Fort Mills, as a prophetic voice who describes hearing and seeing divine revelations from God, often on current events. More than 200,000 follow Joyner’s Facebook page, where he frequently posts about U.S. politics.

A video, dated Oct. 14, shows Jorge Parrott, Morningstar’s missions director, prophesying directly to Trump that he would become president.\n\n“President Trump,” Parrott begins, speaking to Trump from across a room. On the video’s date, the New York Time’s forecast model showed Trump with an 11% chance of winning the presidency. The Access Hollywood tape of him making vulgar and sexual comments about women had leaked days earlier.\n\n“I saw the other day that you will be, after you’re elected president, you’ll have an opportunity to sign a treaty with Israel,” Parrott says, “which will get a lot of resistance all around the world but it’s going to go through and it’s going to be a tremendous spiritual and financial blessing to America and to Israel.”\n\nIn the video, Trump hunches forward as he listens.\n\nLance Wallnau, a Dallas-based business consultant, has been speaking and prophesying about Trump for over a year in videos to his Facebook page, which features 200,000-plus followers. He also heavily promotes his book released in September that describes “Donald Trump being God’s Chaos candidate.”\n\n“I heard the Lord say: ‘Donald Trump is a wrecking ball to the spirit of political correctness,’” Wallnau wrote in an Oct. 5 Charisma News article titled “Why I Believe Donald Trump Is the Prophesied President.”\n\nIn an Oct. 9 video, he called the surfacing of Trump’s Access Hollywood tape “the devil strategically exposing information in order to destroy a candidate.”\n\nThe video, titled “Prophetic Word on Donald Trump,” received over 3.7 million views.\n\nLast week, Trump attended a Sunday morning service at the International Church of Las Vegas in Nevada. There, with Trump on stage and musicians playing softly in the background, church pastors prayed and spoke over Trump.\n\n“The Lord is saying I’m your father and I have prepared you for such a time as this,” said Denise Goulet, an associate pastor, as Charisma reported. “You have been grown and prepared for this kind of battle.”\n\nThe audience applauded. Musicians played softly in the background. Trump stood with his hands folded before him, swaying slightly.\n\n“Yes, you are bold,” Goulet says. “And this comes from the Lord. This comes from God.”\n\nWallnau, the Dallas consultant, later spoke about the prophecies Trump received in Las Vegas in his own post.\n\n“He doesn’t even have enough sense to shield himself from charismatics prophesying over him,” Wallnau said. “I guarantee [Mike] Huckabee and [Ted] Cruz would never let you get them on a platform prophesying over them five days before the election. They know better.\n\n“Trump is like a child when it comes to the kingdom.

Yet the core issues at stake – media freedoms in the digital age and the global limits of the U.S. justice system – have been obscured by Assange's personal life, by the refuge he sought in Ecuador's London embassy and by curious claims about his behavior not that well supported.\n\nAssange extradition:Hearing opens with claims of Trump retribution against media\n\nSince May, the Australian national, 48, has been locked up at Belmarsh Prison, a facility that houses some of Britain's most dangerous lawbreakers.\n\nAssange is there because he was found guilty of skipping bail in 2012; he fled to Ecuador's embassy rather than turn himself in to British authorities for possible extradition to Sweden.

The Swedish case has since been dropped. In Britain, he was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison for jumping bail, a period he has already served. He has been denied bail for his extradition hearing because he is considered a flight risk.\n\nBut there's more at stake than one anti-secrecy advocate's freedom.\n\nShocking detail\n\nJohn Kiriakou, a former CIA analyst who blew the whistle on a U.S. government-sanctioned torture program in 2007 that was approved by President George W. Bush because of the feared threats posed by the al-Qaeda terrorist organization, said that Assange's U.S. case could set a precedent that would erode press freedoms for news organizations that publish classified information.\n\n\"If you are able to prosecute someone who has a strong case to be called a publisher, then who's next?\" said Kiriakou, who served jail time after pleading guilty to leaking the name of an officer involved in waterboarding.\n\nAssange describes himself as a political refugee.\n\nHe maintains that as a journalist he should be immune from prosecution and that his work revealed embarrassing and highly damaging facts about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the detainees held at the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nAssange's detractors say he doesn't write stories or interview anyone or provide sufficient explanatory context and that the dissemination of raw, unfiltered documents and data – the publication of stolen classified materials – should not count as journalism.\n\n\"WikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service,\" then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo, now the U.S. secretary of State, said in April 2017, in his first public speech as head of the spy agency. \"Assange and his ilk,\" Pompeo said, seek \"personal self-aggrandizement through the destruction of Western values.\"\n\nIn fact, Department of Justice officials in President Barack Obama's administration ultimately decided they could not prosecute Assange for revealing national security secrets, described as one of the largest compromises of classified information in U.S. history, because it risked criminalizing subsequent national security journalism.\n\n\"During the Obama administration it was called 'the New York Times problem,' \" after the newspaper's distinguished record of publishing information on national security matters the U.S. government has deemed secret, said Stephen Rohde, a historian and constitutional law expert, and a past chair of the Southern California branch of the American Civil Liberties Union. \"In other words, how can we indict him for espionage when we're confident he's a journalist, a publisher and enjoys First Amendment rights.\"\n\nGenerally speaking, the First Amendment, as it applies to the press, restrains the government from jailing, fining or imposing liability for what the press publishes.\n\nIt does not shield journalists from criminal liability.\n\nOn the opening day of Assange's extradition hearing, James Lewis, a British lawyer representing the U.S. government, said Assange was guilty of \"straightforward\" criminality for hacking and then publishing secret military and intelligence information that put secret U.S. sources at risk of torture or death in places from Iraq to China.\n\nThe information Assange published contained about 90,000 Afghanistan War-related \"significant activity\" reports, 400,000 Iraq War-related reports, 800 Guantanamo Bay \"detainee assessment\" briefs and 250,000 U.S. State Department cables.\n\nIf nothing else, this material illuminated in shocking detail U.S. military and diplomatic procedure and actions in far-flung places, and the light it shined was not flattering.\n\nWikiLeaks' Julian Assange:Journalist or criminal hacker?\n\nTo his supporters, Assange is a champion of free speech and the public interest whose exceptional computer skills helped him reveal, among other things, video footage allegedly showing U.S. air crews in Apache helicopters killing a dozen civilians in Iraq.\n\nThe dead included two Iraqis working for the Reuters news agency.\n\n\"Assange published evidence of war crimes by the U.S. government,\" said Andrew Wilkie, a left-leaning Australian politician who traveled to Britain in February with fellow Australian lawmaker George Christensen in a show of bipartisan support for Assange. Christensen represents Australia's right-of-center Liberal National Party.\n\n\"I'm a big fan of the Trump administration but I'm a bigger fan of free speech,\" said Christensen.\n\n\"Assange did the right thing,\" added Wilkie. \"He served the public interest.\"\n\nStill, the U.S. government alleges that Assange is a criminal who conspired with Manning to steal thousands of pages of national defense information that has risked the lives of U.S. forces, allies and collaborators from translators to political dissidents with whom it partners to fight repressive regimes.\n\n\"No responsible actor – journalist or otherwise – would purposely publish the names of individuals he or she knew to be confidential human sources in war zones, exposing them to the gravest of dangers,\" U.S. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers said when the indictment was announced in May 2019.\n\nManning served seven years in prison, including pre-trial custody, before Obama commuted her 35-year prison sentence. She is now back in jail for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks. Manning, who was convicted of theft and espionage, says she acted on principle when she handed over the top-secret information to WikiLeaks.\n\nIf Assange is sent to the U.S. to stand trial, he could get a life sentence – 175 years – if a federal court finds him guilty on all 18 charges and the maximum penalty is imposed.\n\nA Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment on whether there is any evidence that the WikiLeaks disclosures have directly led to injuries or deaths.\n\nTo date, no evidence of deaths or injuries precipitated by WikiLeaks' disclosures has emerged and Lewis, the lawyer representing the U.S. government in Assange's extradition hearing, said that while Washington believes that many of its informants who were outed by WikiLeaks later \"disappeared\" it can't yet prove the assertion.\n\nJulian Assange:WikiLeaks founder claims ‘spying’ in fight over extradition\n\nSelf-imposed isolation?\n\nEcuador insists it kicked Assange out of its embassy after he became an intolerable nuisance at its building in one of London's most upmarket neighborhoods.\n\nWhile living there, Assange occupied about a third of the embassy's rooms with his cat. He brought in a sun lamp, treadmill, stacks of books, computer equipment and insisted on his own fridge. He also regularly hosted well-known guests such as the musician Lady Gaga and the actor Pamela Anderson. He addressed admirers and gave news conferences from the embassy's tiny balcony – often, as unsuspecting tourists passed by and expensive cars belonging to Harrods' wealthy patrons idled across the street. Due to space constraints, embassy staff had to share a conference room with Assange. One senior diplomat even shared an office with him.\n\nMost people have suffered through a houseguest from hell.\n\nOver time, Ecuador says, that's exactly what Assange became, even allegedly going to the unhygienic length of smearing his own excrement on a bathroom wall. The allegations were first made public in an interview in April 2019 with Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno, who also accused Assange of not looking after his cat and attacking the embassy's security staff. No evidence was released to back up the allegations.\n\nAssange's supporters and legal team strongly deny the claims, which have not been verified. Ecuadorean officials told USA TODAY that some evidence of Assange's misbehavior in the embassy can be found online, such as a YouTube video that shows him standing on a skateboard. Ecuador says it has not released additional evidence because of possible legal retribution from Assange.\n\nThe situation is complicated by the fact that Ecuador started to reexamine its relationship with Assange around the time Moreno took office in 2017. Moreno sought to improve relations with its largest trading partner: the U.S.\n\nIn fact, shortly after Assange was expelled from the embassy, President Donald Trump's administration said it was opening a \"new chapter of cooperation\" with the South American nation that included economic development and natural disasters help.\n\nAnd, cosmetically at least, Assange's expulsion from the Ecuadorean embassy does appear to mark a sea change in U.S.-Ecuador relations that was foreshadowed on Oct. 16, 2018, when the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs wrote a letter to Moreno offering to \"advance crucial matters\" and \"warmer relations\" with Washington if Ecuador \"handed over Assange to the proper authorities.\"\n\nIn February, Moreno became the first chief of state from Ecuador to visit an American president in 17 years. Moreno's predecessor, Rafael Correa, who granted Assange asylum and even Ecuadorean citizenship before it was revoked by Moreno, embraced Iran, closed a U.S. military base, expelled the U.S.'s ambassador and generally railed against what he described as belligerent American imperialism and capitalism.\n\nVegan meal:Pamela Anderson’s present for Julian Assange\n\nWhen USA TODAY visited Ecuador's London embassy in mid-February, some modest refurbishments and redecorations were underway. Officials pointed to the bathroom where they allege Assange spread feces on the wall and also showed off the hotel-style kitchenette where he prepared his meals. But citing legal action in Ecuador and Spain on Assange's behalf, over claims that a security company was contracted by Ecuador's government to spy on Assange while he lived in the embassy, these officials would not reveal further details about what led to Assange's departure. Assange has also tried to sue Ecuador's government for \"violating his fundamental rights,\" by claiming it limited his contact with the outside world while he was holed up there.\n\nEcuador disputes all the allegations and insists it has done nothing wrong.\n\nBritish press reported that his cat, who went by various names including \"Embassy Cat,\" \"Meowchael Moore,\" after the American documentary filmmaker, and \"James,\" was given to a shelter when Assange was forced out of the embassy by British police.\n\nThe YouTube video footage Ecuador cited as evidence for Assange's poor houseguest manners was uploaded to the video-sharing platform in April 2019. It shows a pale and barefooted Assange attempting to stand on a skateboard in a room in the embassy.\n\nHe repeatedly stumbles.\n\nA First Amendment brawl\n\nAssange has been indicted in the U.S. under the Espionage Act of 1917.\n\nAccording to Rohde, the historian and law expert, before Obama took office the 102-year-old act was used just four times against government officials for providing classified information to the media. The Obama administration used it eight times, including against Manning and Edward Snowden, a National Security Agency contractor who leaked information about U.S. telecoms surveillance programs to the press.\n\nSnowden is currently receiving asylum in Russia.\n\nTrump has prosecuted eight government employees for leaking information to the media, according to U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, a press freedom advocacy organization. His administration's use of the act against Assange breaks new legal ground because it is the first time it's been deployed to target a media organization as opposed to a government whistleblower.\n\nYet while the First Amendment protects the publication of truthful information, it does so only if this information is acquired legally.\n\nThe Department of Justice alleges that Assange explicitly solicited – encouraged – Manning to break the law by helping her crack a password that gave her higher-level access to classified computer networks.\n\nManning disputes the allegation.\n\nAs does WikiLeaks.\n\nThe Department of Justice's prosecutors are expected to reveal \"forensic\" digital evidence for this allegation when evidence in Assange's extradition hearing is heard in May. Assange's defense team says it, too, has evidence that refutes the allegation.\n\nAccording to a report in the Associated Press from April 2019 the genesis of the Trump administration's dialing up of the rhetoric on Assange can be traced to WikiLeaks' release, in 2017, of thousands of pages of documents revealing details about CIA cyber-espionage tools for breaking into targeted computers, cellphones and consumer electronics. However, there is an alternative explanation for Trump's interest in a case that Rohde said that if successfully prosecuted would have a \"chilling effect\" on First Amendment protections for the press: Trump's disdain for the media.\n\n\"Assange is low-hanging fruit to Trump,\" said Rohde. \"They can go through the whole process, and win or lose, the process will keep the ball in the air and reinforce that he's prosecuting leakers and the media.\"\n\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, agreed with this assessment.\n\nTrump \"probably believes he can profit politically from pursuing Assange,\" he said.\n\nWhile the U.S. indictment against Assange does not relate to WikiLeaks' 2016 publication of hacked emails belonging to Clinton's presidential campaign, at a preliminary hearing for Assange's extradition case in late February, Edward Fitzgerald, one of his lawyers, nevertheless said there is evidence that Trump, viathen-Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, offered him a pardon if he agreed to say Russia was not involved in leaking the emails. The White House and Rohrabacher deny a pardon was offered.\n\nAs the extradition hearing got underway, Fitzgerald told a British judge the U.S. indictments against Assange were part of the Trump administration's determination to put a journalist's \"head on a pike\" – part of its war on the press.\n\nWikiLeaks intrigue:Trump offered Assange a pardon if he cleared Russia, lawyer says\n\nIf Assange is extradited to the U.S., he will be tried in the same court – the Eastern District of Virginia – as Kiriakou, the CIA analyst, who was also charged under the Espionage Act, but took a lesser plea under the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.\n\n\"It's known as the 'espionage court,'\" said Kiriakou, adding that \"Assange doesn't stand a chance\" in that federal district court because the jury pool tilts toward individuals who are members of the U.S. intelligence community and their families.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department chose not to comment on whether the Eastern District of Virginia would offer an impartial setting for jury selection in any Assange trial. The White House and U.S. State Department chose not to comment on whether the administration was concerned about the impact of Assange's case on the First Amendment.\n\nLewis, who represents the U.S. government in Assange's extradition hearing, has repeatedly reiterated Washington's position that journalism is not an excuse for breaking the law and that the court proceedings in Britain will prove that he did so.\n\nIn a briefing with reporters ahead of Assange's hearing, Kristin Hrafnsson, WikiLeaks' editor-in-chief, described the indictment against Assange as \"propaganda.\"\n\nAnd Jennifer Robinson, a member of Assange's legal team, said he did \"what all journalists, all honorable ones,\" do every day: take receipt of information, communicate about how to protect the source of that information (Manning), and publish it.\n\n\"What signal does it send to countries like Russia, China\" and other authoritarian governments around the world if this extradition goes ahead, she asked.\n\n'If the law is respected'\n\nStill, it's far from certain that Assange will lose his extradition case. And even if he does, it does not automatically follow he will be sent to the U.S., according to Anand Doobay, an expert in the rules governing extradition at London-based firm Boutique Law.\n\nDoobay said if the judge decides \"not to refuse\" the U.S. request then Britain's secretary of state will have to decide whether to order it, a call that involves scrutiny of factors such as whether there is a risk that by extraditing him Assange could face the death penalty. British law forbids extradition under such circumstances.\n\nWhile none of the current charges carry the death penalty, Assange's supporters have argued that the Trump administration can't be trusted and could decide to unveil additional charges that do carry a death sentence once Assange arrives on U.S. soil.\n\n'Angst, anger':Roger Stone intervention stokes uncertainty across justice system\n\nDoobay noted that most extradition requests the U.S. makes to the U.K. are granted. It's not clear what will happen if Assange prevails in the British court. Because he has already served the 50 weeks for skipping bail he could simply be free to go. But if he is deported to his native Australia, the U.S. could try to mount a new extradition case. It could also issue an international arrest warrant if he travels beyond Britain's borders.\n\nAssange's health will also be considered and Nils Melzer, the United Nations' special rapporteur on torture, said in an interview that when he visited Assange in Belmarsh Prison in May last year he was displaying symptoms akin to \"psychological torture\" likely caused by prolonged exposure to extreme stress, chronic anxiety and isolation.\n\n\"He was very agitated,\" he said. \"Not the normal stress you would see in a prisoner.\"\n\nIn a series of preliminary hearings Assange has attended in person and by video link from prison he has sometimes appeared frail and confused when questioned by the judge. He has also lost weight. However, appearing in court for the extradition hearing in late February he mostly looked relaxed and appeared able to follow along with the proceedings. Although he complained several times that he was struggling to hear the legal arguments being made by both sides because of being forced to sit behind a high glass barrier in the courtroom, a scenario he said that has also prevented him from giving \"confidential instructions\" to his lawyers.\n\n\"I'm as much a participant in the court as a spectator at Wimbledon,\" he told the court at one point, referring to the British tennis tournament. \"This case already has enough spying on my lawyers as it is,\" he added, an apparent reference to his claims that he was surveilled during his time in Ecuador's embassy.\n\nAssange's legal team asked the judge, Vanessa Baraitser, to consider whether he can sit in the well of court, next to them, when evidence in the case is heard in May.\n\nShe said she saw no reason to change the seating arrangement.\n\nWikiLeaks' Hrafnsson said Assange's health has been improving but his father, John Shipton, told reporters ahead of the hearing that his son's long confinement has damaged his health and he feared any U.S. extradition would be akin to a \"death sentence.\"\n\n\"His situation is dire, he has had nine years of ceaseless psychological torture where false accusations are constantly being made,\" said Shipton.\n\nRecently, more than 60 doctors wrote an open letter to Britain's secretary of state saying they fear Assange's health is so bad he could die inside Belmarsh Prison, while 130 prominent figures from the worlds of art, politics and the media in Germany urged authorities to release Assange from detention because of his \"critical health.\"\n\n\"If the law is respected, then I don't see any way for him to be lawfully extradited to the U.S.,\" said Melzer, the U.N.'s envoy on torture, noting that there is a \"political offenses exclusion\" in Britain's extradition treaty with the U.S. and that \"espionage really is the quintessential political offense.\"\n\nMelzer added that while governments often prosecute leakers and whistleblowers, government employees who actually implement official policy that involves the perpetration of crimes, such as systematic torture, generally enjoy complete impunity.\n\nInstead, he said, with Assange, \"we're sanctioning\" those that disclose this information.\n\n\"That can't be right,\" he added.\n\nAt the hearing, the prosecution has argued that Assange should not be able to rely on the \"political offenses\" exemption in Britain's extradition treaty with the U.S. partly because in publishing the information he did Assange was not expressly trying to overthrow or a cause a change in the U.S. government or its foreign policy.\n\nFitzgerald, for the defense, described this argument as \"absurd.\"\n\n\"What other reason would Mr. Assange have for publishing this information if it wasn't to cause a change in U.S. policy\" in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, he said.\n\nSteve Bannon testifies:Trump saw Roger Stone as 'access point' to WikiLeaks\n\nMelzer, who is an academic and a lawyer, also expressed concern over the allegations of rape and sexual assault made against Assange that date from 2010. Sweden's authorities ended their investigations without charging Assange in November due to what they characterized as weakened evidence. Melzer said the police reports are riddled with contradictions and possibly even exculpatory evidence, such as text messages that indicate one of the claimants didn't want to accuse Assange of anything and that it was the police who \"made up the charges.\" This claimant was only concerned about getting Assange to take an HIV test because they had unprotected sex.\n\nMelzer said he has written multiple letters to the Swedish authorities asking for clarifications over inconsistencies in internal police correspondence but the response from the Swedish government has been: \"We have no further observations.\"\n\nIn one letter Melzer wrote to Sweden's minister of foreign affairs in May last year he says Assange has effectively been \"publicly shamed\" and \"defamed.\"\n\nThe Swedish Prosecution Authority said in a statement to USA TODAY that its case against Assange is closed and it does not want to comment on Melzer's allegations.\n\nThe Swedish allegations may appear tangential to Assange's case, but they are in fact a central plank in the circumstances that have directly led to his current plight: It's unlikely Assange would have fled to the embassy without Sweden's original claims.\n\nAssange 'told the truth'\n\nGeoffrey Robertson, a human rights lawyer who previously represented Assange – Robinson, from Assange's defense team, works in the firm he founded, Doughty Street Chambers – said that there was \"no doubt\" that the Trump administration was prepared to pursue Assange \"to the ends of the Earth\" because it is \"determined to create precedents that will shackle investigative journalism\" and prevent it from airing the U.S.'s secrets.\n\n\"This is about deterrence,\" he said.\n\nStill, Robertson added that \"America is a beacon of free speech\" and the First Amendment is a \"phenomenal example to the world\" at a time when all over the planet autocratic governments are trying to jail journalists or \"shut them up.\"\n\nIt would be a shame, he said, if the U.S. \"abandons its principles when we need them.\"\n\nRobertson, who like Assange was born in Australia, has won landmark rulings on civil liberties from the highest courts in Britain, Europe and elsewhere. He has been a United Nations war crimes judge and defended scores of people facing death sentences.\n\n\"What the U.S. wants to do with Julian Assange – let him die in jail, essentially – is completely disproportionate to what he has done: told the truth. And no one has disputed that what Julian Assange did was anything but tell the truth,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/13/us/patriot-front-beliefs-history-explainer/index.html", "title": "Patriot Front: What to know about the White supremacist group | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen “a little army” of men with shields and other riot gear was spotted near a Pride parade in Idaho on Saturday, authorities soon linked the men to a relatively new White nationalist group and charged them with conspiracy to riot.\n\n“It is clear to us based on the gear that the individuals had with them, the stuff they had in their possession, the U-Haul with them along with paperwork that was seized from them, that they came to riot downtown,” Coeur d’Alene Police Chief Lee White said.\n\nAmong those arrested was Thomas Ryan Rousseau – the leader of Patriot Front, the sheriff’s office said. In total, 31 people from at least 12 states were arrested and charged with conspiracy to riot. All have been released on bond.\n\nMost of the men arrested had logos on their hats “consistent with the Patriot Front group,” and some had other clothing associated with the White supremacist group, White said.\n\nHere’s what we know about Patriot Front – and what makes it different from other groups:\n\nHow did Patriot Front start?\n\nPatriot Front “is a white nationalist hate group that formed in the aftermath of the deadly ‘Unite the Right’ rally in Charlottesville, Virginia,” the Southern Poverty Law Center said.\n\n“The organization broke off from Vanguard America (VA), a neo-Nazi group that participated in the chaotic demonstration,” the SPLC said.\n\nThe rally turned deadly with the killing of anti-racism demonostrator Heather Heyer. Later that month, Rousseau – who led Vanguard America members at “Unite the Right” – rebranded the group’s website and launched a new group called Patriot Front, the Anti-Defamation League said.\n\nWhat do Patriot Front members believe?\n\n“Patriot Front is a white supremacist group whose members maintain that their ancestors conquered America and bequeathed it to them, and no one else,” the ADL said.\n\n“Patriot Front justifies its ideology of hate and intolerance under the guise of preserving the ethnic and cultural origins of its members’ European ancestors.”\n\nThe group’s manifesto claims those in America who are not of European ancestry are not truly American.\n\n“An African may have lived, worked, and even been classed as a citizen in America for centuries, yet he is not American. He is, as he likely prefers to be labeled, an African in America,” Patriot Front’s website said.\n\n“The same rule applies to others who are not of the founding stock of our people, or do not share the common unconscious that permeates throughout our greater civilization, and the European diaspora.”\n\nWho is Patriot Front’s leader?\n\nRousseau, who grew up in suburban Dallas, founded Patriot Front when he was a teenager, according to the SPLC.\n\nThomas Rousseau Kootenai County Sheriff\n\n“While working for his high school newspaper, Rousseau frequently wrote opinion columns in support of conservative topics including the controversial ‘campus carry’ law in Texas and North Carolina’s since gutted ‘bathroom bill.’ He was also an ardent supporter of Donald Trump during the 2016 election,” the SPLC said.\n\n“Under Rousseau’s direct leadership, Patriot Front’s Texas chapter is its most active – relying mostly on flyering, banner drops and occasionally demonstrations. When the organization ventures off the internet, its activities are primarily conducted in the dead of night, anonymously.”\n\nAfter the arrests in Idaho on Saturday, CNN reached out to the Patriot Front and people believed to be associated with Rousseau but did not immediately hear back.\n\nWhat are the goals of Patriot Front?\n\n“I think when you look at the past actions of the Patriot Front, they’re varied,” former FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok told CNN on Monday.\n\n“A lot of what they do is designed for image – for creating propaganda that they can use to spread their message to recruit more followers,” Strzok said.\n\n“So in the past, what we’ve seen from a lot of their activities (is) not so much intent on engaging in violence as much as engaging in protests. Certainly, hateful speech, for sure, but this is much more a group that’s designed for image and for creating a public spectacle.”\n\nBut Strzok said there’s always a key question with such groups: “Is there a trigger point where their intention is to move from simply protesting to violence?”\n\nHe said it’s not clear what may have happened at the Pride parade in Idaho.\n\n“The real question in my mind is their intention for what they were going to do that day,” Strzok said.\n\nHow is Patriot Front different from other White nationalist or White supremacist groups?\n\nMembers of Patriot Front are “comparatively young,” Strzok said.\n\n“A central tactic to Patriot Front is ‘flash demonstrations’ – privately planned and unannounced events that allow groups to promote their beliefs while limiting the risk of individual exposure, negative media coverage, arrests and public backlash,” the ADL said.\n\n“These flash demonstrations are mainly orchestrated for a quick photo and video opportunity that is then turned into online content.”\n\nAnd Patriot Front “has declined to participate in large rallies with other hate groups, preferring instead to work with small, local chapters that allow Patriot Front to remain the center of attention while controlling their message and presentation,” the SPLC said.\n\nStrzok said he’s worried the country might be in a new phase of extremism.\n\n“I think there’s certainly a lot of personal grievances out there across America. And what particularly concerns me right now is you see a lot of people – both political leaders as well as some in the media – who are tacitly encouraging not violence, but certainly these extremist beliefs,” the former FBI official said.\n\n“Whether it’s replacement theory, which plays into a lot of the White nationalist propaganda, whether it’s political figures using images of violence, I think that’s encouraging or accepting behavior that in the past we had moved away from,” Strzok said. “So I am worried that people who are inclined to violence … might be driven to violence.”\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that CNN had reached out to Thomas Ryan Rousseau's legal representative.

This can happen,” coach Tata Martino said after Inter Miami failed to win its first game of the Messi era.\n\n“It is true that we were a bit unaccustomed to this. The titles, the final, with a league game won the other day in New York, but we must move forward.“\n\nMessi had several opportunities to score on free kicks, as he has done while scoring 11 goals in his previous nine games with the MLS club.\n\nBut he was unable to recreate the Messi Mania magic that has made Inter Miami so entertaining since his arrival and first game in July.\n\nWhile Inter Miami has yet to lose a match, Inter Miami and Nashville settled for one point each in the MLS Eastern Conference playoff race after this match. But three points would’ve been preferred.\n\nWhen does Messi, Inter Miami play next?\n\nInter Miami's next game is against reigning league champion LAFC in Los Angeles on Sunday night. LAFC did not have a game Wednesday night and will be well-rested.\n\nHow does Inter Miami stand in MLS playoff race?\n\nInter Miami likely will have to average more than 2 points per game to make the MLS playoffs, so the tie doesn't really help the playoff hopes (now at 4 points after 2 games).\n\nThanks to the Vancouver Whitecaps' 1-0 win over the Chicago Fire FC on Wednesday night, Inter Miami did gain one point on the ninth-place team in the Eastern Conference.\n\nMiami sits 10 points behind Chicago, which has lost three straight as MLS returns to regular-season play after the completion of the Leagues Cup.\n\nThe top nine finishers in each conference qualify for the MLS playoffs.

A corner kick in the final minute was sent the other way.\n\nMessi attempted a shot in the middle of the field but it was blocked about three minutes into extra time.\n\nInter Miami’s DeAndre Yedlin was evaluated for a handball by VAR. But referees ruled against the initial ruling as we entered the 90th minute. It did appear a kick by Nashville’s Jacob Shaffelburg hit Yedlin before going out of bounds.\n\nDavid Ruiz, after a bad foul a few minutes earlier, missed a shot on goal in the 87th minute.\n\nMukhtar’s free kick misses in 85’: Inter Miami 0, Nashville 0\n\nReigning MVP Hany Mukhtar was fouled by Inter Miami youngster David Ruiz to set up a free kick just minutes after a miss by Messi.\n\nBut we’re still scoreless in this one.\n\nMukhtar’s kick was deflected by Inter Miami’s wall and play continues.\n\nMessi misses free kick in 82’: Inter Miami 1, Nashville 0\n\nMessi was taken down by Nashville’s Jack Maher in the 80th minute to set up a second free kick opportunity for him in the second half.\n\nAnd he was unable to convert again.\n\nMessi’s kick was defended by the Nashville wall and shot into the air after the deflection.\n\nOffsides takes away Mukhtar goal: Inter Miami 0, Nashville 0\n\nReigning MVP Hany Mukhtar was ruled offsides after his shot in 69th minute.\n\nInter Miami avoided the deficit in a back-and-forth set of minutes from 65th minute that saw two other misses and a shot by Messi blocked.\n\nInter Miami’s Facundo Farías missed an attempt in 66th minute, while Nashville’s Jacob Shaffelburg missed a left boot in 67th minute.\n\nMessi had another shot blocked one minute later.\n\nMessi miss in 60’: Inter Miami 0, Nashville 0\n\nMessi was fouled in the 59th minute to set up a free kick.\n\nAnd Messi was unable to do what he does best.\n\nMessi’s free kicks have had a knack of finding the back of the net during his Inter Miami career, but his left boot was met by the Nashville goalkeeper in the 60th minute.\n\nA few minutes earlier, Inter Miami defender Kamal Miller chased down reigning MLS MVP Hany Mukhtar to prevent a shot in the middle of the net in the 56th minute.\n\nMiller celebrated with a fist in the air to get an ovation from the crowd.\n\nHalftime: Inter Miami 0, Nashville 0\n\nTwo yellow cards and another miss for Inter Miami in the final minutes before halftime.\n\nMessi lobbed a beautiful pass with his left foot into the box for Robert Taylor, but Taylor’s left shot missed too wide to the left just before halftime in the 44th minute.\n\nThe pass was stellar. The finish was underwhelming. But the finish before halftime was entertaining. But both teams are playing each other tightly and physically during this rematch of their Leagues Cup game from 11 days ago.\n\nInter Miami’s Diego Gomez was given a yellow card following a foul at the middle of the field in extra time before the half.\n\nInter Miami’s Sergio Busquets also received a yellow card for making contact with referee immediately after the whistle was blown. Busquets was not overly physical, and his contact appeared to be accidental. It appeared he immediately apologized, while the referee loudly told him to not touch him.\n\nTaylor misses in 34’: Inter Miami 0, Nashville 0\n\nRobert Taylor misses a strike in the 34th minute after a great look.\n\nOf course, the shot was set up with a pass from Messi to Taylor in the middle of the field.\n\nInter Miami fans in attendance were ready to erupt after the team’s second shot of the game.\n\nMessi foul met with boos: Inter Miami 0, Nashville 0\n\nMessi was called for a foul in the 25th minute as Nashville defender Lukas MacNaughton challenged an attack in the box.\n\nInter Miami fans in DRV PNK Stadium rained down with boos as possession changed.\n\nMessi, two minutes later, delivered a stellar pass to Jordi Alba in the box, but it was defended well by Nashville.\n\n20': Inter Miami 0, Nashville 0\n\nThree free kicks for Leo Messi in the first 17 minutes of this game, but we’re still scoreless so far.\n\nNashville’s Jack Maher missed right footed shot from the center of the box is high and wide to the right in the 8th minute.\n\nInter Miami has been more aggressive on its side of the field in the opening minutes with three set pieces, but unable to convert.\n\nMessi's fourth free kick seemed to be taken by the wind, as Idalia (now downgraded to a tropical storm) has affected parts of South Florida with rain and wind for much of Tuesday.\n\nKen Griffey Jr. taking photos of Messi at Inter Miami game\n\nBaseball Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. (with a photographer vest and equipment!) is on the pitch and taking photos in tonight’s game.\n\nGriffey said hello to boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. before the game.\n\nInter Miami’s Leagues Cup trophy celebration\n\nBefore the game, Inter Miami held a ceremony to celebrate their Leagues Cup title over Nashville from Aug. 19.\n\nMessi and Deandre Yedlin held the trophy together and raised it to the Inter Miami fan section.\n\nInter Miami co-owner Jorge Mas addressed the crowd at DRV PNK Stadium.\n\n“You, our fans, are responsible for making our first trophy happen,” Mas said.\n\nMessi gets loose in warmups\n\nMessi was all smiles during pregame warmups on the pitch before tonight's game.\n\nHere's a quick video of Messi and the Inter Miami players warming up.\n\nInter Miami lineup: Messi, Busquets back in starting 11\n\nAfter coming off the bench in Saturday night's win over the New York Red Bulls, former FC Barcelona teammates Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets are back in the starting lineup tonight against Nashville SC. Jordi Alba, another former Barça player now in Miami, continues to be a starting 11 staple for coach Tata Martino.\n\nNashville SC lineup: 2022 MLS MVP on bench\n\nNashville SC, which is in the middle of a run of three games in eight days, is sitting some key players tonight.\n\nTwo of Nashville's designated players - forward Sam Surridge and defender Walker Zimmerman - will not be available. The team's third designated player, 2022 MLS MVP Hany Mukhtar, will start the game on the bench.\n\nWill Messi play tonight vs. Nashville SC?\n\nAfter coming off the bench in his last game against the New York Red Bulls last Saturday, Messi is expected to start in tonight’s game against Nashville.\n\nMessi did not start so he could rest after a grueling start to his Inter Miami career.\n\nSince his debut with the club on July 21, Messi has played in nine games with 11 goals and six assists.\n\nAnd he could be on loan to the Argentina national team next month.\n\nHow to watch Lionel Messi and Inter Miami against Nashville SC\n\nThe Inter Miami-Nashville SC game can be streamed live on MLS Season Pass on Apple TV.\n\nWill Messi miss any upcoming Inter Miami games?\n\nMessi could miss up to three Inter Miami games due to national team duties, Inter Miami coach Tata Martino said after the 2-0 win over the Red Bulls last Saturday.\n\n“The importance is that we value winning and winning this way because it's something we have to get accustomed to. Leo is gonna miss at least three games,” Martino said. “He's gonna get called up by his national team and others too. We know that the team has to continue to win without them at times.”\n\nMartino didn't specify which games Messi will miss, or if he'll miss games due to rest.\n\nInter Miami’s upcoming schedule following Wednesday’s match:\n\nSept. 3: at Los Angeles FC\n\nSept. 9: home vs. Kansas City\n\nSept. 16: at Atlanta United\n\nMessi could miss any of the next four MLS matchups as he will be with the Argentina national team for World Cup qualifiers. Argentina will face Ecuador on Sept. 7 and Bolivia on Sept. 12.\n\nTwo Inter Miami standouts joining USMNT\n\nInter Miami goalkeeper Drake Callender and rising 18-year-old standout Benjamin Cremaschi have been called up to represent the United States men’s national team for the upcoming friendly September matches against Uzbekistan (Sept. 9 in St. Louis) and Oman (Sept. 12 in St. Paul, Minnesota).\n\nCallender was named League's Cup Best Goalkeeper and earned the final Man of the Match honors for his influential performance against Nashville SC.\n\nCremaschi has one goal, four assists and two match-winning penalties in the past eight matches for Inter Miami.\n\nThe duo will join USMNT after Inter Miami’s match against LAFC on Sunday.\n\nMLS Matchday 29 (Aug. 30) games\n\nAtlanta United vs. FC Cincinnati, 7:30 p.m. ET\n\nCharlotte FC vs. Orlando City SC, 7:30 p.m. ET\n\nInter Miami vs. Nashville SC, 7:30 p.m. ET\n\nNew England Revolution vs. New York Red Bulls, 7:30 p.m. ET\n\nNew York City FC vs. CF Montréal, 7:30 p.m. ET\n\nToronto FC vs. Philadelphia Union, 7:30 p.m. ET\n\nAustin FC vs. Seattle Sounders, 8:30 p.m. ET\n\nChicago Fire FC vs. Vancouver Whitecaps FC, 8:30 p.m. ET\n\nHouston Dynamo FC vs. Columbus Crew, 8:30 p.m. ET\n\nMinnesota United vs. Colorado Rapids, 8:30 p.m. ET\n\nSt. Louis City SC vs. FC Dallas, 8:30 p.m. ET\n\nPortland Timbers vs. Real Salt Lake, 10:30 p.m. ET\n\nSan Jose Earthquakes vs. Los Angeles Galaxy, 10:30 p.m. ET\n\nAll games available on MLS Season Pass on Apple TV.\n\nWhat is the probability of Inter Miami making the MLS playoffs?\n\nNot great.\n\nInter Miami dug a massive hole for itself in the pre-Messi era, putting itself dead last in the Eastern Conference before defeating the New York Red Bulls on Saturday. Inter Miami now owns 21 points through 23 games played. Most of the teams ahead of Miami in the standings, however, have played at least two more games, so having games in hand helps the cause.\n\nThe top nine finishers in each conference make the playoffs. During the 2022 season, the ninth-place finisher in the Eastern Conference had 42 points; in 2021 the ninth-place team had 47 points.\n\nJust to be safe, let's say Inter Miami needs to get to that 47-point benchmark to have any chance to make the postseason. That would mean averaging 2.4 points a game, winning at least seven of the final 11 games. Any loss would be devastating.\n\nMLS playoff picture\n\nThese would be the early MLS playoff matchups, if the season ended before Wednesday night's games …\n\nEASTERN CONFERENCE\n\nWild-card match:\n\nCF Montréal (No. 8 seed) vs. Chicago Fire FC (9)\n\nRound 1 (best-of-three series)\n\nFC Cincinnati (1) vs. CF Montréal (8)-Chicago Fire FC (9) winner\n\nPhiladelphia Union (2) vs. Nashville SC (7)\n\nNew England Revolution (3) vs. Atlanta United (6)\n\nOrlando City SC (4) vs. Columbus Crew (5)\n\nWESTERN CONFERENCE\n\nWild-card match\n\nFC Dallas (No. 8 seed) vs. Austin FC (9)\n\nRound 1 (best-of-three series)\n\nSt. Louis City SC (1) vs. FC Dallas (8)-Austin FC (9) winner\n\nLos Angeles FC (2) vs. Vancouver Whitecaps (7)\n\nSeattle Sounders (3) vs. San Jose Earthquakes (6)\n\nReal Salt Lake (4) vs. Houston Dynamo FC (5)\n\nFC Cincinnati can clinch a playoff berth Wednesday night with:\n\nScenario 1: Win at Atlanta United\n\nScenario 2: Draw at Atlanta United and New York Red Bulls loss/draw, Chicago Fire FC loss/draw, Charlotte FC loss/draw\n\nScenario 3: New York Red Bulls loss/draw, Chicago Fire FC loss, Charlotte FC loss/draw\n\nScenario 4: New York Red Bulls loss/draw, Chicago Fire FC draw, Charlotte FC loss\n\nWhat is Inter Miami's remaining 2023 schedule?\n\nWith the exception of the U.S. Open Cup final on Sept. 26 (which will be available to stream on the CBS Sports Golazo Network), all other Inter Miami games are available to watch via the MLS Season Pass on Apple TV.\n\nConstruction on new Inter Miami stadium has begun\n\nOn Monday, Inter Miami announced that construction has started on the club's long-awaited new stadium. The stadium is expected to open in 2025. Messi's contract with the team runs through December 2025.\n\nThe 25,000-seat soccer-specific stadium will sit on a 58-acre public park and entertainment district at Miami Freedom Park.\n\nInter Miami has played at DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, since the team's inaugural season of 2020.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/worldcup/2023/08/20/england-vs-spain-womens-world-cup-final-live-updates-highlights-score/70635697007/", "title": "Women's World Cup final score: Spain vs. England highlights, replay", "text": "Olga Carmona’s goal in the 29th minute was all Spain needed to win its first World Cup title.\n\nSpain joins the United States, Germany, Norway and Japan as World Cup champions. It also completes a treble for La Roja, which last year won the Under-20 and U-18 World Cups.\n\nThe title will be seen by some as vindication for Jorge Vilda, who blackballed all but three players who last year protested the team environment he’d created. But it is their spectacularly skilled players, not Vilda’s tactics, that fueled this World Cup win.\n\nSpain shredded England’s left side and forced turnover after turnover after turnover. One of those led to Carmona’s goal. Spain took the ball away from Lucy Bronze at midfield and lofted it to the left side of the field, where Mariona Caldentey picked it up. She dribbled up the field before slipping the ball to Carmona, who beat goalkeeper Mary Earps in the far corner.\n\nEngland had its chances, and Earps’ save of a Jenni Hermosa penalty kick seemed to give the European champions renewed energy. But they couldn’t finish and, ultimately, couldn’t keep pace with the new World Cup champions.\n\nSpain vs. England World Cup final highlights\n\nIt may have been a low-scoring game, but the 2023 World Cup final had plenty of highlights, from an impressive Olga Carmona goal for Spain to a wild, and awesome, save from England goalkeeper Mary Earps.\n\nWorld Cup final replay: Spain vs. England full-length replay\n\nNot awake early enough to catch the World Cup final? You can watch a full replay of the match on foxsports.com.\n\nSpain's Jorge Vilda evades questions about coaching future\n\nJorge Vilda wouldn’t commit to continuing to coach Spain.\n\nVilda was asked multiple times after Spain won its first World Cup title whether he would continue on as coach. His answer each time was evasive.\n\n“Right now, we’re going to celebrate the World Cup,” Vilda said through a translator. “We’re going to go back to Spain and see our loved ones and then we’ll see.”\n\nVilda has coached Spain’s senior team since 2015. But he’s been under fire the past year after 15 players complained about the team environment and said they would not play for the national team until the concerns were addressed.\n\nOther than saying the last year has been “hard,” Vilda did not address the protest by Spain’s players. But he praised both his current players and those who were on the team during qualifying, saying they all contributed to the World Cup title.\n\n“I’m very happy for everyone that we’ve made happy and I’m happy our national team wins,” he said. “That’s all.”\n\nWorld Cup Golden Ball award: Aitana Bonmati\n\nSpain's Aitana Bonmati came into this World Cup wanting to prove she’s the best player in the world.\n\nThat she did.\n\nBonmati was the deserving winner of the Golden Ball as the best player at this World Cup. The midfielder had three goals and two assists, but her contributions to Spain’s World Cup title run were immeasurable. She anchored a midfield that produced gorgeous passes and connecting play, and her defense was filthy.\n\n\"I'm so proud,\" Bonmati said on the Fox broadcast after the game. \"We deserve it. We deserve it.\n\n\"We have been working for years for this moment.\"\n\nSpain also had the best young player of the tournament in Salma Paralluelo, who had goals in the quarterfinals and semifinals.\n\nWorld Cup Golden Boot award: Hinata Miyazawa\n\nThe Golden Boot, awarded each World Cup to the tournament's top scorer went to Japan's Hinata Miyazawa. She five goals before Japan was eliminated in the quarterfinals.\n\nEngland’s Mary Earps, who saved a penalty kick in the final, was named the tournament’s best goalkeeper. Some on social media were even referring to Earps as \"Mary, Queen of Saves.\"\n\nWhere’s the next women’s World Cup?\n\nGreat question! The host for the 2027 World Cup has yet to be determined or announced. But the United States, which is seeing an explosion in women’s sports popularity and where the NWSL is rapidly expanding, is sure to be in the mix as a host.\n\nHas Spain ever won a World Cup?\n\nUntil Sunday, no, Spain had never won a World Cup at the women's senior level. In fact, Sunday was Spain's first appearance in the final. This was only their third World Cup appearance, and the furthest they went previously was the round of 16 in 2019.\n\nBut lately, its youth teams have made it a habit of playing in World Cup finals.\n\nSalma Paralluelo was part of the Spain team that won the Under-20 World Cup last year. It was its first title at that level after finishing as the runner-up in 2018. The U-17 team, meanwhile, won its second consecutive World Cup title last year.\n\nWhile there’s no guarantee that success at the youth level will translate to the senior level, it does signal that Spain has a very robust pipeline.\n\nAccording to FOX, Spain, which was ranked sixth coming into the tournament, became the lowest-ranked team to ever win a women's World Cup.\n\n— Nancy Armour, USA TODAY Sports columnist\n\nWomen's World Cup past winners\n\nThe 2023 World Cup marked just the ninth time the women's event has taken place. (The men's World Cup has been played since 1930.) The U.S. has won more women's World Cup titles than any other country. Here’s a list of every women’s World Cup winner.\n\n1991: United States\n\nUnited States 1995: Norway\n\nNorway 1999: United States\n\nUnited States 2003: Germany\n\nGermany 2007: Germany\n\nGermany 2011: Japan\n\nJapan 2015: United States\n\nUnited States 2019: United States\n\nUnited States 2023: Spain\n\nFormer USWNT coach Jill Ellis presents World Cup Trophy\n\nJill Ellis, who led the USWNT to two World Cup titles (2015 and 2019), presented the World Cup trophy to Spain.\n\nEllis is currently the president of the San Diego Wave of the NWSL. She coached the USWNT from 2014-2019, finishing with a record of 106-19-7. In May, she was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame.\n\nSpain, Germany only countries to win both men's and women's World Cup titles\n\nSpain’s World Cup title put the country in exclusive company.\n\nWith its 1-0 victory over England on Sunday, Spain joined Germany as the only countries to win both the men’s and women’s World Cup. Spain’s men won the title at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.\n\nGermany’s women are the only team besides the U.S. women to win multiple World Cup titles and were the first to repeat champions. They won in 2003 and 2007. Germany’s men are four-time World Cup champions, winning in 1954, 1974, 1990 and 2014.\n\n— Nancy Armour, USA TODAY Sports columnist\n\n13 minutes of stoppage time, Beth England subs in\n\nEngland subbed in Beth England (fitting) for Ella Toone in the 87th minute, just before the referee announced there would be a whopping 13 minutes of stoppage time.\n\nSalma Paralluello hit with yellow card for Spain, England's Alex Greenwood injured\n\nThere was a lengthy stop of play late in the second half after England’s Alex Greenwood took an elbow to the face by Salma Paralluelo in the 78th minute. The knock opened up a gash on Greenwood’s forehead, and her uniform was soon covered in blood. Her teammates brought out a new jersey while trainers wrapped her head with a thick, white bandage.\n\nIt took awhile to tend to Greenwood's injury, which means there's likely going to be quite a bit of stoppage time.\n\nMary Earps saves Spain penalty kick after VAR determines handball\n\nMary Earps gave England a lifeline in the 69th with a monster save of a Jenni Hermosa penalty.\n\nLeading 1-0, Spain was awarded the penalty after a lengthy video assistant review of a handball on England's Keira Walsh. It was the right call — replays showed Walsh had stuck her right arm out — but a goal would have been the dagger for Spain and Hermosa is La Roja’s all-time leading scorer.\n\nBut Earps guessed correctly, diving to her left and smothering the ball so Spain wouldn't get a second chance.\n\n\"I thought this penalty was way too light but I’m not the referee and I don’t decide that,\" England coach Sarina Wiegman said during her postgame news conference.\n\nWho is World Cup final referee Tori Penso?\n\nThe USWNT might be home after bowing out in the World Cup Round of 16, but there are still Americans in Australia making a mark in the World Cup final.\n\nThe most notable of those is Tori Penso, the center referee of the final. She led a group of four Americans who were chosen to work the England-Spain match. It's the first time U.S. Soccer referees have led the officiating crew at a senior World Cup final.\n\nPenso was joined by assistant referees Brooke Mayo and Kathryn Nesbitt, while Armando Villarreal worked as a video assistant referee. According to FIFA rules, referees cannot work a game that involves their own country.\n\n“There’s nothing better than this moment that I’ve living right now,” Penso told The Los Angeles Times. “For me, for the entire crew, what we’re about to embark on, it’s groundbreaking and it’s I moment I will never forget.”\n\nOihane Hernández subs in for Spain\n\nSpain also used its first sub early in the second half, bringing in Oihane Hernández for Alba Redondo in the 60th minute with Spain still leading 1-0.\n\nLauren Hemp gets yellow card for England\n\nIt seems like nothing is going right for England.\n\nThe Lionesses trail Spain 1-0 in the World Cup final and haven't been able to connect on a handful of good looks. Then, in the 55th minute, England's Lauren Hemp was hit with a yellow card after a tackle on Spain's Laia Codina. Hemp argued with the referee after to no avail.\n\nLauren James subs in for England\n\nLauren James, the talented forward who missed England’s last two games, has subbed in for the Lionesses in the second half with England trailing 1-0.\n\nJames missed the semifinal and quarterfinal matches after picking up a red card in England’s Round of 16 win over Nigeria. The 21-year-old was ejected late in regulation after purposely stepping on Nigeria’s Michelle Alozie in the 84th minute.\n\nMany wondered if James, who has scored or assisted on six of England’s 14 goals this tournament, would start in the final.\n\nJames came in for Alessia Russo, and Chloe Kelly subbed in for Rachel Daly.\n\nOlga Carmona goal puts Spain up 1-0 on England\n\nSpain made England pay for Lucy Bronze’s turnover. After getting the ball at midfield, Spain floated the ball over an England scrum to Mariona Caldentey, who dribbled up the left side before spotting a late-charging Olga Carmona and slipping the ball to her. Carmona fired to the far corner, past a diving Mary Earps to put Spain up 1-0 in the 29th minute.\n\nIt was Carmona’s second goal in as many games. She also had the game-winner in Spain’s 2-1 win over Sweden in the semifinal.\n\nInstant halftime analysis: Spain 1, England 0\n\nSpain’s 1-0 lead doesn’t reflect just how dominant La Roja was in the first half of the World Cup final.\n\nSpain, which was eliminated by England in the quarterfinals of last year’s European championship, bossed the Three Lionesses all over the field. They’re dominating possession, 53% to 31%, and have a massive edge in both passes (313 to 175) and passes completed (275 to 141). Salma Paralluelo was thisclose to having not one, but two goals.\n\nSpain is also shredding England’s left side. That’s where Olga Carmona’s goal came from, slipping in late from behind to an open space and beating Mary Earps in the far corner.\n\nEngland’s had chances, but it’s going to need to shore up its defense in the second half.\n\n— Nancy Armour, USA TODAY Sports columnist\n\nEngland vs. Spain first-half highlights from electric start\n\nThis England-Spain final is all gas, no breaks so far.\n\nWe’ve already seen an Olga Carmona goal, a banger off the crossbar by Lauren Hemp and near-misses by Salma Paralluelo and Alba Redondo. And that was just in the first 30 minutes!\n\nSpain is dominating possession — it was 53% to 31% through the first 45 minutes — and doubled England's three attempts on goal. That included two shots on target for England that were saved by Coll. Spain also had two shots on target saved by England. Additionally, England has been called for offside three times (Spain hasn't done it at all).\n\nWith such a frenetic pace already, it feels as if there are more goals to come. Just before halftime, Salma Paralluelo had another great look for Spain, but her shot ricocheted off the post.\n\nWho is Salma Paralluello?\n\nA 19-year-old sensation for Spain’s national team, Salma Paralluelo got the start for the World Cup final vs. England. The teenager has made a tremendous impact for Spain off the bench this tournament, scoring the game-winning goal in the quarterfinal against the Netherlands and the go-ahead goal in the team’s semifinal win over Sweden.\n\nIf she ever tires of soccer, Paralluelo could always switch back to track: a standout athlete, she set under-20 records for Spain in the 400 and 400 hurdles before deciding to focus on soccer.\n\nSpain vs. England World Cup final starting lineups\n\nTeenage super-sub Salma Paralluelo is in Spain's starting lineup for the championship game Sunday against England, while star Alexia Putellas returns to the bench.\n\nParalluelo scored the game-winning goal against the Netherlands in extra time of the quarterfinals, and the 19-year-old scored Spain's go-ahead goal in the semifinal victory over Sweden.\n\nCheck out Spain's starting IX:\n\nForward Lauren James is back in the lineup for England, but will come off the bench after serving a two-game suspension for a red card.\n\nCheck out England's starting IX:\n\nHow to watch World Cup final Spain vs. England\n\nThere are plenty of ways to watch the World Cup final. The game is being broadcast on FOX Sports, with the Spanish-language version available on Telemundo. Additionally, the World Cup final can be live streamed in English on FoxSports.com and in Spanish on Peacock. You can also watch it on your favorite streaming service that provides live TV, including DirecTV Stream, Sling Blue, Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, and Fubo.\n\nThe World Cup final between England and Spain kicks off at 6 a.m. ET Sunday at Stadium Australia. That's 8 p.m. in Sydney, Australia, where the match will be held.\n\nSpain coach Jorge Vilda and controversy with his players\n\nSpain’s appearance in the World Cup final comes almost a year after 15 of the team’s top players complained about the environment under coach Jorge Vilda and said they didn’t wish to be selected for the national team unless changes were made.\n\nThe Spanish federation backed Vilda — and his decision to drop the players. Though some later said they wanted to come back, only three are on the World Cup squad. Two-time Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas and Jenni Hermosa, Spain’s all-time scoring leader, who weren’t among the 15 but expressed support for their teammates, are also at the World Cup.\n\nInstead, Vilda stocked his squad with up-and-comers, most notably Salma Paralluelo. It’s worked, but it hasn’t stopped the questions. Vilda was asked Saturday about the mutiny and would say only, “Next question please.”\n\n— Nancy Armour, USA TODAY Sports columnist\n\nIs Prince William going to the World Cup final?\n\nIt’s well known that Prince William, the heir to the British thrown is a huge soccer fan, as well as head of the Football Association, England’s governing body for soccer. Many thought he’d made the trip to Sydney for the final, given that England is playing. He won’t be there in person, but on Saturday he posted a video on social media wishing the Lionesses good luck, alongside 8-year-old daughter Charlotte.\n\nQueen of Spain in Sydney for World Cup final\n\nWhile Prince William is absent, Queen Letizia of Spain will be in the house to cheer on Spain. She made the trip to Sydney with her 16-year-old daughter Infanta Sofia. According to the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Queen Letizia visited the team during practice in June, speaking to players and the coaching staff.\n\nWorld Cup final odds\n\nLooking to bet on the 2023 World Cup?

Spain does not and I think that inexperience will cost them. Score: England 2-0\n\nLindsay Schnell, USA TODAY reporter: I'm picking England, which almost surely means Spain will win. Whatever I've predicted this tournament, the opposite has happened. So if you're a betting individual, do the opposite of what I say. But just for fun ... Score: England 3, Spain 2\n\nAlicia DelGallo, senior editor USA TODAY: Spain commands the beginning of the game and goes up early, but England comes back and holds onto a narrow lead. Score: England 2, Spain 1\n\nSportsbook Wire: Spain 2, England 1\n\nUSWNT missing World Cup final good for women's soccer\n\nThe U.S. women not playing in the World Cup final is actually a good thing.\n\nNo, really. Hear me out.\n\nThe USWNT, and the executives at Fox Sports, will disagree there’s anything positive about the four-time champions not being around for the last two weeks of the tournament. For the growth of the game, to incentivize still-developing programs to keep investing in their teams, however, the early exits of the USWNT and other powerhouses is a boon.\n\nRead Nancy Armour's full column here.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2024/03/07/inter-miami-nashville-concacaf-champions-cup-score-updates/72886715007/", "title": "Inter Miami vs. Nashville in Champions Cup: Score, highlights, recap", "text": "There’s always enough time for Inter Miami when Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez are on the pitch – even in the final minutes.\n\nMessi scored a goal in the 52nd minute, while Suárez’s header in the fifth minute of extra time helped Inter Miami storm back to finish a 2-2 draw against Nashville SC during the first leg of their Concacaf Champions Cup match on Thursday night at GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tenn.\n\nBoth teams have MLS games on Sunday, before the second leg of their Round-of-16-matchup Wednesday at Inter Miami’s Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nInter Miami vs. Nashville SC Concacaf Champions Cup highlights\n\nMessi’s goal was a sigh of relief for Inter Miami after Nashville’s Jacob Shaffelburg scored twice in the opening minutes of each half to give his side a 2-0 lead.\n\nMessi's sidekicks from Barcelona also came through in clutch moments – none bigger than Suárez, who rose above the defense to use his head on a pass from Sergio Busquets.\n\nInter Miami fell behind 1-0 after four minutes, and 2-0 just two minutes after halftime. They were without Jordi Alba, another Barcelona star who orchestrated two of Messi’s goals this year but was out with an illness. They lost Leo Campana, Suárez’s backup, to a foot injury in Wednesday’s practice before the game. They traded away defender DeAndre Yedlin to FC Cincinnati earlier in the week. There were a lot of holes to fill, but Inter Miami's star power prevailed again.\n\nNashville's offside call spoils 3-1 lead\n\nBefore the equalizer from Suárez, Nashville’s Shaq Moore was ruled offside after VAR, negating a goal that would have given them a 3-1 lead in the 83rd minute.\n\nNashville coach Gary Smith considered both sequences as “defining moments” that could determine which side advances in the Champions Cup.\n\n“We’ve been given for five occasions, and we scored two. And most times we’d say that’s enough, but not against Miami,” Smith said of Nashville’s opportunities in the match.\n\nMessi finished the game despite injury – his legendary left leg was kicked by the calf area, causing his ankle to twist with about 10 minutes remaining in the match. Messi also got his right hamstring massaged during the first half.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Messi will play in Inter Miami’s next match at home against Montreal CF on Sunday. Nashville is also in action, hosting L.A. Galaxy on Sunday.\n\n“Leo finished the game. He’s tired. He’s fatigued. That’s why he was getting massages. But he is fine,” Inter Miami coach Tata Martino said after the game.\n\nLionel Messi 'is the show'\n\nSmith applauded Nashville’s intensity, which was also on full display when they fell to Inter Miami 1-1 (10-9 penalty kicks) during the Leagues Cup final last August.\n\n“There’s a slightly different edge and feel when Lionel Messi is in town. He is the show and an exceptional individual,” Smith said. “It squeezes a little bit more [out of you], of course. It’s not always easy to get to those heights … in such a prestigious tournament. The guys left everything out there.”\n\nWhat is aggregate in soccer?\n\nThe aggregate score in soccer is the combined number of goals scored by two teams in a series of games.\n\nAs far as the Concacaf Champions Cup is concerned, that aggregate score is over two games. Each team plays one home game in the two-leg knockout rounds.\n\nIn a situation where the two teams are tied on goals after the second leg, the team with the most away goals will advance via the away-goal tiebreaker. If the two teams are tied on goals as well as away goals, then the game will be decided in extra time and/or a penalty kick shootout.\n\nInter Miami might have tied Nashville SC on Thursday night, but heading back to their home stadium with two away goals gives them a slight edge.\n\nLuis Suárez goal: Nashville 2, Inter Miami 2\n\nInter Miami’s comeback is complete: Luis Suárez scored in extra time in the final minutes, and Inter Miami will likely leave Nashville with a 2-2 draw in the first leg of their Champions Cup match.\n\nThe second leg is Wednesday at Inter Miami.\n\nIt’s the third goal Suárez has scored in his last two matches.\n\nShaq Moore goal ruled offside: Nashville 2, Inter Miami 1\n\nNashville’s Shaq Moore delivered a goal in the 83rd minute, but VAR ruled the goal offsides.\n\nMoore connected on a left-footed shot into the left side of the net, and Nashville nearly had a 3-1 lead in the final minutes.\n\nInstead, the score remains 2-1.\n\nMessi goes down with left leg injury, but stays in game: Nashville 2, Inter Miami 1\n\nMessi’s leg was kicked in the lower leg area, causing his left ankle to roll after being kicked by Nashville’s Lukas MacNaughton, who was following through on a kick of the ball.\n\nMessi stood on the sideline after being tended to by trainers, drinking a bottle of water before coming back into the match with about 10 minutes remaining.\n\nMessi, Suárez faceoff against Nashville player: Nashville 2, Inter Miami 1\n\nTempers are flaring, and Lionel Messi is mixing it up.\n\nMessi stepped in as Inter Miami’s Luis Suárez was bickering with Nashville’s Aníbal Godoy in the 67th minute.\n\nMessi had some words with former MLS MVP Hany Mukhtar after the sequence dissolved.\n\nInter Miami threatens in 63rd minute: Nashville 2, Inter Miami 1\n\nDiego Gómez was taken down just outside the penalty box and Inter Miami was awarded a free kick. Lionel Messi's free-kick attempt was booted out of bounds by Nashville for a corner kick, which did not find the head of a Miami player in the box.\n\nInter Miami goal negated after offside: Nashville 2, Inter Miami 1\n\nInter Miami’s Diego Gomez found the back of the net in the 57th minute, but was ruled offside.\n\nThe goal comes off the board for Inter Miami, who nearly tied the match early in the second half.\n\nLionel Messi goal highlight: Nashville 2, Inter Miami 1\n\nHere comes Lionel Messi to the rescue. Messi scored in the 52nd minute to bring Inter Miami back into the match.\n\nMessi’s shot snuck into the left side of the net, after an assist by Luis Suárez.\n\nJacob Shaffelburg scores second goal: Nashville 2, Inter Miami 0\n\nNashville’s Jacob Shaffelburg has scored in the opening minutes of both halves, this time in the 47th minute.\n\nMessi gets hamstring massage on sidelines\n\nSomething to monitor: Lionel Messi received some treatment on the back of his right leg earlier in the match.\n\nMessi misses free kick before halftime: Nashville 1, Inter Miami 0\n\nInter Miami faced a 1-0 deficit just four minutes into the match. And in the final minutes of the first half, they were unable to tie it.\n\nMessi’s free kick collided into the wall of Nashville players, and Julian Gressel’s rebound was saved by the Nashville goalie.\n\nInter Miami missed opportunity: Nashville 1, Inter Miami 0\n\nMessi and Suárez nearly had an opportunity in the penalty area in the 37th minute, but Messi was unable to get a shot off.\n\nFederico Redondo yellow card: Nashville 1, Inter Miami 0\n\nInter Miami rookie Federico Redondo was given a yellow card in the 26th minute after his left elbow connected with Nashville’s Jacob Shaffelburg, who scored the first goal. It’s Redondo’s debut with Inter Miami after recently signing with the club.\n\nShortly after, Inter Miami’s Noah Allen and Nashville’s Shaq Moore – who assisted on the first goal – collided for a headbutt, leading to a brief stoppage in play.\n\nHany Mukhtar misses strike in 23’: Nashville 1, Inter Miami 0\n\nHany Mukhtar’s strike in the 23rd minute was saved by Inter Miami goalie Drake Callender, just outside the right side of the net. Mukhtar winded up with a shot after some traffic near midfield with Inter Miami trying to maintain possession.\n\nA few updates since Messi’s miss: Nashville 1, Inter Miami 0\n\nInter Miami’s Luis Suárez missed a header close to the net after a Messi corner kick. Nashville’s Alex Muyl came flying in with a header, but was hit high and out of bounds. And Suárez missed another shot attempt from the left side. We’re now in the 20th minute.\n\nMessi misses his shot: Nashville 1, Inter Miami 0\n\nLionel Messi’s first shot of the game didn’t have enough bend. Messi connected with a left boot just before the 13th minute, but was wide left.\n\nJacob Shaffelburg goal: Nashville 1, Inter Miami 0\n\nWelp. Inter Miami is down in the opening minutes into tonight’s Champions Cup match. Nashville’s Jacob Shaffelburg scored in the fourth minute to take a 1-0 lead, thanks to an assist by Shaq Moore.\n\nThe Inter Miami vs. Nashville SC match will kickoff at 9 p.m. ET (8 p.m. CT) at GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tennessee. The match is available in English on FS2 and in Spanish on TUDN.\n\nWATCH: Messi and Inter Miami vs. Nashville SC in the CONCACAF Champions Cup on Fubo\n\nTICKETS: See Messi and Inter Miami in person vs. Nashville SC\n\nLeo Campana has foot injury, out for Inter Miami vs. Nashville SC\n\nInter Miami will be without Jordi Alba (illness) and Leo Campana, who has come off the bench to relieve Luis Suárez during the last two matches. Campana suffered a foot injury in Wednesday's practice, a team spokesman told USA TODAY Sports, and was omitted from Inter Miami’s lineup.\n\nAdd the fact right-wing defender DeAndre Yedlin was traded to Cincinnati, and Inter Miami’s depth will be tested.\n\nSome good news: 21-year-old Argentine midfielder Federico Redondo will make his Inter Miami debut alongside Sergio Busquets.

He even posted about it on Instagram earlier Thursday.\n\nHere are the starting lineups for Inter Miami vs. Nashville SC:\n\nInter Miami's Jordi Alba won't play against Nashville\n\nInter Miami’s Jordi Alba has been dealing with an illness this week. And he will not play against Nashville SC.\n\nInter Miami coach Tata Martino was coy when asked whether Alba even made the trip to Nashville: \"They'll have to ring his doorbell at home to see if he’s here.\n\nNashville MLS MVP Hany Mukhtar will play vs. Inter Miami\n\nNashville's Hany Mukhtar, the 2022 MLS MVP is in the starting lineup for tonight's match, despite a recent hamstring injury.\n\n“He's back in the group and working, and there certainly be a thought about where and how he might be used [Thursday],” Nashville coach Gary Smith said of Mukhtar, who got hurt Feb. 22 during the first leg of their Champions Cup matchup against Dominican team Moca FC.\n\nInter Miami vs. Nashville SC predictions\n\nSafid Deen, Lionel Messi reporter: Inter Miami 3, Nashville SC 0\n\nNashville will play Inter Miami close early, but Messi and Inter Miami are well-rested and coming off a heater against Orlando City last week. Messi scores once, and has an assist to Luis Suarez, while one other Inter Miami player, let’s say Julian Gressel, finds the back of the net in a 3-0 win.\n\nJacob Shames, Nashville SC beat writer for The Tennessean: Inter Miami 2, Nashville SC 0\n\nEven if Hany Mukhtar and Sam Surridge don't play, Nashville's defensive structure still will frustrate Messi and Suarez, but Inter Miami's superior talent will overwhelm when it's all said and done. But if Nashville is at or close to full strength, can it generate offense to match? In that regard, there's little to go off of.\n\nHow did Inter Miami and Nashville SC get here in Concacaf Champions Cup?\n\nInter Miami’s win in the Leagues Cup qualified them for a berth into the Round of 16 in the Champions Cup tournament.\n\nNashville SC outlasted Dominican team Moca FC 7-0 on aggregate to advance.\n\nWhat is the Concacaf Champions Cup?\n\nCompared to other soccer tournaments, it’s like the CONMEBOL Libertadores and the UEFA Champions League.\n\nThe winner qualifies for the FIFA Club World Cup in 2025.\n\nWhat happened when Messi last visited Nashville?\n\nMessi and Inter Miami hoisted the League Cup trophy after beating Nashville 1-1 (10-9 in penalty kicks) on Aug. 19, 2023. It was Messi’s seventh match with Inter Miami last summer, and the win marked Inter Miami’s first championship in its four-year franchise history.\n\nMessi scored in the 23rd minute. Nashville’s Fafá Picault scored in the 57th minute. And both sides were inches away from winning it in the final minutes of regulation before needing 22 total penalty kicks to decide it.\n\nBoth teams last met on Aug. 30, playing to a scoreless draw.\n\nWhen is Inter Miami vs. Nashville SC second leg?\n\nInter Miami and Nashville each have a regular-season match Sunday before the second leg of their Champions Cup matchup.\n\nNashville hosts the L.A. Galaxy at 3 p.m. ET, while Inter Miami will host CF Montreal at 5 p.m. ET on Sunday.\n\nThe second leg of their matchup will be at Inter Miami’s Chase Stadium on March 13 at 8:15 p.m. ET.\n\nConcacaf Champions Cup: Recent winners\n\n2023: Club León\n\nClub León 2022: Seattle Sounders FC\n\nSeattle Sounders FC 2021: CF Monterrey\n\nCF Monterrey 2020: Tigres UANL\n\nTigres UANL 2019: CF Monterrey\n\nCompetition was known as the Concacaf Champions League from 2008-2023.\n\nCould Lionel Messi’s jampacked schedule include a trip to Paris for the 2024 Olympics?\n\nArgentina coach Javier Mascherano is hopeful, but he knows Messi, 36, has plenty to consider.\n\nMascherano, who coaches Argentina’s under-23 team, said he had conversations with Messi about being one of three possible overage players to join Argentina’s Olympic roster.\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

What to know about rule for 2022 World ...", "text": "The offside call is often as consequential a call as a foul inside the penalty box in a soccer match. It’s often the reason a goal gets overturned. Or two goals.\n\nThat was the case at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil for Mexico forward Giovani dos Santos, who saw two goals overturned in the Mexican side’s opening match against Cameroon. Mexico ultimately beat the Cameroonians 1-0 on a late goal, but a 3-0 result would have boosted their goal differential and perhaps changed the tournament dynamics. Mexico narrowly finished second in its group on goal differential behind Brazil. The disallowed goals would've put them in a better spot to finish first heading into the final group stage game, potentially setting up a more favorable opponent in the round of 16 knockout stage.\n\nVideo replay showed dos Santos onside on both goal-scoring plays.

However, the French champions hope the revamping of their squad during the offseason will result in a more balanced team less focused on individuals.\n\nPSG has retained its main attacking threat, Kylian Mbappe, who should lead the attack against Dortmund. PSG will be without Marco Asensio and Presnel Kimpembe. Dortmund has been shaky in defense so far this season and has struggled to replace Jude Bellingham, who’s now starring for Real Madrid.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nShakhtar Donetsk playing its UCL home games in Germany\n\nCaptain Taras Stepanenko told The Associated Press on Monday that Shakhtar’s opening Champions League game against Porto on Tuesday is part of his team’s duty to represent Ukraine and show his country’s resilience.\n\n“Our soldiers fight in the battles and we fight in the sports arena. So it’s our duty like citizens of Ukraine,” he said.\n\nFor the second straight season, Shakhtar is playing its Champions League games outside of Ukraine because of the Russian invasion. Last year, Poland stood in as Shakhtar’s home venue. Now it’s Germany, a country which has welcomed hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who fled the fighting.\n\nJust getting to Hamburg took an “absolutely difficult” 10-hour journey, Stepanenko said, mostly by bus because Ukraine’s airports have been closed since the invasion. After winning a Ukrainian league game Saturday, the team drove to Poland from the border city of Lviv, spent about three hours getting through the border, then caught a flight from Poland to Hamburg. It’s technically a home game for Shakhtar, but the away team will get there much faster from Portugal.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nCan Manchester City repeat in Champions League?\n\nHistory is not on Pep Guardiola’s side as he tries to lead Manchester City to back-to-back Champions League titles this season.

He had previously won it with Lionel Messi and Barcelona in 2009 and 2011.\n\n“I’d like to say that for our club to win the Champions League is incredible,” he said. “But in perspective for the Champions League, how many teams have won the Champions League once?\n\n“A lot have won two, three, four, five. In perspective, we did nothing special. Just one.”\n\nThe defending English Premier League champions have are in first place domestically, winning their first five games of the new season.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nNewcastle holds dominant AC Milan to scoreless draw\n\nNewcastle marked its return to Europe’s elite with a 0-0 draw at AC Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday, despite being completely dominated at San Siro.\n\nA combination of good saves by Newcastle goalkeeper Nick Pope and wayward finishing by Milan saw the visitors pick up a point in the club’s first Champions League match in 20 years.\n\nMilan should have put the match to bed in the first half and the seven-time champion will perhaps rue its missed opportunities, with Paris Saint-Germain and Borussia Dortmund also in Group F.\n\nMilan had 25 attempts on goal to just six for Newcastle but the English side almost snatched a win at the end. Goalkeeper Marco Sportiello pulled off his only save off the match to fingertip Sean Longstaff’s effort over the bar.\n\nThe match marked the return of Sandro Tonali to San Siro after he moved to Newcastle from Milan in the offseason.

Another match highlighting the sharp decline of two of England’s top teams who, at this rate, are unlikely to be playing in the Champions League next season.\n\nChelsea was playing its first game since but little was different under his interim replacement, Bruno Saltor.\n\nIndeed, there was something very familiar about the teams serving up a goalless draw. That has been the score in this fixture in their last four meetings — both Premier League matches this season and both domestic cup finals last season, which were ultimately won by Liverpool via penalty shootouts.\n\nThe top four, and qualification for the Champions League, is looking increasingly unlikely for both teams.\n\nLiverpool, which ran Manchester City so close for the title last season, is in eighth place and seven points off fourth-place Tottenham. Chelsea, on the back of spending $630 million in the last two transfer windows, is four points further back in 11th place.\n\nScoring goals remains Chelsea's big problem, with the expensively assembled team failing to net at home for the fifth time in 2023.\n\nReece James had a strike disallowed for a narrow offside against Enzo Fernandez and Kai Havertz's celebrations for a goal in the second half were cut short after VAR spotted the ball rebounded off his arm and into the net after Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker saved the striker's shot.\n\n“These have been emotional days,\" Bruno said, “and the players have been able to keep focused. It’s a credit to them.”\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was satisfied with the reaction of his team after a humbling 4-1 loss at Manchester City, which led to him making six changes — including dropping Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson to the bench.\n\n“Yes, it was not the best football,” Klopp said, “but these boys are really good footballers and tonight they put in a proper shift.”\n\nNO CHANGE\n\nFiring its manager didn't have an instant effect on Leicester, either.\n\nA 2-1 defeat at home to Aston Villa dropped Leicester into next-to-last place and means the team has lost six of its last seven league games, drawing the other one.\n\nFollowing the departure of Brendan Rodgers on Sunday, first-team coaches Adam Sadler and Mike Stowell were put in interim control of Leicester but they weren't able to fix a leaky defense that has now conceded 51 goals in 29 games.\n\nBertrand Traore came off the bench to score Villa's winner in the 87th minute, with Leicester down to 10 men by that time after Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall collected a second booking in the 70th.\n\nHarvey Barnes had earlier canceled out the opener by Villa striker Ollie Watkins, who scored for the sixth straight away game — the first player to do so in the Premier League since former Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero in 2017.\n\nVilla climbed to seventh place under Unai Emery and has won five of its last six league games.\n\nRELEGATION BATTLE\n\nIt was a significant evening in the league's tightest relegation battle in years — and Leeds turned out being the big winner.\n\nBy rallying to beat fellow struggler Nottingham Forest 2-1, Leeds climbed out of the bottom three and jumped to 13th place in the 20-team league.\n\nThe fight to avoid the drop remains too close to call, though, with five points separating Crystal Palace in 12th and Leicester in 19th.\n\nForest, which has dropped to fourth-to-last place, took the lead at Elland Road through Orel Mangala in the 12th minute only for Leeds to turn the game around thanks to goals by Jack Harrison and Luis Sinisterra before halftime.\n\nBournemouth dropped back into the relegation zone after losing 2-0 at home to Brighton, whose goals came from teenage strikers — a deft flicked finish by Evan Ferguson in the 27th and Julio Enciso's individual effort in second-half stoppage time.\n\nBrighton moved up to sixth place, four points off the top four, and could yet challenge for Champions League qualification.\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at https://twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/worldcup/2022/11/27/world-cup-updates-spain-germany-belgium-canada/10774398002/", "title": "Sunday World Cup recap: Canada eliminated by Croatia; Spain ...", "text": "USA TODAY Sports Staff\n\nPlay in Groups E and F continued Sunday after an action-packed opening week at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\n\nOne of the favorites in Group E — four-time men's World Cup champion Germany — dropped in a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Japan on Wednesday.

In 2018, Germany was eliminated from the World Cup in its earliest exit in 80 years.\n\nFINAL: Croatia 4, Canada 1\n\nCanada was eliminated from the 2022 World Cup after losing 4-1 to Croatia on Sunday. After losing their opener 1-0 to Belgium, the Canadians took the lead less than 90 seconds into Sunday's match. But Croatia scored twice just before halftime and added two more in the second half.\n\nGoal!

Alphonso Davies puts Canada up on Croatia\n\nIt took less than two minutes for Canada to take the lead, with Alphonso Davies heading home Tajon Buchanan's cross to beat Dominik Livaković.\n\nThe 22-year-old Bayern Munich man's goal was the first goal Canada has ever scored in the men's World Cup, days after Davies missed a penalty kick in the opening loss to Belgium.\n\nCanada, Croatia starting lineups\n\nOne change for each side with kickoff set for 11 a.m. ET at the Khalifa International Stadium in Al Rayyan.\n\nMorocco didn't back down.

There's some confusion as to why. The Moroccan FA announced the change on Twitter after the game was underway.\n\nAl Thumama Stadium erupted with jubilation from Moroccan fans when Hakim Ziyech scored from a free kick, but video review overturned the goal for an offside call. The teams enter halftime knotted in a scoreless tie.\n\nWith pressure from Morocco, Courtois opts to show off his footwork. The goalkeeper, with the ball at his feet, caught Moroccan forward Youssef En-Nesyri off balance as he rushed in — a nervy moment from Courtois, but it worked out in the end.\n\nWith a win, Belgium would secure a spot in the Round of 16. A draw between the two teams shifts the pressure to the final round of group stage games.\n\nBelgium (3-4-2-1): Courtois; Vertonghen, Alderweireld, Meunier; T. Hazard, Witsel, Onana, Castagne; E.

The banner on the U.S. men's national team's Twitter page, which lists the team’s group-stage games at the tournament, was also changed Saturday to feature the Iranian flag without the Islamic Republic emblem. After being up for 24 hours, it was changed back Sunday afternoon to the banner U.S. Soccer had been using during the tournament.\n\nThe changes ahead of Tuesday’s game against Iran were intentional, with a U.S. Soccer spokesperson saying it was the federation’s way of showing “support for the women in Iran fighting for basic human rights.”\n\nThe official Iranian flag could still be seen elsewhere on U.S. Soccer's social media accounts, including on its main web page. The removal of the emblem was not meant to be a permanent protest, and U.S. Soccer's future posts are expected to use Iran's official flag. — Nancy Armour\n\nKeysher Fuller scored in the 81st minute to lift Costa Rica to a 1-0 victory over Japan on Sunday, leaving both teams with three points after two games in Group E of the World Cup.\n\nJapan has one group game remaining with Spain, and Costa Rica faces Germany in its final group match. With a victory, Japan could have all but wrapped up a place in the knockout stage after a 2-1 upset of Germany in its opener. Costa Rica was pounded by Spain 7-0 in its first game and just trying to survive. — Associated Press\n\nJapan made a late push against Costa Rica, but goalkeeper Keylor Navas and the Costa Rican defense put their bodies on the line to hold on to the lead.\n\nAfter bunkering down in the first half to stay scoreless, Costa Rica breaks through late in the second half. Keysher Fuller shoots from the center of the box. Goalkeeper Shuichi Gonda mistimed his jump and the error cost Japan the opening goal.\n\nJapan made two substitutions at halftime, adjusting to a more attacking 3-4-3 formation. Hiroki Ito entered the game as the third center back and Takuma Asano adds to the attack.\n\nIn the 50th minute, both Ko Itakura and Wataru Endo had shots blocked. Defender Francisco Calvo made a lunging save to stop Endo's attempt and keep the score even.\n\nFor Costa Rica, things are going to plan. Los Ticos are sitting back and keeping Japan from running behind their defense. For Japan, it'll want to make some changes to get a score on the board and keep its Round of 16 hopes alive.\n\nHalftime stats:\n\nPossession: Japan 42%, Costa Rica 58%\n\nJapan 42%, Costa Rica 58% Shots: Japan 2 (0 on target), Costa Rica 3 (0 on target)\n\nCosta Rica is playing for pride after losing its opening game 7-0 to Spain, while Japan looks to prove the win over Germany wasn't a fluke.\n\nJapan, who pressured Germany early, have stayed back against Los Ticos, splitting the possession battle (Japan 44%, Costa Rica 56%). The best attacking attempt for Japan came from Ritsu Doan, who drove into the box, but his cross was stamped out by goalkeeper Keylor Navas .\n\nWant to watch the U.S. men's national team return win-or-go-home match against Iran, see what's likely Lionel Messi's last go with Argentina and Cristiano Ronaldo with Portugal or witness France's title-defense run?

Rather than having to guess whether that was or wasn’t a handball, or why a goal was waved off, the match official will announce the offense, who committed it and the VAR decision.\n\nIf that sounds similar to what the NFL has been doing for years, that’s the idea. FIFA wants to have transparency for what are often controversial calls. Fans might still disagree with the result, but at least there won’t be questions about what the call was and, more importantly, why.\n\nHere’s all you need to know about VAR:\n\nWhat is VAR?\n\nIt stands for video-assistant referee, and it utilizes technology to make or confirm calls that could be missed by the match official.\n\nWorld Cup history:Different name, bigger fields.

Just like in NFL games.\n\nWill this mean extended stoppage time, like we saw at the men’s World Cup in Qatar last fall?\n\nYes. FIFA wants to be as accurate as possible, both in the calls that are made and the actual times of the games. Referees have been told to be meticulous about tracking the time spent on VAR calls, goal celebrations, injuries and substitutions, and to add every second of it to the end of regulation.\n\nEven one or two VAR calls will add several minutes, so lengthy amounts of stoppage time won’t be out of the norm.

Nearly 14 minutes were added to the second half of Saudi Arabia's stunner against Argentina, and nine minutes were added to the second half of the U.S. victory over Iran to advance to the knockout rounds.\n\nBut what is stoppage time, how does it work and why is so much being added to this World Cup? Here's what to know:\n\nFOLLOW EVERY MATCH: Live World Cup scores\n\nFIFA WORLD CUP: How does the tournament work? The ultimate soccer showcase, explained\n\nWhat is stoppage time?\n\nSoccer match are 90 minutes long, comprised of two 45-minute halves. But how it differs from sports like basketball and American football is the clock counts up instead of down, and it never stops. So if the ball goes out of bounds or players are lining up for a penalty kick, the clock continues.\n\nThat's where stoppage time, also known as added or injury time, comes into play. Once each half gets to the 45 minute mark, stoppage time is added. Typically, there's at least one minute added to each half.\n\nStoppage time also is added to each of the two extra time periods in the knockout stages of the World Cup.\n\nWHAT IS OFFSIDE IN SOCCER?: Explaining the rule so you're prepared to watch the 2022 World Cup\n\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS A TIE?: FIFA World Cup extra time and penalty shootouts, explained\n\nHow does stoppage time get decided?\n\nThere are numerous factors taken into account of how much stoppage time will be added, all decided by the head official on the field.\n\nReasons for stoppage time include, but are not limited to:\n\nInjuries\n\nSubstitutions\n\nPlayers lining up for out of bounds throw and free, corner, goal or penalty kicks\n\nReferees issuing yellow or red cards\n\nGoal celebrations\n\nVideo assistant referee stoppages\n\nOther delays like water breaks due to high temperatures\n\nWhen there is a delay in play, the head referee keeps track of how long it lasts. Then when the half nears the mandated 45 minutes, the head referee communicates the total amount of lost time to the side official, who displays the number of added minutes on a digital board for the players and coaches to see.\n\nWHAT IS A YELLOW CARD IN SOCCER?: How players get red cards, suspensions in World Cup, explained\n\nWhy is so much stoppage time added during the 2022 World Cup?\n\nBefore any matches were played, FIFA made it a point of emphasis to its referees that it wants more activity to happen on the field.\n\n\"The purpose is to offer more show to those watching the World Cup,\" FIFA referees committee chairman Pierluigi Collina said ahead of the tournament, according to the Associated Press.\n\nCollina added referees have been instructed to keep track of all delays in the game in an effort to maximize the amount of effective game play. This comes after Soccer Metrics Research found the average amount of effective playing time in the 2018 World Cup was between 52 to 58 minutes, much lower than the 60 to 67 minutes range at the 2014 World Cup.\n\nReferees are also taking into account any delays that happen during the stoppage time, further adding more extra time that indicated by referees.\n\nAs a result, five of the longest stoppage times added to a half in World Cup history have happened this year, according to Opta Joe.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nFollow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}]}

It is the latest in a series of state and federal criminal indictments stemming from the Trump campaign's \"fake elector\" scheme to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTrump and his allies allegedly devised a plan to recruit fake electors to replace legitimate presidential electors in key battleground states and reverse Trump's loss, according to state indictments in Georgia, Michigan, and Arizona and a federal indictment in Washington, D.C.\n\nHere's a closer look at the plot:\n\nWho are electors?\n\nPresidential elections are determined by the Electoral College. All electors meet in their states to collect the results of the presidential election and to send their votes to Congress for certification the month after a presidential election. Each candidate has a slate of electors who have pledged to vote for that candidate.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTechnically, voters actually choose electors for their preferred presidential candidate, rather than the candidate herself. The electors for the candidate who wins the plurality of votes in a state then cast Electoral College votes on behalf of that candidate, except in Maine and Nebraska, in which the two electors corresponding to the state's two Senate seats vote for the winner, while the rest correspond to congressional districts and vote for the winner of the vote in the district.\n\nThe Constitution and federal laws provide general requirements for elector selection. Electors cannot be members of Congress, hold high-level federal positions or have engaged in an insurrection or rebellion against the U.S.\n\nWhat was the fake electors scheme?\n\nAfter the Trump campaign's efforts to overturn his losses in key swing states were defeated in court, his campaign hatched a plot to draft alternative slates of electors in seven states Biden carried: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nTrump's electors met on Dec. 17 to cast fraudulent votes for Trump and sign certificates falsely claiming they were legitimate electors, which they sent to the National Archives and Congress. The watchdog group American Oversight has published some of the fake certificates.\n\nTrump and his allies pressured then-Vice-President Mike Pence to use the fake elector certificates to refuse to certify Biden's Electoral College victory during the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6., 2021 on the grounds that there were competing slates of electors and doubt as to which should be counted.\n\n“We would just be sending in ‘fake’ electoral votes to Pence so that ‘someone’ in Congress can make an objection when they start counting votes, and start arguing that the ‘fake’ votes should be counted,” Jack Wilenchik, an Arizona-based pro-Trump lawyer based in Arizona, wrote in an email to Trump advisor Boris Epshteyn.\n\nElectors who have been indicted for their role in this scheme include former Arizona Republican Chair Kelli Ward and Arizona Republican state Sens. Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern, Georgia Republican Party Chair David Shafer, and Michigan GOP National Committeewoman Kathleen Berden.\n\nThe 1960 precedent\n\nIn 1960, the results of the vote count in Hawaii remained in dispute as Dec. 14 approached, to meet and cast its votes drew near. A recount was underway but it did not appear as though it would be completed by the time the Electoral College was expected to convene, on Dec. 19, 1960.\n\nRepublican Vice-President Richard Nixon claimed was leading and the governor formally certified a slate of electors declaring him the victor, but Sen. John F. Kennedy's campaign drafted an alternate slate of electors. Kennedy electors ended up being certified by the governor after Kennedy won a recount.\n\nThe Trump campaign claimed this as a precedent for their alternative elector slates. However, historians have noted several differences: Hawaii's competing elector slates were chosen in public, while Trump's were in secret, and there was an ongoing recount in Hawaii in 1960, whereas all seven states Trump tried to overturn had unequivocally determined Biden won.\n\nWhat charges do Trump and his allies face?\n\nThe federal 2020 election indictment charges Trump with four felony counts: conspiracy to defraud the U.S., conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding on Jan. 6, 2021, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiracy against rights.\n\nThe Georgia indictment charged Trump and 18 of his allies with violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, Act for a pressure campaign on state election workers, a scheme to use so-called fake electors and more. Four defendants have pleaded guilty, including Trump lawyers Kenneth Chesebro, Jenna Ellis, and Sydney Powell.\n\nTrump and his allies such as former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani also face other charges in the Georgia indictment, including conspiracy to commit forgery in the first degree, and solicitation of violation of oath by public officer.\n\nIn the federal election subversion case, Trump faces four felony charges: conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights.\n\nContributing: John Fritze", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/26/wisconsin-could-prosecute-trump-2020-fake-electors/73452583007/", "title": "Wisconsin is the last state that may prosecute Trump's fake electors", "text": "After Arizona became the fourth state to bring charges against fake electors involved in the Trump campaign's alleged scheme to overturn the 2020 presidential election Wednesday night, eyes turned to the three remaining states where the effort took place: New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nOfficials in New Mexico and Pennsylvania have said they are unlikely to prosecute Trump allies who sent documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence purporting to certify Trump won the election in their state, because those fake electors placed certain limits on their claims. That leaves Wisconsin as the state most likely still to pursue charges.\n\nProsecutors had already filed charges in Michigan, Nevada and Georgia. In Georgia, defendants include Trump himself, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. And Trump is facing federal charges in Washington, D.C., of conspiracy and obstruction related to the effort. Trump has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare him immune from those charges.\n\nThe top law enforcement official in Wisconsin hasn’t tipped his hand on whether his office is investigating the question, but he also hasn’t ruled out prosecution.\n\nGillian Drummond, a spokesperson for Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, said the department “does not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation, except in unique public safety circumstances,” but Kaul “believes that those who committed crimes in an effort to unlawfully subvert the outcome of an election should be held accountable.”\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nWisconsin was key in the Trump campaign’s effort\n\nTen Wisconsin Republicans signed a document falsely saying they were “the duly elected and qualified electors” for the state, that they had met in Madison, and all had voted for Trump. But they weren’t duly elected or qualified because voters in Wisconsin chose Biden by a margin of just under 21,000 votes.\n\nThe alleged scheme was largely rooted in on a memo that came out of Wisconsin, where a recount in the close race was underway, according to the Justice Department's indictment of Trump. The memo advocated that a slate of Trump electors should meet and vote for him in case Trump won the recount.\n\nThe indictment said Trump’s campaign and others “took the Wisconsin memo and expanded it” to states that Trump said he was contesting, “even New Mexico, where the defendant had lost by more than ten percent of the popular vote.”\n\nBiden won the recount, and Wisconsin’s governor, Democrat Tony Evers, declared Biden’s electors the legitimate ones from the state.\n\nThe Trump electors wrote in their certificate that they met and voted for Trump on Dec. 14, 2020, the same day the state Supreme Court rejected the Trump campaign’s legal challenge. State officials continued rejecting the claim that Trump won Wisconsin.\n\nWhile the 10 Wisconsin fake electors have not faced criminal charges, two of the legitimate electors from 2020 sued them along with two lawyers, Jim Troupis and Kenneth Chesebro, involved in the scheme. The Republicans settled the case.\n\n\"This is a scheme to overturn the election that was launched here in Wisconsin and then metastisized to those other six states,\" said Jeff Mandel, a lawyer with the left-leaning group Law Forward, which represented the legitimate electors. He called Troupis and Chesebro \"the linchpins of the scheme for the whole nation.\"\n\nElectors in Pennsylvania and New Mexico unlikely to face charges\n\nIn Pennsylvania and New Mexico, the fake electors didn't claim to be the real electors, only the electors whose votes should be counted if Trump succeeded in getting their states to reverse his loss − an important legal caveat.\n\nPennsylvania’s Trump electors wrote that their votes for Trump should be counted only “if, as the result of final non-appealable court order or other proceeding prescribed by law, we are ultimately recognized as being the duly elected and qualified electors.”\n\nThat language represented a watering-down of the original scheme Trump’s campaign sought and was something the campaign didn’t want catching on with other states, according to the Justice Department’s indictment of Trump.\n\n“Though their rhetoric and policy were intentionally misleading and purposefully damaging to our democracy, based on our initial review, our office does not believe this meets the legal standards for forgery,” the office of then-Attorney General Josh Shapiro wrote in a statement to Lancaster Online. Shapiro, a Democrat, is now the governor.\n\nLikewise, New Mexico’s Trump electors wrote that their filing was prepared “on the understanding that it might later be determined that we are the duly and elected qualified electors.”\n\nThe office New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez investigated but said the conditional language “prevents the filing of criminal charges.” Instead, Torrez, a Democrat, asked the state Legislature to pass new laws safeguarding the state’s elections.\n\nCharges in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada range from forgery to racketeering\n\nThe grand jury in Georgia handed down the most sweeping and serious case involving the elector scheme. The case charged 19 people − including Trump, Meadows and Giuliani − in a racketeering case under a law usually reserved for Mafia bosses.\n\nThe Arizona grand jury charged 18 people − including 11 fake electors, Meadows and Giuliani− with crimes including conspiracy and forgery. The indictment lists Trump as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, charged 16 people with counts that included conspiracy to commit forgery and publishing a false record. The indictment named Trump as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nIn Nevada, a grand jury indicted six fake Trump electors, several of whom were state Republican officials.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated the name of the Wisconsin Gov.

Why the six people cited in Trump's indictment pose a ...", "text": "WASHINGTON −The federal government's criminal indictment of Donald Trump lists six people who allegedly conspired with him to try to steal the 2020 election, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, a former Justice Department official and a political consultant.\n\nAny of the six could deepen Trump's already dire legal jeopardy should they decide to cooperate with special counsel Jack Smith to avoid facing criminal charges of their own.\n\nFormer prosecutors and other legal analysts told USA TODAY they were struck by the fact that Smith did not announce charges against any of the six even though the indictment describes them as crucial cogs in a broad Trump-led conspiracy to try to overturn Joe Biden's victory. In a process known as \"flipping,\" prosecutors often use the implied threat of potential criminal charges to pressure suspected co-conspirators into cooperating against their main target − in this case Trump.\n\nAnd if Smith can get even a few to flip, it would help his case tremendously.\n\nNone of the six were cited by name in the indictment, but USA TODAY has determined the identities of four: Giuliani; former Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Clark; and attorneys John Eastman and Sidney Powell.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nA fifth appears to be attorney Kenneth Chesebro. A sixth was identified only as “a political consultant who helped implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors” to block Congress from officially certifying Biden’s win and paving the way for the orderly transfer of power from one administration to the next.\n\nFormer Trump White House special counsel Ty Cobb was one of several legal analysts who said one of the most likely reasons Smith didn’t seek indictment of the six is because he’s trying to pressure them into providing incriminating evidence against Trump – and to possibly testify against him at trial.\n\nCobb said the indictment, from what it says and doesn’t say, makes clear that the grand jury hearing evidence in the case is still working and looking at additional charges. And the fact that the six are listed as conspirators, and not unindicted co-conspirators, he said, suggests Smith intends to seek grand jury indictments of them “unless they work out some arrangement with the government.\"\n\nA lawyer for Eastman, Harvey Silverglate, said in a statement that his client has not and will not be engaged in plea bargaining in the case with state or federal prosecutors. USA TODAY reached out to representatives of others believed to be named in the indictment but got no response.\n\nMore bricks in the wall\n\nTimothy Heaphy, who was lead investigator on the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection, said the potential cooperation of the six people listed as co-conspirators would be crucial to the special counsel’s prosecution of Trump.\n\n“Every single brick that is placed on the wall – and a co-conspirator’s testimony would be a pretty heavy brick – makes the wall harder to penetrate” for Trump’s defense team, Heaphy said.\n\nHeaphy, a former federal prosecutor, said the playbook in any conspiracy case – from a drug distribution enterprise to Trump’s efforts to overturn an election – is to use the leverage of a potential criminal charge to bargain with co-conspirators for more information and possible cooperation.\n\nThe cooperation of Giuliani – if he were to flip – would undoubtedly be the most significant of the six, Heaphy said. Giuliani, who was Trump’s attorney and top strategist leading up to Jan. 6, helped promote many of the falsehoods about election fraud in the 2020 election cited in the indictment.\n\n“Rudy Giuliani is not quite the architect but at least one of the leaders in implementing the multi-part plan” to overturn the election, Heaphy said.\n\nHeaphy and the House special committee interviewed Giuliani, who cited attorney-client privileges repeatedly, as well as Clark and Eastman, both of whom cited their Fifth Amendment rights on all questions. Powell provided some information in response to questions, Heaphy said. The panel did not interview Chesebro.\n\nTrump also did not speak to the Jan. 6 committee despite being subpoenaed.\n\nPredicting who might flip, and what their value is\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Barbara McQuade cautioned that at least some of the six alleged co-conspirators, if not all of them, might decide to stay loyal to Trump and not cooperate with the ongoing investigation.\n\nTrump, and some of his Republican supporters in Congress, have given them that incentive by hinting that Trump should, and would, pardon such people if reelected president.\n\n\"It is always difficult to predict whether a co-conspirator will flip. A defendant and his lawyer must assess his own likelihood of conviction at trial versus the benefit of pleading guilty and cooperating,” McQuade said.\n\n“Sometimes people remain loyal to their criminal associations. A prosecutor does not file charges unless he already has evidence sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction, so Jack Smith is not likely counting on any of them to flip.”\n\nThe value of any of them is mixed, McQuade said.\n\nOn the one hand, their proximity to Trump means they probably have information that could be valuable to prosecutors, she said. But on the other, “they likely all have credibility problems in light of their alleged lies about the election.\"\n\nPotent weapon to flip co-conspirators\n\nSmith has several potent weapons, though, that he can use pressure co-conspirators into cooperating, including some that the Jan. 6 committee did not, according to Heaphy, Cobb and others.\n\nOne is the ability to obtain information via subpoena, or the threat of a subpoena. Using that, the special counsel already has obtained a potential gold mine of information from other key players in Trump’s alleged schemes to overturn the election results.\n\nAt the center of that effort, according to Cobb and others, is Mark Meadows, Trump’s chief of staff before, during and after Jan. 6.\n\n“I have been saying for more than a year that he’s cooperating,” Cobb said of the former congressman who was at Trump’s side during the weeks and months after he lost the election in November 2020.\n\nMeadows has refused to comment on whether he is cooperating with the Justice Department investigation being led by the special counsel’s office. But he already has publicly acknowledged handing over 2,319 text messages to the Jan. 6 committee.\n\n“Meadows is probably almost as much an architect of this indictment as Jack Smith is because he is a witness to 80% of what's been alleged,” Cobb said. “They’ll build the narrative around Meadows and they will have him on the stand forever, I'm sure, detailing everything that happened.”\n\nDenver Riggleman, another Jan. 6 committee investigator, said the committee tried to get Meadows’ “call detail records,” which show to whom he talked, when he talked to them and possibly also where he was when he talked to them. He has said publicly that he’s certain that with its subpoena power, Smith and the Justice Department have gotten those, and used them – and Meadows himself – as a foundation for the whole indictment.\n\nBecause Meadows has some association with many of the alleged co-conspirators in the indictment, his cooperation could encourage others to seek a deal as well that could lower their chances of being prosecuted and, if so, serving a lengthy prison sentence.\n\nAnother wild card, they say, is what former Vice President Mike Pence knows about the various and allegedly illegally schemes laid out in the indictment, and what level of cooperation he might provide.\n\nPence is mentioned in the indictment as having taken contemporaneous notes of key meetings and phone calls in which Trump pressured him to go along with the scheme.\n\nAnd then there are all of the other potential eyewitnesses, including more than a dozen White House staffers at the time, who already have cooperated with the Jan. 6 committee and provided testimony to the grand juries Smith is using to bring the election fraud case against Trump.\n\nCobb and other legal analysts said that even if it’s only informed speculation that key players like Meadows are cooperating, that puts considerable added stress on alleged co-conspirators to come clean because of what they know about what those already cooperating might be telling the special counsel’s office and its prosecutors and investigators.\n\nA rundown of the six co-conspirators and what they allegedly did\n\nThe first is Rudy Giuliani, a key legal and, at times, operational architect of Trump's efforts to overturn the election results in various states. He was also central to the Trump-led effort to falsely claim that the election had been stolen, including making now-debunked comments about two Georgia election workers whom he accused of pulling out “suitcases” of illegal ballots. Giuliani worked with a group of outside attorneys feeding Trump rumors and unfounded allegations of voter fraud long after White House insiders told the President that he had lost the election and needed to concede. The indictment also referred to discussions between the former New York City mayor and prosecutor and former Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers in which Bowers asked for evidence of election irregularities and Giuliani promised to deliver them − and then never did.\n\nThe second is John Eastman, a Trump attorney and former Texas law professor who has stated he was dealing directly with Trump at times in the weeks after the election. The indictment says he circulated a \"two-page memorandum\" outlining the plan to try to persuade Pence to subvert the Constitution and throw out the 2020 election results on Jan. 6. According to Bob Woodward and Robert Costa in their book \"Peril,\" that memo was written by Eastman. CNN later reported on the memo as well. The Jan. 6 committee also found thatEastman and others devised the plan for Vice President Pence to declare the electoral votes from certain states could not be counted on Jan. 6, a measure he had previously said was not legal. Eastman pleaded the Fifth Amendment 100 times before a deposition for the Jan. 6th committee.\n\nThe third is attorney Sidney Powell, an inside member of the legal team working with Giuliani and others to overturn the election results. Powell filed or helped file lawsuits in several states over alleged but now debunked election fraud and made numerous public claims of outside influence in the election − including from Venezuela and even satellites. Former Trump White House staffer Hope Hicks told Jan. 6 investigators that the president had privately acknowledged that Powell’s ideas for overturning the election results “sounded crazy.” Powell showed up unannounced at the White House on Dec. 18, 2020 with a team of outside attorneys to discuss election theories, the Jan. 6 committee found, triggering a contentious, unplanned six-hour meeting with the president and his White House staff advisors.\n\nThe fourth is Jeffrey Clark, who the indictment says “attempted to use the (justice) department to open sham election crime investigations and influence state legislatures with knowingly false claims of election fraud.\" Clark, who had been nominated by Trump to be an assistant attorney general at the Department of Justice, allegedly also sent letters to Georgia officials about overturning the election. Clark invoked his Fifth Amendment right 125 times during a deposition for the Jan. 6 committee.\n\ndepartment to open sham election crime investigations and influence state legislatures with knowingly false claims of election fraud.\" Clark, who had been nominated by Trump to be an assistant attorney general at the Department of Justice, allegedly also sent letters to Georgia officials about overturning the election. Clark invoked his Fifth Amendment right 125 times during a deposition for the Jan. 6 committee. The fifth isn't as crystal-clear as some of the others, but the evidence points to it being Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney credited with writing strategic emails and memos about the efforts to overturn the vote in the key states. The Jan. 6 internal report said Chesebro drafted and distributed documents intended for use in “the Trump team’s fake elector ceremonies” that were distributed to several states. The indictment refers to those memos, saying they were sent with “fraudulent elector instructions, along with fraudulent elector certificates that he had drafted.”\n\nThe identity of the sixth is also unclear. It could be one of a few people involved in constructing the fraudulent slates of presidential electors in a flurry of emails and conference calls during the first two weeks of December 2020. The indictment describes the person as “a political consultant” who spoke with alleged co-conspirators 1 and 5 in conference calls organized by the Trump campaign on Dec. 7 and 12 and circulated conditional language in the fraudulent elector certificates.\n\nValuable but 'not indispensable'\n\nLegal experts said cooperation from the six is not necessary for the Justice Department to get a Trump conviction.\n\n“It would be valuable for any of the six to cooperate with the government and testify against Trump,” said Norman Eisen, who served as a special counsel for the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee during Trump's first impeachment.\n\n“It’s not indispensable because my assessment of the indictment is that the government already has a lead cooperator who is going to serve as the government’s tour guide into and through the conspiracy. And that’s Mark Meadows.”\n\nLike Cobb and others, Eisen believes Meadows is a cooperating witness for the government.\n\n“It's inconceivable given his level of involvement in the events, which was second only to Trump's, that he would otherwise be excluded from the list,” Eisen said. “That’s relevant to the value of the co-conspirators. That downgrades the value of cooperation.”\n\nEisen said the standard for prosecuting a president is “not just proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but proof well beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n\nHe said government cooperation from the six “can make it worse” for Trump but believes the Justice Department “has the receipts to obtain and sustain a conviction, and then some.”\n\nEisen said Smith made the right call to defer charging decisions for the six so he could first indict Trump in the broader interest of the country. Eisen said it is also possible that Smith lacks the evidence to charge others right now.\n\nIf the government does have evidence to prosecute the six, they face a choice of loyalty to Trump versus the possibility of jail time if later charged. One major consideration whether to flip, according to Eisen, could be anticipating a scenario in which Trump is reelected in 2024 and pardons them after taking office.\n\n“That blend of loyalty and calculation is part of what's going on.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/08/politics/donald-trump-jr-meadows-text/index.html", "title": "CNN Exclusive: 'We control them all': Donald Trump Jr. texted ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nTwo days after the 2020 presidential election, as votes were still being tallied, Donald Trump’s eldest son texted then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows that “we have operational control” to ensure his father would get a second term, with Republican majorities in the US Senate and swing state legislatures, CNN has learned.\n\nIn the text, which has not been previously reported, Donald Trump Jr. lays out ideas for keeping his father in power by subverting the Electoral College process, according to the message reviewed by CNN. The text is among records obtained by the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021.\n\n“It’s very simple,” Trump Jr. texted to Meadows on November 5, adding later in the same missive: “We have multiple paths We control them all.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See ex-Trump official's reaction to Trump Jr.'s 'revealing' texts 04:16 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Trump Jr.’s lawyer Alan S. Futerfas said, “After the election, Don received numerous messages from supporters and others. Given the date, this message likely originated from someone else and was forwarded.”\n\nImmediately before his text to Meadows describing multiple paths for challenging the election, Trump Jr. texted Meadows the following: “This is what we need to do please read it and please get it to everyone that needs to see it because I’m not sure we’re doing it.”\n\nThe November 5 text message outlines a strategy that is nearly identical to what allies of the former President attempted to carry out in the months that followed. Trump Jr. makes specific reference to filing lawsuits and advocating recounts to prevent certain swing states from certifying their results, as well as having a handful of Republican state houses put forward slates of fake “Trump electors.”\n\nIf all that failed, according to the Trump Jr. text, GOP lawmakers in Congress could simply vote to reinstall Trump as President on January 6.\n\n“We have operational control Total leverage,” the message reads. “Moral High Ground POTUS must start 2nd term now.”\n\nThe text from Trump Jr. is revealing on a number of levels. It shows how those closest to the former President were already exchanging ideas for how to overturn the election months before the January 6 insurrection – and before all the votes were even counted. It would be another two days before major news outlets declared Joe Biden the winner on November 7.\n\nThe text also adds to a growing body of evidence of how Trump’s inner circle was actively engaged in discussing how to challenge the election results.\n\nOn March 28, Judge David Carter, a federal judge in California, said that Trump, along with conservative lawyer John Eastman, launched an “unprecedented” campaign to overturn a democratic election, calling it “a coup in search of a legal theory.”\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, an attorney for Meadows, declined to comment for this story. A spokesperson for the House select committee declined to comment.\n\nForeshadowing the Trump campaign strategy\n\nIn the weeks following the 2020 election, Trump and his allies eventually filed more than 60 unsuccessful lawsuits in key states, failing to convince the courts that his claims about a stolen election were justified, or uncover any evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n\nThey also called for various recounts based on those same unfounded voter fraud claims. A number of states conducted recounts in the months after the election, though none of them revealed any fraud substantial enough to have changed the outcome of the vote in any state.\n\nWhile Trump Jr. was publicly pushing various voter fraud conspiracy theories and generally casting doubt about the results in states like Pennsylvania and Georgia, his text to Meadows reveals there were other ideas being discussed privately.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump-endorsed candidate asked about January 6. Watch what happened next 01:48 - Source: CNN\n\nSpecifically, Trump Jr. previews a strategy to supplant authentic electors with fake Republican electors in a handful of states. That plan was eventually orchestrated and carried out by allies of the former President, and overseen by his then-attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n\nIn his text to Meadows, Trump Jr. identifies two key dates in December that serve as deadlines for states to certify their electoral results and compel Congress to accept them. Though the dates are largely ceremonial, in his text Trump Jr. appears to point to them as potential weaknesses to be exploited by casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election results.\n\nSeeking Trump electors\n\nTrump Jr.’s November 5 text to Meadows came as similar notions of faithless electors were starting to percolate publicly on conservative social media. Trump Jr. sent the text to Meadows at 12:51 p.m., just minutes after conservative radio host Mark Levin had tweeted a similar idea and suggested state legislatures have final say on electors.\n\nIf secretaries of state were unable to certify the results, Trump Jr. argues in his text to Meadows that they should press their advantage by having Republican-controlled state assemblies “step in” and put forward separate slates of “Trump electors,” he writes.\n\n“Republicans control Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina etc we get Trump electors,” Trump Jr. adds.\n\nTrump Jr.’s text, however, refers to an untested legal theory that state houses are the ultimate authority in elections and can intervene to put forward a different slate of electors than those chosen by the voters, when in reality this is a ceremonial process and the outcome is essentially a foregone conclusion.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump dangles pardons for Jan. 6 rioters while teasing 2024 run 00:58 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Justice Department and the House committee are both investigating the fake electors plot within the context of what unfolded on January 6 and Trump’s broader effort to overturn the election.\n\nThe strategy floated by Trump Jr. is similar to what was outlined by former Texas Governor and Trump Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who texted Meadows on November 4 suggesting three state legislatures ignore the will of their voters and deliver their states’ electors to Trump.\n\n“HERE’s an AGRESSIVE (sic) STRATEGY: Why can t (sic) the states of GA NC PENN and other R controlled state houses declare this is BS (where conflicts and election not called that night) and just send their own electors to vote and have it go to the SCOTUS,” Perry’s text message read.\n\nA spokesman for Perry told CNN at the time that the former Energy secretary denies being the author of the text. However, multiple people who know Rick Perry previously confirmed to CNN that the phone number the committee has associated with that text message is Perry’s number.\n\n‘We control them all’\n\nTrump Jr. also texts Meadows that Congress could intervene on January 6 and overturn the will of voters if, for some reason, they were unable to secure enough electoral votes to tip the outcome in Trump’s favor using the state-based strategy.\n\nThat option, according to Trump Jr.’s text, involves a scenario where neither Biden nor Trump have enough electoral votes to be declared a winner, prompting the House of Representatives to vote by state party delegation, with each state getting one vote.\n\n“Republicans control 28 states Democrats 22 states,” Trump Jr. texts. “Once again Trump wins.”\n\n“We either have a vote WE control and WE win OR it gets kicked to Congress 6 January 2021,” he texts Meadows.\n\nIn a series of memos in early January, conservative lawyer John Eastman proposed a variation of that idea.\n\nEastman’s memo laid out a six-step plan for Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election for Trump, which included throwing out the results in seven states because they allegedly had competing electors. In fact, no state had actually put forward an alternate slate of electors – there were merely Trump allies claiming without any authority to be electors.\n\nEastman, who has been subpoenaed by the House select committee and is fighting to keep some of his records secret from investigators, was accused by Carter of likely engaging in a criminal conspiracy with Trump to overturn the election.\n\n“Dr. Eastman has an unblemished record as an attorney and respectfully disagrees with the judge’s findings,” his attorney Charles Burnham said in response to the judge’s ruling.\n\nTrump Jr. pushes Meadows to fire Wray and install loyalist at FBI\n\nTrump Jr. ends his November 5 text by calling for a litany of personnel moves to solidify his father’s control over the government by putting loyalists in key jobs and initiate investigations into the Biden family.\n\n“Fire Wray; Fire Fauci,” he texts, referring to FBI Director Christopher Wray and White House coronavirus adviser Anthony Fauci. Trump Jr. then proposes making former acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell interim head of the FBI and having then-Attorney General Bill Barr “select Special prosecutor on HardDrivefromHell Biden crime family.”\n\nAs Trump refused to concede in the days and weeks after the 2020 election, rumors swirled that he was still considering firing Wray, along with several other top officials with whom he had grown frustrated.\n\nTrump and his allies sharply criticized Wray for failing to produce information that they claimed would be harmful to the President’s political enemies, including Biden. CNN previously reported that the prospect of Trump firing Wray hung over the FBI for weeks, dating to before Election Day.\n\nWhile Wray remains in his post and Barr resigned in mid-December 2020 without naming a special prosecutor to investigate the Bidens, Trump Jr.’s text underscores just how precarious the situation at DOJ was in the immediate aftermath of the election.\n\nThe same is true for Trump Jr.’s recommendation that Meadows replace Wray with Grenell, someone who not only lacked the usual qualifications to lead the FBI but also had a proven track record of doing the former President’s bidding.\n\nAfter serving a controversial three-month stint as Trump’s acting intel chief, Grenell hit the campaign trail in late 2020 to help promote Trump’s unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud and support his legal challenges in a key swing state: Nevada.\n\nOn November 5, Biden held a slim lead over Trump in Nevada but appeared poised to win the state’s six electoral votes. That same day, Grenell and Trump campaign officials announced they were filing a new lawsuit to “stop the counting of illegal votes” but provided no evidence to support their claims of rampant fraud.\n\nThis story has been updated with new details of a text message Trump Jr. sent to Meadows.", "authors": ["Ryan Nobles Zachary Cohen Annie Grayer", "Ryan Nobles", "Zachary Cohen", "Annie Grayer"], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/politics/donald-trump-capitol-riot-pardons-2024-republicans/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Donald Trump offers chilling glimpse into possible second ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump conjured a vision of a second term that would function as a tool of personal vengeance, and become even more authoritarian than his first, when he vowed to pardon US Capitol insurrectionists if he runs for the White House again and wins.\n\nHis pledge at a Texas rally Saturday was accompanied by a call for demonstrations if prosecutors in New York, who are probing Trump’s business practices, and those in Georgia, looking into his attempts to reverse his election loss in the state, do anything that he defined as wrong or illegal. The comments underscore Trump’s obsession with delusional lies that he won the 2020 election, and his determination to put that falsehood at the core of the Republican worldview. As was often the case during his four years in office, Trump’s pardons threat shows that he still makes no distinction between his personal goals and the national interest or rule of law.\n\nBut the former President’s new rhetorical outburst also at times hinted at concern with his own legal position, and comes at a moment when various criminal and congressional lines of investigation seem to be tightening around him. The House select committee probing the January 6, 2021, riot has now penetrated deep inside Trump’s West Wing inner circle, and he lost a Supreme Court bid to keep key documents secret. The likelihood of a damning accounting from the committee, bristling with new details about Trump’s attempt to destroy American democracy, is growing, though the GOP has sought to thwart it at every turn.\n\nAs well as further threatening US democracy on Saturday night, Trump was preoccupied with his personal legal exposure. He fired off a wild attack, which looked to be racially-motivated, on two Black New York prosecutors investigating whether his business empire deliberately falsified accounts to get preferential treatment on loans and income taxes. He also alluded to potential legal peril he’s facing in Fulton County, Georgia, where a Black district attorney has been granted a special grand jury to examine his attempt to steal President Joe Biden’s win in the state.\n\nIn a sign of the potential impact of Trump’s incitement, District Attorney Fani Willis wrote to the FBI on Sunday asking for an immediate risk assessment for the Fulton County Courthouse and government buildings. She said that “security concerns were escalated this weekend” by the former President’s speech and added that her office had already received “communications” from people unhappy with the investigation before Trump’s rally.\n\nTrump’s pressure on investigators prompted Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who sits on the House committee probing the insurrection, to warn that the ex-President had issued a “call to arms.”\n\n“Calling out for demonstrations if, you know, anything adverse, legally, happens to him, is pretty extraordinary. And I think it’s important to think through what message is being sent,” the California Democrat told CNN’s Pamela Brown on Sunday.\n\nIn yet another sign of Trump’s incessantly consuming inability to accept his election loss, he issued a statement that same evening slamming former Vice President Mike Pence for refusing his demands to overturn the result of the democratic election in 2020, and falsely claimed that the then-vice president had the power to do so.\n\nWith Trump and his fans already referring to him as the 45th and the 47th President, his fixation with the 2020 election may also represent a growing problem for the Republican Party. In the midterm elections in November and beyond, the GOP wants to build a case that Biden is weak, flailing at home and abroad and has lost his grip on inflation. But Trump, who wants to use the elections to demonstrate his hold on the GOP grassroots, threatens to detract from that simple Republican message. While the ex-President remains wildly popular with the “Make America Great Again” crowd, his loss in 2020 poses the question of whether Republicans – and independents and suburban swing voters – want to get stuck forever in Trump’s unhinged 2020 feedback loop. Some other potential 2024 presidential candidates, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, are meanwhile demonstrating that Trump’s populist nationalism and assault on what supporters view as liberal elites will be waged long after the 45th President has left the scene.\n\nDemocrats failed in their attempt to make Trump the bogeyman in last year’s Virginia gubernatorial election, when Republican Glenn Youngkin kept his distance from the ex-President and tapped into voter concerns about education, Covid exhaustion and rising prices. But it will be an easier case for Democrats to make when Trump is holding wild rallies in swing states and again makes himself the face of the party in 2022, spreading his lies, spewing increasingly racist rhetoric and behaving like an autocrat in waiting.\n\nTrump signals possible new abuse of power\n\nTrump’s latest comment on pardons was in line with his attempt to whitewash the truth of a day when his mob, incited at his Washington rally, invaded the Capitol to try and disrupt the certification of Biden’s win, beat up police officers and sent lawmakers running for their lives. Throughout his presidency, he used the chief executive’s pardon power to shield his political cronies.\n\n“If I run and if I win, we will treat those people from January 6 fairly. We will treat them fairly,” Trump said on Saturday. “And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons. Because they are being treated so unfairly.”\n\nPeople dragged into the criminal justice system because they tried to stage a coup based on lies about a stolen election are not being treated unfairly. But it is characteristic of Trump’s democracy-threatening brand of politics to play up a sense of grievance and victimhood. He spent four years of his twice-impeached presidency sowing a narrative that opponents and subordinates who tried to check him were in fact the ones guilty of abusing power. And he repeatedly sought to force the Justice Department to embrace his anti-constitutional schemes.\n\nSeveral high-profile Republicans quickly dismissed Trump’s offer to help January 6 insurrectionists. New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who disappointed the national party by passing on a Senate bid, said on Sunday that those responsible for the insurrection must be held accountable. Asked by CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” about the possibility of a pardon for such Trump supporters, Sununu, who is emerging as a standard bearer for a possible post-Trump GOP, said: “Of course not. Oh my goodness, no.”\n\nOne of Trump’s closest enablers, Sen. Lindsey Graham, also dismissed Trump’s promise in an appearance on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “I think it’s inappropriate. I don’t want to reinforce that defiling the Capitol was okay. I don’t want to do anything that would make this more likely in the future,” the South Carolina Republican said. His comments were notable since he has previously warned that the GOP needs to find a way to work with Trump if it wants to wield power. Another Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, also condemned Trump’s remarks. “I do not think … President Trump should have made that pledge to do pardons. We should let the judicial process proceed. January 6 was a dark day in our history,” said Collins, who just won reelection in 2020, speaking on ABC’s “This Week.” She also said it was “very unlikely” that she would support Trump if he does officially decide on a third presidential run.\n\nWyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, one of the party’s most vocal critics of Trump and his hold on the Republican Party, tweeted Monday that “Trump uses language he knows caused the Jan 6 violence; suggests he’d pardon the Jan 6 defendants, some of whom have been charged with seditious conspiracy; threatens prosecutors; and admits he was attempting to overturn the election. He’d do it all again if given the chance.”\n\nThis must have been a case of déjà vu for Republicans who often had their talking points overshadowed by the ex-President’s extremism when he was in power. But it is one thing for key Republicans to criticize the ex-President now. On every previous occasion when the GOP faced a choice between appeasing Trump to keep or win power and standing up for American democracy and the rule of law, it has chosen the first option. In a sense, Trump’s demagoguery this weekend was a fresh sign that he is convinced that his personality cult still holds his party in thrall.\n\nThe House Republican conference has already demonstrated that it would act as a vessel of Trump’s power and vengeance if it wins the majority in November. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has put the ex-President at the center of his efforts to become speaker of the House and has been put on notice by pro-Trump members like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene that departures from the ex-President’s dogma could doom his hopes. And former Speaker Newt Gingrich encapsulated the extremism of the House GOP when he suggested last week that a new majority should throw members of the January 6 committee in jail.\n\nTrump fires off racist attack on New York prosecutors\n\nThe ex-President’s speech was also notable for an extraordinary assault on prosecutors in New York who are investigating allegations of fraud at his business empire. The ex-President called for “the biggest protests we have ever had” if the prosecutors “do anything wrong or illegal.” New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. are both leading investigations into Trump’s business empire. And both are Black, a point that Trump hinted at in his complaints about his treatment.\n\n“These prosecutors are vicious, horrible people. They’re racists and they’re very sick – they’re mentally sick,” he said. “They’re going after me without any protection of my rights from the Supreme Court or most other courts. In reality, they’re not after me, they’re after you,” he told his crowd.\n\nIt was the second recent occasion when Trump has sought to stir up racial hatred as part of his increasingly dangerous rhetoric. He claimed at a rally in Arizona two weeks ago that White people could not get Covid-19 treatment or vaccines in New York, grossly distorting a policy that says that race should be one factor in the use of limited therapies for a disease that disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic populations.\n\nTrump’s speech once again presented a conundrum about how much attention should be paid to an ex-President who is using his high profile to stir division and outrage in order to stay politically relevant. Yet given his power in the Republican Party and the intensity of those who follow a once and possible future President who has already incited a coup to overthrow an election, it would be unwise to ignore the implications of his rage.\n\nEven out of office, Trump has convinced millions of Americans that the election was stolen and Biden is an illegitimate president. Multiple Republican-run states have passed laws that make it harder to vote and easier for political officials to interfere in election results rooted in his false claims of voter fraud. And Trump is touring the country inciting polarization and racial animus as the hot favorite for the GOP 2024 nomination.\n\nJohn Dean, a former White House counsel to President Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal, condemned Trump’s remarks on pardons in a chilling tweet.\n\n“This is beyond being a demagogue to the stuff of dictators. He is defying the rule of law. Failure to confront a tyrant only encourages bad behavior,” Dean wrote. “If thinking Americans don’t understand what Trump is doing and what the criminal justice system must do we are all in big trouble!”", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/politics/supreme-court-lindsey-graham-clarence-thomas/index.html", "title": "Clarence Thomas freezes order for Lindsey Graham to testify before ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas on Monday agreed to temporarily freeze a lower court order requiring the testimony of Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in front of an Atlanta-area special grand jury that is investigating efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in the state.\n\nThomas acted alone because he has jurisdiction of the lower court that issued the original order.\n\nThomas’ move is an administrative stay that was most likely issued Monday to give the Supreme Court justices more time to consider the dispute.\n\nThe court has asked for a response from the Georgia investigators by Thursday.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat, is spearheading a special grand jury investigation into Donald Trump-aligned efforts to manipulate the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. She has indicated that she would like to question Graham on calls he made to election officials in Georgia after the election.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican senator is arguing that such testimony is foreclosed by the Constitution’s Speech or Debate clause, which shields legislators from certain law enforcement action for conduct connected to their legislative duties.\n\nA spokesperson for Fulton County declined to comment on Thomas’ move to pause the subpoena. CNN has reached to representatives for Graham.\n\nLower courts had said that, to the extent Graham was making the calls to the Georgia election officials as part of fact-finding for the congressional certification of President Joe Biden’s win, that could be out of bounds under the Constitution. But the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals had said that “communications and coordination with the Trump campaign regarding its post-election efforts in Georgia, public statements regarding the 2020 election, and efforts to ‘cajole’ or ‘exhort’ Georgia election officials” are not legislative activities protected by the Speech and Debate Clause.”\n\nWillis’ probe recently secured the grand jury testimony of former Georgia Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, CNN reported last week.\n\nThe Fulton County probe was launched with the aim of looking at the hour-long January 2021 phone call from then-President Trump to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger asking the election chief to “find” the votes necessary for Trump to win the state. The investigation now encompasses several other aspects of the Trump-world machinations to reverse his loss in Georgia, including presentations on unfounded election fraud claims to state lawmakers, the fake elector scheme, efforts by unauthorized individuals to access voting machines in one Georgia county, and a campaign of threats and harassment against lower-level election workers, CNN has reported.\n\nThe litigation over whether Graham can be compelled to testify before the special grand jury has been playing out since the summer.\n\nGraham turned to the Supreme Court for intervention on Friday. He told the justices in court filings his phone calls with Georgia officials were related to the “impending vote on certifying the election,” and because, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time, he was charged with “reviewing election-related issues.”\n\nHowever, the senator also argued to the high court that his motives were irrelevant to the protections that Constitution offers lawmakers for legislative conduct,\n\n“The district court’s and District Attorney’s apparent suspicions about motives are baseless, but even assuming otherwise, the Speech or Debate Clause was designed to prevent exactly this sort of examination,” he wrote. He added that a lower court was “wrong, also, to think that any other lines of hypothetical questioning would be permissible.”\n\nSteve Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and University of Texas Law School professor, said Monday’s order doesn’t mean Graham will never appear before the grand jury.\n\n“These kinds of ‘administrative stays’ are not predictive of how the full court, or even the justice who issued it, is likely to vote,” Vladeck, said, as he noted a recent, separate case in which a lower court order from Justice Sonia Sotomayor was eventually allowed to go into effect after a brief pause so the justices could consider.\n\n“The bigger question is how the full court is going to rule, and today’s order tells us nothing about the answer,” he added.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue Tierney Sneed", "Ariane De Vogue", "Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2022/11/18/trump-2024-run-impeachment-lawsuits-failed/10695936002/", "title": "Trump 2024 exposes GOP impeachment failures, timid US justice ...", "text": "There’s no more definitive indictment of the U.S. legal and political systems than Donald Trump’s entry into the 2024 presidential race a week after his Big Lie candidates crushed Republican hopes and dreams nationwide.\n\nYou’d think by now there would be another way to use the words Trump and indictment in the same sentence.

The scheduled execution follows criticism over the state’s last two lethal injection attempts, including one that was called off after the execution team had trouble finding a vein. Kenneth Eugene Smith, 57, is set to die at Holman Correctional Facility on Nov. 17, according to a Friday order from the Alabama Supreme Court. Smith was sentenced to death for the killing of Elizabeth Dorlene Sennett, a 45-year-old grandmother and pastor’s wife. Prosecutors said Smith was one of two men who were each paid $1,000 to kill Sennett on behalf of her husband, the Rev. Charles Sennett, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect on insurance. Elizabeth Sennett was found dead March 18, 1988, in the couple’s home in Colbert County. The coroner testified that she had been stabbed eight times in the chest and once on each side of the neck. The pastor killed himself a week later. Smith maintained it was the other man who stabbed Elizabeth Sennett, according to court documents. Smith was initially convicted in 1989, and a jury voted 10-2 to recommend a death sentence, which a judge imposed. His conviction was overturned on appeal in 1992. He was retried and convicted again in 1996.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Acting state Revenue Commissioner Deven Mitchell has been chosen as the new chief executive officer of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. The announcement was made Monday by the fund’s board. The corporation said in a statement that the selection “is contingent on the successful negotiation of a salary and benefits package” and that a start date has not yet been set. Mitchell has called Alaska’s nest-egg oil wealth fund the state’s “trump card” as a renewable source of revenue, the Anchorage Daily News reports. His message to the board was that he would not chase short-term cash yields, as the fund has been invested for long-term growth. He also said he doesn’t see the CEO’s role as second-guessing investment decisions made by the corporation’s chief investment officer or as overriding his decisions. Earnings from the fund traditionally have been used to pay annual dividends to residents. Since 2018, earnings also have been used to help pay for state government. Mitchell last month stepped down as the state’s debt manager and executive director of the Alaska Municipal Bond Bank Authority when Gov. Mike Dunleavy appointed him to be the acting Department of Revenue commissioner.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An abortion clinic has come up with a way for patients who can end their pregnancy using a pill to get the medication quickly without running afoul of a resurrected state law that bans most abortions. Under the arrangement that began Monday, patients will have an ultrasound in Arizona, get a prescription through a telehealth appointment with a California doctor, and then have it mailed to a post office in a California border town for pickup, all for free. While not as easy as before an Arizona judge ruled that a pre-statehood law criminalizing nearly all abortions could be enforced nearly two weeks ago, the process saves an overnight trip to a major California city with an abortion clinic. And it is more accessible than the previous workaround used by Camelback Family Planning in Phoenix, which was to have a doctor in Sweden prescribe the pills and a pharmacy in India mail them to Arizona. That could take up to three weeks. Ashleigh Feiring, a nurse at the clinic, said the cost of the pills will be covered by the Abortion Fund of Arizona, which is helping women pay for out-of-state access to abortions. Women can use a pill for an abortion until the 12th week of pregnancy. Pills and surgical abortions were legal until about 24 weeks until the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June.\n\nArkansas\n\nNorth Little Rock: Authorities say three people have died after a fire early Tuesday at a North Little Rock apartment complex. The fire broke out shortly after 2 a.m. at an apartment near Shorter College, authorities said. North Little Rock Fire Department Capt. Dustin Free told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that three adults died in the blaze. The fire, which was extinguished by about 7 a.m., was contained to one apartment but caused the second floor of the building to collapse onto the first, Free said. “This was an all-hands-on-deck situation,” he said. “We work every day to save a life, but sometimes we are notified too late. The firefighters came in and tried to stop the fire aggressively.” The cause of the blaze remained under investigation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The past three years have been the state’s driest on record, and officials said Monday that they’re preparing for the streak to continue. The official water year concluded Friday, marking an end to a period that saw both record rainfall in October and the driest January-to-March period in at least a century. Scientists say such weather whiplash is likely to become more common as the planet warms. It will take more than a few winter storms to help the state dig out of drought. Though it’s impossible to predict with certainty what the winter will bring, “we are actively planning for another dry year,” said Jeanine Jones, drought manager for the state Department of Water Resources. Jones spoke alongside state climatologist Michael Anderson about the just-completed water year. The water year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30 so that the rainiest winter months are recorded together. Snow that falls in California’s mountains typically provides one-third of the state’s annual water supply, but last year snow levels were far below average by the end of the winter. The Colorado River, another major source of water for Southern California, is also beset by drought, threatening its ability to supply farmers and cities around the U.S. West.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man survived a bear attack in his own backyard when he fired at the animal and scared it away after it threw him to the ground, state wildlife officials said. The attack occurred Saturday night in the small town of New Castle, Colorado Parks and Wildlife area manager Kirk Oldham said in a news release. The man went into his backyard after hearing a noise and encountered the bear, which threw him to the ground, officials said. He then threw up an arm to protect his face while grabbing a gun with his free hand and firing three shots, they said. It’s unknown whether the bear was hit by the bullets. The man told Parks and Wildlife that he had seen the bear in his yard the previous two nights. Heavy rain made it difficult for Parks and Wildlife officers to find and follow a blood trail and bear tracks as they searched for the animal, the news release said. They were still searching Monday. The man, whose name was not released, was treated at a hospital for minor injuries to his hand and arm and bruising on his chest, the release said. It’s the second bear attack in the western Colorado town in the past three months as bears prepare for hibernation, Oldham said. In August, a bear charged a woman and swiped at her, lacerating her arm and back. She recovered, and a mother bear and cub were euthanized, The Denver Post reports.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal by the Connecticut State Police Union in its challenge of a police accountability law that allows public disclosure of certain state trooper personnel files and internal investigation reports. At issue were documents in internal probes that end with no finding of wrongdoing. The union argued the 2020 state law violated the 2018-2022 troopers’ contract by stripping away its exemptions from state freedom of information laws and allowing such documents to be publicly released. Union officials say troopers oppose the law because it allows records involving unfounded allegations to become public, possibly tarnishing a trooper’s reputation despite no findings of wrongdoing. The Supreme Court did not say anything about the case in rejecting it among a host of others, as is typical. The decision upholds rulings by lower federal courts that upheld the state law. Andrew Matthews, executive director of the state police union, said the decision is going to have a chilling effect. Proponents of the 2020 law, which included many other reforms, said it answered the calls for reform, including accountability and transparency, after the police killings of George Floyd and other Black people.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Elevated lead levels in water were found at nearly 50 schools, prompting the Delaware Division of Public Health to advise shutting off at least one school’s drinking water supply in New Castle. Water samples were taken from 25 locations at the Wallace Wallin School in the Colonial School District last year and on multiple occasions throughout the summer, with all but three coming back with elevated lead levels. The results prompted the school to shut off its drinking water supply throughout the building at the beginning of the school year and utilize bottled water while the state continues to test the water quality and determine a plan for remediation, said Ted Lambert, director of facilities for the school district. The Wallin School is one of 47 schools across the state that tested positive for elevated levels of lead, according to results released by the state last month. Wallin’s highest results were over 12 times the maximum acceptable level in a staff break room. Lead levels from a water fountain outside a classroom at the school came back nine times higher than acceptable levels. According to federal standards, acceptable levels of lead in water must be lower than 0.015 milligrams per liter; however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes says there is no safe blood level for young children.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With an ambitious goal of ending generations of racial discrimination, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a plan Monday to boost Black homeownership, hoping to place 20,000 families into their own homes by 2030, WUSA-TV reports. “We know we want to add more homes, but we want to be intentional about making sure people can afford those,” Bowser said in the announcement at the Howard Theatre. According to a report gathered by the Black Homeownership Strike Force, only 34% of D.C.’s Black residents owned their own homes in 2019, compared to 49% of white residents. The task force pointed to a history of discriminatory practices that have prevented Black families from attaining property and generational wealth. Bowser’s plan attempts to correct both. “These recommendations are ambitious but are imminently doable if we all work together,” said Vanessa Perry with the Housing Finance Policy Center. The task force issued 10 recommendations including using the mayor’s allotted $10 million down payment to help families buy and maintain homes and rezoning neighborhoods to allow for more multifamily housing. “I am standing before you as a testament that homeownership is possible,” Brittney Freeman told the crowd at the Howard. “I am indeed my ancestors wildest dreams.”\n\nFlorida\n\nPolk City: A 21-year-old deputy appears to have been fatally shot by friendly fire from deputies with whom he was serving a warrant in central Florida early Tuesday, authorities said. The Polk County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that Deputy Blane Lane was shot in the left arm and chest at a trailer in Polk City while serving a warrant with three other deputies on a suspect wanted for failing to appear on a felony drug charge. Shots were fired after deputies discovered the suspect with what appeared to be a handgun pointed at them but actually was a BB gun. Two of the deputies fired their guns, and “the round that struck Lane came from one of their firearms,” the sheriff’s office statement said. The deputy, who Sheriff Grady Judd described as one of the youngest on the force, was taken to a hospital, where he died “despite valiant efforts,” the sheriff said. The suspect, Cheryl William, also was hit multiple times. She was taken to a hospital where she was in stable condition. She faces a felony second-degree murder charge, among other charges, the sheriff’s office said. The sheriff’s office planned to hold a line-of-duty death funeral with full law enforcement honors for Lane.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The prosecutor investigating whether ex-President Donald Trump and his allies broke the law trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state is seeking search warrants in the case, a sign that the wide-ranging probe has entered a new phase. The revelation came Monday in a court order filed by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who’s overseeing the special grand jury seated to help the investigation. In an order sealing any search warrants and related documents from being made public, McBurney wrote that District Attorney Fani Willis’ office is “now seeking to obtain and execute a series of search warrants, the affidavits for which are predicated on sensitive information acquired during the investigation.” Disclosure of the information could compromise the investigation, McBurney wrote, “by, among other things, causing flight from prosecution, destruction of or tampering with evidence, and intimidation of potential witnesses.” It could also result in risks to the “safety and well-being” of people involved in the investigation, he wrote. It wasn’t immediately clear who the targets of the search warrants are or whether any search warrants had yet to be approved by a judge.\n\nHawaii\n\nJoint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam: The commander of the task force responsible for draining fuel from a World War II-era storage tank facility that leaked jet fuel and poisoned Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year said Monday that he’s exploring ways to get community feedback. Rear Adm. John Wade told reporters at a news conference he may establish an advisory group, but he’s not sure yet what form it will take. He said getting input from the community will help him be more responsive. He said Hawaii’s elected officials told military leaders that it would be valuable for them to give the community a voice in their work. “I don’t have the structure yet. It’s still a work in progress, but I think it’s something that’s important,” said Wade, the commander of Joint Task Force Red Hill. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced Wade’s appointment last month. In November, jet fuel spilled from a drain line at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, flowing into a drinking water well and then into the Navy’s water system serving 93,000 people in and around Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. Nearly 6,000 sought medical attention for ailments like nausea, headaches and sores. The military put about 4,000 families in hotels for several months. Wade said he’s started reaching out to Hawaii’s congressional delegation and other local leaders.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal judge has ordered the state and its prison medical care provider to pay more than $2.5 million in legal fees to a transgender inmate who sued after she was denied gender confirmation surgery. The cost, however, will not come out of taxpayer dollars. Instead, it will be covered by Corizon Correctional Healthcare under a separate agreement with the state. Adree Edmo sued the state and the Idaho Department of Correction’s health care provider, Corizon, in 2017, alleging they were violating her Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment by denying her gender confirmation surgery. Edmo identifies as female, but she had long been housed in the men’s prison while she served a 10-year sentence for sexually abusing a 15-year-old boy. In her lawsuit, she asked a judge to order the state to allow her to change her name, provide her with access to gender-appropriate clothing, transfer her to a women’s correctional facility and provide her with gender-confirmation surgery. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill ruled in 2018 that the state must provide Edmo with the surgery and said that continuing to deny the treatment would place her at risk of irreparable harm. The state appealed Winmill’s ruling, and it was two more years before she received the gender confirmation surgery, becoming the second person in the U.S. to undergo the surgery while incarcerated. She was transferred to a women’s prison to serve the remainder of her sentence and was released in 2021.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A Cook County judge on Monday threw out convictions for eight more people whose cases were linked to a notorious former Chicago police sergeant who regularly framed people for drug crimes they didn’t commit. Judge Erica Reddick vacated the convictions and sentences of the men in response to motions filed jointly by their attorneys and the Cook County State’s Attorney Office. The action followed the dismissal of 44 convictions in April and brought to 237 the number of vacated convictions in recent years linked to former Sgt. Ronald Watts and his tactical unit, State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said. Watts, a Black sergeant, led a team that for nearly a decade until 2012 planted drugs or falsely accused residents of a public housing complex and others who were visiting or simply happened to be in the area. Watts and another officer pleaded guilty in 2013 to stealing money from an FBI informant. Watts received a 22-month prison sentence. “Vacating these convictions provides just a fraction of relief for those who spent time in prison, away from their families, and we will never be able to give them that time back,” Foxx said. “We will continue to review these cases as we seek justice for all his victims.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: At the start of the pandemic, the number of people killed in homicides across the state as a result of domestic violence jumped 180%, as shutdowns and stay-at-home orders sometimes led to unintended consequences such as locking people in with their abuser. But while businesses, schools and workplaces have reopened, and building capacities have returned to normal, experts say domestic violence homicides have not decreased as much as they expected. In the past decade, Indiana has averaged 55 to 60 deaths from domestic violence annually, according to the Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence. From June 2020 to July 2021, domestic violence homicides jumped to 98. The coalition tracks such deaths through news media and advocacy organizations that report when a person dies as a result of domestic violence. It often means the numbers are much lower than reality, which makes the rising number of deaths recorded in the past two years more concerning. The coalition’s latest data show there hasn’t been a corresponding reduction in homicides from domestic violence as shelters returned to full capacity and social distancing requirements loosened. Seventy-seven people from 2021 from late June this year died in Indiana from domestic violence.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A state board on Monday rejected claims for $1 million payments for 52 prison inmates who were given six times the proper dose of COVID-19 vaccines last year. The three-member State Appeals Board, which considers state legal financial obligations, unanimously denied the claims from inmates who received the extra doses in April 2021. The 52 inmates who each sought a $1 million payment were among 77 prisoners at the Iowa State Penitentiary in Fort Madison who had been given overdoses of the Pfizer vaccine by prison nursing staff. The board – made up of State Auditor Rob Sand, State Treasurer Michael Fitzgerald and Iowa Department of Management Director Kraig Paulsen – accepted the recommendation of the Iowa attorney general’s office lawyers to reject the claims. The lawyers advised that under the federal Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, “the state is immune from claims arising out of administration of the COVID-19 vaccine.” The mistaken doses occurred after the vaccine was delivered in concentrate form that was supposed to be diluted with saline solution. Two nurses were fired after the incident. A spokesman for the union representing prison staff said the overdoses happened after the prison abruptly switched from using the Moderna vaccine to the Pfizer version.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Enrollment in the state’s public universities and colleges is on a downward trend that started before COVID-19 but surged as more teenagers have pursued other options after high school. Headcount enrollment, or the raw number of individual students across the Kansas Board of Regents system, decreased by 1% overall, according to the Regents’ count released Thursday. Meanwhile, full-time equivalent enrollment – calculated by dividing the total number of credit hours taken by 15 hours for undergraduates and 15 for graduate students – fell by a slightly lower amount of 0.9%. In a statement, Regents chair Jon Rolph, Wichita CEO of the Thrive Restaurant Group, said the board acknowledges the declines but is working as a system to reverse the trend. “Our system is taking decisive action to reverse declining enrollments, better serve students and ensure that our state has the workforce needed to grow the Kansas economy,” Rolph said. “Initiatives such as our general education package and implementation of student success initiatives will help our system serve and graduate more students.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: While the battle over a voter referendum that will determine the future of abortion rights in Kentucky has drawn considerable attention, it is not the only constitutional amendment on the ballot this fall that could have a large political impact on the future of the state. Constitutional Amendment 1 is a rather lengthy, 744-word ballot referendum that essentially would give more power to the General Assembly – letting legislators call themselves into a special session and potentially extending regular sessions to end later in the year. Currently, only a governor can call legislators into a special session, in which they may pass bills that are within the parameters set by the governor. The Republican supermajority that pushed for the ballot referendum wants to be able to initiate special sessions with legislation of their choosing, while Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear wants to retain this power in the governor’s office. Under the proposed amendment, the Legislature could be called into a special session by a joint proclamation of the House speaker and Senate president, though they could only meet for a maximum of 12 days per calendar year in such sessions. Kentucky is one of just 14 states in which only the governor can call the legislature into a special session.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: An outspoken Christian conservative attorney has asked a federal appeals court to revive a pastor’s damage claims against state officials over long-expired COVID-19 restrictions. A federal judge this year dismissed minister Tony Spell’s lawsuit against Gov. John Bel Edwards and others over enforcement of the ban. Spell drew national attention for his flouting of the restrictions early in the pandemic at his church in Central, near Baton Rouge. One of Spell’s attorneys is Roy Moore, the former Alabama Supreme Court justice and U.S. Senate candidate, who insisted in arguments this week before a panel of judges from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the state had no authority whatsoever to restrict church gatherings. Panel members appeared skeptical of that claim in arguments Monday. But they raised the question of whether Spell’s church was unfairly restricted, compared with other public gathering places, such as shopping mall food courts. “They have treated us differently,” Moore said. “But the basis of our argument is there is no jurisdiction to limit a church attendance.” Spell has had some legal victories in his fight with the state. Louisiana’s Supreme Court threw out state charges against him in May, ruling 5-2 that restrictions in place at the time violated Spell’s freedom of religion.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunkport: The Kennebunkport Heritage Housing Trust, a local nonprofit organization whose mission is to build 25 affordable or “attainable” homes in town by 2025, has completed one neighborhood and is now actively seeking properties on which to build a second and third, according to Executive Director Larissa Crockett. Heritage Woods, the completed neighborhood, includes six new homes, all purchased and now occupied. One morning last month, Crockett stood on Briggs Way – named after Patrick Briggs, the president of KHHT – and said the new homes there are designed to accommodate the way people live today. “Inside, they have really bright, open, sunny, airy, shared spaces,” she said, looking at the duplexes and single homes in view. Tanya Alsberg and Jennifer Armstrong are an example of two people whom KHHT has helped attain their own home in Kennebunkport. In April 2021, Alsberg and Armstrong stood at the edge of an excavated, gravel-filled hole and dreamed. Now, at the very same site, they live in their own home, thanks to KHHT. They bought and moved into the place in February. “We’re kind of crazily happy,” Alsberg said. “Every single day, we do the happy dance. Now that we’re here, it has changed our lives. ... It’s a lovely home.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A Johns Hopkins University scientist who created a website to track COVID-19 cases worldwide is the recipient of this year’s Lasker award for public service. The $250,000 awards, announced last week by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, recognize achievements in medical research. The public service award went to Lauren Gardner, an engineer who studies the spread of diseases. She worked with her lab team to develop the COVID-19 tracker as the coronavirus began spreading worldwide in January 2020. The dashboard became a key resource and now tracks global cases, deaths, vaccines and more. Through it all, the team has made the tracker freely available to the public. The dashboard set “a new standard for public health data science” and helped inform both personal decisions and policy, the Lasker Foundation said in a release.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A former Northeastern University employee who said he was injured when a package he was opening on campus exploded last month was charged Tuesday with fabricating the incident. Jason Duhaime, formerly the new technology manager and director of the university’s Immersive Media Lab, was charged with “conveying false and misleading information related to an explosive device” and then lying to federal investigators, federal authorities said. “This alleged conduct is disturbing to say the least,” U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins said at a news conference. “Our city, more than most, knows all too well that a report or threat of an explosion is a very serious matter and necessitates an immediate and significant law enforcement response, given the potential devastation that can ensue.” Duhaime told investigators the hard plastic case exploded when he opened it Sept. 13, causing “sharp” objects to fly from the case and injure his arms, but his arms only had superficial marks, and there was no damage to his shirt or signs the case had been near an explosion, investigators said. The case also contained a rambling yet “pristine” typed note full of misspellings and exclamation points that railed against virtual reality, referenced Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and threatened to “destroy” the lab. And investigators found a word-for-word electronic copy stored in a backup folder on a university computer in Duhaime’s office – written just hours before he called 911.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A judge dismissed charges Tuesday against seven people in the Flint water scandal, including two former state health officials blamed for deaths from Legionnaires’ disease. Judge Elizabeth Kelly took action three months after the Michigan Supreme Court unanimously said a different judge acting as a one-person grand jury had no authority to issue indictments. Kelly rejected efforts by the attorney general’s office to just send the cases to Flint District Court and turn them into criminal complaints, the typical path to filing felony charges in Michigan. “Simply put, there are no valid charges,” Kelly said. Kelly’s decision doesn’t affect former Gov. Rick Snyder because he was charged with misdemeanors, and his case is being handled by a judge in a different Flint court. But he, too, was indicted in a process declared invalid by the state Supreme Court. In 2014, Flint managers appointed by Snyder took the city out of a regional water system and began using the Flint River to save money while a new pipeline to Lake Huron was being built. But the river water wasn’t treated to reduce its corrosive qualities. Lead broke off from old pipes and contaminated the system for more than a year. Separately, the water was blamed for an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease, which typically spreads through heating and cooling systems.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Two of the four former police officers who were convicted of violating George Floyd’s civil rights during the May 2020 restraint that killed him were scheduled to begin serving their federal sentences Tuesday. The Bureau of Prisons typically would assign J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao to a federal facility, but authorities had not publicly said where they would go. They are scheduled to go to trial on state charges of aiding and abetting both murder and manslaughter later this month. The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office said it anticipated Kueng and Thao would be transferred into its custody for the trial, but further specifics were not provided for security reasons. Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill issued an order Monday saying the sheriff’s office must provide the men with access to three sets of clothing for the trial – as well as for two hearings scheduled for later this week – further suggesting that they will be in local custody. Kueng, Thao and Lane were convicted earlier this year of depriving Floyd of his right to medical care as the 46-year-old Black man was pinned under former Officer Derek Chauvin’s knee for 91/ 2 minutes while handcuffed and facedown on the street. Kueng knelt on Floyd’s back, Lane held his legs, and Thao kept bystanders back.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: Forty years after Mississippi University for Women started enrolling men, its president says the school should consider choosing a more inclusive name. Previous attempts to remove “women” from the name, including the most recent one in 2009, have brought strong backlash from alumni of the school, nicknamed the W. Men make up about 18% of the 2,700 students at MUW. In a letter to alumni, President Nora Miller said the university is creating a task force to examine a name change, the Commercial Dispatch reports. Miller said she received a letter in May from the Deans Council at the university, acknowledging the current name presents “challenges.” “I assure you, no matter what happens, we maintain our historic commitment to academic and leadership development for women, forever embracing our status as the first state-supported college for women in the United States,” Miller wrote in the letter sent Sept. 28. The president of MUW in 2009, Claudia Limbert, proposed changing the name to Reneau University to honor Sallie Reneau, who wrote to the Mississippi governor in the mid-19th century to propose a public college for women. That renaming effort fizzled amid opposition from outspoken graduates.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A $40 million tax credit package for farmers and other agricultural businesses neared passage Monday, when a committee voted to send the bill to the full state Senate. The bill was expected to come up for a final Senate vote Tuesday. The measure extends several agricultural tax credits that expired and creates some new tax credits, including breaks for gas stations that sell biodiesel and fuel with a higher percentage of ethanol. The legislation also would expand government loan programs for farmers in the state. The Republican-led Missouri Legislature passed a bill with similar provisions during the regular legislative session this year, which ended in May. But GOP Gov. Mike Parson vetoed the measure, citing a two-year sunset attached to the tax credits that he said was too short. He also said the bill unconstitutionally included a provision on recycled asphalt shingles, violating a rule against including multiple topics in the same legislation. Parson called a special session – primarily focused on cutting individual income taxes in the state – and tasked lawmakers with extending the agricultural tax breaks for at least six years. Lawmakers last week sent Parson a bill to cut individual income taxes from 5.3% to 4.95% beginning next year.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A judge struck down as unconstitutional three laws that restricted voting in the state, saying there was no evidence of the widespread voter fraud that the 2021 Republican-sponsored laws ostensibly were targeting. The laws ended same-day voter registration, imposed new identification requirements on students and restricted third-party ballot collections. The restrictions were put on hold in April under a temporary injunction later upheld by the Montana Supreme Court. Election officials declined to say if they would appeal the latest ruling to the state high court. And with the election just over a month away, it’s uncertain if justices would render a decision before Nov. 8. Native American tribes that sued over the laws argued the student ID and ballot collection measures would hurt voters on remote reservations, where many people live far from polling places and are dealing with poverty and other challenges. Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen, who oversees elections in the state, requested the voting measures last year as Republicans around the country changed voting laws in the wake of the November 2020 election. The moves followed claims made by ex-President Donald Trump and parroted by his supporters that the election was stolen.\n\nNebraska\n\nHalsey: Progress has been made in containing a large Sandhills wildfire where one firefighter died while fighting the flames, which also destroyed much of a popular youth campsite and threatened a small village, officials said Tuesday. The Bovee Fire in west-central Nebraska’s remote Thomas County was 30% contained Tuesday morning, according to a statement from the Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team, which has taken over management of the scene. Favorable weather conditions, including high humidity, temperatures in the 60s and some rainfall, are helping fire crews contain the grasslands blaze that was sparked Sunday afternoon and ballooned to 15,000 acres, or about 24 square miles, within six hours. The fire destroyed the main lodge and cabins of the Nebraska State 4-H Camp, as well as an observation tower in the Bessey Ranger District of the Nebraska National Forest. Purdum Volunteer Fire Department Assistant Chief Mike Moody died Sunday after suffering an apparent heart attack while battling the fire, officials said. Officials ordered the evacuation of the nearby village of Halsey and shut down a stretch of Nebraska Highway 2 as smoke from the fire cut visibility. The highway was reopened by Monday. Officials have said the fire was “human-caused” but have not released details.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A $20,000 reward is now being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever killed five wild horses in eastern Nevada late last year, the Bureau of Land Management announced Monday. BLM officials said the National Mustang Association pledged to double the previous $10,000 reward in the case. Authorities said five mortally wounded horses were discovered Nov. 16 in Jakes Valley, about 30 miles west of Ely. They said the horses all were located within 600 yards of each other about 2 miles south of U.S. Highway 50, and an aborted fetus was attached to one of the dead animals. The BLM is investigating and prosecuting the killings as part of the enforcement of the Wild Horses and Burro Act of 1971.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state has resumed COVID-19 mobile vaccination clinics and a home-based vaccination program. “As we move into the fall and winter, we want to make sure everyone has access to the updated COVID-19 booster doses that better protect against the most recently circulating COVID-19 variants,” Patricia Tilley, the state’s director of Public Health Services, said in a statement Tuesday. Three mobile vaccination vans are available to provide free COVID-19 inoculations, both primary series and updated booster doses. Public and private clinics will be available statewide. The home-based program visits any part of the state to provide free COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses to those individuals who are unable or have difficulty leaving their home or have been advised by a medical provider that their health or an illness could worsen by leaving their home. The programs are funded through the American Rescue Plan and will run through March 2023. Groups can schedule a mobile vaccination clinic at on-sitemedservices.com/van or by calling (603) 826-6500, and residents can make an appointment for a home-based COVID-19 vaccine or a booster dose at on-sitemedservices.com/vaccine or by calling (603) 826-6500.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The Assembly approved a revised version of a state child tax credit Monday, fixing an error in the legislation that would have delayed payments for two years. The Legislature passed the program in June, and Gov. Phil Murphy signed it into law, providing a refundable credit of up to $500 per year for each child under the age of 6. The program was a response by Democrats to soaring costs of living and closer-than-expected state elections last fall. But a drafting error in the initial legislation meant the credit could not be claimed until the end of the 2023 tax year, and families would not get the benefit until 2024. Monday’s vote by the Assembly moved the eligible tax year forward, so the credit will be available next year. The state Senate approved the fix last week. The program will cost the state $135 million to $156 million annually, according to a state fiscal analysis released last week. The credit is $500 per child for families earning up to $30,000 a year. The benefit decreases by $10 for every $1,000 increase in yearly family income, until it reaches a minimum of $300 per child for a household earning up to $80,000, according to the legislation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: Pete’s Most Wanted Salsa, a new product bearing the image of New Mexico State University mascot Pistol Pete, celebrated its launch last week with a party at La Posta de Mesilla, and the university says more branded products will soon be joining a growing family of licensed NMSU merchandise. “There’s a realm of possibilities out there, and as long as it’s a good-quality product, I don’t see why this thing won’t keep expanding,” NMSU athletics director Mario Moccia said. Sales of NMSU-licensed beer, wine and whiskey are reportedly robust. Precise data was unavailable, but non-apparel licensed products – including the alcoholic products but also its other consumable and non-consumable items such as lawn chairs and tents – totaled approximately $116,700 in the last fiscal year. And the university’s licensing company stated in a recent report that NMSU ranked second among college institutions with licensed alcoholic products, including the first collegiate-branded spirit, Pistol Pete’s Six Shooter Rye Whiskey. Moreover, NMSU ranked fifth in sales of consumable licensed products among colleges and universities, according to the Collegiate Licensing Company/Learfield Licensing Partners, which licenses university-branded products\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Giant tents for temporarily housing migrants arriving in the city are being moved to an island off Manhattan from a remote corner of the Bronx, after storms raised concerns about flooding at the original site. Mayor Eric Adams announced Monday that the city’s humanitarian relief center will now be on Randall’s Island, which sits in the waters between Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. It’s connected by five bridges to the three boroughs, and people can take buses or walk off the island to reach the city’s subway system. The center’s tents had been put up in a parking lot at Orchard Beach, in the northeast part of the Bronx on Long Island Sound, where access to public transportation is limited. Images online showed water ponding at the site following rainfall over the weekend. In a statement announcing the change, Adams said while the city could have made the original location work, moving the center “is the most efficient and effective path forward.” The city’s plan for Orchard Beach had been met with concern by immigration advocates, who cited its inaccessibility among other reasons, and that concern extended to the new location. “The city must look to other solutions instead of tent cities, where our clients will be isolated, vulnerable to extreme weather, and far from public transportation and other critical services,” the Legal Aid Society and the Coalition for the Homeless said in a statement issued Tuesday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The State Board of Elections directed county election officials Monday not to engage in signature matching when reviewing absentee ballot envelopes this fall after a judge rejected the GOP appeal of a state board ruling prohibiting the practice. According to a directive sent to county election directors from the board’s legal counsel Paul Cox, the judge’s ruling maintains the status quo outlined in state law, which requires that all absentee voters fill out their ballots in the presence of two witnesses or a notary. Absentee ballot request forms in North Carolina must also include a date of birth and either a driver’s license number or the last four digits of the voter’s Social Security number. The North Carolina Republican Party had filed motions in Wake County Superior Court last week, asking the court to block the state board from enforcing its declaratory ruling that prevented county election officials from comparing signatures on absentee ballot request forms and return envelopes with the signatures included in voter registration records. Superior Court Judge Stephan Futrell ruled from the bench Monday afternoon, denying the party’s motion for a temporary restraining order and preventing the use of signature matching in the 2022 general election, state board spokesperson Pat Gannon said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A trial has been set in a federal lawsuit brought by two Native American tribes that allege the state’s new legislative map dilutes tribal members’ voting strength. The bench trial is scheduled for June 12, 2023. A bench trial means the verdict is up to the judge alone. The lawsuit filed in February by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and the Spirit Lake Tribe alleges that North Dakota’s new legislative map violates the Voting Rights Act. The Legislature during its special session last fall approved the map, based on updated census data. The map includes the new state House subdistricts for the Fort Berthold and Turtle Mountain Indian reservations. Turtle Mountain argues the split House district “packs” tribal members into a single subdistrict on its reservation, while diluting their vote in the non-reservation subdistrict. Spirit Lake alleges the new redistricting map dilutes American Indian voters on and near its reservation. A federal judge in July dismissed the state’s argument that the tribes lacked the standing to sue. Tim Purdon, an attorney for the tribes, said about half of the 14-member GOP-led redistricting committee will be called as witnesses in the trial. He would not name them.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The nation was shocked when a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim was forced to obtain an abortion in Indiana after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. But in the months since, court records detailed at least two other minors who traveled out of state for abortions because Ohio banned doctors from performing the procedure after cardiac activity was detected. New data from the Ohio Department of Health offers some insight: In 2021, 538 children ages 17 and younger legally obtained abortions in Ohio, including 57 who were younger than 15 years old. That represents 2.5% of the 21,813 abortions performed in Ohio last year. The state does not track how many abortions were performed on victims of rape and incest. The age of consent in Ohio is 16 years old. The Ohio Department of Health report offered a snapshot of abortion access in Ohio before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and the state’s six-week ban took effect. The “heartbeat bill” is now on hold, blocked temporarily by a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge. The number of abortions performed in Ohio increased by nearly 6% in 2021, the second year in a row of increased abortions. Of the 21,813 abortions performed in 2021, 20,716 were for Ohio residents, and 1,097 people came from other states.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Department of Human Services has implemented a 25% rate increase for providers who work with some of Oklahoma’s most vulnerable individuals as part of the agency’s push to eliminate its 13-year waiting list for developmental disability services. DHS on Saturday bumped its provider reimbursement rates to increase pay for a variety of medical professionals, including nurses, speech therapists, group home employees, direct care staffers who help developmentally disabled Oklahomans, and those who help low-income seniors. An official from a Sallisaw-based provider that serves Oklahomans with intellectual and developmental disabilities said this is the largest one-time rate increase nationally. Sheree Powell, government liaison at Sequoyah Enterprises Inc., said the reimbursement rate increase is key for providers to recruit and retain the best employees as businesses across the state have increased wages due to the pandemic and related worker shortage. The Legislature this year earmarked $32.5 million in new appropriations for DHS to clear its developmental disability services waiting list. Roughly one-third of that funding will go toward the provider rate increase. The boost brings hourly wages from about $9.50 to $12, DHS Interim Chief of Staff Samantha Galloway said.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A jury has awarded a racial justice demonstrator more than $1million in a federal lawsuit she filed against the city in 2020 accusing officers of violating her civil rights. Eleaqia McCrae, a Black woman, sued the city and the police department, accusing police of intentionally targeting Black people with deadly force during the protest, which followed the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police officers in May 2020. The jury found McCrae proved that Officer Robert Johnston shot her in the eye and chest with rubber bullets and violated her “Fourth Amendment right not to be subjected to excessive force.” McCrae said the bullets caused permanent vision loss and a chest injury. The jury also found she did not prove by “preponderance of the evidence” that Johnston violated her First Amendment right to lawful assembly or that he committed battery against her. She was awarded $250,000 in economic loss and $800,000 in non-economic loss, the jury verdict documents said. McCrae’s attorney, Kevin Brague, said in the lawsuit that McCrae attended a demonstration May 31, 2020, and after nightfall, people unrelated to the march arrived and began throwing objects. McCrae said she, her sister and a friend were kneeling at the front of the march when she was shot twice.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A judge has barred enforcement of an executive order signed by Mayor Jim Kenney last week banning guns and deadly weapons from the city’s indoor and outdoor recreation spaces, including parks, basketball courts and pools. Common Pleas Judge Joshua Roberts on Monday ordered Philadelphia “permanently enjoined” from enforcing the order after a legal challenge, citing Pennsylvania state law that prohibits any city or county from passing gun-control measures, The Philadelphia Inquirer reports. The Gun Owners of America, on behalf of several state residents, filed a lawsuit immediately after Kenny’s order, the latest attempt by Philadelphia officials to regulate guns inside city limits. Attorneys for the city had cited its role as a property owner managing its facilities, saying that distinguished the order from previous legislation passed by the City Council and struck down in court. Andrew Austin, who represents the plaintiffs, said in a statement that he was gratified by the court’s quick action. But he said it was “in large part because the law is so explicit: The city is not allowed to regulate possession of firearms in any manner.” “It is unfortunate that the mayor and city are willing to waste their time and taxpayer money on these type of ‘feel-good’ measures,” Austin said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: With the “Superman Building” as a backdrop and an unsheltered woman surrounded by her belongings just yards away, more than 50 protesters gathered at Burnside Park on Monday to demand that Gov. Dan McKee declare a state of emergency and take more action to provide immediate shelter to Rhode Islanders experiencing homelessness. “It’s your friends. It’s your neighbors. It’s your relatives. These people are not a separate category of human beings. They’re people who need help,” said Eric Hirsch, a Providence College professor who’s spent three decades advocating for people without housing. At last count, there were 405 people living without shelter in the state, not factoring in others who are staying with family and friends, said Hirsch, co-chair of the state’s Homeless Management Information System Steering Committee. The protest came as McKee and state Secretary of Housing Josh Saal participated in Crossroads Rhode Island’s Celebration of Housing to highlight “record investments in housing.” The event touted $12 million in state and federal money for the development of Crossroads’ Summer Street Apartments in Providence, a 176-apartment complex that will provide current residents of the Crossroads Tower with one-bedroom units that include private bathrooms and full kitchens.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Every year, law enforcement agencies across the state turn in crime data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on a voluntary basis. The optional nature of this self-reporting can leave gaps when comparing crime data from the FBI to local agencies. “You likely have seen news stories where a crime was solved or an investigation was supported or a missing person was found. It was a crime analyst who connected those dots,” said Michele Covington, executive director of USC Upstate’s Greenville programs and an associate professor of criminal justice. “When you see crime trends, and an agency is able to trend downwards, there’s usually an analyst behind that.” The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that focuses on the U.S. criminal justice system, compiled a report of which agencies fully reported, partially reported, or neglected to report crime data for the 2021 calendar year. Eighty-five percent of South Carolinians saw their jurisdictional law enforcement agency fully report 12 months of 2021 crime statistics to the FBI, despite only 30% of agencies in the state fully reporting. The largest agencies in the state by population coverage not to fully report were the York County Sheriff’s Office, Charleston Police Department and Aiken County Sheriff’s Office. Most of the major agencies missing data were located in the Midlands and Lowcountry.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Native Americans who plead guilty to first-degree manslaughter in South Dakota receive on average 11 years longer in prison than their white counterparts, according to an analysis and investigation of court records spanning 10 years. But prosecutors and judges called into question the sample size and said several factors go into sentencing decisions, such as criminal histories and the specific nature of the crime. The Sioux Falls Argus Leader pulled data from the South Dakota Unified Judicial System, filtering by charged convictions made by offenders who were Native American. The data only captures those who pleaded guilty and/or avoided a trial, reflecting the majority of convictions in the state during the past decade. The data also excludes those who were given life sentences. A total of 84 offenders pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter in South Dakota during the past 10 years, according to the data. Of those cases, 44% were white, 32% were Native American, 16% were Black, and 7% were Hispanic or Latino. Four of the 84 received a life sentence, according to the data. None of the four were Native American. White people convicted of first-degree manslaughter on average were sentenced to 35 years in prison, Native Americans to 46, Black people to 40 years and Hispanics to 42.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The snail darter, a tiny fish that derailed a federal dam during an epic battle over Endangered Species Act protection in the 1970s, is no longer considered imperiled, officials announced Tuesday. The fish held up construction of the Tellico Dam in Tennessee for more than two years as biologists and others fought to protect its only known habitat, the free-flowing Little Tennessee River. The battle, which went to the U.S. Supreme Court and beyond, is still sometimes cited as an example of environmentalist overreach, although the reality is much more complicated. The dam eventually was built, with snail darters collected and transplanted into other rivers. They were also later discovered in several additional streams. Snail darters went from being considered an endangered species in 1975 to a threatened species in 1984 as they continued to recover. Three years ago, the Center for Biological Diversity, Jim Williams and Zygmunt Plater petitioned to remove the fish from federal protection altogether. Williams is the biologist who listed the snail darter as endangered. Plater is the attorney who sued to protect it. The U.S. Department of the Interior on Tuesday announced the snail darter’s official removal from the federal list of threatened and endangered wildlife.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A man accused of killing 22 elderly women in the Dallas area and stealing jewelry and valuables has been linked by DNA evidence to one of the deaths, a prosecutor said Monday. Billy Chemirmir, 49, is on trial for capital murder in the death of 87-year-old Mary Brooks. It’s Chemirmir’s third trial. His first trial, in the smothering death of 81-year-old Lu Thi Harris, ended in a mistrial last November when the jury deadlocked. He was retried and found guilty in April and sentenced to life without parole. If convicted in Brooks’ death, he’ll receive a second sentence of life without parole. Prosecutor Glen Fitzmartin said in opening statements that while presenting evidence in the deaths of Brooks and Harris, he would also show that DNA links Chemirmir to the death of 80-year-old Martha Williams. Chemirmir has maintained his innocence. His attorney entered a not guilty plea on his behalf Monday but declined to make an opening statement. His arrest was set in motion in March 2018 when Mary Annis Bartel – 91 at the time – told police that a man had forced his way into her apartment at an independent living community for seniors, tried to smother her with a pillow and took her jewelry.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Five years after they allegedly snuck into a pig farm and recorded video of themselves smuggling two piglets away from what they said were inhumane living conditions, two animal rights activists are set to face a jury trial this week despite protests about a mistake made during Monday’s jury selection process. Wayne Hsiung and Paul Darwin Picklesimer, the two remaining defendants facing charges from the 2017 incident, could face more than 10 years in prison on charges of felony burglary and theft. They were part of a group of five people who reportedly recorded a series of disturbing videos at Circle Four Farms in Milford, Utah, where owner Smithfield Foods was operating one of the country’s largest pig farms. The other three people charged in the case struck plea deals earlier, but Hsiung and Picklesimer pursued their cases, saying they hoped they could raise awareness about animal cruelty at factory farms and potentially set new precedent if a jury determined they were justified in taking the piglets because they feared for the animals’ lives. Jury selection in the trial was set to start Monday at the 5th District Courthouse, but there was controversy even before the trial could begin after defense lawyers protested they had not received information on prospective jurors and asked for a mistrial.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: The state Health Department has confirmed five cases of Legionnaire’s disease in Franklin County, including one death, but the source of the infection is unknown, it said Tuesday. The cases were reported between Aug. 12 and Aug. 29 and appear to be clustered in the St. Albans area, the department said. The death was in a person in their 70s, it said. The general risk to residents is very low: Most healthy people exposed to the bacteria do not get sick, the Health Department said. The disease can be treated with antibiotics. Legionnaires’ disease is a form of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. Air-conditioning units for large buildings, hot tubs, cooling misters, decorative fountains or plumbing systems are common sources of infection, officials said. Symptoms, which start two to 14 days after exposure, can include a cough, muscle aches, fever, shortness of breath and headache, the department said. The disease is not contagious and almost never spreads from human to human, the department said. People with symptoms who live or work in Franklin County are encouraged to contact a health care professional. Those age 50 and older who smoke or formerly smoked, have chronic lung disease, or have a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Higher prices at the grocery store mean more and more people in the area are relying on food banks to feed themselves and their families. The Thomas Jefferson Area Food Bank has been packed, its warehouse holding rows of pallets of canned goods stacked to be packed into kits for seniors or distributed to members of the community who need emergency food. As of late, it’s also held lines of people. “This is the one day this week where it hasn’t been crowded,” said the food bank’s partner engagement manager, Joe Kreiter. Rising food costs are being blamed. Prices swelled 11.4% between August 2021 and August 2022, according to the most recent Consumer Price Index report Michael McKee, CEO of the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank, which partners with the Thomas Jefferson Area branch, said the organization served 110,000 people in July, an increase from 106,000 in June. He expects the upward trend to continue. High rent in Charlottesville and Albemarle County and a lack of affordable child care often leave little room in a family’s budget, McKee said. Single mothers, seniors and children are the three groups who depend on food-assistance programs the most. Food banks used to provide emergency food assistance, but they’ve become a regular source of food for low-income people, Kreiter said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Amazon has sued the state’s labor agency following disputes with regulators over citations and fines imposed on the company for worker safety issues. In the lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court for the Western District of Washington, Amazon asked a judge to prohibit orders from the Washington Department of Labor & Industries to remedy any types of workplace hazards during the company’s pending appeal over the citations. Amazon argued in the lawsuit that the agency has not proven any of its allegations and that requiring companies like it to remedy alleged hazards before that happens violates the due process protections under the 14th Amendment. Matt Ross, a spokesperson for the agency, said the department is aware of the lawsuit and will review it along with the state’s attorney general’s office. The agency had said in March it inspected an Amazon warehouse in Kent, Washington, and found workplace processes that “create a serious hazard for work-related back, shoulder, wrist, and knee injuries.” It said workers were expected to perform tasks, such as lifting and carrying items, at a fast pace that heightened the risk of injury. Amazon’s warehouse injury rate has been higher compared to other warehouses, which CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged earlier this year and said the company was attempting to improve.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A voucher program that would provide parents state money to pull their children out of K-12 public schools is blatantly unconstitutional and would disproportionately affect poor children and those with disabilities, a lawyer representing parents who sued the state argued Tuesday in West Virginia’s Supreme Court. The Hope Scholarship Program, which was passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature last year and would have been one of the most far-reaching school choice programs in the country, “negatively and intentionally” impacts West Virginia’s system of free schools, lawyer Tamerlin Godley told justices during oral arguments. “It decreases enrollment and thus funding,” said Godley, who is representing two parents of children who receive special education supports in West Virginia public schools. “It utilizes public funding for subsidizing more affluent families that have chosen private and home-schooling, and it silos the poor and special needs children who cannot use the vouchers.” Signed by Republican Gov. Jim Justice last year, the program was set to go into effect this school year but was blocked by Circuit Court Judge Joanna Tabit in July.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Republican-controlled Legislature took mere seconds Tuesday to reject Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ call to create a way for voters to get a chance to repeal the state’s 1849 abortion ban, even as Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson voiced support for letting the people decide the issue. The move by Evers is the latest by Democrats in the battleground state to turn the Nov. 8 election into a referendum on abortion. But Evers’ GOP opponent, Tim Michels, Johnson and other Republicans are focusing instead on crime and public safety in arguing that Democrats have failed to keep the state safe. “What people want to talk about (is) reducing crime, they want to talk about reducing inflation, they want to talk about getting more money in their pocket, and they want better schools in Wisconsin,” Michels said at a campaign stop in Baraboo when asked for his reaction to the Legislature’s action. A Marquette University Law School poll last month showed both the state’s governor and U.S. Senate races to be about even, while a majority of voters support abortion rights. The Wisconsin Senate convened for all of 15 seconds, to gavel in and adjourn, the special session called by Evers to pass a constitutional amendment that would create a pathway for an up-or-down vote on the state’s abortion ban.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: An owl at the Teton Raptor Center has tested positive for avian influenza, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. It’s the first case of the deadly disease this fall in Teton County, and the great horned owl was euthanized humanely, the center said in a statement.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/27/python-haul-beef-theft-ring-kansa-warrior-statue-news-around-states/50877423/", "title": "Python haul, beef theft ring: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state Supreme Court has upheld a decision removing a probate judge from office who was accused of racist and sexually inappropriate behavior that included showing an explicit video to an employee and making inappropriate comments after George Floyd’s murder by a police officer. The justices last week unanimously upheld the 2021 decision by the Court of the Judiciary – a disciplinary panel that hears complaints against judges – to remove Randy Jinks as Talladega County probate judge. The Alabama Court of the Judiciary, the panel tasked with hearing ethics complaints against judges, last year ruled that Jinks failed to uphold the integrity and independence of the court system. The initial complaint against Jinks included that he made derogatory comments about women and African Americans, including references to Floyd, whose death sparked nationwide protests. The panel ruled that there was clear and convincing evidence that Jinks had displayed inappropriate behavior that included showing an explicit video to an employee; asking an attorney if he knew of an acronym involving a racial slur; asking a Black employee if he was selling drugs after he purchased a new car; and other inappropriate comments.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The running mate of Republican gubernatorial candidate Charlie Pierce said Tuesday that she’s withdrawing from the campaign team and urging voters to support Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s reelection bid instead. Edie Grunwald, who was running for lieutenant governor on a ticket with Pierce, in a statement cited “recent circumstances” surrounding Pierce that led her to make her decision. The decision was announced two weeks before the Nov. 8 election. Pierce, a former Kenai Peninsula Borough mayor, was sued last week by a woman who said he sexually harassed her when she worked as an assistant. The lawsuit also lists the borough as a defendant. Pierce did not immediately return a message from the Associated Press on Tuesday. On Saturday, after a candidate forum in Anchorage, he told the AP he had no plans to end his campaign. Grunwald, in her statement, said: “I support and advocate for the respectful treatment of women in politics, the workplace and the world in general. I believe my stepping down at this time is in the best interest of Alaskans and a demonstration of my support for all women, regardless of political affiliation.” Early and absentee in-person voting began Monday.\n\nArizona\n\nPeach Springs: Five people in a tour group have been rescued after spending more than 24 hours underground at the Grand Canyon Caverns due to an elevator malfunction, authorities said Tuesday. Coconino County Sheriff’s officials said there were no reported injuries, and nobody in the party suffered any medical issues requiring treatment on the scene Monday night. The names and ages of the tourists weren’t immediately released Tuesday, but authorities said the group included a husband and wife and a second couple with two young children and at least two people were in their 70s. Authorities said one man was able to take the emergency staircase to the surface to seek help prior to the other five people being rescued. According to its website, the Grand Canyon Caverns is tourist attraction 12 miles east of Peach Springs that allows visitors to tour inside an ancient cave, dine and stay in an underground motel. A group were taking a 30-minute tour of the caverns about noon Sunday when sheriff’s officials said they were notified about 8:30 p.m. that people were stranded at the bottom of the elevator some 21 stories below ground. After assessing the situation over the phone and with personnel from Grand Canyon Caverns, sheriff’s officials say it was determined that the stranded party could stay overnight in a hotel suite.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The city will be in focus as the face of homelessness for a crew making a documentary on those living without a roof over their heads this November. In Fort Smith, homeless people live outdoors year-round, some in makeshift camps near the Arkansas River or sleeping along northside streets with day shelters and food pantries. Unhoused women and veterans are the focus of an ongoing nationwide documentary effort on film coming soon. Some of the common factors of homelessness for women involve domestic violence and divorce, said California documentary filmmaker Robert Craig. Craig said he knows Fort Smith is a destination for filming as part of “No Address,” the documentary title, because of people who are not only experiencing homelessness in the River Valley but because organizations are addressing growing needs. Craig said he has never visited Fort Smith. The heat of the summer and a winter storm added to challenges for those living without shelter in Fort Smith. Colder days are ahead. “I do know that the reason we’re going there (Fort Smith) is that there are important areas that we want to capture with encampments and the organizations that are trying to reduce homelessness and interviewing them,” Craig said. “So we are excited about that.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The City Council was forced to recess Wednesday to clear chanting protesters from its chamber, as members were poised to formally rebuke two council members and the council’s former president for their involvement in a racism scandal. A small but noisy group crowded into the main aisle of an otherwise mostly empty chamber, banged water bottles on a lectern, whooped and shouted in what appeared to be an effort to shut down the meeting. They unrolled a large sign calling the council “illegitimate.” “Justice now!” they chanted. “Shut down!” After multiple warnings to take seats, council leaders called the recess to clear the room. That led to something of a standoff in which about 20 protesters continued shouting, as police officers watched over the group. Council members earlier had left the room. Council President Paul Krekorian warned the protesters they would not deter the council’s business. “We will continue to do the work of the people of Los Angeles,” he said.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A potential election worker in Larimer County reported receiving a fake phone call earlier this month spreading disinformation about working the upcoming November election. The call – which was reported to the Larimer County Clerk and Recorder’s Office on Oct. 6 – informed the potential election worker that “Larimer County requires all Election Judges to be vaccinated in order to work in the Election,” according to a notice about the call issued by the county’s election operation manager. Larimer County does not require vaccination or proof of vaccination to work during the election, according to the notice. “I said, ‘Not in my county,’ ” Clerk and Recorder Angela Myers said of her reaction to hearing of the report. The call came from a spoofed phone number, modified to look like it came from the “Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk,” according to the notice. The number comes from a Long Beach, California, area code. Myers said she called the number, but it was not a working line. A reporter also called the number and got the same result. No other similar calls have been reported to the clerk’s office, and no other election-related concerns have been reported to the clerk’s office this election cycle, Myers said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Newly released tax documents show Gov. Ned Lamont, a former cable television entrepreneur, earned more than $54 million last year, most of it from investment earnings. It marks a big increase in income when compared to Lamont’s previous tax documents, released in April by his reelection campaign. Those showed his adjusted gross income for the first three of his four years in office had totaled nearly $26 million. The governor is not accepting the $150,000 state salary for governors. Lamont, who files his taxes separately from his wife, Annie, a successful venture capital consultant, had sought a filing extension from the IRS and didn’t release his 2021 returns until Friday. His reelection campaign allowed reporters to review cover sheets of Lamont’s federal and state tax returns, which showed the Democrat paid $12.8 million in federal taxes and $3.7 million in state taxes for the 2021 tax year. The campaign also included a list of organizations that benefited from $1.6 million in charitable contributions distributed by the governor’s philanthropy fund. The list of groups includes the Boy Scouts of America, Council on Foreign Relations, Yale University and 4-CT, the independent, nonprofit charity Lamont helped to create during the early days of the pandemic.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Plans for a second library in the city have raised complaints that the money could be better spent elsewhere and that Wilmington doesn’t need a second such facility. Last month Gov. John Carney announced plans to build a new $22 million library on North Market Street, a project spearheaded by state Sen. Darius Brown. Just one month earlier, state Rep. Nnamdi Chukwuocha announced plans to renovate the existing library, also on North Market, a mere 5-minute walk from the proposed location of the new one. Several comments under a social media post announcing the new library claimed that the existing library is underused. Even Linda Gray, the city council member who represents the district in which both libraries would exist, has her reservations, said that the neighborhood is a food desert, that “there’s enough libraries around” and that the area has bigger needs. State Librarian Annie Norman said there are valid reasons for having the two facilities in the same area. The existing location will continue to operate much like a traditional library but with added space for activities and speaker and author events. The new library will provide meeting space, literacy programs, workforce development resources, digital technology access and computer skills training, and resources for entrepreneurship.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The D.C. Public Library has extended its hours. Starting Nov. 14, branches will be open until 9 p.m. during the week, WUSA-TV reports. The extended times will provide 15 more hours of operations per week at libraries across the district. These added hours will help patrons more easily visit the library and pick up books after work, as well as give people the opportunity to attend workshops.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A 19-year-old South Florida man captured 28 Burmese pythons during a 10-day competition that was created to increase awareness about the threats the invasive snakes pose to the state’s ecology. Matthew Concepcion was among the 1,000 participants from 32 states, Canada and Latvia who participated in the annual challenge, which removed 231 of the unwanted pythons, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said in a news release. For his efforts, Concepcion was awarded the $10,000 Ultimate Grand Prize courtesy of the Bergeron Everglades Foundation. Dustin Crum won a $1,500 grand prize for removing the longest python, at just over 11 feet. Earlier this year, a team of biologists hauled in the heaviest Burmese python ever captured in Florida. That female python weighed in at 215 pounds, was nearly 18 feet long and had 122 developing eggs, according to the Conservancy of Southwest Florida. Burmese pythons aren’t protected except by Florida’s anti-cruelty law, so participants had to document that each one was killed humanely. Concepcion told the South Florida SunSentinel he’s been hunting pythons for about five years and typically looks for them at night because that’s when they’re on the move, seeking the warmth of roads.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge on Wednesday ordered former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to testify before a special grand jury that’s investigating whether then-President Donald Trump and his allies illegally tried to sway Georgia’s results in the 2020 election. Meadows, a former GOP congressman, is a key figure in the investigation. He traveled to Georgia, sat in on Trump’s phone calls with state officials, and coordinated and communicated with outside influencers who were either encouraging or discouraging the pressure campaign. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis opened the investigation last year into actions taken by Trump and others to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the state. Meadows is just one of several associates and advisers of the Republican ex-president whose testimony Willis has sought. Because Meadows doesn’t live in Georgia, Willis, a Democrat, had to use a process that involved getting a judge where he lives in South Carolina to order him to appear. First, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who’s overseeing the special grand jury, signed off on a petition certifying that Meadows was a “necessary and material witness.” Now, Circuit Court Judge Edward Miller in Pickens County, South Carolina, has honored McBurney’s finding and ordered Meadows to .\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Concerns about lead contamination have led to staff shortages at a public shooting range, HawaiiNewsNow reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The federal government is suing a small town near Grand Teton National Park for dumping toxic waste from its sewage treatment plant into a stream that feeds several scenic rivers in the region. The lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice was filed in Idaho’s U.S. District Court on Monday. The federal government contends the city of Driggs violated the Clean Water Act by dumping effluent with too much e. coli and ammonia or otherwise violated wastewater permit rules more than 2,600 times over the past seven years. The effluent was released into Woods Creek, which flows into the Teton River, Henry’s Fork, and the Snake and Columbia Rivers on its way to the Pacific Ocean. The Teton River and Henry’s Fork are renown fly fishing locations, drawing anglers from around the world. The violations, if proven, could put the city of about 2,100 people on the hook for more than $160 million in fines. In written statement, the city of Driggs said the lawsuit was a positive development because it will allow the EPA and city officials to work together to come up with solutions. “Although it seems scary to be sued by the Department of Justice, it’s actually an opportunity to receive support and resources” from the federal government, Driggs Mayor August Christensen wrote in the statement.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A former Teamsters union boss who was once one of the most powerful labor leaders in Chicago was sentenced Wednesday to 19 months in federal prison for extorting $325,000 from the head of a film studio in the city. The sentence comes more than three years after John Coli Sr. pleaded guilty to extortion, faced with secret recordings made by Cinespace Chicago Film Studios President Alex Pissios in which Coli could be heard threatening a union strike if Pissios didn’t pay him. In one tape, Coli tells Pissios that he would have union workers walking a picket line that would shut the studio down “within an hour” if he didn’t continue making the secret payments. Prosecutors agreed to dismiss several counts against the 63-year-old Coli in exchange for his guilty plea to receiving prohibited payments as a union official and making a false income tax return. In exchange, Coli agreed to cooperate with federal investigators and that cooperation helped build an extortion case that landed former state Sen. Thomas Cullerton in prison this year. Cullerton pleaded guilty to embezzlement charges for improperly taking more than $248,000 from the Teamsters.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indianapolis Housing Agency, the federal agency responsible for providing housing to low-income tenants in the city, has been battling a cyberattack for the past three weeks that’s compromised their entire information technology system. The agency has not released details about the motive or identity of the individuals behind the ransomware attack, which is a type of malicious software often unknowingly downloaded onto computers through methods such as innocuous email attachments. The software prevents users from accessing computer files and systems. It can result in massive disruptions and loss of information. As the name suggests, ransomware attacks can involve demands for ransom payments in exchange for the system being restored. The ransomware attack delayed the Indianapolis Housing Agency’s ability to send out October rent payments to landlords for the federal housing choice voucher program, also known as Section 8, which 8,000 Indianapolis families depend on. Section 8 provides rental assistance to very low-income families, the elderly, and disabled individuals for housing on the private market, and the agency administers the program for Indianapolis.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state dished out $238,000 in unemployment compensation to people who were either incarcerated or dead, according to a new report. Iowa Workforce Development issued the payments because agency officials were not using or checking systems designed to detect fraud, according to the review State Auditor Rob Sand released Tuesday. The annual report examined practices by the agency during the fiscal year that ended in June 2020, about three months into the COVID-19 pandemic. Perhaps more than any other government agency, Iowa Workforce Development was inundated during those months as hundreds of thousands of workers lost their jobs amid shutdowns ordered while the deadly virus began to sweep through the state. During a 15-week period beginning that March, 365,000 people filed unemployment claims with the state. That’s more than the 285,000 claims that the state received in all of the previous two years. Amid that crunch, the state did not run claims through a computer system to check whether applicants’ personal information matched those of inmates, according to the audit. Among other reasons, an inmate is ineligible for unemployment because a federal law requires that a recipient be “available for work.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: People who want a selfie with the bronze statue of a Kansa warrior atop the Statehouse may soon be able to snap that photo with a replica statue closer to the ground. The second statue of Ad Astra is already made and has been sitting in storage in Salina since before the word “selfie” became part of English vocabulary. It’s waiting to be placed on a pedestal that sits empty. “The intent was always to finish the Ad Astra plaza as it was started 20 years ago,” said state Sen. Elaine Bowers, R-Concordia. “And on top of the pedestal is nothing, and the pedestal is waiting for the 8-foot statue.” The Capitol Preservation Committee is moving forward with completing the project after a Tuesday meeting and a subcommittee meeting earlier this month. The 6-foot granite pedestal is already on the plaza southwest of the Statehouse. The 8-foot bronze replica of the dome sculpture would be mounted on top of the pedestal, surrounded by bronze plaques. Three of the plaques have already been cast, with 19 more needing to be done. Former state Sen. Randall Hardy, R-Salina, has been an advocate for completing the project and said he believes the addition will be an attraction. “The statue will be a magnet to draw people to the to that part of the Statehouse grounds,” he said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFort Campbell: Staff are using controlled burn techniques to manage a fire that started in a training area last week. The fire started Friday near Trigg County during routine training, Fort Campbell said in a news release Tuesday. Clinton Allen, Directorate of Public Works conservation branch chief, said workers are using back fires to make a buffer. “The back burns will help keep it from getting closer to the boundary with Land Between the Lakes,” Allen said. The Forestry Section of the DPW Environmental Division annually burns about 20,000 acres to support training operations and preserve the natural environment, the post said. The fire has burned through several hundred acres in an area where controlled burns are held. Anyone across the installation’s rear training area should watch for potential hazards if they see smoke and fire and contact dispatch, range control or the fire desk at (270) 798-4122 if they’re concerned, DPW forester J.P. Hart said. The sprawling Fort Campbell Army post straddles the Kentucky-Tennessee line.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Police say they have arrested one of two women seen on a social media video firing guns from a moving vehicle on Interstate 10. The 20-year-old suspect surrendered Monday with her attorney present, according to a police news release. The other suspect, a 21-year-old woman, was still at large Wednesday. Police said the shootings occurred on Oct. 16. Video circulating on social media showed two women, one in the front seat, the other in the back, firing handguns from passenger-side windows. Police said conviction on the charge of illegal discharge of a firearm from a moving vehicle would bring a prison sentence of five to 10 years. Nobody was reported injured in the Oct. 16 incident. However, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports that shootings on the interstate highway in New Orleans have increased. Interstate shootings have killed six people this year, the newspaper reported. Police said the shootings generally fall into one of three categories: road rage incidents; pre-existing feuds where shooters are targeting someone they know or someone getting caught in the crossfire.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Despite the state’s view of itself as independent, few unenrolled candidates actually win elections, The Maine Monitor reports. Good Party, a startup campaign platform company that began taking shape in 2020, hopes to change that. It is using Maine as a testing ground to see if its model succeeds and what might need to be improved, with the idea of expanding its groundwork elsewhere. While independents from across the country are featured on their site, organizers say Maine is the only state where it is conducting events and doing outreach for candidates. All of its Facebook ads have been targeted to Mainers within the last 90 days and featured Maine candidates, according to the platform’s ad library. Its goal is to elevate independent candidates outside of the traditional political campaign and money engine that has increasingly defined elections. It also aims to increase participation from unenrolled voters, a population that the Pew Research Center found in 2019 is less politically engaged than partisan voters and who make up 32% of registered voters in Maine. Some independents see promise in the tool and say unenrolled candidates need all the support they can get. It is an open question whether it will be enough to get them over the finish line.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: An Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge last week blocked a first-of-its-kind digital advertising tax on companies making more than $100 million, but the state Senate’s president called for an appeal and maintains education funding will continue. The law, which may be appealed by Maryland’s attorney general, passed the General Assembly in 2021 with the intent of collecting revenue to fund the state’s schools. “We always knew this issue would face a legal journey,” Senate President Bill Ferguson, said in a statement after the judge’s decision. “We are confident that the Attorney General will prevail in state courts on appeal.” According to court documents, a hearing in the case is scheduled for Jan. 6. Oral arguments are scheduled in a separate federal case about the law Nov. 29. The Democrat tied the law, which he previously deemed a tax on “big tech” companies, to funding for the state’s education system. “Maryland’s children deserve a world-class 21st-century education system that works for them and that’s funded appropriately,” said Ferguson, a former teacher. “That’s what this law is all about.” In a separate statement, Ferguson assured funding for education will continue through the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, independent of the lawsuit, at least in the short term.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMalden: The state education department is investigating a complaint that claims the rights of children with disabilities in the Boston Public Schools are being violated because the district’s bus system is in “disarray,” Education Commissioner Jeffrey Riley said Tuesday. The complaint filed last week by Greater Boston Legal Services and Massachusetts Advocates for Children on behalf of the parents and guardians of six students with disabilities says children are being being denied an education because of chronically late or canceled buses. “The systemic disarray of the BPS transportation and special education departments deprives thousands of Boston children, many of whom are low-income students with disabilities and students of color, of what cumulatively amounts to weeks or months of learning time,” the complaint said. Riley confirmed the investigation at Tuesday’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education board meeting. “We’ve been in touch with BPS regarding their transportation challenges, particularly as it relates to students with disabilities,” he said. “We have encouraged the district to work with families and advocates to resolve this issue.” Under federal law, the department has 60 days to investigate and either issue a letter of finding or a letter of closure, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: Three men accused of supporting terrorism in the plot to kidnap the governor were convicted of all charges Wednesday in a trial that focused on paramilitary drills and fierce contempt for government ahead of the 2020 election. Joe Morrison, his father-in-law Pete Musico, and Paul Bellar were found guilty of supplying “material support” for a terrorist act as members of a group known as the Wolverine Watchmen. They held gun training in rural Jackson County with a leader of the kidnapping scheme, Adam Fox, who was disgusted with Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and other officials and said he wanted to snatch her. The trial in state court was an offshoot of the main case in federal court, which produced mixed results: conspiracy convictions for Fox and three others but also two acquittals. Jurors in Jackson, Michigan, read and heard violent, anti-government screeds as well as support for the “boogaloo,” a civil war that might be triggered by a shocking abduction. Prosecutors said COVID-19 restrictions ordered by Whitmer turned out to be fruit to recruit more people to the Watchmen. “The facts drip out slowly,” state Assistant Attorney General Bill Rollstin told the jury, “and you begin to see – wow – there were things that happened that people knew about.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A former state House speaker is stepping down as vice chairman of the University of Minnesota Board of Regents following increased criticism over his question about whether the Morris campus is “too diverse.” Steve Sviggum has resigned his leadership position but will remain on the board until his term expires when the Legislature holds its regents election during the 2023 session, according to a statement from the University of Minnesota. Sviggum, 71, faced mounting pressure over comments he made nearly two weeks ago during a regents meeting. In talking about declining enrollment at the Morris campus, Sviggum asked acting Chancellor Janet Schrunk Ericksen whether the campus was “too diverse,” from a marketing standpoint. Currently, Morris has 1,068 students enrolled. Of those, 41% are people of color. Sviggum said that after meeting with board Chairman Ken Powell over the weekend, he came to the “realization” that he should resign as vice chairman immediately, the Star Tribune reports. “I owe that position to my colleagues who have shown disapproval in my actions,” he wrote in a letter to Powell. “I do so humbly and thoughtfully, with knowledge that the success of the University of Minnesota is the most important focus and is much more important than any one person or position.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Federal investigations into public spending on the failing water system in the majority-Black city are a test of President Joe Biden’s commitment to racial equity, one of his congressional allies told hundreds of people at a town hall meeting hosted by the NAACP. “President Biden has made a fundamental policy in his administration to talk about equity. And this is an issue of equity and fair treatment about the citizens of Jackson,” Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson said Monday night at Jackson’s New Hope Baptist Church – the same spacious sanctuary where Biden spoke during the 2020 campaign. The Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it is investigating whether Mississippi state agencies have discriminated against Jackson by refusing to fund water system improvements in the city of 150,000, where more than 80% of residents are Black and about a quarter of the population lives in poverty. Thompson said the EPA civil investigation is expected to take about four months. The federal agency could withhold money from the state if it finds wrongdoing – potentially millions of dollars. If the state agencies don’t cooperate with the investigation, the EPA could refer the case to the Department of Justice.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Relatives of the gunman who killed a student and a teacher during a school shooting had long been concerned about his mental health and worked with police to take a gun away from him – possibly the same gun used in the attack, Police Commissioner Michael Sack said Wednesday. Police and the FBI are working to determine what prompted 19-year-old Orlando Harris to force his way into Central Visual and Performing Arts High School on Monday and start shooting. Sack said the the carnage could have been far worse. The gunman was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and an estimated 600 rounds of ammunition. Fifteen-year-old Alexzandria Bell and 61-year-old teacher Jean Kuczka died in the shooting. Four students suffered gunshot or graze wounds, two had bruises, and one had a broken ankle – apparently from jumping out of the three-story building. Sack said all are recovering, as is a police officer who suffered cuts from broken glass. Police believe Harris, who was killed by responding officers, had intended targets. They have not said if any of the victims were among them. Harris’ mother was “heartbroken” by the shooting, Sack said. She and other relatives had long dealt with Harris’ mental health issues and even had him committed at times, Sack said at a news conference.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Montana Shakespeare in the Parks will return for a 50th anniversary season with a winter production of “The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged) - Revised,” after postponing last winter’s tour of this same production. The free performances will be staged in 29 communities in Montana and Wyoming through Nov. 20, including a date in Great Falls on Nov. 14, at the Mansfield Theater at The Civic Center. The fast-paced comedy features three actors touching on all 37 plays by the famed playwright in just 90 minutes, and is an outreach program of Montana State University’s College of Arts and Architecture. “Though we were all disappointed to have to postpone last year’s winter tour, what we missed the most was all of you,” said Kevin Asselin, executive artistic director, in a statement. “Shakespeare has always been about the community for us, and that still holds true in our 50th season! This winter’s production is beyond phenomenal, but what will make it special is getting to share it with our friends, family, and community. We invite everyone to come out for our final tour of the 2022 season!” For more information, visit shakespeareintheparks.org.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: An investigation into the theft this summer of several semitrailers loaded with frozen beef from Nebraska has led to arrests and uncovered a multimillion-dollar theft ring targeting meatpacking plants in six Midwestern states, federal authorities said. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported Tuesday that the discovery of the Miami-based theft ring began in June with a Nebraska investigation into the theft of several semitrailers loaded with nearly $1 million in frozen beef from areas near Grand Island and Lincoln. The investigation, led by the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office in Nebraska and Homeland Security’s Major Crimes Task Force in Omaha, determined that the theft ring was targeting beef and pork packaging plants in Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota and Wisconsin. On Oct. 20, investigators arrested three Miami men on suspicion of transporting stolen goods and money laundering. They face charges in federal court in Florida. Information on whether the men have attorneys representing them in the case could not immediately be found Wednesday. Investigators said they have identified approximately 45 thefts that occurred across the six Midwest states totaling $9 million in losses.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Prosecutors said they won’t seek the death penalty against a former Las Vegas-area politician who pleaded not guilty Wednesday to killing a veteran investigative journalist who wrote articles critical of him and his managerial conduct. “Not guilty, your honor,” Robert Telles, a Democrat who has been stripped of his elected position, responded during his arraignment on an indictment in the Sept. 2 stabbing death of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German. Telles, 45, appeared with his new lawyer, Ryan Helmick, who Telles hired to replace deputy public defenders initially named to his case at taxpayer expense following a declaration by Telles that he was unable to afford a lawyer. The Review-Journal last week reported that Telles and his wife were making $20,500 per month before his arrest and that he owns five rental houses in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Local property records show the couple also owns a Las Vegas home with a taxable value of more than $320,000. A trial date was not immediately set. Telles’ next court date is Nov. 2 before Clark County District Court Judge Mark Denton. Helmick declined outside court to comment.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Massachusetts has agreed to pay about $3.5 million to New Hampshire to settle a yearslong dispute over lost property taxes caused by infrastructure in New Hampshire that helps to prevent Merrimack River flooding that primarily benefits Massachusetts, authorities said Wednesday. Some of the 15 flood control facilities constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers date to the 1940s, according to a statement from the office of New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella. The states in 1957 entered into an agreement to ensure that Massachusetts paid affected New Hampshire communties some of the lost property tax revenue. But since 2014, the states have been unable to agree on the precise amount. Massachusetts has now agreed to pay the full amount owed to New Hampshire dating to 2014, Formella’s office said. The states have also agreed to come up with a formula to determine future reimbursements. “After eight years of impasse, I am pleased that our two great states have been able to reach agreement on this settlement payment to compensate New Hampshire citizens for almost a decade of lost revenue,” Formella said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Another toll increase is on the horizon, marking the third time in four years that New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway usage fees are going up. On Jan. 1, 2023, tolls will rise 3%, the same rate they increased last year. The New Jersey Turnpike Authority board unanimously approved the measure as part of the 2023 budget Tuesday. The increase comes as revenues came in above agency projections across the board for the first nine months of the year. The Turnpike Authority collected more than $1.82 billion in revenue during that time, up 6% compared to what it budgeted. The number of vehicles traversing the two highways also rose 1.3% in September 2022 when compared to the same month last year. Commercial vehicle transactions reached the third-highest number amount ever recorded, according to board documents. The budget is designed to provide “enough funding for operating expenses budgeted at approximately $714 million to operate and maintain the Turnpike and Parkway during a time inflation levels not seen in 40 years, and growth,” according to budget documents. Tom Feeney, a Turnpike spokesman, noted the toll increase is less than half that of the inflation rate.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: An environmental group is suing U.S. wildlife managers, saying they have failed to protect a rare grouse found in areas that include one of the country’s most prolific areas for oil and gas development. A lawsuit filed Tuesday by the Center for Biological Diversity says the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is nearly five months late in releasing a final rule outlining protections for the lesser prairie chicken. Once listed as a threatened species, the prarie chicken’s habitat spans parts of New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas – including a portion of the oil-rich Permian Basin that straddles the New Mexico-Texas state line. Environmentalists have been pushing to reinstate federal protections for years. They consider the species severely threatened, citing lost and fragmented habitat as the result of oil and gas development, livestock grazing, farming and the building of roads and power lines. The Fish and Wildlife Service in 2021 proposed listing the southern population in New Mexico and the southern reaches of the Texas Panhandle as endangered and those birds in the northern part of the species’ range as threatened. The agency had a deadline of June 1.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New York City sanitation workers who were fired for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19 should be reinstated and given back pay, a state judge ruled in a decision released Tuesday. Sitting in Staten Island, state Supreme Court Justice Ralph Porzio held that the city’s health commissioner overstepped his authority and violated the workers’ due process and equal protection rights when he barred the workers from their jobs. Porzio also cited Mayor Eric Adams’s lifting of the vaccine mandate for some private employees earlier this year – notably, athletes and entertainers – as evidence that the public worker mandate was arbitrary and unreasonable. “There is nothing in the record to support the rationality of keeping a vaccination mandate for public employees while vacating the mandate for private sector employees or creating a carveout for certain professions, like artists, athletes or performers,” Porzio wrote. “This is clearly and arbitrary and capricious action because we are dealing with identical unvaccinated people being treated differently by the same administrative agency.” The city’s law department said Tuesday it had appealed Porzio’s ruling.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: A former nurse at a hospital has been charged in the deaths of two patients after officials said he injected them with lethal doses of insulin. Forsyth County District Attorney Jim O’Neill announced at a news conference Tuesday that Johnathan Howard Hayes, a registered nurse, was charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder, news outlets report. Hayes worked at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem. Hayes was ordered held without bond at a first appearance Wednesday, police said. His case was referred to the public defender’s office, but one hasn’t been assigned yet, according to the clerk of the court’s office. The 47-year-old Winston-Salem man, described by O’Neill as a “rogue nurse,” is accused of administering a near-fatal dose of insulin to Pamela Little on Dec. 1, 2021, O’Neill said. Little survived. On Jan. 5, Hayes administered a lethal dose of insulin to patient Gwen Crawford, who died three days later, O’Neill said. On Jan. 22, Hayes gave another lethal dose of insulin to Vickie Lingerfelt, who died five days later, he said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: North Dakota State University is facing drastic budget cuts, the school’s new president said Tuesday. David Cook wrote in a campuswide email that significant reductions will be necessary due to decreasing enrollments over the past several years. He describes the cuts as “incredibly difficult.” The north Fargo campus is facing a $10.5 million budget shortfall for the next biennium. Cook said he has asked the school’s deans to help with “rightsizing and reorganizing the academic enterprise” and creating new programs to meet workforce needs. The school is also looking at new strategies to retain students, he said. The email does not mention layoffs, KFGO radio reports. Cook said most of the NDSU’s money comes from tuition and state revenue, both of which are dependent on student numbers. Enrollment at the university is at a 15-year low. “Please understand that I know NDSU has been living through numerous years of budget cuts, and I appreciate how difficult it has been,” Cook said. “My goal is for us to transform our operations strategically so that we can set NDSU up for future success.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio law does not permit voters to return absentee ballots at their precincts on Election Day, the state’s elections chief is cautioning amid a misinformation campaign around the security of voting machines that’s urging them to do so. Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose said those voters who heed advice from a prominent national group of Republican election deniers and hold onto their paper ballots until Nov. 8 must deliver them to their county board of elections office. Poll workers at precinct-level voting locations cannot accept them, he said. “This is why it’s dangerous for people who don’t know what they’re talking about to be dispensing bad elections-related advice to people,” he said in an Associated Press interview Tuesday. “Because if someone is telling voters to take their absentee ballot to their polling location on Election Day, they’re effectively instructing them how to disenfranchise themselves.” LaRose said that possibility has caused concern among county election officials.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The process of re-exhuming of some of the 19 bodies exhumed a year ago for testing in an effort to identify victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, then reburied in an Oklahoma cemetery, began Wednesday to gather more DNA from the remains. The latest exhumations of bodies that were taken from Oaklawn Cemetery in Tulsa, will be followed by another excavation for additional remains. Of the 19 bodies previously exhumed, 14 fit the criteria for additional DNA analysis, but just two of the 14 had enough usable DNA recovered to begin sequencing by Intermountain Forensics of Salt Lake City. Danny Hellwig, director of laboratory development for Intermountain, said Wednesday that the DNA recovered from the remains had degraded during the more than 100 years they were buried. “These samples are very … degraded,” Hellwig said. “There are samples that are very light right now on DNA, some that are semi viable, some that are just on the threshold” of being viable.” Hellwig said work to develop a genealogy profile for the two remains with enough viable DNA is expected to start in about a week and couple be completed within a few weeks, but efforts to identify the remains could take years.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A waiting and vetting period would be baked into gun purchases if a measure on the November statewide ballot passes. If voters approve the measure Nov. 8, buying a gun would first involve the potential purchaser obtaining a permit, which requires a number of steps supporters of the initiative say would save lives. The measure also bans large capacity gun magazines. The ballot measure is aimed at saving lives from suicide – in Oregon, 82% of gun deaths are suicides – mass shootings and other gun violence. The gun safety initiative gained momentum after mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, with more volunteers joining the effort, which was led by interfaith leaders. “We’re making a strong, strong push and the coalition is just growing by the day,” the Rev. Mark Knutson, one of the chief petitioners, said over the phone last week. “Everybody’s working hard in the next three weeks.” He said volunteers are canvassing door-to-door, erecting lawn signs and reaching out to voters by phone. The measure would require a permit to purchase any gun. To qualify for a permit, valid for five years, an applicant would need to complete an approved firearm safety course, pay a fee, provide personal information, submit to fingerprinting and photographing, and pass a criminal background check.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Republicans in the state House introduced a measure Wednesday to impeach Philadelphia’s Democratic district attorney, saying they may add session days to get the job done before the two-year legislative term expires next month. Rep. Martina White, the only House Republican who currently represents the city, sponsored the 22-page resolution aimed at removing District Attorney Larry Krasner a year after he was overwhelmingly reelected. White and about two dozen other House Republicans announced the move at a Capitol news conference. White accused Krasner of “dereliction of duty and despicable behavior” and running an office with a “staggering amount of dysfunction.” She said Krasner is “responsible for the rise of crime across our city.” Krasner tweeted just before the news conference that those seeking his removal “don’t allege I’ve committed a crime.” He wrote: “They just don’t think Philly has a right to govern itself,” saying the move is “devastating to democracy, and it shows how far toward fascism the Republican Party is creeping.” “These Republicans divest from communities and then grandstand about crime for political gain,” he said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city’s $10 million reparations budget cleared a major hurdle Tuesday night, receiving its first vote of approval from the City Council. The budget is set to fund more than 20 efforts related to home ownership and financial literacy, workforce training, media, community organizations, small business and more. The finance committee opted to remove three investments to establish a home repair fund, expand Mayor Jorge Elorza’s guaranteed income program and create a legal defense fund for renters facing evictions. Instead, council members moved to reallocate the more than $1.7 million that would have been spent on those categories to a “United Way COVID-19 Equity Fund.” Next step toward reparationsDetails on how those funds would be spent was not provided, though the intent would be to secure additional funding for the city’s reparations program. However, any proposed expenditures regarding that fund would require a public hearing followed by council approval. The council was highly supportive of the budget, with all members voting in favor except Councilmen Michael Correia, Nicholas Narducci and James Taylor, and Councilwoman Kat Kerwin, who were each absent.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The University of South Carolina has announced a new branding mark to go along with its iconic tree-and-gates academic logo. University officials said Wednesday that the school it is simplifying its branding marks while also introducing a new spirit mark for USC. The brand update becomes effective on Jan. 4, 2023, but some changes will take place immediately. The school will maintain and replace signs in phases. The university said the updated brand standards will include these guidelines: The iconic tree-and-gates will remain as the official academic logo. It becomes the official mark for academic branding. The university will introduce a new block-letter USC spirit mark that embraces the university’s unrivaled spirit and includes 1801, the year of its founding. The spirit mark will provide versatility in promoting the university in non-academic settings. The university will be referred to as the University of South Carolina, USC, South Carolina or Carolina in editorial and marketing materials. Athletics logos, including the “Block C” logo, will not be changed. “It’s great that the change announced today has been extremely well received across the board, especially by alumni who are really embracing the news,” said Jeff Stensland, assistant vice president of Institutional Relations and Public Affairs.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state has seen a rapid rise in people registering to use medical marijuana in recent months, as many obtain their patient cards through temporary consultation sites rather than their regular medical providers, a state health official told lawmakers Tuesday. Chris Qualm, who administers the state’s medical pot program, told a legislative oversight committee that there are now more than 4,000 people registered to use the drug. That’s a rapid rise from this summer, when the state tracked several hundred people registering each month. Many of those cardholders are getting certified to use medical marijuana at so-called pop-up clinics where physicians certify they have a medical condition that qualifies them for medical pot use. The quick consultations – sometimes lasting as little as five minutes – prompted some members of the legislative committee to voice concern that the process was not thorough enough. Advocates for medical marijuana access said patients were turning to the temporary consultation sites because established health care systems have not embraced the drug. “The problem is not pop-up clinics,” said Melissa Mentele, who organized the 2020 ballot initiative that legalized medical cannabis. “It’s our health systems refusing to participate in the program.”\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A former officer has been sentenced to 12 years in federal prison for giving police information and equipment to civilians who robbed drug dealers in the city, prosecutors said. Former Memphis Police Officer Sam Blue, 63, pleaded guilty in January 2020 to conspiracy to violate civil rights by using force, violence and intimidation, and conspiracy to commit robbery affecting interstate commerce. Blue was sentenced to the prison sentence, plus three years of probation, on Tuesday, the U.S. attorney’s office said. From 2014 to 2018, Blue conspired with others to rob drug dealers. Blue gave robbers home addresses for targets. He also provided robbers with an official Memphis Police Department badge and a car dashboard blue light. In 2018, several men put on fake police uniforms and used a blue police dashboard light to stop Eric Cain near his apartment, prosecutors said. Attackers handcuffed, kidnapped and tortured Cain, demanding to know where he kept his drugs and money. Cain escaped and spent a week in the hospital.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A teen shot by a police officer three weeks ago as he put his car in reverse while eating a hamburger is still hospitalized, and his condition remains “very touch and go,” his father said Tuesday in the family’s first public comments since the shooting. “He is getting slightly better, his wounds are healing, but the wounds that he’s endured, they are great; there’s a lot of them,” Eric Cantu said at a news conference. Family attorney Ben Crump – who has taken on some of the nation’s most high-profile police killings of Black people – said the family has been told that the now-fired officer who shot 17-year-old Erik Cantu racially profiled him while searching for a Hispanic suspect. Cantu was shot on Oct. 2 by Officer James Brennand in a McDonald’s parking lot. After the shooting, the 27-year-old rookie officer was fired and charged with two counts of aggravated assault by a public official. Police said Brennand violated his training and police procedures after approaching the car. Police have said Brennand was responding to an unrelated disturbance when he saw Cantu inside a car he believed had evaded him the day before during an attempted traffic stop. Brennand said he suspected the car was stolen.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: St. George has hosted at least one IRONMAN triathlon event every year since 2010, so local motorists have gotten used to navigating road closures and other obstacles presented on race day. But this year, with the IRONMAN 70.3 World Championships set to take place over the course of two full days, the event could come with more challenges than usual. The 70.3-mile race – half the distance of the traditional triathlon – covers wide swaths of Washington County, starting with a 1.2-mile swim through Sand Hollow Reservoir, followed by a 56-mile bike ride that crosses through Hurricane, Washington, St. George, Ivins and Snow Canyon State Park before finishing with a 13.1-mile run through central St. George. The official races start at 7:30 a.m. on Friday and Saturday, and while the top professionals can finish in under four hours, many participants can take the better part of the day to complete the grueling task. The race is expected to bring more than $20 million in direct economic impact to the area, and local governments have gathered a favorable reputation with race organizers for their willingness to plan around the event.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Ski resorts across the state have begun announcing their opening days and taking reservations for those wanting a chance at the untouched powder. Weather conditions could influence opening day plans, but many resorts say they would refund reserved lift tickets due to unfavorable conditions. Season passes have already gone on sale, but for those day-trippers ready to reserve the first lift tickets, the early bird gets the berm. Jay Peak Resort expects to begin its season Nov. 25, as does Killington Ski Resort. Mad River Glen in Waitsfield.Ski season at Mad River Glen in Waitsfield is expected to open Dec. 10, but Stark’s Pub should open Nov. 25. Mount Snow Ski Resort in Somerset plans to open Nov. 11. Okemo Mountain Resort in Ludlow is projected to open Nov. 19. Opening day for Saskadena Six in South Pomfret is planned for Dec. 14, weather permitting, and Ski Quechee in Hartford is looking to Dec. 21. Smugglers’ Notch in Jeffersonville plans to kick things off Nov. 25; Stowe Mountain Resort is starting Nov. 18 and Stratton Mountain on Nov. 19.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A judge has sided with city officials in a lawsuit over whether Richmond can remove a final Confederate monument and the remains of a rebel general interred beneath it. Circuit Court Judge David Eugene Cheek Sr. said in a ruling Tuesday that city officials – not the descendants of A.P. Hill – get to decide where the statue goes next, the Richmond Times-Dispatch and TV station WRIC report. The city plans to give the statue to the Black History Museum and Cultural Center of Virginia, which the plaintiffs found objectionable. The plaintiffs, who were indirect descendants of Hill, did not oppose the removal of the general’s remains to a cemetery in Culpeper, near where Hill was born. But they argued that the ownership of the statue should be transferred to them. They hoped to move it to a battlefield, also in Culpeper, according to the news outlets. “We’re gratified by Judge Cheek’s ruling,” Mayor Levar Stoney said in a statement.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Big ships entering and leaving Puget Sound will be asked to slow down to reduce underwater noise this fall in an effort to help the Pacific Northwest’s critically endangered orca whales. Washington state is importing the voluntary slowdown from British Columbia for container ships, tankers, freighters, cruise ships and car carriers coming from the Canadian province, Northwest News Network reports. The optional slowdown is scheduled to run from Oct. 24 to Dec. 22 and covers the shipping lanes from Admiralty Inlet by Port Townsend south to Kingston and Mukilteo. “When large vessels slow their speed they reduce the amount of underwater noise they create, and less underwater noise means better habitat for the endangered Southern Resident killer whales,” said Rachel Aronson, the program director of Quiet Sound, which is a relatively new, government-funded outfit that organized the slowdown trial. Aronson said most vessels would need to reduce speed by 30% to 50% over 20 nautical miles. She estimated that participating might add between 10 minutes to an hour of ships’ travel time, depending on their usual speed. Aronson said the time period and geographic area for the trial slowdown were chosen because the orcas travel into inland Puget Sound during that time to chase salmon runs.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBeaver: Federal officials are investigating complaints about conditions at a jail, according to a published report. The Register-Herald reports the West Virginia Department of Homeland Security denied its request to tour the Southern Regional Jail in Raleigh County citing a federal probe of the facility. “The federal government is in the process of investigating the facility, and the integrity of that investigation is of the utmost importance to the WV Department of Homeland Security,” said Morgan Switzer, deputy general counsel for the state agency said in an email to the newspaper. The jail in Beaver has been the “subject of many questions and concerns” since March, Switzer said. The state agency hasn’t answered questions about which federal agency is investigating and when the investigation began, the newspaper reports. A federal civil rights lawsuit was filed against the jail last month on behalf of current and former inmates who have described conditions at the facility as inhumane. The complaint references a lack of access to water and food, as well as overcrowded conditions and fights that were allowed to continue until someone was injured. A state investigation of conditions at the jail earlier this year found no evidence of inhumane treatment.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A man who stole the head from the state Capitol statue of Hans Christian Heg during a night of protests in 2020 pleaded guilty to misdemeanor theft on Wednesday and was sentenced to a year of probation. Rodney A. Clendening, 36, of Beloit, was originally charged with felony theft, but the charge was reduced to a misdemeanor as part of a plea agreement that resulted in the probation imposed by Dane County Circuit Judge John Hyland. The Wisconsin State Journal reports Clendening turned over the head of the statue to his attorney. Heg was an abolitionist and Union Army colonel during the Civil War. Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne said that because of that gesture, he agreed to reduce the charge. Damage to the statue was estimated at the time at more than $50,000. It has since been restored, reinstalled and rededicated at on the state Capitol grounds. Protests in Madison over the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police began in late May 2020. Protests the night of June 23 were in response to the arrest earlier in the day of local activist Devonere Johnson. He has since been convicted in federal court of extortion involving a Madison business.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A movement in the state aims to create an alert system for missing Indigenous adults, WyoFile.com reports.

Now these families want to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChristopher James Dawley, known as CJ to his friends and family, was 14 years old when he signed up for Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Like many teenagers, he documented his life on those platforms.\n\nCJ worked as a busboy at Texas Roadhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He loved playing golf, watching “Doctor Who” and was highly sought after by top-tier colleges. “His counselor said he could get a free ride anywhere he wanted to go,” his mother Donna Dawley told CNN Business during a recent interview at the family’s home.\n\nBut throughout high school, he developed what his parents felt was an addiction to social media. By his senior year, “he couldn’t stop looking at his phone,” she said. He often stayed up until 3 a.m. on Instagram messaging with others, sometimes swapping nude photos, his mother said. He became sleep deprived and obsessed with his body image.\n\nOn January 4, 2015, while his family was taking down their Christmas tree and decorations, CJ retreated into his room. He sent a text message to his best friend – “God’s speed” – and posted an update on his Facebook page: “Who turned out the light?” CJ held a 22-caliber rifle in one hand, his smartphone in the other and fatally shot himself. He was 17. Police found a suicide note written on the envelope of a college acceptance letter. His parents said he never showed outward signs of depression or suicidal ideation.\n\n“When we found him, his phone was still on, still in his hand, with blood on it,” Donna Dawley said. “He was so addicted to it that even his last moments of his life were about posting on social media.”\n\n\"For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,\" said Donna Dawley, the mother of CJ. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nNow, the Dawleys are joining a growing number of families who have filed recent wrongful death lawsuits against some of the big social media companies, claiming their platforms played a significant role in their teenagers’ decisions to end their lives. The Dawleys’ lawsuit, which was filed last week, targets Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. The suit accuses the two companies of designing their platforms to addict users with algorithms that lead to “never-ending” scrolling as part of an effort to maximize time spent on the platform for advertising purposes and profit.\n\nThe lawsuit also said the platforms effectively exploit minor users’ decision-making and impulse control capabilities due to “incomplete brain development.”\n\nDonna Dawley said she and her husband, Chris, believe CJ’s mental health suffered as a direct result of the addictive nature of the platforms. They said they were motivated to file the lawsuit against Meta and Snap after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked hundreds of internal documents, including some that showed the company was aware of the ways Instagram can damage mental health and body image.\n\nIn public remarks, including her testimony before Congress last fall, Haugen also raised concerns about how Facebook’s algorithms could drive younger users toward harmful content, such as posts about eating disorders or self-harm, and lead to social media addiction. (Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a 1,300-word post on Facebook at the time claiming Haugen took the company’s research on its impact on children out of context and painted a “false picture of the company.”)\n\n“For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,” said Donna Dawley, adding she felt compelled to “hold the companies accountable” after she heard how Instagram is designed to keep users on the platform for as long as possible. “How dare you put a product out there knowing that it was going to be addictive? Who would ever do that?”\n\nCJ Dawley died by suicide at the age of 17. His parents allege his social media addiction contributed to his death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nHaugen’s disclosures and Congressional testimony renewed scrutiny of tech platforms from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. A bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate in February that proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harm. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nSome families are now also taking matters into their own hands and turning to the courts to pressure the tech companies to change how their platforms work. Matthew Bergman, the Dawleys’ lawyer, formed the Social Media Victims Law Center last fall after the release of the Facebook documents. He now represents 20 families who have filed wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies.\n\n“Money is not what is driving Donna and Chris Dawley to file this case and re-live their unimaginable loss they sustained,” Bergman said. “The only way to force [social media companies] to change their dangerous but highly profitable algorithms is to change their economic calculus by making them pay the true costs that their dangerous products have inflicted on families such as the Dawleys.”\n\nHe added: “When faced with similar instances of outrageous misconduct by product manufacturers, juries have awarded tens of millions of dollars in compensatory damages and imposed billion-dollar punitive damage awards. I have every reason to anticipate a jury, after fairly evaluating all the evidence, could render a similar judgment in this case.”\n\nCJ's parents, Chris and Donna, are now suing Meta and Snap over CJ's death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Snap spokesperson Katie Derkits said it can’t comment on active litigation but “our hearts go out to any family who has lost a loved one to suicide.”\n\n“We intentionally built Snapchat differently than traditional social media platforms to be a place for people to connect with their real friends and offer in-app mental health resources, including on suicide prevention for Snapchatters in need,” Derkits said. “Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our community and we are constantly exploring additional ways we can support Snapchatters.”\n\nMeta also declined to comment on the case because it is in litigation but said the company currently offers a series of suicide prevention tools, such as automatically providing resources to a user if a friend or AI detects a post is about suicide.\n\nTech companies under pressure to make changes\n\nAlthough alarms have been raised about social media addiction for years, Haugen’s testimony – coupled with concerns around kids’ increased time spent online during the pandemic – has made the issue a national talking point. But change hasn’t come fast enough for some families.\n\nJennifer Mitchell, who said her 16-year-old son Ian died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat, is also working with the Social Media Victims Law Center to file a lawsuit against Snap. She said she hopes it will make more parents aware of the dangers of social media and encourage lawmakers to regulate the platforms.\n\n“If we can put age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes and to purchase a gun, something needs to be something done when it comes to social media,” she told CNN Business. Snapchat’s age requirement for signing up is 13. “It’s too addictive for kids.”\n\nIn August 2019, Mitchell had just landed in Alaska on a business trip from Florida when she received a series of voice messages saying her son died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She said police later told her they believed Ian was recording a video at the time of the incident.\n\n“After trying to get into some of his social media accounts, we found video of him [taken] on Snapchat that looked like he was playing Russian roulette with the gun,” Mitchell said. “We don’t know who he was sending it to or if he was playing with someone. The phone was found not too far from his body.”\n\nSnap declined to comment on the incident.\n\nIan's mother said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat. Courtesy Jennifer Mitchell\n\nThe emergence of wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies isn’t limited to teenagers. In January, Tammy Rodriguez filed a lawsuit, alleging her 11-year-old daughter Selena struggled with social media addiction for two years before taking her own life in July 2021. (Instagram and Snapchat, the two sites her daughter is said to have used most, require users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with many social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.)\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Selena Rodriguez had spent more time on those social networks during the pandemic and started communicating with older men on the platforms. She responded to requests to send sexually explicit images, “which were subsequently shared or leaked to her classmates, increasing the ridicule and embarrassment she experienced at school,” the suit alleged.\n\n“Throughout the period of Selena’s use of social media, Tammy Rodriguez was unaware of the clinically addictive and mentally harmful effects of Instagram and Snapchat,” the lawsuit said. It also cited the lack of sufficient parental controls at the time as a contributing factor, an issue that has been a focus of some recent criticism among lawmakers.\n\nBoth Snap and Meta declined to comment on the case but referenced their resources to help its users struggling with their mental health.\n\n“If a person walks into a bad neighborhood and is assaulted, that’s a regrettable incident,” said Bergman, who is also representing the Rodriguez family. “But if a tour guide says, ‘Let me show you around the city or I’ll show you the top sites,’ and one of those [spots] is a very dangerous neighborhood where a person is assaulted, the tour guide appropriately has some responsibility for putting the tourist in harm’s way. That’s exactly what these platforms do.”\n\n“It’s not random that teenage girls are directed toward content that makes them feel bad about their bodies. That is the way the algorithms work; it’s by design,” he added.\n\nA long and uncertain legal road\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, believes these wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies could hold up in court despite inevitable challenges.\n\n“The problem, at least in the traditional notion in the law, has been that it’s difficult to prove addiction that then leads to taking somebody’s life or doing serious damage to somebody that’s self-inflicted,” he said. “But judges and juries in certain situations might be more open to finding liability and awarding damages.”\n\nHe said Haugen’s “damning” testimony before Congress and the “seemingly troubling” data companies collect about young users, as revealed in the documents, could potentially support a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, depending on each case.\n\nIf you suspect someone may be at risk: If you suspect that someone may be at risk: 1.

However, Tobias said because families are now targeting how the platforms are designed, it “might persuade a court to distinguish the new allegations from other actions by defendants that judges found immune.”\n\nIn the months following the leaked internal documents, Instagram has rolled out a handful of safeguards aimed at protecting its young users, including a tool called Take a Break, which aims to encourage people to spend some time away from the platform after they’ve been scrolling for a certain period. It also introduced a tool that allows parents to see how much time their kids spend on Instagram and set time limits, and brought back a version of its news feed that sorts posts in reverse chronological order rather than ranked according to the platform’s algorithms.\n\nLast month, dozens of attorneys general wrote a letter to TikTok and Snap calling on the companies to strengthen the platforms’ existing parental tools and better work alongside third-party monitoring apps, which can alert parents if children use language that suggests a desire for self-harm or suicide.\n\n“Your platforms do not effectively collaborate with parental control applications or otherwise provide an adequate opportunity for parental control within the platform,” the letter said. “We ask that you conform to widespread industry practice by giving parents increased ability to protect their vulnerable children.”\n\nSnap told CNN Business in a response it is currently working on new tools for parents that give more insight into what their teens are doing on Snapchat and who they’re talking to. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has expanded its safety features over the years. In 2019, TikTok introduced a limited app experience called TikTok for Younger Users which restricts messaging, commenting and sharing videos for users under age 13. In 2020, it rolled out the ability to disable direct messaging for users under the age of 16.\n\nBergman said he anticipates a “long fight” ahead as he plans to “file a lot of cases” against social media companies. “The only thing that’s certain is the level of opposition that we’re going to face from companies that have all the money in the world to hire all the lawyers,” he said. “They want to do everything they can to avoid standing up in a courtroom and explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the life of CJ Dawley.”\n\nDonna Dawley said the last time she saw her son, on the day of his death, he was looking down at his phone, appearing sad. “I just wish I would have grabbed him and hugged him,” she said.\n\n“[This lawsuit] is not about winning or losing. We’re all losing right now. But if we can get them to change the algorithm for one child – if one child is saved – then it’s been worth it.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}]}

Tens of thousands of new vehicles sit in parking lots awaiting semiconductor chips before they can be shipped to dealers.\n\nHere's what you need to know about semiconductor chips:\n\nSo what are these chips?\n\nThe chips are tiny transistors made from silicon, which is found in most of the minerals on the earth's surface. They allow computers, smart phones, appliances and other electrical devices to function. Vehicles use chips, too.\n\nSilicon feeds a $500 billion chip industry, according to a report by the BBC. The chips underpin a global tech economy worth an estimated $3 trillion, the report said. The raw materials for the semiconductor business often come from Japan and Mexico, with the chips made in Taiwan, China and some in the U.S.\n\nWhat is the chip shortage?\n\nThe chip shortage is a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased demand for the personal electronics such as cell phones and laptops that the chips are used in to the point where production could not keep pace with demand.\n\nMore:GM build-shy strategy has tens of thousands of vehicles parked awaiting chip parts\n\nMore:GM to increase vehicle deliveries to dealers: 'Help is on the way'\n\nWhy is there a chip shortage?\n\nSo in March 2020, the global pandemic prompted automakers, suppliers and car dealerships to close down. The economy went into a recession.\n\nThe automakers, who have experienced previous recessions, quickly canceled orders for parts with computer chips, thinking auto sales would nosedive, said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Autotrader.\n\nSales of new cars did plummet initially, but quickly rebounded with pent-up demand and 0% financing offers. Also, dealers figured out how to sell vehicles online, offering home pickup and delivery.\n\nSo when the factories restarted, the stronger-than-expected demand for new vehicles outpaced production and has yet to catch up.\n\n\"Automakers and suppliers that use chips contacted their chipmakers and put back their orders,\" Krebs said. \"By then, chip capacity was consumed by other businesses — phones, computers, video games — as people worked and schooled at home.\"\n\nGlobal chip production is monopolized by a few global, Asia-Pacific suppliers, said Joe McCabe, CEO of AutoForecast Solutions LLC.\n\n\"Everyone’s lights went off at the same time. This means that there was no ability to build inventory of products and solutions when businesses were able to turn their lights back on,\" McCabe said. \"This created a significant bottleneck in all manufacturing processes.\"\n\nThe chip deficit was further complicated by a fire at plant owned by chipmaker Renesas Electronics in Japan. The damage was extensive and the plant is not yet up to full production, but they are hoping it will reach full production in June, Krebs said.\n\nWhy is there so much competition for chips?\n\nIn September, global consulting firm AlixPartners in Southfield said the chip shortages could cost the global auto industry $210 billion in revenue for the year.\n\nGM CEO Mary Barra has said the shortage could cost GM up to $2 billion in lost earnings this year. Barra said GM expected chip supplies to return to normal in the second half of the year.\n\nThe Alliance for Auto Innovation, the trade group that represents automakers, said the shortage could hurt auto production for another six months and result in 1.28 million fewer vehicles being made in the U.S. this year.\n\nSo it is critical for automakers to get as many chips as possible to keep assembly lines moving to mitigate losses.\n\nMore:Bad quarter and year as auto industry to lose billions from chip deficit\n\nIt remains unclear whether automakers might be able to make up that production and any revenue losses over time, Krebs said.\n\n\"The losses are being offset by higher vehicle prices and less expense,\" Krebs said. \"Almost every automaker in every region has been forced to make production cuts. As a result, inventories are extremely low while consumer demand is extremely high. That means vehicle prices are high.\"\n\nIn the first week of June, the average listing price of a new vehicle was $40,566, up nearly $200 from the prior week. The average listing price was 5.5% above last year, and 10.3% above the same week in 2019, Krebs said.\n\nUsed car prices are also high because with new cars not moving, trade-ins aren't happening creating a shortage ofused cars. too. The average listing price for a used vehicle was $23,786, up nearly $340 from the prior week, Krebs said. Prices are running 22% above 2020 and 2019 levels, she said.\n\nWhy is my vehicle delayed because of chips?\n\nMany automakers have idled factories and stopped making some vehicles altogether so as to ship whatever chips they can get to more in-demand highly profitable vehicles such as pickups and SUVs. Also, GM and Ford Motor Co. are building the vehicles without the chips, then parking them to await the part. Once the chips arrive, those vehicles are put through final assembly and shipped to dealers. But the delay can be weeks.\n\nIn the meantime, supply of new vehicles is at an all-time low, Krebs said. Used supply is slowly rising due to a slowing sales pace. These trends likely will continue over the coming weeks since there is little that could change the current situation, Krebs said.\n\nMore:Chip shortage makes finding perfect car a challenge but could help get you out of a lease\n\nMore:MSU gets a cash windfall from GM as the automaker parks unfinished cars\n\nWhat sorts of things are chips used for in vehicles?\n\nCars use the chips in a variety of electronics systems. One car part could use 500 to 1,500 chips depending on the complexity of the part.\n\nHow long will the chip shortage last?\n\nCisco CEO Chuck Robbins told the BBC in late April: \"We think we've got another six months to get through the short term. The providers are building out more capacity. And that'll get better and better over the next 12 to 18 months.\"\n\nMore:Ford dealer: 'We can't freak out' as automaker cuts F-150, Escape production again\n\nHow are the automakers adjusting, or not adjusting?\n\nIn the short term, automakers have been cutting the production of vehicles like cars that are not as much in demand and not as profitable as pickups and SUVs, so as to redirect chips from cars into the money-making vehicles.\n\nThey also are building vehicles and parking them until chips become available.\n\nOr they are building vehicles without some features — Tesla has taken out the passenger side lumbar support; GM took out fuel-saving features like automatic start-stop and the fuel management module.\n\nLong term, automakers are examining their supply chains. The just-in-time-inventory system that they took from Toyota may be revamped some with critical parts like chips, Krebs said.\n\nThe chipmakers are trying to boost production and are looking at – and some committing to – building more capacity, including in the U.S.\n\nThe Biden administration has also assigned a task force to study the chips' supply chain. The U.S. Senate has voted 68-32 in favor of legislation intended to battle back against overseas competition, especially a growing threat from China, including investing more than $50 billion into the making of semiconductors.\n\nLooking forward, automakers, suppliers and government officials are looking at EVs and where batteries and other parts come from as they push for North American production.\n\n\"The chip shortage demonstrated our exposure to a limited domestic production capacity to the point where it has turned into an issue of national security,\" McCabe said. \"Each major global market is now getting full support from their governments for a combination of domestic and redundant supply streams. Expect to see many new, smaller chip producers, scale up to help mitigate the issue in the future — with government money supporting the efforts.\"\n\nMcCabe said carmakers are likely to become more vertically integrated in chip production, taking direct responsibility for multi-year, high-volume contracts to make sure there are no future capacity constraints. Volkswagen has already indicated this direction.\n\nAs most carmakers including Ford and GM move toward electric vehicles, the need for high volume, and more complex chips will help shape the global chip manufacturing landscape, McCabe said.\n\nMore:GM struggles to hire hundreds of temps; union leader says drop drug test\n\nMore:Arctic blast, chip shortage mean UAW members may not get summer vacation\n\nMore:Chip shortage cripples car production into the second half of 2021\n\nContact Jamie L.

These problems include Tesla needing to make some of the batteries by hand and borrowing scores of employees from one of its suppliers to help with this manual assembly, said these people.\n\nTesla's future as a mass-market car maker hinges on automated production of the Model 3, which more than 400,000 people have already reserved, paying $1,000 refundable fees to do so.\n\nThe company has already delayed production, citing problems at the Gigafactory. On November 1, 2017, CEO Elon Musk assured investors in an earnings call that Tesla was making strides to correct its manufacturing issues and get the Model 3 out.\n\nBut more than a month later, in mid-December, Tesla was still making its Model 3 batteries partly by hand, according to current engineers and ex-Tesla employees who worked at the Gigafactory in recent months. They say Tesla had to \"borrow\" scores of employees from Panasonic, which is a partner in the Gigafactory and supplies lithium-ion battery cells, to help with this manual assembly.\n\nTesla is still not close to mass-producing batteries for the basic $35,000 model of this electric sedan, sources say. These people requested anonymity as they are not authorized by the company to talk to the press.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson told CNBC, \"Until we reach full production, by definition some elements of the production process will be more manual. This is something Elon and [CTO] JB [Strausel] discussed extensively on our Q3 earnings call, and it has no impact on the quality or safety of the batteries we're producing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, bears are growing more skeptical by the day. Stanphyl Capital's Mark B. Spiegel told CNBC, \"While I've no doubt that Tesla will eventually work out its Model 3 production problems, the base model will cost Tesla at least mid-$40,000s to build. The company will never deliver more than a token few for less than the current $49,000 lowest-cost offering. Sales will hugely disappoint relative to expectations of over 400,000 a year. And even at those higher prices Tesla will never come anywhere close to its promised [profitability].\"\n\nA history of missing targets\n\nTesla has a history of setting and missing ambitious targets.\n\nIt reportedly aimed to ship its Model X gullwing vehicles to the masses in 2014, but couldn't do so until 2016.\n\nLast year, Elon Musk promised to deliver 1,600 Model 3s in the third quarter, but only delivered 220 of them. In a shareholders' update in August, he said the company should be producing 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of 2017. In November, he lowered expectations, saying Tesla will be able to crank out 2,500 premium Model 3s per week by the end of March, ramping up to 5,000 per week by June.\n\nAccording to shareholder updates, the company delivered fewer than 2,000 Model 3s through the end of 2017, and only the more expensive long-range ones. No $35,000 basic models have shipped as of mid-January.\n\nIssues at the Gigafactory could hamper Tesla's ability to hit even its reined-in goals, say sources. Delays would hurt employee morale, test the patience of customers, and help electric vehicle competitors like Chevy, Nissan, and China's BYD.\n\nBut some Tesla investors view production issues as minor in the grand scheme. A note from RW Baird's Ben Kallo on Tuesday said, \"We continue to believe Tesla will be able to ramp Model 3 production, think demand could accelerate with positive reviews from early customers, and believe the Model 3 total addressable market could be larger than expected.\"\n\nSome former Tesla engineers agreed, saying manufacturing and quality issues should be kept in perspective. \"Manufacturing is always hard. There are questions of tolerance and risk, what meets quality criteria and so on,\" one said. \"It takes time to figure it out.\"\n\n'Slapping bandoliers together'\n\nWhat does it take to make a Model 3 battery? Each battery pack contains four modules. And each module contains 7 bandoliers, or cooling tubes with a row of lithium ion cells glued to each side. Those cells have to be precisely aligned.\n\nManual assembly works for some parts of battery production, like bolting down and gluing the \"clamshells,\" or outer structures that hold a battery pack together.\n\nBut bandoliers are tough to put together by hand. Cells can be pushed a bit too high or low, or otherwise drop out of alignment, as they're squeezed against the glue on a cooling tube and packed into modules.\n\nA current Gigafactory engineer recalled that in December, factory workers were manually \"slapping bandoliers together as fast as they possibly could,\" generating a lot of scrap in the process.\n\nOnce the machines in the factory were able to crank out bandoliers as fast or faster than the manual laborers, Tesla began sending Panasonic workers back to their employer, sources said.\n\nToday, Tesla is dwindling down manual assembly as much as possible at the Gigafactory, a hopeful sign.\n\nBut one engineer who works there cautioned that the automated lines still can't run at full capacity. \"There's no redundancy, so when one thing goes wrong, everything shuts down. And what's really concerning are the quality issues.\"\n\nMany of the company's quality control workers are relatively inexperienced, make sloppy calculations and don't know when they're looking at flaws, according to several current and former employees. They said many quality inspectors were temp-to-hire workers with no automotive experience who Tesla hired via a staffing agency.\n\nTesla acknowledged the relative inexperience of some employees, but said new hires involved in battery production receive \"extensive training, including safety training.\"\n\nTwo current engineers told CNBC that they are concerned some of the batteries being shipped do not have the minimum gap required between lithium ion cells. These engineers warned that this \"touching cells\" flaw could cause batteries to short out or, in worse cases, catch fire.\n\nThese engineers said they raised the issue internally, but their concerns were shrugged off by managers.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson dismissed these comments as \"false claims,\" and strenuously denied the company is shipping hazardous batteries.\n\n\"The implication that Tesla would ever deliver a car with a hazardous battery is absolutely inaccurate, contrary to all evidence, and detached from reality,\" the spokesperson wrote in an e-mail to CNBC.\n\nThe spokesperson also explained:\n\n\"Every battery in a Tesla vehicle has thousands of cells, the vast majority of which are at the same voltage potential as neighboring cells. Hypothetically, even if two cells of the same voltage potential were touching, there would be absolutely zero impact, safety or otherwise – it would be as if two neutral pieces of metal touched. \"Despite this fact, all Model 3 battery modules' cell positions are measured twice in manufacturing to verify process control and quality of outgoing parts. Conversely, if at any point in the production process cells are touching at different voltage potentials, they cannot be electrically interconnected. Over the course of the production process, we conduct three different tests to ensure the right number of cells are electrically connected in Model 3 modules.\"\n\nThe two engineers also said that Tesla doesn't do the same kind of \"stress tests\" of its Model 3 batteries which would be expected of other electronics or car makers. Such tests could help Tesla figure out if touching cells (or any other flaws) are present in its fully assembled batteries, or if flaws develop or worsen with real-world use.\n\nTesla countered that it tests batteries in many other ways, \"including shock and vibration, and high temperature and humidity testing, as well as thermal cycling endurance testing throughout design and via sampling in production.\" The company says this testing \"is designed to prevent touching cells from being installed in any of our vehicles.\"\n\n© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

It's big, loud and secretive", "text": "Big numbers are one way to appreciateTesla’s gargantuan Nevada Gigafactory.\n\nOperating 24-hours per day in shifts, workers produce enough battery packs and drive units in a week to power 5,300 of Tesla’s Model 3 sedans.\n\nTesla says at 5.4 million square feet, roughly equivalent to 50 Home Depot stores, the factory is just 30 percent of its potential size and is already producing more batteries than all other carmakers combined.\n\nWith more than 7,000 Tesla workers, the factory is responsible for increasing manufacturing employment in the Reno-Sparks area by 55 percent since 2014, according to the Governor's Office of Economic Development.\n\nAnother way to appreciate it is to feel it through your ears and toes. On Dec. 3, the Reno Gazette Journal got a rare glimpse inside the factory.\n\nHallways, production areas and even the offices and conference rooms seem to exist in a state of steady vibration that, depending on your location in the building, is punctuated by loud warning beeps from autonomous vehicles or whirring from robots large and small.\n\n“It is not elaborate, mahogany offices here, this is where work gets done,” said Chris Lister, vice president of operations for the Gigafactory.\n\nMore:Elon Musk says Tesla would consider buying idled GM plants, takes another swing at SEC\n\nMore:Upcoming Tesla features are straight out of a 'James Bond' movie\n\nLister was speaking from a carpeted work area stocked with hundreds of sparse workspaces where design engineers and teams from planning, production and engineering work side-by-side at tall tables arranged in long rows.\n\nThat factory floor is a hive of activity by human workers, robotic arms, conveyor lines and autonomous vehicles. They're working together to assemble battery cells into configurations that will power Tesla Model 3 sedans and other energy products.\n\nMore:Want to go to space in 2019 with Virgin Galactic? Pack courage and $250,000\n\nPanasonic makes the cells, which look a little like oversized AA batteries, in one part of the factory before Tesla's human and robot workforce assemble them to be used in cars and batteries that power homes and businesses.\n\nThe noise and vibration that seeps from the factory floor into the office area is a constant reminder that every corner of the Gigafactory is part of what Tesla CEO Elon Musk refers to as \"the machine that builds the machine.\"\n\nWith that machine under constant refinement as Musk and others chase ambitious production goals it makes for an environment filled with Sturm und Drang.\n\nA living machine: How the Gigafactory works\n\nWhen Tesla officials cite advantages of the Gigafactory they often discuss elements of design and logistics.\n\nDesign-wise, the factory is built for an automated workforce.\n\nLong, unobstructed and straight corridors are referred to as “spines,” where autonomous vehicles can move parts about. Its orientation is set to true north to make it easier to use GPS in programming vehicles or automated processes.\n\nEven the exterior wall panels are modular, so they can be removed and reinstalled as the factory expands.\n\nTesla still plans to make the factory energy independent by continuing to add solar panels to the roof.\n\nUnlike corporate campuses developed or under development for high profile tech companies like Apple or Facebook, Tesla’s Gigafactory appears spartan by comparison.\n\nFrom the outside there is little to no landscaping. The building, in its current configuration, is an “L” shape with right-angle corners.\n\nThere are no awnings or patios outside. Vehicles park on pavement or dirt that goes to the edge of the structure.\n\nThe sheer size of the building and volume of work inside its walls makes it difficult to grasp what’s going on inside the Gigafactory from a single vantage point.\n\nThat’s why when trying to understand how the factory works, it’s helpful to consider each of the three, major functions it performs.\n\nThey include battery cell manufacturing, battery pack assembly and drive unit production, key components that are shipped to Fremont, Calif., where Tesla builds the Model 3 and other vehicles.\n\n“This is really like 10 manufacturing plants in one,” Lister said.\n\nHere's how it all works.\n\nWhere it all begins: making battery cells\n\nThis part of the factory, operated by Panasonic Energy of North America, is where some of most sensitive operations take place.\n\nThe entire Panasonic portion of the Gigafactory is off-limits to photos, video and audio recording and people walking through can only view areas of production that are visible through small windows from the hallway.\n\nPanasonic invested $1.6 billion in the $5 billion Gigafactory. The company is the exclusive cell provider for Tesla and converts , raw materials such as refined lithium and steel into the cells Tesla uses to create a Model 3 battery.\n\nPanasonic already produces cells for Tesla’s models S and X vehicles in Japan, but at nowhere near the volume that the Model 3 requires.\n\nMore:Pew study: Artificial intelligence will mostly make us better off by 2030 but fears remain\n\nPanasonic President Allan Swan said there are already 11 battery cell production lines in operation and two more under construction.\n\nThe two incoming production lines, he said, will produce double the output of the older lines.\n\nWith each Model 3 battery pack requiring more than 4,000 cells, Panasonic needs to churn out more than 3 million cells daily to keep pace with Tesla's ambitious production schedule.\n\n“This is just a completely different scale,” Swan said..\n\nAlthough lithium ion batteries are commonplace in everything from mobile phones to unmanned aerial vehicles to electric cars, Panasonic zealously guards the specific processes and ingredient mix it uses for its cells\n\nSwan flashes a chart to visitors to explain the process, but he won’t distribute copies.\n\nThe chart depicts a process that includes mixing the material that goes into each cell, coating the metallic sheet that’s wound like a cinnamon roll into a cylinder, cutting, or slitting, the sheets to the appropriate size for the Model 3 cells, then assembling the cells and enclosing them in casings from H&T Nevada, which manufactures them on-site.\n\nThe secrecy is important as manufacturers Panasonic seeks to maintain its advantage.\n\nAt least one electric vehicle expert, Jack Rickard of EVTV, said Tesla’s batteries are superior to those in use by Volkswagen, Nissan and GM.\n\n“I would venture that no one … has anything that can approach it,” said Rickard during a nearly 90-minute video in which he disassembles and analyzes a Model 3 battery pack. “This is probably the finest battery in the world.”\n\nSecrecy isn’t the only thing Panasonic cherishes when it comes to cell manufacturing. Cleanliness is also high on the priority list.\n\nWorkers on the lines wear masks, protective booties, gloves and head coverings and the rooms where they work are hermetically sealed with special filters that control the air quality.\n\nThe measures are precautions to protect the cells which can be ruined by dust or other contaminants.\n\n“Any contamination whatsoever, we basically have to scrap the batteries,” Swan said.\n\nPutting it all together: Module and pack assembly\n\nThis is where Tesla workers and robots receive cells via autonomous vehicles from Panasonic and assemble them into Tesla products.\n\nThis handoff is what Lister refers to as the “handshake” between the partners.\n\nFrom here, using a combination of human and robot labor, Tesla assembles the cells into long rows Lister calls “bandoliers,” because of the way the cells are arranged around a cooling tube. The tubes are also manufactured on-site by the company Valeo.\n\nBandoliers are then grouped side-by-side and placed into modules. The modules then go through more machines that, with help from people, use wires to bond the electrical connections. The bonding enables cells within modules to work together as part of a cohesive energy bank to power a Model 3 or any of Tesla's stationary products, such as the Powerwall home battery or the Powerpack, it's industrial cousin.\n\nFor Model 3s, four modules are placed in large, clamshell-type enclosure that contains and protects the battery pack in place at the bottom of the car.\n\nThe pack gets topped off with a “penthouse,” which is what Tesla calls the assembly of computer hardware that manages the pack.\n\nOnce a pack is complete it's ready for shipping to Fremont where workers will assemble it into a Model 3.\n\nAlthough the Model 3 gets most of the attention from the public, Tesla is hard at work seeking to triple it's stationary storage power business with products like the Powerpack, which the company has deployed in disaster areas when traditional electrical service is disrupted.\n\n“A lot of the discussion has been around Model 3 production, but the energy products are a significant part of our business,” Lister said.\n\nThe pack and module lines are among the most human-intensive areas of the Gigafactory.\n\nThat’s due in part to the nature of some of the components. Pieces that are firm and require simple, straight-line movements to install can be done by robots.\n\nBut other parts, such as wires and tubing, require manual dexterity and higher-level decision-making to install and are better done by humans.\n\nThe process of figuring out that people are better than machines at some jobs was part of the reason behind bottlenecks that caused headaches last year as Tesla struggled to meet Model 3 production goals.\n\n“We had to make some quick drastic decisions on the fly to take areas that may have been over automated at first design and create a manual station to unlock a piece of the bottleneck,” Lister said, adding that safety was another factor in decisions about where to automate.\n\nIt was a process that’s been repeated throughout the factory, Lister said, as each fix that sped up a line at one place exposed a slow spot elsewhere.\n\n“We look at the slowest unit operation and we apply all the resources and mind power that we can and solve that bottleneck,” he said. “Then we move on to the next bottleneck.”\n\nMore than just batteries, the Gigafactory also makes drive units\n\nAlthough the Gigafactory is most often described as a battery factory, it’s also where Tesla produces another important component: drive units for the Model 3.\n\nThe drive units are what convert electrical power from a motor into force that moves the wheels of a vehicle.\n\nEach all-wheel drive versions of the Model 3 requires two drive units and rear-wheel models use just one.\n\nThe drive unit area is separated from the battery manufacturing and assembly area by walls. And with about 90 percent of the work done by machines, it’s the most automated portion of the factory.\n\n“Most of the operations here do not require manual interventions, it can just run,” Lister said of the automation, which has capacity to produce drive units at a rate of as many as 10,000 per week.\n\nThe motors include stators and rotors, gearboxes, and inverters. Parts move by elevator and conveyors, mostly from the third floor, and are assembled into housings.\n\nAfter the drive units are tested, conveyors, autonomous vehicles and robots stage the units for shipping to Fremont.\n\n“The robots are loading the final drive units into the shipping rack,” Lister said.\n\nWhat is it like to be an employee there?\n\nAlthough the factory has an elaborate and extensive food and beverage operation, the Gigafactory doesn’t have gyms, drugstores or other conveniences found in some high-profile tech campuses.\n\nThe list of amenities for employees includes outdoor fitness programs such as running, hiking and mountain biking. Employees get free snacks including cereal, oatmeal, crackers, pretzels, coffee, tea and other beverages.\n\nThe Gigafactory also provides private pumping space for breastfeeding mothers.\n\nFor transportation, the factory offers free commuter shuttles with Wi-Fi from various locations such as Reno, Sparks, Fernley and Carson City in addition to vanpools.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson said the shuttle program has grown from about 150 users in January to about 1,700 today. Including the vanpool, more than 2,000 employees are using alternative transportation to arrive at the factory.\n\nGiven Tesla’s ambitious goals, it’s likely the number of people arriving at the factory will continue to grow.\n\n“The biggest thing we need are folks with enthusiasm and passion and drive and scrappiness,” Lister said. “This family keeps growing bigger and bigger every single day.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/energy/2017/11/02/recovery-oil-and-gas-industry-hiring-again/819773001/", "title": "The Oil And Gas Industry Is Hiring Again | OilPrice.com", "text": "Irina Slav\n\nOilprice.com\n\nThe oil and gas industry is hiring more than it’s letting go for the first time in three years, a new report from recruitment firm NES Global Talent and Oilandgasjopbsearch.com shows.\n\nThis is the latest sign of recovery in oil and gas after the 2014 price crash, reinforcing the belief that a lot of oil and gas companies have successfully adjusted to the new level of oil prices, which is still more than 50% below the 2014 highs.\n\nThe report’s authors surveyed more than 3,000 oil and gas employers as well as almost 7,000 employees, and found that an impressive majority of 60% of employers had plans to hire significantly more people over the next 12 months. In fact, NES Global Talent notes, 2018 will be the first year since 2014 in which there will be more new hires in oil and gas than layoffs.\n\nIn the last three years, more than 440,000 jobs were wiped out in the industry, but now 17% of employers surveyed plan to raise their workforce by more than 10%, with another 19% planning to increase the workforce by 5% to 10% in the next 12 months.

With a tighter capital spending program and a much stricter cost discipline, many E&Ps are not just surviving but expanding production.\n\nIn some places, such as the Permian — the hottest spot in the U.S. shale patch — this has brought about a new challenge: finding enough new hires, as a lot of those workers who lost their jobs amid the crisis have moved on to other careers.\n\nA recent story from the Houston Chronicle details the problems oilfield service providers face now that their workload has increased substantially and qualified workers are hard to come by. One such company, Byrd Oilfield Service, is losing an estimated $7,000 a day because it can’t hire truck drivers fast enough to deliver equipment to its frac crews in the oilfields.\n\nThis situation was only to be expected: When oil prices crashed, everyone in the industry started laying off workers. That was the knee-jerk reaction of an industry that for decades followed the growth-at-all-costs approach to business management. But while these layoffs helped many companies survive, they also became a ticking time bomb.\n\nNot only did a lot of workers change careers amid the price downturn, but also many high school graduates scrapped their plans to pursue oil and gas-related degrees in higher education.\n\nThis is now worrying analysts and investors alike. The problem may seem like a short-term one and workers might start flocking back to oil and gas when employers offer them more money. But it is just as likely that many people will refuse to return to an industry as fickle as oil and gas. That would be a long-term problem that, according to industry executives, could cripple oil and gas for decades to come.\n\nOilprice.com is a USA TODAY content partner offering energy industry news and commentary.

So while washing produce before consuming it is \"an important step,\" it won't reduce the risk of possibly consuming pesticides.\n\nRegardless, Roberts still recommended washing produce for 10 to 15 seconds in cold water before eating it.\n\nWho's most at risk from pesticides?\n\nDespite residues being found in small amounts of produce, they can still pose huge risks to the people who consume them, especially children or people who are pregnant, Roberts said.\n\nShe said that not only are some of these pesticides endocrine disrupters, meaning they can affect hormones in one's body, but Roberts said that people whose diets have higher amounts of pesticides could potentially have a higher risk of getting cancer or cardiovascular disease.\n\nWhile the pesticide levels in some of the tested produce may be within EPA limits, Roberts said that could be an indication that the EPA's thresholds are too high.\n\nLandis said the EPA stands by its comprehensive pesticide assessment and review.\n\n\"EPA’s human health risk assessments consider all relevant scientific data on the pesticide and are based on the overall risk of a pesticide taking into consideration comprehensive hazard, dose-response, and exposure assessments,\" stated Landis.\n\nBut the threat extends beyond consumers, Roberts said: Farmers, their families and other agricultural workers who handle the produce are also at a higher risk from contamination.\n\nAccording to a study published by the National Library of Medicine, agricultural workers are more likely to be susceptible to illnesses related to their exposure to toxic chemicals and pesticides. The chemicals they're exposed to daily can negatively affect their physical and neurological health.\n\nHow to reduce exposure to pesticides as a consumer\n\nRoberts recommended folks buy organic produce when possible.\n\nThe data Consumer Reports collected showed that pesticide-related risk was much lower in organic food than in non-organic food.\n\nThis is because the United States Department of Agriculture only allows pesticides that are approved by the National Organic Program to be used on organic produce, said Roberts.\n\n\"It's not that organic food has no pesticides,\" stated Roberts. \"(The) ones that it does (have) are considered lower risk.\"\n\nRoberts said that Consumer Reports is asking the EPA to ban organophosphates and carbamates, the pesticides that are the biggest drivers of risk in the organization's analysis.\n\n\"These pesticides need to not be used,\" she stated. \"There's no need for it. Organic growers do it without them all the time.\"\n\nIf the EPA proceeded with Consumer Reports' request, it would not be the first time it banned a pesticide from being used.\n\nIn the statement, Landis said that since EPA started the pesticide registration review program in 2006, it \"canceled some or all uses in nearly 25% of the conventional pesticide cases it has completed work on\" when new science points to the need for \"additional mitigations\"\n\nJulia is a trending reporter for USA TODAY.

Follow produce from Yuma, Arizona, to your ...", "text": "Robert Anglen\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nYUMA — Sunlight punches a hole through the early-morning sky, then is quickly obscured by clouds. In a field below, a mechanized platform in constant motion seems to hover above a cabbage crop, its steel frame appearing almost alien among the symmetrical leafy green rows.\n\nThe harvester, with its cutting tables, washing stations and conveyor belts, hums with functionality and efficiency.\n\nWorkers walking behind and in front of it hack off the cabbage heads, snatching them from the ground, cutting off excess debris and tossing them onto the loader. Knives flash, water sluices, wheels roll through furrows.\n\nBut a drop of blood, a piece of trash, a trace of animal feces can halt the harvest. A cut hand, a missing blade, an animal print in the dirt can result in either the loss of a crop in a section of ground or a whole field.\n\nAll in the name of food safety.\n\nWherever you live in North America, if you are eating a salad at home or in a restaurant from January through March, chances are the lettuce came from the Yuma area.\n\nYuma is the nation's largest supplier of winter greens — lettuce, cabbage, spinach, kale, spring mix and more.\n\nThe speed of the process often astonishes those outside the industry. In some cases, leafy greens picked one day could end up on your plate the next. They are harvested, packaged and shipped from the field directly to the store.\n\nBefore the fork gets to your mouth, lots of effort is put forth to assure the produce is safe. After E. coli outbreaks jolted the nation and industry a decade ago, the nation's food-safety net tightened up.\n\nThe process starts in the field before the seed is planted, with soil samples, water tests and field inspections. And it continues through the harvest with rigid inspections, equipment audits and checklists. After the greens are loaded onto trucks, the inspections don't end.\n\n\"Most people don't think about food safety ... They take it for granted,\" said Vicki Scott, director of quality assurance at Amigo Farms in Yuma. \"They have this belief that their food, water and air are safe without thinking about it.\"\n\nThe food-safety net has been woven by individuals, private companies and government agencies, growers, buyers, the Arizona Department of Agriculture, and the Food and Drug Administration, among others.\n\nTen years ago, no uniform standards existed for leafy greens coming out of the field. It was up to the industry to police itself, and the consequences were deadly.\n\n\"It was an honor system,\" Scott said. \"And (safety) depended on how your farm approached that.\"\n\nWorkers, most of them Mexican citizens transported by bus from the border to the fields each day, are schooled in food safety. They can't work if they have the flu or another communicable disease. They can't eat, drink or spit in the field. They must wear hairnets and gloves. No jewelry beyond simple wedding bands is allowed. Nothing can be carried in upper pockets. Workers are assigned numbered tools.\n\nThe cabbage field on Amigo's Y-2 farm is about 3.5 acres and will take about seven hours to harvest.Before workers take up their stations around the harvester, a field supervisor walks the field's perimeter looking for animal incursions; tracks, feces, chewed leaves, bird droppings. Migrating birds have been known to destroy an entire field if they decide to roost there overnight.\n\nThat done, the supervisor moves on to the equipment, working off a checklist before giving the green light.\n\nAn E. coli outbreak in 2006 changed the leafy-green industry's approach to food safety. Three people died and 205 were sickened in 26 states.\n\nAn investigation by the Food and Drug Administration ultimately traced the outbreak to Dole brand baby spinach farmed in California. But before the source could be confirmed, and as more victims went to emergency rooms across the country, the FDA sent a message: Don't eat spinach.\n\nThe FDA didn't specify a brand or a region or a date. It simply warned consumers that spinach wasn't safe. Overnight, grocery stores purged their shelves and restaurants altered their menus. And the spinach industry lost an entire crop. Spinach was left to rot in the field. What already had been picked was destroyed.\n\nFor the first time, an outbreak involving a single crop at one farm had damning economic consequences for all growers.\n\nProduce growers, who had long resisted government oversight and the need for industrywide safety standards, found themselves facing calls for state and federal regulation and demands for public accountability.\n\n\"It put a shock through the industry,\" said Scott Horsfall, executive director of the California Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement. \"It seared these people.\"\n\nThe LGMA, whose members are companies that grow and ship leafy greens, was the industry's answer to the outcry, and in many ways it forestalled legislation and strict government mandates.\n\nThe California LGMA was established in 2007. Arizona followed later that year with a nearly identical agreement.\n\nThe agreements established a certification program that required members to follow specific guidelines from soil preparation through harvest, according to Horsfall.\n\nThe program, which was developed with the help of university scientists, agricultural specialists, food-safety industry experts and government oversight agencies, created protocols for every aspect of the process. They covered pesticides, irrigation, field workers, equipment, storage and transportation.\n\nThe agreements were supported by produce buyers and retailers who were looking for ways to ensure customers that their commodities were safe. Grocery chains signed agreements to buy only from LGMA-certified growers.\n\nThe California and Arizona LGMAs were among several industry-driven initiatives as a result the 2006 outbreak. The Center for Produce Safety, which provides and shares research on food safety, also launched in 2007.\n\nThe LGMAs included a powerful enforcement mechanism: a series of scheduled and surprise inspections called farm audits.\n\nJuan Ley, an Arizona Department of Agriculture produce inspector, starts his review of the cabbage field in the least likely place: the portable toilets.\n\nLey is a certified auditor for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He performs market and shipping inspections for the state and conducts farm audits for the Arizona LGMA. His December visit to Amigo's Y-2 farm is scheduled.\n\nHis methodology combines observation with direct questions and reviews of logs. The audit process easily can last six hours. Ley can't shut down field operations, but his findings can affect the future of any farm and result in a flurry of corrective actions that could threaten LGMA certification.\n\nHe works off a checklist. He looks inside each portable toilet, notes the cleaning log, checks soap dispensers, water flow and paper towels. He makes sure signs are posted notifying workers they must wash their hands. Then he moves into the field.\n\nSouthwest Arizona and the Imperial Valley, its California cousin on the other side of the Colorado River, is known as America's Salad Bowl.\n\nThe Yuma Fresh Vegetable Association reports that local farmers \"produce enough iceberg lettuce each year for every person in the United States, Canada and Mexico to have their very own head of lettuce — with enough lettuce left for every person in the United Kingdom to have one, too.\"\n\nYuma's winter greens season typically lasts from October plantings to March, but the economic impact lasts all year long. The association says on its website that agriculture contributes $2.5 billion to Yuma’s economy and accounts for 25 percent of employment in Yuma County.\n\nThe California and Arizona LGMAs boast their members represent more than 90 percent of shippers in both states and are responsible for producing about 90 percent of leafy greens in the United States.\n\nThe agreements are supported through fees paid by shippers, which enforce the food-safety standards on growers. \"These shippers are ultimately responsible for the entire process of farming, harvesting and shipping to buyers,\" according to the Arizona LGMA website.\n\nMORE: 10 easy tips to keep your salad fresh\n\nThe Arizona LGMA is administered by the state Department of Agriculture, which tracks cartons of produce, monitors fees paid by members based on the amount of produce shipped, tracks audit compliance and distributes food-safety kits.\n\nAudit findings can range from minor infractions to major ones that must be corrected within five days. Most shippers have compliance officers to ensure infractions are addressed. Failure to comply with an audit can result in membership certification being revoked.\n\nShippers that don't belong to the LGMA are small operators and don't likely sell sell leafy greens to major retailers and restaurants, Horsfall said. Non-members also can't ship to Canada, since any produce crossing the border requires LGMA certification.\n\nA shipper, or produce handler, must have 100 percent compliance in order to stay certified, Horsfall said.\n\n\"The handler is the gatekeeper,\" he said. \"Farmers sell to a lot of different handlers.\"\n\nLey clomps over cabbage furrows, stepping through the harvested remains. He surveys the tractor pulling the harvester, looking for leaks and emissions. The machinery doesn't slow down while he works.\n\nOn the platform, he inspects chlorine levels for the wash, using pH test strips to test water ratios. He pulls aside workers and questions them in Spanish about procedures and what they've been told.\n\nWhat do you do if you touch food? How do you prepare in the morning? How do you disinfect hands?\n\n\"If you get a cut, what do you do?\" Ley asks.\n\n\"Report it,\" a worker says. \"Move out of the line.\"\n\nThe professional agreements, audits and safety procedures haven't fully eliminated E. coli and other pathogens from sickening the public.\n\nA 2013 outbreak that sickened KFC, Taco Bell, Burger King and Pizza Hut customers in Canada was traced to a California LGMA member farm.\n\nThe Canadian Food and Inspection Agency traced the source of the outbreak to winter lettuce that had been sold to a Toronto distributor.\n\nAccording to public health records and media accounts, 24 people in multiple provinces were stricken with the bacteria, which is transmitted through contact with animal or human feces. Symptoms range from severe diarrhea to kidney failure.\n\nThis was the second outbreak traced to a California LGMA member in as many years. In 2012, Canadian health officials said they traced tainted lettuce to Amazing Coachella Inc., in Riverside County.\n\n\"We're not perfect,\" Horsfall said. \"But I would say these are relatively small outbreaks that have been traced to our products.\"\n\nHorsfall said an outbreak doesn't automatically result in decertification. He said the LGMA conducts an internal investigation in tandem with ones conducted by public health agencies. He said the LGMA reviews audit reports to ensure the member was in compliance and seeks to better understand what went wrong.\n\n\"We are trying to deal with every conceivable risk out there,\" he said, adding that great strides have been made in the past decade in understanding pathogens. \"We have addressed gaps in our knowledge ... and we don't see the kind of multi-state outbreaks.\"\n\nArizona Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control records show there were 152 food-borne outbreaks in the state between 2011 and 2015. Of those, 69 occurred in a restaurant and nine were linked to food. Only one was traced to lettuce.\n\nIn July 2013, about 94 people contracted E. coli after eating at a Federico's Mexican Restaurant in Litchfield Park. At least two people were hospitalized and the restaurant was temporarily closed.\n\nHealth inspectors did not find E. coli in tests of food samples.\n\n\"As the case-control study results were analyzed, lettuce became the most highly suspect food item,\" county health officials wrote in their final report. \"Lettuce has been associated with previous E. coli outbreaks ... as it is a natural, uncooked food product, and washing does not completely eliminate bacterial contamination.\"\n\nHeath inspectors documented how easily the pathogen could have spread.\n\n\"If contamination had been present on a small amount of lettuce, it could have easily spread to contaminate other lettuce in areas such as the prep sink and shredder, or during storage in a large container,\" health officials reported. \"For example, dirt from the outside of lettuce heads could have been washed into the prep sink and spread to other clean lettuce sitting in the sink. The bacteria could have continued to spread during the shredding and storage process.\"\n\nThe health department did not name the source of the lettuce and noted the restaurant's supplier also served other Valley restaurants and no other cases of E. coli were reported, indicating the contamination occurred at the restaurant.\n\nTo prevent future outbreaks, the restaurant adopted new protocols for storing, washing and handling lettuce.\n\nDuring his audit, Ley finds minor problems at Amigo's temporary equipment yard. This is where shipping containers are prepared and cleaned. It's away from the field, but close enough to keep the cycle of flatbeds used to haul produce flowing.\n\nStorage bins are assembled and lined with plastic, fork-lifted onto trucks, then driven to the harvester and filled with the fresh cabbage. The cabbage is driven to a processing facility, or \"the cooler,\" where it is stored until being delivered to stores and restaurants.\n\nLey discovers two water-storage tanks are labeled with the same number. It means auditors won't be able to tell which records belong to which tank. He also has questions about soap-to-water ratios used in cleaning equipment. Amigo's rules call for following manufacturer's instructions, but there are none.\n\nThese are minor issues, and easily corrected. Back at Amigo's offices, Ley begins a painstaking review of the farm books. He asks about pesticide reports, water tests, fertilizers and composts. He checks the company's food safety plan, inspection reports, operating procedures, sanitation procedures. The list is long.\n\nWhen Ley is finished, he drives to the cooler to inspect procedures involving the bins. Then he will go back to his office and write up his report, which will go to the farm and the state and LGMA.\n\n\"Some days you see more stuff than others,\" Ley says, adding that each crew is different. \"But they are all getting a lot better.\"\n\nThere has never been a leafy-green outbreak traced back to a Yuma farm.\n\nUniversity researchers and Arizona LGMA members attribute the phenomenon to several factors, including Arizona's sunlight and ultraviolet rays, the short growing season and the lack of humidity.\n\nThe warm, dry climate doesn't invite pathogens the way other places do, said Paula Rivadeneira, a microbiologist and assistant professor at the University of Arizona Yuma Agriculture Center.\n\n\"We have never ever had an outbreak sourced to Yuma,\" she said.\n\nRivadeneira said growers and producers are much more aware of the consequences of an outbreak, to the point where they will abandon an entire field to eliminate potential problems.\n\nIt happened last month.\n\nRivadeneira, whose nickname is \"Paula the poop doctor,\" was called to inspect a field after feces was found in a bed of lettuce. Rules call for a five-foot buffer around the scat, and sometimes that's enough to contain the hazard. But Rivadeneira said she also discovered a coyote was tracking the deer.\n\nThe field was contracted to an unspecified restaurant chain. Based on the animal incursion, the buyer made the decision to abandon the field altogether.\n\n\"It was several acres,150 beds of Romaine lettuce,\" Rivadeneira said. \"Some buyers are very, very strict.\"\n\nRivadeneira said animal incursion represents one potential threat to food safety. The threat grows once produce is harvested, she said.\n\n\"There is a much bigger risk of amplification after it comes out of the ground,\" she said. \"The number of people to touch produce increases (risk).\"\n\nOnce the cabbage is dropped off at the processing plant or shipped from the field directly to retailers, the LGMA no longer oversees the crop.\n\nFood safety falls under the control of federal, state and county agencies with overlapping regulations. Generally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration oversees the processing plant and transportation to stores and restaurants, where county health agencies are responsible for local health inspections.\n\nFDA officials won't comment on the inspection process, providing their written guidelines instead. They stress it is the industry's responsibility to adhere to regulations that cover everything from the temperature of coolers and trucks to the labeling of products.\n\nEquipment, transportation, production and process controls are covered in the guidelines.\n\nNew, sweeping federal food-safety standards are in the works.\n\nThe Food Safety Modernization Act, which was passed in 2011, calls for enforcement starting in 2017. But industry experts say it likely will be years before the law is fully implemented.\n\nOn its website, the FDA describes the act as \"the most sweeping reform of our food safety laws in more than 70 years.\" The goal: \"to ensure the U.S. food supply is safe by shifting the focus from responding to contamination to preventing it.\"\n\nThe idea behind the act was to create a federal set of standards that apply across the board to all growers and shippers, regardless of product. The rules will cover everything from farm production to processing, transportation and even importers.\n\nRivadeneira and others said the law exempts small producers with annual revenues of less than $500,000. It also exempts operators who sell more than 50 percent of their products within 400 miles of their farms.\n\nLGMA officials say they are ahead of the law and that the new law copies much of the standards covered in the leafy-green farm audits.\n\n\"Generally, the LGMA goes above and beyond FSMA,\" Horsfall said.\n\nStores and restaurants mark the next-to-last stop for the cabbage in this Yuma field, and oversight continues there.\n\nFor example, Arizona-based Bashas’ grocery stores ship all produce from its own distribution center using its own fleet to ensure quality control. Store officials say before any produce is accepted, it is inspected carefully.\n\n\"Inspectors verify temperature, inspect the trailer for potential cross contamination and infestation, and perform a thorough inspection of the product, including opening cases, physically handling items and cutting open produce,\" Ralph Woodward, Bashas' chief compliance officer, said.\n\nWoodward says all of the company's producers are required to comply with FSMA and the California Leafy Green Products Handler Marketing Agreement.\n\nProduce is again inspected at the store and goes through a vegetable wash before it is stocked for customers.\n\n\"We understand the critical importance of food safety throughout the supply-chain process,\" Woodward says.\n\nThat's not quite the end of the journey, however. Before the cabbage ends up on the end of your fork, there's one last step you can take to ensure food safety:\n\nWash it.\n\nThe food industry has spent millions of dollars since 2011 to comply with new federal food-safety standards.\n\nIndustry officials say they don't expect to see any significant reversal of the Food Safety Modernization Act under President Donald Trump's Republican administration.\n\nSome parts of the sweeping new law might be \"tweaked,\" but the standards will remain intact, said Lance Jungmeyer, president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas in Nogales.\n\n\"I don't see how the current political landscape is going to change the need for food safety,\" he said, adding that some flaws in the law might be addressed \"but I don't think there is going to be a need to roll back FSMA.\"\n\nThe association represents 100 companies involved in the growth, harvest, marketing, import and distribution of Mexican produce. Jungmeyer said the food industry has worked hard to comply with the law, including new training and the hiring of food-safety compliance officers.\n\nVicki Scott, director of quality assurance at Amigo Farms in Yuma, said companies have spent years restructuring in anticipation of the new law. She said the final piece is enforcement, which is supposed to begin in 2018.\n\n\"The idea was to educate before they regulate,\" she said.\n\nScott said she doubts that the Trump administration would scrap the new law but acknowledged there is some trepidation among insiders, who are taking a wait-and-see approach.\n\nThe same is true for labor concerns, Scott said.\n\nScott said growers have so far been unaffected by executive orders regarding border security or the proposed wall.\n\nYuma depends on workers from Mexico to plant and harvest crops. Arizona's employment verification system requires workers to obtain work permits to get jobs on this side of the border.\n\n\"So far we're seeing normal border wait times for people to get across,\" she said. \"They are allowed to cross the border and work for us.\"\n\nScott said some workers have expressed concerns about stricter rules, primarily because they could affect their family members. She said some employees are anxious to help relatives get their paperwork processed as soon as possible.\n\nTrump has not made any announcement about changing the work permit system for farm laborers, but any such policy could dramatically affect Yuma.\n\n\"If he does away with work cards, we could be in trouble,\" Scott said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2022/04/09/baby-formula-shortage-2022-worsens/9525498002/", "title": "Baby formula shortage 2022 worsens after Abbott Similac recall", "text": "Less than two months after a baby formula recall, retailers are reporting shortages with some stores rationing sales.\n\nNearly 30% of popular baby formula brands may be sold out at retailers across the U.S., according to an analysis by Datasembly, which assessed supplies at more than 11,000 stores.\n\nThat's a higher level than other products, said Ben Reich, CEO of the Tysons, Virginia-based research firm.\n\n\"Inflation, supply chain shortages, and product recalls have brought an unprecedented amount of volatility to the category, and we expect to continue to see baby formula as one of the most affected categories in the market,” he said.\n\nBaby formula shortage:5 things you can do to feed your baby during a formula shortage\n\nRecall Database:Check USA TODAY's recall resource for the latest updates\n\nThe shortage comes after Abbott Nutrition voluntarily recalled in mid-February select batches of Similac, Alimentum and EleCare formulas manufactured in Sturgis, Michigan.

A spokeswoman for Gov. Kay Ivey confirmed the state signed a contract with Caddell Construction Co., effective April 15, for construction of a specialized men’s prison facility in Elmore County “that will provide enhanced medical and mental health services.” “The new facility will create a safer security environment for inmates and security personnel. Our construction timeline continues to remain on schedule,” Gina Maiola, a spokeswoman for Ivey, wrote in an email. The Alabama Department of Corrections on Wednesday declined to release a copy of the contract. A spokeswoman said it needed to be redacted, and that would take some time because it is a lengthy contract. The department did not immediately respond to an email seeking information about the cost or the size of the prison. Ivey’s office indicated the prison system should be be able to provide a copy of the “publicly available contract documents in the coming days.” Lawmakers and the governor approved a construction plan that also includes another prison with at least 4,000 beds in Escambia County, a new women’s prison, and renovations to existing facilities.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Some local officials have raised concerns about militarization of the police force after learning of the police department’s plans to buy an armored security vehicle that can seat 12 officers. Some have referred to the vehicle as a tank and said they worry it could harm a transparent relationship between police and the community. Police counter that the vehicle is a way to help protect officers, especially when dealing with people firing weapons, the Juneau Empire reports. “There’s a policy question here about militarizing our police force, and I don’t agree with that,” City and Borough of Juneau Assembly member Carole Triem said. “I think we’ve heard from the community that they really desire transparency when it comes to operations.” Triem raised the issue late at Monday’s assembly meeting, where she also objected to the police department’s ability to buy the vehicle with a grant that doesn’t require assembly approval. The Lenco Armored Vehicle BearCat G3 will cost more than $300,000 when custom-built to Juneau police department specifications, Lt. Krag Campbell said. Campbell said that despite some in the community describing the vehicle as a “tank,” it’s not a military vehicle. “Generally, it’s for our emergency response teams and our fire department,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Electric companies won’t have to worry about competing for customers after Gov.

Utilities in Arizona supported the legislation because they said allowing competitors to enter the market would threaten the reliability of the power grid as various companies tried to forecast how much power their customers needed. Ducey said competition is a “critically important policy goal” but echoed those concerns about power-grid reliability in his signing letter. “Arizona will not follow the path of California, Texas and other states that have mismanaged their grids and continually experience rolling brownouts and blackouts,” Ducey said in a statement on the bill. Officials at Green Mountain Energy, a company whose move to compete with Arizona utilities appears to have prompted the legislation, said they were disappointed in the governor’s actions. “It is unfortunate that Arizona’s law that would have created competition in the electricity industry, which has been on its books for two decades, has never been implemented,” Green Mountain Vice President Mark Parsons said in a statement.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state is suing Family Dollar over the discovery of more than 1,000 rodents in a distribution facility that prompted the discount retail chain to recall items purchased from hundreds of stores in the South. The lawsuit, filed Thursday by Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge in state court, accuses the chain and parent company Dollar General of deceiving consumers, negligence and engaging in a conspiracy that allowed the infestation at the West Memphis facility to occur. “This misconduct by Family Dollar Stores and Dollar Tree allowed them to maximize profits, while causing Arkansas citizens to purchase hazardous, adulterated and contaminated products,” the lawsuit said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced in February that it had inspected the distribution facility following a consumer complaint. Inside the building, inspectors said they found live rodents, dead rodents in “various states of decay,” rodent feces, dead birds and bird droppings. A Dollar Tree spokesman did not immediately return messages seeking comment Thursday. According to the lawsuit, state and federal inspections show Family Dollar had known of the rodent infestation at its facility since at least January 2020.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: People who get hurt because of a doctor’s negligence could soon get a lot more money in malpractice lawsuits under an agreement reached Wednesday that – if approved by the Legislature – would avoid a costly fight at the ballot box this November while resolving one of the state’s longest-running political battles. California does not limit how much money patients can win in malpractice cases for economic damages, which include things that can be counted such as medical expenses and lost wages. But since 1975, state law has limited how much money patients can win for what can’t be counted – such as pain and suffering – to $250,000. Trial attorneys and patients’ rights groups have tried and failed for decades to raise that limit, noting it sometimes costs more than that to take one of these complex lawsuits to trial. Doctors have usually opposed raising the limits, saying it would result in soaring malpractice insurance premiums that could put some community health clinics out of business. With neither side budging, California voters were set to settle the issue in November. But supporters of raising the limit agreed to withdraw the measure from the November ballot Wednesday, instead supporting a new bill in the Legislature that would gradually increase the limit over the next 10 years. The bill has the support of the California Medical Association, the Consumer Attorneys of California, Californians Allied for Patient Protection, state legislative leaders and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nColorado\n\nCanon City: An outbreak of an undetermined and highly contagious disease has killed dozens of wild horses at a federal holding facility in southern Colorado. Bureau of Land Management officials say 67 horses have died since the outbreak began Saturday at the agency’s holding pen in Canon City, about 150 miles southwest of Denver. “We are working with local, state and federal officials to determine what is impacting horses in the facility and how we can respond as effectively as possible,” said Stephen Leonard, the manager of the BLM Colorado Wild Horse and Burro Program. The facility, which is under voluntary quarantine, currently holds 2,550 horses. BLM officials say the horses that have been most affected by the disease were gathered from the West Douglas area last fall. No other information has been released.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Broad agreement has been reached on a revised one-year state budget proposal, Gov. Ned Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly announced Wednesday. The $24.2 billion plan, set to take effect July 1 in the midst of the election season, would see nearly $500 million in tax reductions including the continuation of the 25-cent-per-gallon gas tax cut until Dec. 1, lawmakers said. It also includes substantial new spending for mental health programs for children and early childhood programs, which have struggled to pay workers competitive wages while ensuring services are affordable to families. And the proposal makes $2 billion in payments to help reduce state pension debt, according to the legislators, who have yet to release any documents. Lamont and the Democrats haven’t settled how much of the state’s share of federal COVID-19 funds will be spent in this budget, including how much of that money will be set aside for pandemic pay for essential workers and to reduce the $493 million debt in the state’s unemployment trust fund. But they expressed confidence the budget will be approved before the legislative session ends May 4. Democrats said they were hopeful that at least some Republicans, the minority in the Assembly, will support the proposal.\n\nDelaware\n\nBear: Sixteen years ago after Jason McKenry’s 2-year-old gray tabby escaped from his apartment, he got a text: Ritz had been taken to a veterinarian and was about to be put down when someone found a microchip. Little is known of the cat’s whereabouts after that day in Bear, though McKenry did learn that Ritz had hitched a ride in a neighbor’s pickup truck after charging out of the apartment. For the past couple of years, Ritz has been surviving thanks to the kindness of strangers near Lums Pond. One of those strangers took the cat to the vet and started the chain of events that led to McKenry and Ritz being reunited. But everything in between is a mystery. “I wish he could talk,” McKenry said this week. “I’d love to hear his story.” Everyone connected to the cat, from those who were feeding him to the makers of the microchip, is stunned by the story. “Sixteen years? That’s a new record as far as I know,” said Tom Sharp, president of AKC Reunite, a national database for microchipped pets. “That’s amazing.” Sharp said he expects shelters and veterinarians to check for microchips on animals when they are taken in or before they are adopted out. These microchips, known as radio frequency identification, are not able to locate or trace a pet’s whereabouts because they don’t have GPS.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Residents in the Southeast neighborhood are being warned after a turkey was seen disrupting bike riders and hikers on a nearby trail, WUSA-TV reports. Late last week, the Department of Energy and Environment, National Park Service, Humane Rescue Alliance and Maryland Department of National Resources were first alerted to an aggressive turkey attacking residents on the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail. Wildlife officials said they had received multiple reports of turkeys attacking people in the district. According to DOEE, it’s turkey breeding season, and the rise in attacks is related to territorial behavior. One of the latest encounters was caught on video by local go-go musician DeDe Folarin of Rare Essence, who was riding his bike on the trail April 12. “All of a sudden, I was coming around the bend, and this big wild turkey just jumps up and almost claws me in the face,” he said. Folarin said he dismounted his bike while the turkey continued to harass him for nearly five minutes. The large bird then turned its attention to another passing cyclist as Folarian captured video of the encounter. “After the lady asked if I could help, I picked up a stick, and I kind of whacked the turkey, and he kind of ran back into the brush, and that was it,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A judge on Wednesday vacated the life sentence of a 55-year-old Black man who prosecutors said was wrongfully convicted because of mistaken identity in 1991. “I feel good. Real good,” Thomas “Jay” Raynard James said Wednesday as he left a Miami courtroom with his attorneys and family members. James was convicted of the 1990 death of Francis McKinnon, largely on identification by an eyewitness who told jurors she watched him gun down her stepfather during a robbery in his Coconut Grove apartment. Earlier Wednesday, James, wearing his red prison uniform and shackles, stood behind his mother, Doris Strong, as Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle detailed a 90-page motion her office filed asking for the conviction to be vacated. “Mom, hopefully the court will grant you the freedom you’ve been looking for for so many years,” Fernandez Rundle told Strong, who sobbed quietly throughout the news conference. James was 23 when he was convicted. Over the past year, Fernandez Rundle said, members of her office’s Justice Project poured over 20,000 pages of documents, reinterviewed witnesses, resubmitted fingerprints and retested DNA samples. In a 90-page motion to vacate the conviction, prosecutors said that “what appears to be a chance coincidence that the defendant, Thomas Raynard James, had the same name as a suspect named by witnesses and anonymous tipsters … led to the defendant’s photograph being included in a lineup, and set in motion a mistaken identity.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Morris Brown College has regained full accreditation after a 20-year journey that its leaders hope will ultimately prompt higher enrollment. The Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools voted Tuesday to grant the liberal arts college full accreditation status, meaning its students can apply for federal loans and Pell grants, the association confirmed to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools revoked Morris Brown’s accreditation in 2002 after a former college president and financial aid director were found to be misappropriating federal funds and rising debt. “Morris Brown College just made history,” President Kevin James told the newspaper. “We’re excited about it. A lot of people had written us off. But due to a lot of hard work and dedication, we were able to regain our accreditation.” Morris Brown sought accreditation from TRACS, which also approved reaccreditation to another HBCU in Georgia: Paine College in Augusta. James, Morris Brown’s leader since 2019, called the process “the hard reset.” The historically Black college planned to formally announce the reaccreditation Thursday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s top public health officials said Wednesday that the COVID-19 pandemic is still active but is moving into a new phase of the disease, in which people can test themselves at home and ideally avoid serious illness thanks to vaccination and the use of therapeutic treatments. Gov. David Ige described the change as a transition from “emergency response” to “public health management.” He said at a news conference that state officials would be handling COVID-19 more similarly to other diseases. The adjustment has been underway for a few months, said Dr. Libby Char, the director of the state Department of Health. One example is how the state uses contact tracers. “We’ve seen a shift from trying to track down every single case and all of their contacts to instead getting the message out so that we all have our own personal COVID-19 preparedness plan,” said Dr. Sarah Kemble, the state’s epidemiologist. Part of that change is possible because home test kits are now widely available. But another reason is that universal contact tracing isn’t the best method to control an airborne disease like COVID-19, she said. People can follow self-isolation guidelines and notify those with whom they’ve been in contact about their exposure.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Jurors have begun deliberating in the rape trial of a former state lawmaker accused of sexually assaulting a legislative intern last year. Prosecutors and the defense attorney for Aaron von Ehlinger made their final arguments to the jury late Thursday morning, moments after von Ehlinger gave his own recounting of the events. Von Ehlinger, 39, has pleaded not guilty to felony charges of rape and sexual penetration with a foreign object – both charges carry a maximum penalty of up to life in prison – and maintains he had consensual sex with the 19-year-old intern. The Associated Press generally does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted and has referred to the woman in this case as “Jane Doe” at her request. Doe told her supervisors that von Ehlinger, then a Republican representative from Lewiston, raped her in March 2021 at his Boise apartment after the two had dinner at a restaurant. Von Ehlinger resigned from the House of Representatives last year after a legislative ethics committee recommended he be banned from the Statehouse because of his conduct with Doe. Ada County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Katelyn Farley told jurors the case was about “power in the wrong hands” used to the “great devastation” of Doe. Von Ehlinger had social, political and physical power over the petite intern, Farley said.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed four pieces of legislation into law Wednesday aimed at easing a shortage of teachers and classroom aides in public schools. The new laws lower the fee to reinstate a lapsed teaching certificate, allow student teaching by college seniors, lower the minimum age for classroom aides, and extend the number of days in a row a short-term substitute can spend in one classroom if a disaster is declared. Pritzker signed the bills during a ceremony at Springfield High School, just two blocks from the Capitol. The Illinois State Board of Education estimates there will be about 4,120 openings in public schools this fall. That includes 1,700 teachers and 1,240 paraprofessionals, who are qualified but unlicensed educators who help teachers. It’s not a new situation and predates the COVID-19 pandemic. But the coronavirus, which forced schools into a roller coaster of openings and closings, scheduling and staffing, worsened matters. Several lawmakers have been focused on getting classrooms staffed with qualified people. Rep. Sue Scherer, a Decatur Democrat and former teacher, said a retired teacher who is a constituent wanted to help out because of the crisis before learning it would cost him $500 to reinstate his license. Scherer’s legislation, run through the Senate by Meg Loughran Cappel, D-Shorewood, lowers that fee to $50 immediately.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafeyette: Purdue University and Duke Energy plan to jointly explore the feasibility of using advanced nuclear energy to meet the campus’s long-term energy needs and reduce its carbon footprint, they announced Wednesday. Purdue and Duke intend to study power produced through small modular reactors, which are significantly smaller than traditional nuclear power plants. An SMR could meet current and future needs for the West Lafayette campus and provide excess power to the state’s electric grid. SMRs can be prefabricated off site, saving money and time in construction. “No other option holds as much potential to provide reliable, adequate electric power with zero carbon emissions,” Purdue President Mitch Daniels said. However, nuclear power plants use large amounts of water for steam production and cooling. They also produce spent uranium fuel, which is stored in pools or steel-lined concrete vaults for decades. Purdue provided no time line on when its first SMR might arrive on campus. Duke said it is the largest regulated nuclear plant operator in the nation, with 11 nuclear units at six plant sites in North Carolina and South Carolina.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Bureau of Refugee Services says it is seeking families to become official sponsors of Ukrainian refugees who may be coming to Iowa under a new federal program. In a news release, the bureau said it plans to assist families with webinars and training sessions to help sponsors understand what resettlement entails, what their duties and responsibilities will be, and the resources available to help them. The news release did not say how many Ukrainians are likely to come to Iowa or what plans are being made to deal with those Ukrainians after Afghan refugees who began arriving in the Des Moines metro late last year told reporters they’ve struggled without sufficient long-term housing, food and other assistance. While the bureau said it stands ready to help prospective sponsors, they also can apply directly through the federal program at welcome.us. But Des Moines Refugee Support, a nonprofit that has been working closely with Afghan refugees, said in a statement Wednesday that volunteers would love to welcome Ukrainians, but Des Moines is not ready to take them. “We are worried about the logistics, as we have many Afghan families still in hotels, Afghans still needing food assistance, Afghan babies without diapers,” the statement said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state saw a 4.1% increase in the number of abortions performed in 2021 compared with 2020, with more Missouri residents but fewer Oklahoma and Texas residents coming into Kansas to terminate pregnancies. A preliminary report Tuesday from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment showed that 7,849 abortions were performed in the state last year. That’s 303 more than the 7,546 performed in Kansas in 2020. The state saw an increase of more than 9% in the number of abortions performed in 2020 over 2019, due to an influx of patients from Oklahoma and Texas, where Republican governors shut down providers early in the coronavirus pandemic, while Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, kept them open. But the number of abortions performed in Kansas for women from Oklahoma and Texas dropped to a total of 370 in 2021 from 566 in 2020, a decline of nearly 35%. Meanwhile, the number of abortions for women from Missouri was 3,458 last year, up 8% or 257 from 2020. And 8% more Kansas residents had abortions in the state in 2021 than in 2020. The increase was 292, making the total 3,937.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A long-controversial proposal for a pipeline that would snake through Bullitt County and a beloved arboretum is being sent back to the drawing board after a vital permit for the project was suspended. After several conservation groups threatened to sue to prevent Louisville Gas & Electric from building the natural gas pipeline, which would cut through some property owned by Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decided to review how the project could affect three bat species protected by the Endangered Species Act that live in the region. Construction on the 12-mile pipeline has not yet started and, under the new ruling, will not be able to begin until the two agencies ensure the species – Indiana bats, gray bats and northern long-eared bats – are not put at risk. The contested project has been in the works for years, sparking outcry from environmental advocates and others in the community since it was first proposed in 2015. “Save Bernheim Forest” yard signs are a common sight around Louisville among homeowners concerned about the proposed pipeline’s potential impact on the popular 16,000-acre wildlife sanctuary just south of the city.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A bill to outlaw spanking and all other forms of corporal punishment in the state’s public schools cleared its first hurdle Wednesday as lawmakers determine whether hitting children in schools is an appropriate form of discipline or abuse. The Louisiana House Education Committee advanced Metairie Republican Rep. Stephanie Hilferty’s House Bill 649 without objection. “We don’t allow juveniles in our detention centers or (inmates) in our prisons to be hit; I’m asking for the same treatment for our children while they’re in school,” Hilferty said while testifying for her bill. An identical bill in 2021 by Hilferty made it to the House floor, where it was defeated on a 48-49 vote. Louisiana is one of 19 states that still allows corporal punishment in public schools. Among the others are neighbors Arkansas, Mississippi and Texas. Fellow Metairie Republican Rep. Laurie Schlegel made the motion to approve Hilferty’s legislation. “I was shocked that this is still a thing,” Schlegel said. Louisiana Partnership for Children and Families executive director Susan East Nelson, who has previously described corporal punishment as “state-sponsored child abuse,” testified again in favor of banning the practice. “This has been a priority for us for 10 years,” Nelson said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A hunting group is suing the state to overturn its long-standing ban on Sunday hunting. Hunting bear, moose, wild turkey and deer is popular in Maine, but the state has barred Sunday hunting for generations. Opponents of the ban filed their lawsuit Wednesday with a claim that the law violates the state’s new “Right to Food” amendment. Maine voters passed the nation’s first such constitutional amendment last year. The amendment states that individuals have a right to harvest food of their own choosing. The opponents of the Sunday hunting ban said in a statement that Maine’s long-standing ban “was created based on the religious and social beliefs at the time, not biology or science.” But the ban has withstood challenges in the past. The Legislature’s Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife voted against a proposal to end the ban in March. The Maine Professional Guides Association, which represents guides who assist hunters, was among the groups that opposed the change. The only other state that bans Sunday hunting is Massachusetts.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which prints U.S. currency, is moving forward with plans to build its new facility in Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Wednesday. The bureau is expecting to house at least 850 workers on site, with 600 additional employees working remotely, the governor’s office said. The 104-acre site, located at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Prince George’s County, has been officially transferred to the Department of the Treasury. It will house a new state-of-the-art and environmentally conscious production facility to print U.S. paper currency and other federal security products. “Over the past three years, the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the state of Maryland have worked closely on evaluating the potential for this Beltsville facility and determining how we can best work together to make this project successful,” Hogan said in a statement. The bureau is in the design stage of the project and plans to wrap up design development by summer 2023. Construction of the new facility, which is being managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Baltimore District, is anticipated to be completed by early 2027, with currency production starting midyear.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A former transit police officer has pleaded guilty to assaulting and violating the civil rights of a 63-year-old man who refused to get off a bus last year but has avoided jail and could eventually have the charges dismissed. Prosecutors on Wednesday asked a Superior Court judge to sentence Nicholas Morrissey to a one-year suspended sentence with three years of probation, according to a statement Thursday from the Suffolk district attorney’s office. The judge, citing Morrissey’s military service and the fact he resigned, continued the case for an 18-month probationary period. That means charges could be dismissed if Morrissey complies with the terms of probation. He is also not allowed to seek another job in law enforcement. “The actions of one officer can sow seeds of distrust in our entire system,” Suffolk District Attorney Kevin Hayden said in a statement. “I’m grateful to the Transit Police Department for their immediate actions to hold a member of their own ranks accountable and to ensure the wellbeing of the public they serve.” Morrissey’s attorney said his client is a Marine Corps veteran who had no prior disciplinary problems. “I think it was a fair disposition,” Robert Jubinville said. “This fellow had been on the job for 13 years and had never had any issues.”\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A man in prison for 15 years for kidnapping and sexual assault was cleared of the crimes Wednesday after authorities discovered many mistakes, including a failure to disclose DNA results proving his innocence. “There were so many things missed along the way,” said Valerie Newman of the Wayne County prosecutor’s office, who reviews Detroit-area cases that can turn out to be wrongful convictions. Judge Kelly Ramsey approved a request to erase Terance Calhoun’s convictions in two cases from 2006 and immediately release him from prison. His earliest parole date would have been November 2023. Calhoun, 35, declined to speak during the court hearing, which was held by video conference, but wore a big smile when lawyers Tabitha Harris and Michael Mittlestat congratulated him. “Good luck to you,” the judge said. In 2007, Calhoun pleaded no contest to kidnapping and other charges and was sentenced to at least 17 years in prison. He was accused of targeting two teen girls in Detroit in 2006. But a few months after Calhoun was sent to prison, tests revealed a condom linked to an assault on the second victim had ruled him out as the perpetrator. There is no indication the DNA results were given to his lawyer, Newman said. She also noted that a description of the attacker as a man with braids and a puzzle tattoo didn’t fit Calhoun.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Legislative leaders announced a deal Thursday to refill the state’s unemployment insurance trust fund and to pay bonuses to front-line workers, resolving a months­long impasse. The tentative agreement includes $2.7 billion to replenish the trust fund and pay back a debt to the federal government for jobless aid, as well as $500 million in bonuses for workers who took risks during the pandemic. House Democrats came down from their $1 billion proposal for bonus checks, cutting the amount per worker in half to $750 but keeping eligibility at about 667,000 workers. The proposal – which would spend all of Minnesota’s remaining federal pandemic relief funds of more than $1 billion – also includes $190 million for a pandemic response account to support efforts that are already ongoing, like the state’s testing apparatus. A House provision making hourly school employees eligible for unemployment insurance during the summer months was cut in the compromise. “We tried to get it done earlier,” said Senate Majority Leader Jeremy Miller, R-Winona, citing the Senate passage of its unemployment insurance bill in February on a bipartisan 55-11 vote. “It took a little bit longer than we’d hoped, but the final deal is a good deal for the people of Minnesota, and we’re happy to get it done.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves has vetoed part of a budget bill for the University of Mississippi Medical Center, saying he objects to spending $50 million for improvements to the adult hospital in Jackson. The Republican governor issued the partial veto of Senate Bill 3010 on Tuesday. Legislators specified the $50 million would come from Mississippi’s pandemic recovery money from the federal government. UMMC declined to comment on the partial veto, spokesperson Marc Rolph said Wednesday. Reeves wrote on Twitter that UMMC’s academic functions – teaching physicians, nurses and other health care professionals – are largely funded by the state, but the hospital is not. “They are responsible for their own operational budget – just like other hospitals,” Reeves wrote. The governor wrote that UMMC receives “competitive advantages” over other hospitals and physician groups because it does not need the Health Department’s approval for new facilities or large equipment. However, UMMC does need approval from the state college board. “There is little reason that Mississippi taxpayers should radically increase the commitment to further subsidize the operations of UMMC to the detriment of competitors,” Reeves wrote. “Furthermore, they currently have enough money to willingly turn away patients on private insurance, clearly indicating that they have no need for the state to underwrite their ambitious building/spending goals.”\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A divided state Senate narrowly passed legislation Thursday that could allow thousands of elderly, disabled and homeless residents to spend government food stamp benefits at restaurants – something currently allowed in only a handful of states. The bill revealed deep divisions within the Republican-led chamber, where most GOP members voted against what they described as an “expansion of the welfare state” even as Republican leaders joined with Democrats to support it. The measure passed 18-15, receiving the bare minimum to advance to the House with just two weeks remaining in the legislative session. Low-income residents receiving aid from the federally funded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program generally must get food at retail locations, such as grocery and convenience stores. But the federal government allows states to enact policies authorizing elderly, disabled and homeless residents to buy food at restaurants that agree to sell meals at lower prices. Some in the conservative caucus claimed their party leaders were violating a core GOP campaign pledge by supporting the legislation and encouraging low-income residents to squander their benefits. Others pushed back, noting the bill doesn’t increase the overall cost of the program but rather offers options for hot meals for people in need. Those who are disabled or elderly might not be able to cook, and people who are homeless don’t have refrigerators to store food or kitchens to prepare it, said Sen. Tony Luetkemeyer, the Republican whip responsible for rallying votes.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A new law that requires the state’s attorney general to warn voters if a proposed ballot initiative would hurt businesses does not apply to ballot measures that would amend the state constitution, a state judge has ruled. Wednesday’s decision by District Court Judge Chris Abbott of Helena allows signature gathering to continue for a constitutional initiative that seeks to cap residential property taxes at 1% of the assessed value and limit annual changes in valuations, thus limiting changes in residential property taxes. Market value assessments would be performed when property is sold or significantly improved, under the proposed initiative. The Montana Federation of Public Employees, the Montana Farmers Union, Realtor Jeff Barber, farmer Ron Ostberg and rancher Dennis McDonald argued in a complaint filed in January that Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen and Attorney General Austin Knudsen did not meet the requirements of the new law before allowing signatures to be gathered to put Constitutional Initiative 121 on the November 2022 ballot. The state argued and Abbott agreed that the law passed in 2021 applies only to initiatives that seek to change the law, not to change the state constitution. The plaintiffs oppose the ballot initiative because putting a limit on residential property taxes could shift the tax burden to agricultural land and other property and lead to reductions in state services.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Another large case of bird flu at a farm has been confirmed, state and federal agriculture officials said Wednesday. The highly contagious avian influenza was found on a farm in Knox County in northeast Nebraska along the South Dakota border. It is the seventh confirmed case of the disease in the state this year, the Nebraska Department of Agriculture said in a news release. More than 2.1 million laying hens will be euthanized, agriculture officials said. The farm will also be quarantined, and a 6.2-mile control zone will be established. The department also announced that an order prohibiting any type of birds from events such as fairs, expositions, swap meets, exotic sales and live bird auctions has been extended to May 15. It was scheduled to expire Saturday.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A wild coyote howls at the glow of a lamp post in a snowy parking lot. A mustard-yellow recliner is beached in a flooded grove of trees. These images depicting interactions between the human and natural world are part of the Nevada Museum of Art’s Altered Landscape collection and the inspiration behind a new classical composition, “Altered Landscape,” which the Reno Philharmonic will perform May 7-8 at the Pioneer Center for the Performing Arts. In the upcoming performance, the Reno Phil plans to present a composition that will tackle the complexity of climate change and how the pandemic reflected that complexity. “This is a project that sheds both light and hope on one of the most urgent issues of our time: climate change,” said Reno Phil Music Director Laura Jackson. “There is no question that we are in an era where human impact has reached every corner of the earth, and we can no longer take for granted the health and abundance of the natural resources we hold dear.” In 2019, Jackson commissioned Peruvian-born composer Jimmy López Bellido to create a piece of music that would tell a story about climate change. The Reno Phil is approaching orchestras worldwide to perform the symphony in their respective communities. Rather than paying a consortium fee to the Reno group, other orchestras will donate a minimum of $1,000 directly to The Nature Conservancy.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Senate has blocked an attempt to eliminate a registration system put in place years ago to prevent widespread hepatitis C outbreaks. New Hampshire created the Board of Registration for Medical Technicians in response to David Kwiatkowski, who is serving 39 years in prison for replacing painkillers with saline-filled syringes tainted with his blood. Despite being fired numerous times over drug allegations, Kwiatkowski had worked in 18 hospitals in seven states before being hired in at Exeter Hospital in New Hampshire. After his arrest in 2012, 46 people in four states were diagnosed with the same strain of the hepatitis C virus he carries, including one who died in Kansas. The New Hampshire House recently passed a bill that would eliminate the board, with supporters saying it creates unnecessary bureaucracy at a time when health care facilities are struggling to hire workers. But the Senate killed it Thursday, citing the importance of patient safety.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Orsted, the Danish wind power developer, signed an agreement Thursday with New Jersey officials to use a state-financed manufacturing port to build the components of the state’s first offshore wind farm. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the agreement during an international wind energy conference in Atlantic City, from whose coast the project’s turbines should be visible on the distant horizon. Orsted, which is partnering with Newark-based PSEG to build the project, will lease the New Jersey Wind Port in Salem County for two years starting in April 2024. Murphy did not reveal how much the developers will pay for the lease. The parties signed the letter of intent Thursday, but binding agreements are to be submitted to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority by June. The pact marks the first return on the state’s investment of up to $500 million in the wind port, designed to help the state attract companies interested in building wind power projects as New Jersey seeks to become the East Coast hub of the offshore wind industry. “This is a huge moment: Today is a vision turning into reality,” Murphy said at the conference, sponsored by the Business Network for Offshore Wind. “This is truly New Jersey’s ‘if you build it, they will come’ moment.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The city’s K-12 schools should cut staff and think about downsizing the district’s footprint amid dwindling enrollment while spending more for the education of low-income students who fell further behind their peers during this school year, according to a report from the Legislature made public Wednesday. The report from the powerful Legislative Finance Committee recommended Albuquerque Public Schools let go of 400 of the district’s 12,000 employees but didn’t specify how many of the district’s increasingly empty schools it should shutter. The system has 144 schools and 73,000 students, down from 85,000 six years ago. Public schools in New Mexico have not recovered from the exodus of students that accelerated during the pandemic, with enrollment across the state and in Albuquerque still down about 4%, more than the average of 2.6% for 41 U.S. states. Thousands of families in New Mexico amid the pandemic tried home-schooling or charter schools for the first time and didn’t send their kids back to traditional classrooms this year. Despite getting financing federal pandemic relief funds, most school districts across the U.S. now have fewer students and less funding than before the pandemic, forcing educators to consider cutting spending.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state’s highest court on Wednesday rejected new congressional maps that had widely been seen as favoring Democrats, largely agreeing with Republican voters who argued the district boundaries were unconstitutionally gerrymandered. The decision may delay New York’s primary elections by as much as two months and is likely a hammer-blow to Democrats’ national redistricting hopes, which leaned heavily on their ability to gerrymander New York state to maximize the number of seats they could win in the U.S. House of Representatives. The state’s Court of Appeals said the Democratic-led Legislature lacked the authority to redraw congressional and state Senate maps after an independent redistricting commission charged with crafting new maps failed to reach a consensus. The judges also said lawmakers gerrymandered the congressional maps to Democrats’ favor, in violation of a 2014 constitutional amendment designed to rout out political gamesmanship in redistricting. The Appeals Court handed authority to draw new district maps to an expert, known as a special court master, instead of the Legislature. “Prompt judicial intervention is both necessary and appropriate to guarantee the People’s right to a free and fair election,” said the court’s opinion, written by Chief Judge Janet DiFiore.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: State residents can now cast ballots in person for the May 17 primary elections. Election boards in all 100 counties opened early voting sites Thursday morning. People who are registered to vote or who apply at a site can cast ballots. Party nominations for the U.S. Senate and House, the Legislature, judicial positions and county offices are at stake. There are also municipal races – many of them officially nonpartisan – in towns and cities where 2021 elections were delayed. The early-voting period continues through the afternoon of May 14. Some counties will have early voting on preceding weekends. An unaffiliated voter can choose to cast ballots in the Democratic or Republican primary but not both. Registered Democrats and Republicans must vote in their party’s primary. People who are already registered have other voting options. They can request a mail-in absentee ballot by May 10, or they can vote in person May 17.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMedora: The planned Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in western North Dakota won’t get all the money initially promised from a Walmart heir, but officials say they surpassed its $100 million private fundraising goal anyway. Rob and Melani Walton had pledged $50 million to the project near Medora but wound up committing to $15 million instead, as first reported by KFGO radio. Melani Walton, a Williston native, had been a member of the library’s board but resigned last month. Rob Walton is the eldest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton. Both library officials and the Waltons downplayed the diminished donation. “When the history of this remarkable institution is told years from now, Melani and Rob will occupy a significant place in that story,” library foundation CEO Ed O’Keefe told The Bismarck Tribune. “We wish them nothing but the best.” A statement from the Rob and Melani Walton Foundation said the couple “is so pleased to have supported this project from its inception.” Library organizers set the fundraising bar at $100 million in order to access an additional $50 million in state money. O’Keefe declined to say how much money has been raised, citing “the quiet phase of the capital campaign,” but said that “I can assure you it is in excess of $100 million.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Frustrated Democrats took the unusual step Thursday of calling their own political mapmaking hearing of sorts, inviting public testimonials and streaming the proceeding on Facebook. State Sen. Vernon Sykes and House Democratic Leader Allison Russo are both members of the bipartisan Ohio Redistricting Commission, a seven-member panel controlled by Republicans. The commission has not yet reconvened despite facing a May 6 deadline set by the Ohio Supreme Court for fixing its fourth set of invalidated Statehouse maps – though it has set a meeting for May 4, the day after the primary election. Sykes and Russo said their decision to schedule the forum followed their repeated attempts to get the other commissioners to the table, or to convene the panel themselves. Neither strategy worked, they said. The GOP’s casual approach to the deadline follows a key decision last week by a three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which indicated in a separate federal lawsuit that it plans to impose the commission’s third set of legislative maps May 28 if no alternative is passed by then. The state Supreme Court has ruled the third set of maps – like the first, second and fourth – an unconstitutional gerrymander unduly favoring Republicans. “Too bad so sad,” influential Republican state Rep. Bill Seitz, of Cincinnati, said in a Twitter spat with former Ohio Democratic Chair David Pepper over the ruling. “We win again.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state House gave final approval Thursday to a Texas-style abortion ban that prohibits the procedure after about six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. The bill approved by the GOP-led House on a 68-12 vote without discussion or debate now heads to Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who is expected to sign it within days. House members also voted Thursday to adopt new language prohibiting transgender students from using school restrooms that match their current gender identity and requiring parental notification to parents ahead of any classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity. “They’re all concerned about their elections coming up and making sure they have something they can put on a postcard to talk about,” said Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Midwest City. The abortion bill, dubbed the Oklahoma Heartbeat Act, prohibits abortions once cardiac activity can be detected in the fetus, which experts say is roughly six weeks into a pregnancy. A similar bill approved in Texas last year led to a dramatic reduction in the number of abortions performed in that state, sending many women seeking the procedure to Oklahoma and other surrounding states. Although Stitt already signed a bill this year to make performing an abortion a felony crime, it’s not set to take effect until later in the summer and might not withstand a legal challenge.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Court of Appeals on Wednesday overturned a $1.1 billion verdict against the state over its forest management practices, the latest development in a decades­long dispute over the best use of vast tracts of forestland that cover much of the state’s rural areas. A Linn County jury found in 2019 that Oregon breached its contract with 13 rural counties and 151 local taxing districts by failing to maximize timber harvests on state forests over the past two decades. The counties have said Oregon must manage more than 700,000 acres of state forestland for maximum timber revenue, while the state Department of Forestry believes it has the discretion to manage the land for wildlife and recreation. Gov. Kate Brown applauded the reversal and said in a statement that Oregon manages its forests sustainably “not only for the benefit and prosperity of this generation but those to come.” “Today’s decision by the Oregon Court of Appeals is a validation of the fact that a balanced, science-based approach to public forest management will produce the greatest long-term outcomes for all Oregonians, including the counties and taxing districts that receive revenue from state forests,” she said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHonesdale: A candidate in next month’s Republican primary for lieutenant governor was ordered this week to stay away from his home after his wife made claims of physical and mental abuse in obtaining a protective order. Teddy Daniels was accused of making threats, saying he would kill the family dog and grabbing his wife by the shirt. The woman also told a judge Daniels stalked her at work, “screaming at me, making me cry,” and continually cursed at her and threatened to throw her out of the home if he loses his campaign. He has hurled verbal abuse toward their son, she said in a handwritten, three-page petition. He also prevents her from seeing her family and told her she couldn’t attend a family funeral, she wrote. Daniels, 47, is one of nine candidates seeking the GOP nomination in the state’s May 17 primary, running with the endorsement of a leading candidate for governor, state Sen. Doug Mastriano. Both are vocal supporters of ex-President Donald Trump. Daniels has said he, like Mastriano, was outside the U.S. Capitol during the insurrectionist riot Jan. 6, 2021. Responding to his wife’s accusations, Daniels vowed to stay in the race and claimed without evidence that he was the target of “political terrorism” meant to damage his campaign. A Wayne County judge granted a temporary protection from abuse order to Daniels’ wife Tuesday. Daniels was removed from his home in a gated community in the Poconos. The judge gave Daniels’ wife temporary custody of their child and ordered Daniels to turn over his guns.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee on Thursday pulled out of a planned gubernatorial debate next week as a new online poll showed his popularity has fallen dramatically since last year. McKee was slated to participate in the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council candidate forum May 5 but said Thursday that he won’t do any debates until the election ballot is set at the end of June. “I’ll engage in these debates and forums once everybody signs their name on the line that they are running, and I am going to have to do that as well,” McKee told reporters at a general news briefing Thursday without elaborating on the decision. McKee skipped the first gubernatorial debate in February hosted by the Rhode Island Democratic Women’s Caucus. McKee’s office told RIPEC he is not doing debates last week after twice confirming he would attend, the business-backed fiscal watchdog group said Thursday. The announcement that McKee will not debate his rivals until the summer coincided with the release of an online poll from Morning Consult that found 42% of Rhode Island voters approve of the job he is doing, and 40% disapprove. It’s a big drop in popularity from last year, when Morning Consult found 59% of voters surveyed from July to October approved of the job McKee was doing, and only 25% disapproved.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: People who want the state to become the 49th to pass a hate crimes law have explained, bargained and begged Republicans in the state Senate just to hold a debate on the bill. On Wednesday, with just days left before the measure dies, they turned to one of the survivors of one of the most heinous racist attacks in modern America seeking to persuade senators to at least take a vote on the bill. They showed a two-minute video of Polly Sheppard to the Senate chamber, where the bill has been stuck for months, with eight Republicans senators objecting and only eight more legislative days to take action. The racist gunman who killed nine of Sheppard’s church friends in 2015 pointed his gun at the woman but said he would spare her life so she could let the world know he was killing Black people because he hated them. One of the dead from the attack was Sheppard’s pastor, state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, whose portrait hangs in a place of honor in the Senate chamber. “Eight members of the South Carolina Senate are giving a safe haven to hate. Every time you look at senator Pinckney’s photograph, you should be reminded that hate killed him,” Sheppard said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nWatertown: In the wake of a high school teacher handing out a letter that refuted the gender identities of transgender students, some local organizations and businesses are working to provide a safe, supportive community for LGBTQ+ kids. Watertown Love held an event Tuesday night during which students, friends and family could converse in a safe environment. The gathering also provided an opportunity for community members to show their support for those affected by Monday’s incident at Watertown High School, which the school district is investigating. Students received a letter from German teacher Calvin Hillesland saying that when they asked him to call their friends by masculine names, he felt it was “wrong” and “a lie.” First Congregational United Church of Christ in Watertown was one of the community entities that offered support. Pastor Dustin Bartlett provided a letter of his own to the students and all LGBTQ+ individuals who might be struggling with their understanding of God and how religion fits with their sexuality and gender. “I have read the Bible. I have read much of it, including the so-called ‘clobber passages’ that have been used to attack LGBTQ+ people, in the original Hebrew and Greek languages,” he wrote. “I am something of an expert on this question, certainly more so than that of a high school German teacher. And I want to set the record straight. ... You are loved and worthy of love, just as you are. God loves you, just as you are.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Republicans advanced legislation Wednesday that would place more scrutiny over what books are placed in public schools’ libraries, moments after the bill’s sponsor in the state House said any inappropriate book should be burned. The measure is just one of several proposals introduced in Tennessee this year designed to impose more scrutiny and transparency in school libraries amid a national spike in book challenges and bans. School librarians have become the target of scorn from GOP lawmakers pushing for more oversight on materials provided to children, particularly those that touch on racism and LGBTQ issues. Rep. Jerry Sexton, R-Bean Station, introduced a last-minute amendment this week to a school bill that would give the state’s textbook commission – made up of politically appointed members – veto power over what books end up on school library shelves. Schools would have to provide the commission a list of their library materials. Rep. John Ray Clemmons, D-Nashville, asked Sexton what he would do with books deemed to be inappropriate. “You going to put them in the street? Light them on fire? Where are they going?” Clemmons asked. “I don’t have a clue, but I would burn them,” Sexton said on the House floor. Later, he amended what he had said on the floor to note that he wasn’t a member of the textbook commission and didn’t think any book-burning was likely to occur.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: University of Texas officials are warning students to stay away from raccoons on campus after three students were bitten and received rabies vaccinations as a precaution. The UT Office of Campus Safety tweeted Wednesday that the university has seen “an increase of incidents involving raccoons and the UT student population where raccoons may be made bolder due to being fed by humans.” The raccoon in question is believed to be located around the outside of the McCombs School of Business and the Perry-Castañeda Library, and it might feel threatened by close contact, especially if it has offspring nearby, according to the UT Office of Campus Safety. The school said people should be aware of their surroundings in the area and seek medical attention immediately if they are scratched or bitten by a raccoon or any other wildlife. The university also is urging people to not approach raccoons with the intent to feed, pet or take pictures with the animals.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The Canyon Overlook Trail, one of the oldest hikes in Zion National Park, is getting a facelift this summer, the park announced. With upgrades like improved trail tread, rehabilitated masonry, and handrails, the more than 5 million annual visitors to the nation’s second-most-popular national park will have an upgraded sight to see. “The (National Park Service) planned this work to protect the trail’s historic, rustic appearance and enhance safety for hikers,” officials said in a press release. The trail will be closed Monday to Thursday each week while work is underway until early June, and though it will be open most Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, there might be intermittent closures on weekends. The Pine Creek canyoneering route and lower Pine Creek Drainage, with sections below the Canyon Overlook Trail, may be closed for short periods to “ensure safety,” the release said. “Canyoneers traveling this route need to be mindful of their surroundings, watch for signs showing closed areas, and be aware that work may be happening above them,” it said. The Canyon Overlook Trail is outside the east end of the Mount Carmel Tunnel and was originally built in the 1930s, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A foundation is working with the state community college system to provide a free, two-year college degree over the next five years. The J. Warren & Lois McClure Foundation announced the “Free Degree Promise through the Early College Program at CCV” on Tuesday for Vermont students in the high school classes of 2022-2026. In addition to providing tuition and fees after any federal and state financial aid, the foundation will provide career and education counseling and stipends to help pay for books, transportation and other college costs. The McClure foundation’s plan builds upon the Community College of Vermont’s Early College program that allows high school seniors to complete their last year of high school and first year of college at the same time. “Young people deserve a degree they can count on and afford,” McClure Foundation President Barbara Benedict said in a statement. “By guaranteeing this pathway through Early College to a free degree at CCV, we are telling Vermont’s young people we believe in them and we believe in their futures.” Vermont officials have been working for years to help alleviate what has become an acute labor shortage caused by declines in the number of working-age adults and the lack of trained workers.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrats in the House of Delegates voted Wednesday to remove their caucus leader, months after an unsuccessful election cycle that saw the party lose full control of the state government. The 48-member caucus voted by secret ballot to remove Minority Leader Eileen Filler-Corn, who previously served as Virginia’s first female House speaker, according to lawmakers and staffers who spoke with reporters shortly after the vote. The membership voted against removing caucus chair Charniele Herring, lawmakers said. No immediate vote was held on who would fill Filler-Corn’s role. The vote on whether to remove the two women came after a campaign led in part by Del. Don Scott, an attorney and two-term House member from Portsmouth. Scott resigned a caucus leadership post, vice-chair for outreach, on Sunday and called for the election to remove Herring and Filler-Corn. He nominated himself to take over Filler-Corn’s role and nominated two young, progressive members to serve along with him. Filler-Corn, who served as the first female and first Jewish speaker of the House of Delegates for two years after Democrats flipped the chamber in 2019, conceded her role immediately. She called leading the caucus “the honor of my life.”\n\nWashington\n\nIssaquah: An invasive species is consuming and competing with native species in western Washington, including salmon. Scientists have spotted African clawed frogs in Issaquah, Lacey and Bothell, KING5 reports. The frogs were initially brought into the United States to be used in pregnancy tests and later became pets, said state wildlife scientist Max Lambert. Although Washington made it illegal to own them, some still do. Others who decided not to keep the frogs ultimately released them into ponds and streams. As officials began looking into the issue, they discovered hundreds of frogs. “These are considered one of the worst invasive species on earth,” Lambert said. “They’ll eat a lot of native insects, which are good forage food for our fishes and our amphibians, they will eat tadpoles of our native salamanders, and they’ll eat fish. We looked at some of their stomach contents – and they’re full of baby fish.” People working to restore salmon populations fear the frogs will infringe on that progress. Since Trout Unlimited began trapping in January, the organization has caught about 300 frogs, Rebecca Lavier said. About half of those have been found in the past few weeks. They believe it’s just a fraction of the population.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: An investigation of conditions at a jail has found no evidence of inhumane treatment of inmates, Gov. Jim Justice said Thursday. The Republican governor ordered the investigation last month after a TV station reported allegations of water deprivation, failure to provide toilet paper, and inmates having to sleep on hard floors without a mattress at the Southern Regional Jail in Beaver. “Our investigators talked with a bunch of people and pulled a bunch of records and, at the end of the day, they determined that the allegations were simply not true,” Justice said in a statement. The investigation by the state Department of Homeland Security determined inmates have continuous access to water at sinks in their cells and an industrial water fountain in each section of the jail. Every inmate is provided tumblers for water consumption, and the jail maintains a minimum three-day supply of bottled water for emergencies. In addition, inmates receive three drinks each day for breakfast, lunch and dinner, including those in segregation and quarantine units. There was no history of medical cases of dehydration, and no inmates have filed grievances for being deprived of water, according to jail records. In addition, ample toilet paper is provided to inmates, while the jail buys new mattresses for inmates regularly, according to the investigation.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Most of the respondents to the Wisconsin Conservation Congress’ spring survey say they support limiting the state’s wolf population to 350 animals. The congress, an influential group of sportspeople who advise the state Department of Natural Resources on policy, holds a survey each spring gauging respondents’ support for a wide range of outdoor and environmental proposals. This year’s survey was conducted online earlier this month. One question asked if the respondent supports limiting the wolf population to 350 animals. Of the Wisconsin residents who responded, 12,978 said they supported that number, 6,410 said they did not, and 2,277 had no opinion. Overall, 13,136 respondents said they supported the limit, 6,633 said they did not, and 2,326 had no opinion. The results are advisory only. The question comes as the DNR is revising its wolf management plan. A draft is expected to be released by June. The DNR’s current wolf management plan dates back to 1999 and lays out a goal of 350 animals. Wolf hunt supporters have held up the number as justification for higher quotas. The DNR’s latest population estimates, compiled over the winter of 2020-21, put the number of wolves roaming the state at 1,126.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The virtual emergency room visits that a hospital began allowing early in the COVID-19 pandemic have been suspended, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Cheyenne Regional Medical Center’s telehealth visits began as a way to screen patients from home so that some could avoid visiting the hospital and risking the spread of the coronavirus, but as the virus’s spread “has cooled down,” CRMC is pausing the program and considering changes, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/03/18/coronavirus-timeline-first-case-michigan-first-death/5069676002/", "title": "Coronavirus timeline: From the first case to Michigan's first death", "text": "In just a few weeks, the all-too-familiar coronavirus outbreak, which is causing the deadly COVID-19 illness and wrecking the world's economy, is quickly spreading across America — and now Michigan.\n\nHere's a timeline of how the pandemic has unfolded:\n\nMonday: Harris English tests positive for COVID-19 ahead of Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit.\n\nSunday: Michigan health officials urge caution as the state opens and coronavirus cases rise.

Andrew Cuomo ordered the shutdown of all nonessential businesses across the state effective at 8 p.m. Sunday night. Grocery stores, pharmacies and other essential operations were allowed to remain open. All nonessential government and private-sector employees are required to work from home. New York City is the hotbed of the pandemic in the United States. Brooklyn photographer and videographer Carey Wagner describes life under the restrictions.\n\nI wasn’t one of the people worried about running out of toilet paper. I manage my photography and video business from home when I’m not out working for various clients, so I know how much I truly use. But the fear of being infected with the coronavirus is real, and not being able to find a thermometer in my medical kit or in the entire city of New York has made me feel unprepared.\n\nMy career depends on physically being in spaces around people and traveling on subways and airplanes to do so. Within weeks, all of my scheduled work was canceled, and largely without pay. Photographing speakers at a conference in midtown Manhattan — canceled. The trip to Southern California to instruct photography at a resort with colleagues I really looked forward to seeing — canceled. That sports game at a big stadium in New Jersey — canceled. And that trip to Italy to cover a cycling race — definitely canceled. In fact, my computer calendar just now sent me a reminder for a photo shoot in a theater at 4 p.m. Canceled.\n\nMore:Map of coronavirus cases in USA, Texas and beyond\n\nMore:Coronavirus in Fort Bliss: Two more soldiers test positive for COVID-19 at Army post\n\nMore:No coronavirus screenings taking place at El Paso International Airport, city says\n\nMore:Travel limits may block El Pasoans shopping in Juárez for items missing from US shelves\n\nEconomic stress in running a business is something I am used to after eight years of freelance. I’ve handled injuries and sickness in silence, taking care of myself while trying to work through it and deliver on time. But now our health and business has become public. We can all potentially become sick at any time and we can infect and possibly kill others with the decisions we make. Financial assistance is essential to those who rely on each paycheck. However, the right decision to make is not so clear. And there are seemingly more decisions to make. One of them being, do I leave the house?\n\nThere is such a thing in psychology called decision fatigue. After consistently analyzing our options and making educated choices over and over again we sometimes lose the ability to make a good decision. This can happen to me in a normal workday. In the case of the coronavirus pandemic, the information we need to make a decision changes daily, if not hourly.\n\nA week ago on Saturday night, New Yorkers were out, crowding bars. On Sunday they were shamed for doing so. Last Monday, March 16, we had our final meals inside of a restaurant and by Tuesday we were limited to takeout and delivery only. During that time, I decided to stay in on Saturday night yet take the train to Harriman State Park on Sunday with two friends to go hiking. We ate in one restaurant in a small town with the three of us, and did not touch anyone or hug hello or goodbye.\n\nPersonal decisions have consequences\n\nBut the trains were crowded, and I had brought myself from a city that is a hotbed for COVID-19 to a small town over an hour away. I didn't stay home. My decision was made based off my personal health because I’m a hiker and needed one last hike before all of this gets worse. Unfortunately, everyone else was thinking the same thing, to do \"one last\" of whatever activity they love \"before it gets worse\" and it caused crowding.\n\nBut there is no way to know exactly if the individual decision I made actually spread the virus. And that is terrifying and mentally exhausting as every decision replays in my mind while I monitor for days if there will be an effect.\n\nThe very next day after the hike I was asked to cover the coronavirus pandemic for a news outlet: another decision to make. I said yes and did not have to consult with anyone in my household to do so. I really wanted to work and needed the pay, but it also meant putting myself at risk. For two days in a row I was going to leave the house.\n\nI didn’t know it would be for 10 hours, require riding three subway trains, entering into four restaurants, one gym and New York City Hall. I walked 6.5 miles and talked to dozens of people. I had three pairs of black surgical gloves, two tiny bottles of Peach Bellini and At The Beach hand sanitizer from Bath & Body Works that I shockingly found one early morning when all the box stores had sold out. At the end of the day, the news outlet offered me two masks and to replenish my hand sanitizer stash.\n\nNormally, I don’t think back on every interaction I have because I welcome as many as possible when I’m out. But now, it replays in my mind how I walked out of a restaurant and someone spit on the ground in front of me. How easy would it be for a droplet to enter my body?\n\nOne week later, I have not been on public transportation once. Ridership on subways collapsed 74% and most New Yorkers are out walking. I ingest the news constantly by internet, television and texts to my phone from our local government. Even my transportation apps give me notices like, \"Covid-19: Mandates using public transportation for essential trips only.\"\n\nNonessential businesses closed\n\nAt 8 p.m. March 22, all nonessential businesses in New York City closed. We are told by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio that nonvulnerable individuals still can go outside if we are 6 feet or more from other individuals and only go out for essential trips and services. All nonessential gatherings of any size for any reason are banned. Essential businesses are open. In New York, this includes liquor stores.\n\nIt’s hard to decide exactly how to live.\n\nBig decisions, like leaving the house, lead to a million tiny decisions. A couple days ago, I decided to leave the house to buy medication and supplies for a friend who felt sick and leave it at the front door. This would serve as my daily walk for exercise as well as help a homebound friend.\n\nWe were told not to wear masks if we do not feel sick, so I left the house with my surgical gloves, hand sanitizer, small alcohol prep pads and tissues I could throw away. After I opened the doors to leave my apartment building, I used the hand sanitizer. I walked to the local pharmacy because they seemed to have flu medicine all of the big pharmacies and box stores lacked.\n\nI put on my gloves and entered a small store.\n\nThere was no way to keep 6 feet away from other patrons. My first instinct was to turn away and hold my breath as I passed. I picked up something to read the label, then realized I shouldn’t be putting things back after I touch it, so I bought it. When it came time to check out, the cashier seemed very relaxed. He said this doesn’t compare to time he spent helping in an addiction facility.\n\nThe correlation seemed off, but no one seems to know what to compare this to, so I nodded like I understood. As I put the items in my bag, I tried to remember the hours and days coronavirus lasts on surfaces. I tried not to touch my phone to Google it.\n\nOnce outside, I could breathe again. Until I had to pass people on a narrow sidewalk. How is this supposed to work in a city full of everyone doing the same thing?\n\nFrom inside my home, I hear a lot more sirens than usual. People are getting sick and people are dying. Our hospitals are overwhelmed and celebrity TV doctors are donating N95 masks to the effort. My friends and family are constantly on my mind. People I haven’t heard from in months are calling to check in on me. Everyone asks if I am being \"safe.\" We don’t really know what that means or how to know with 100% certainty. And the pressure to be producing and working is greater than ever.\n\nBeing alone indoors with no sunlight or exercise and liquor stores ready to deliver is probably not safe for mental and physical health. But daily walks have proven to be filled with passersby on narrow sidewalks and in city parks crowded with people and dogs.\n\nEven with the best intentions, we are not organized enough as a community to know how to spread out our time outdoors and in grocery stores and pharmacies. People have said they will turn back if they encounter too many people, but by then is it too late? Disregard for the severity of the virus also is common as seen during spring break in Florida and New York City before we shut down the inside of bars and clubs.\n\nBut even with common sense, it’s hard to know what to do. But it seems one of the best mental approaches is to believe that we are all in this together.\n\nAs we try to flatten the curve, we must also endure a steep learning curve on how to be physically distant while remaining mentally healthy. I’ve signed up for lists to be on call for older neighbors who might need supplies. I join online concerts and dance parties with friends around the world. I bought a 10 pound weight to add to my indoor exercise supplies. I video chat with family and friends and share how I’m feeling. I do my best to accept help where I need it. And I have committed to spending more time on my roof, despite that also being a no-go zone.\n\nIf there are more changes and restrictions, I will adjust. Most importantly, I will think about others as much as I do myself and hopefully make good decisions based on what is good for all of us.\n\nCarey Wagner can be reached at carey@careywagner.com; 415-297-6594; @careywagner on Instagram; @photocarey on Twitter; careywagner.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/03/12/manitowoc-coronavirus-updates-vic-ferrari-concert-capitol-postponed/5034447002/", "title": "Coronavirus in Manitowoc: Total cases exceed 300 as 12 more ...", "text": "Manitowoc Herald Times Reporter\n\nEditor's note: This story will be updated frequently with the latest information related to the coronavirus in Manitowoc and the surrounding area.\n\nMonday, Aug. 3\n\nManitowoc County surpasses 300 total cases of COVID-19 after 12 more reported over weekend\n\nManitowoc County surpassed 300 total cases of coronavirus over the weekend after six new positive cases were reported on both Saturday and Sunday, bringing the total number of cases in the county to 306 as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nManitowoc County Health Department reported the combined 12 new cases Saturday and Sunday while also reporting 177 combined negative test results on those days.\n\nThe county now has 198 active cases of coronavirus and the health department said there have been 107 recovered cases since the pandemic began.

People who violate the order could be fined up to $200.\n\nA safer-at-home order issued by Evers in March ended April 24, but the order was extended through May 26 before being struck down by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in a 4-3 ruling on May 13.

Graduation in the historic Lincoln High bowl is a unique experience among high schools and we will do what we can to ensure it happens live, if at all possible. We are planning a virtual Senior Scholarship Night to recognize the outstanding accomplishments of our seniors. We do not have answers yet for you for all of these milestones but discussions are underway.

Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he would be extending Vermont's state of emergency through August 15. The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15.

Individuals from counties in these states that have less than 400 cases per million people can travel to Vermont without the 14 day quarantine mandate required of other travelers.\n\nThese states are:\n\nOhio\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDelaware\n\nMaryland\n\nWest Virginia\n\nVirginia\n\nThe District of Columbia\n\nThis accounts for about 19 million people across 216 counties, a population which Scott hopes will support the struggling hospitality industry in the state. Travelers must travel by personal vehicle, and cannot fly or take a bus or train.\n\nVermont has already allowed travel without quarantine from low-risk counties in New York, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.\n\n__________\n\nThursday, June 25, 2020\n\nSeven new cases of COVID-19 reported in Vermont on Thursday brought the total number of positive cases to 1,191, according to Health Department data.\n\nThree people are hospitalized with COVID-19, while 12 people are hospitalized and under investigation for the virus. The state said that 938 people across the state have recovered.\n\nThe number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 remained at 56. A total of 60,709 people have been tested for the virus.\n\n__________\n\nThe Chittenden Solid Waste District's drop-off center in South Burlington will be reopening on Saturday, June 27 after being temporarily closed during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCustomers will be required to wear facial coverings and vehicles will be metered into the facility, according to the organization's website. The facility will be open on Monday, Friday and Saturday between 8 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.\n\nThe facility is currently not accepting large bulky items such as mattresses, furniture, or construction material. Items that will be accepted and their fees can be found on the Chittenden Solid Waste District's website at cswd.net/facility-locations/south-burlington-drop-center.\n\n__________\n\nWednesday, June 24, 2020\n\nDuring the Governor's meeting Wednesday, Health Commissioner Mark Levine gave updates on outbreaks and clusters of COVID-19 across the state.\n\nWinooski outbreak: The total cases are 114 so far with its peak in early June. According to Levine we are \"clearly on a downward and stable slope.\" He said it takes time for numbers to peter out because of the 7 to 14 day incubation perid.\n\nRutland County cluster: A Rutland County employer in the Fair Haven area has 12 cases within its population. Testing is being performed on employees and community wide testing is expected to be announced soon. Levine would not identify the business but said it was not of the type where consumers would be coming in and out.\n\nWindham County family cluster: one family in Windham County has multiple cases. Testing is being performed today in Brattleboro. Levine said the number of cases there is less than 10 but would not give an exact number as to not inadvertently identify the family.\n\nLevine said a cluster is when cases are confined to one main source such as a family, household or business and not distributed across the population. The term outbreak is used when transmission is beyond one particular source, he said.\n\n__________\n\nThere were 20 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the state cumulative total to 1,184. Hospitalizations increased to four (from two) and those hospitalized under investigation decreased from 17 to 9 over the last 24 hours.\n\nDeaths remained at 56. Total people being monitored increased by 20 to 1,230.\n\nThose recovered total 930, while 1,296 completed being monitored and 59,860 tests have been performed so far.\n\n__________\n\nThe University of Vermont Medical Center is scaling back some limitations on visitors to the hospital. Every Vermont hospital began restricting visitation in March to slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\nEffective today, UVM Medical Center is allowing one \"consistent\" family member or support person in inpatient and procedural areas. Outpatient restrictions remain in place, where family and friends are not allowed to accompany patients into their doctors' offices unless patients requires support and assistance to meet with their doctors.\n\nFor pediatric patients, one parent or support person is recommended, but both parents may be permitted to visit when \"necessary and appropriate,\" based on unique care needs and circumstances determined by the care team.\n\nPatients arriving in the emergency department or urgent care may also be accompanied by one consistent family member or support person.\n\n__________\n\nNational Life Group in Montpelier announced it cut 53 jobs in Vermont as a result of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The insurance company also cut 30 jobs in Texas and 12 in \"other remote locations,\" according to a news release.\n\nMehran Assadi, chairman, president and CEO of National Life, said in a statement the company does not anticipate any further job cuts.\n\nNational Life employees have been working remotely since mid-March, with the exception of a few dozen essential workers who continue to report to the office in Montpelier, the news release said. The company is currently planning a phased return to the office, which will not occur before July 20.\n\n__________\n\nTuesday, June 23, 2020\n\nOne new case of COVID-19 brought the state cumulative total to 1,164. Hospitalizations increased to two (from none) and those hospitalized under investigation increased from 8 to 17 over the last 24 hours.\n\nDeaths remained at 56. Total people being monitored are 1,210.\n\nThose recovered total 927, while 1,270 completed being monitored and 59,328 tests have been performed so far.\n\n__________\n\nSmugglers' Notch Resort reopens for travelers and locals June 26. Activities such as pools, water parks, guided hiking, disc golf and 20 miles of mountain biking trails are expected to be open. Food and beverage service will be available on-site. Social distancing and enhanced cleaning protocols will be employed.\n\n__________\n\nEmployees of restaurant and retail shops in downtown Burlington can park for free.\n\nTemporary free parking will be available at the Lakeview/College Street garage. Those who haven't done so previously need to sign up for FlexVal and fill out a sign up form.\n\nEmployees will receive a printed reusable validation parking pass to use until the end of July. The period could be extended.\n\n__________\n\nSome Vermonters who apply for unemployment insurance will see an increase to their weekly benefits.\n\nThe announcement came from Gov. Phil Scott and the Vermont Department of Labor Tuesday, as part of a series of changes to the state's Unemployment Insurance (UI) program.\n\nBeginning the first week of July, maximum weekly UI claims will increase from $513 to $531.\n\nIn addition to the benefits increase, Vermont employers will see a lowering of their UI tax rates as of July 1.\n\n“This tax relief will help reduce the burden on employers who’ve had to make difficult decisions to protect the health and safety of their workers and help limit the spread of COVID-19 in Vermont,” said Governor Scott in a news release.\n\n“We know Vermonters made a tremendous economic sacrifice in order to respond to this virus, and we will continue to pull every lever we can to help workers and employers recover from this pandemic.”\n\n__________\n\nChittenden Solid Waste District's South Burlington Drop-Off Center will resume its operations starting June 27.\n\nThe facility will reopen at limited capacity, with new hours (Mondays, Fridays and Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.) and temporary flat fees while precautions are ongoing for the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAll customers and visitors will be required to wear facial coverings when entering the Drop-Off Center. Trailers, wood waste, mattresses, and major electronic appliances (air conditioners, dehumidifiers, refrigerators) are not currently allowed.\n\n__________\n\nMonday, June 22, 2020\n\nFour new cases of COVID-19 were reported Monday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the cumulative total to 1,163.\n\nNo additional deaths were reported — the total remains at 56.\n\nNo people were reported hospitalized for the disease, although eight are under observation in a hospital.\n\nThe number of people being monitored for symptoms stands at 1,142 and the number who have completed monitoring is 1,241. These numbers include close contacts of confirmed cases and people traveling to Vermont from out-of-state who have enrolled in the state's Sara Alert program.\n\n_____________\n\nDarn Tough Vermont announced on Monday that it had to lay off nearly 50 employees.\n\n\"A few months ago we couldn’t grow fast enough,\" the company wrote on its social media account. \"There are larger problems in the world, and we get that.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday. It is unclear whether the inmate was in contact with others in the general population. Health Department officials are conducting contact tracing.\n\nCorrections officials have been testing inmates for COVID-19 upon intake to facilities throughout the state, Smith said. All inmates and staff in the South Burlington prison will be tested.\n\nAnother inmate last week tested positive after being brought into the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland. Smith said that testing over the weekend turned up no other positive cases at the facility. A second mass-test of the Rutland facility will be conducted next week.\n\nIn late May and early June, the Department of Corrections had tested all staff and inmates in its facilities and reported no new positive cases. An outbreak in March at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only recorded spread of the virus in a Vermont prison.\n\n___________\n\nThe number of cases associated with an outbreak of COVID-19 in Winooski and Burlington has risen to 110, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Monday.\n\nLevine said he believes health officials have been successful in identifying those who could have been affected to try to suppress the outbreak, but the outbreak will not be over until there is no new activity that can be connected back to those involved.\n\n“It’s so common to use the forest fire analogies these days, so I would use the term ‘smoldering,’” Levine said. He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159. No additional deaths were reported, which keeps the state's total at 56.\n\nThere are no people hospitalized with the disease but 11 are currently under investigation. An additional 817 people have been tested statewide, bringing the total to 57,845.\n\nThe number of people being monitored for symptoms stands at 1,018 and the number who have completed monitoring is 1,209.

The state's total fatalities related to the coronavirus now stand at 56.\n\nSix new cases of the disease were reported in the department's mid-morning update, for a cumulative total of 1,135. Three of the cases are in Chittenden County. Addison, Bennington and Rutland counties each had one new case.\n\nStatewide, about 917 people have recovered from the virus and 54,745 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are hospitalized for the disease, the department said; nine people are hospitalized and under investigation as possible cases.\n\n________\n\nU.S. and state flags will be lowered to half-staff on Friday at all state facilities as part of a monthly observance of Vermonters who have died due to COVID-19, Governor Phil Scott announced.\n\nVermont's first fatality from the new coronavirus took place March 19, 2020. A month later, after 35 deaths, Scott ordered flags to be lowered on the eighteenth of every month until the end of the year.\n\nFifty-six people in Vermont have died from the disease; the most recent death was reported on June 18.\n\n____________\n\n============\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\nNo new cases have been reported in Vermont, which currently has 1,129 cases, according to the Vermont Department of Health's dashboard Wednesday.\n\nSo far, about 915 people have recovered from the virus and 53,663 people have been tested.\n\nOne person is in the hospital for COVID-19 and four are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n_________\n\nThe Farmers To Families nutrition assistance program has been extended through August, Vermont's congressional delegation announced Wednesday.\n\nA pair of Vermont-based organizations, Willing Hands and the Abbey Group, secured contracts to continue the food box-delivery program for two more months, according to news release from Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund is also supported by federal CARES Act funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19. Eligible “short-term borrowing costs” do not include principal payments, fees, or any interest on borrowings not directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMunicipalities can learn more, and apply, by visiting https://www.vermonttreasurer.gov/content/local-government.\n\n_________\n\nThree additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont, bringing the pandemic total to 1,130, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 914 people have recovered from the virus, the data showed, and 52,890 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 10 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\nMonday, June 15, 2020\n\nGov. Phil Scott extended a state of emergency through July 15. That action does not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but provides a mechanism by which guidelines can be updated (relaxed or tightened, as needed) in an orderly, methodical way.\n\n_________\n\nOutdoor camping facilities may operate at 100% capacity, beginning today, the governor announced. Campground use had been capped at 50% capacity.\n\nQuarantine guidelines from out-of-state campers will remain in place.\n\n_________\n\nOne additional positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Vermont on Sunday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,128, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 912 people have recovered from the virus, the data shows, and 52,557 people have been tested, the data showed.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n________\n\nDespite uptick in cases due to a cluster in Winooski in early June, Vermont seems to be back on a reliable path toward containing and tracking the coronavirus (# of cases dipped to just three over the weekend), according to Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\nStatewide, effective ways of managing outbreaks can take place even as restrictions are relaxed, he said.\n\nSerology tests (that test blood for the presence of, or exposure to, coronavirus) would be of limited utility in Vermont, where the population that has been exposed remains very low by national standards (Levine's best guess is 5%).\n\nLess invasive and more comfortable tests (front-of-nose; saliva) are in development, and will, until a vaccine is developed, make it easier for people to seek out testing, Levine added.. Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Phil Scott and members of his cabinet announced a proposed $90 million in economic relief on Friday — phase two of a relief package he has proposed to restart the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunds from the first phase are being considered by the Vermont Legislature currently. Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal. The Vermont House of Representatives announced Friday that it had fast-tracked a $93 million coronavirus relief package to Scott's desk for his signature.\n\n\"They're only including about a third of the money we recommended,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday. He added, \"While this pandemic has impacted everyone in the state, this crippled small businesses — the folks who provide the jobs that families rely on and generate the revenue we need for the services we provide in state government.\"\n\nThe second phase money, which will also be reviewed by the Legislature, provides assistance for long-term economic recovery, housing and community recovery, broadband expansion, and modernizing Vermont's regulatory programs.\n\nThe money being put toward relief from the pandemic was granted to the state through the federal CARES Act.\n\n__________\n\nNine additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Friday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,119, Vermont Department of Health data showed.\n\nAt the same time, 907 people have recovered from the virus, while 48,634 people have been tested, the data showed. Two people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n__________\n\nBurlington City Arts will begin its 2020 summer artist market this weekend on Pine Street.\n\nThe arts organization announced a number of health and safety measures that would be in place due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The market will run each Saturday from June 13 through Oct. 17 from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 339 Pine St. in Burlington.\n\nPrecautions being taken include:\n\nRequiring vendors to wear face masks and gloves, and encouraging shoppers to do the same.\n\nDirecting shoppers in one direction, with only one entrance and one exit.\n\nLimiting 10 to 15 shoppers in the market at one time, and relying on extra staff to regulate these numbers.\n\nEstablishing hand sanitizing stations at booths in addition to the market's entrance and exit.\n\nLimiting the number of vendors to 20 each week, with booths spaced at least 6 feet apart.\n\nEncouraging vendors to display merchandise in a way that limits touch.\n\nLimiting two people per booth at a time.\n\nOffering contactless payment.\n\nA full list of vendors participating in the 2020 markets can be found at burlingtoncityarts.org/artistmarket\n\n__________\n\nThursday, June 11, 2020\n\nThe Vermont National Education Association (NEA) expressed its concerns with the Governor and Agency of Education's announcement to reopen Vermont schools by Labor Day.\n\nDon Tinney, Vermont-NEA president, called the announcement “unfortunate” because the hard work required to plan for a safe reopening has not been completed, according to a press release from the Vermont-NEA.\n\nSome of the issues the organization said need to be resolved before setting an opening date are:\n\nEffective and robust testing and contact tracing in areas with in-person schooling.\n\nCollective pre-opening planning.\n\nSufficient time to plan and make facility preparations.\n\nEstablish protocols for social distancing and use of personal protective equipment, cleaning, how to respond if a student or staff member contracts the virus.\n\nAddress learning deficits as a result of remote learning and address student trauma.\n\nPlan for contingency distance learning if schools need to close again.\n\nEstablish regular and effective communication between schools and families.\n\nCreate protocols for how to deal with students and staff at higher risk of contracting the virus or experiencing life-threatening complications as a result.\n\nState should allocate funding to hire nurses, custodians, bus drivers, mental health counselors and to purchase sufficient amounts of personal protective equipment.\n\nGuidance on special education services.\n\nProtection of vulnerable children if schools close again.\n\nResources for families who do not benefit consistently from distance learning.\n\nEstablish which student groups would return first in a gradual return to school.\n\nSolve the internet access issues some families face.\n\nStandardized testing requirements be waived.\n\n__________\n\nNorthern Vermont University will begin its fall semester one week earlier than initially planned to position itself in case there is a resurgence of COVID-19 cases later this year.\n\nThe semester will also end early — residential students will return home for Thanksgiving break and will take final exams remotely, the college announced Thursday.\n\nThe plan will not affect the number of teaching and learning days, the college said in a statement. The accelerated semester includes no breaks, with instruction on Labor Day and throughout October. Students will leave campus on Friday, November 20, and are planned to be welcomed back when the spring semester begins on January 19, 2021.\n\n“We know this is different from our normal semester,” college President Elaine Collins said. “The health of the entire NVU community is our number one priority as we prepare to return to campus for face-to-face instruction.”\n\n__________\n\nVermont reported an additional 16 positive cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, bringing its total to 1,110, Health Department statistics show.\n\nAccording to the data, 905 people have recovered from COVID-19 and 47,209 people have been tested for the virus in Vermont.\n\nThe number of people hospitalized with the virus decreased by one on Thursday for a total of three. Nine people are hospitalized under investigation for COVID-19.\n\nNo additional deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred — that total remains at 55.\n\n__________\n\nNo cases of COVID-19 were found at the Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield following mass testing of inmates and staff, the Vermont Department of Corrections said.\n\nAccording to Corrections officials, 336 inmates and 181 staff at the facility were tested June 8. All tests came back negative for the virus.\n\nThe Springfield-based prison was the sixth and final facility to undergo mass testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only facility to have inmates test positive for the virus since it was first detected among members of the prison population, the Corrections Department said.\n\n__________\n\nWednesday, June 10, 2020\n\nA total of 74 cases of COVID-19 are thought to be associated with the recent outbreak that emerged in Winooski, according to Vermont Department of Health data from Tuesday evening.\n\nAbout 80% of those cases are in Winooski and most of the rest are in Burlington, the Health Department said. Only one in five people associated with the outbreak are reporting symptoms — the number of asymptomatic individuals is thought to be a contributing factor to the spread of the virus in the community.\n\nThere have been no deaths associated with the outbreak, the state reported.\n\n__________\n\nGuidance is underway to prepare Vermont schools across the state to tentatively open by Labor Day, announced Gov. Phil Scott in a press briefing Wednesday.\n\nHealth and safety measures for school districts are being developed by the state's Agency of Education and the Health Department, in collaboration with other Vermont educational organizations and pediatricians, and will be formally announced by next week.\n\n\"it's critical we finalize a plan now so we can reopen in the fall,\" said Scott.\n\nAmong the objectives of the guidance is to decrease the risk of COVID-19 entering school, being transmitted between staff and students, and ensuring students with certain needs are \"addressed in a fair and equitable measure\".\n\nProvisions could include social distancing on busses, daily temperature screenings at bus stops and school entrances, increased testing and tracing capacity, and mandatory dismissals if students or staff display any symptoms.\n\n\"It's likely we'll have to change or amend this guidance in the coming months,\" said Dan French, secretary of the Agency of Education.\n\n\"We're also preparing to improve our ability to provide remote learning as a contingency.\"\n\n__________\n\nRegistration is open for Vermonters seeking meals from distribution sites across the state this month.\n\nPick up sites are scheduled on these days in these areas , with more sites to be added for the remainder of June:\n\nMiddlebury area: June 10\n\nBrattleboro area: June 11\n\nMorristown area: June 12\n\nLyndon area: June 15\n\nGrand Isle County: June 16\n\nRandolph area: June 17\n\nDover area: June 18\n\nChittenden County: June 19\n\nPeople can register online at humanresources.vermont.gov/food-help or over the phone via 2-1-1.

Doug Jones, often called the Senate’s most endangered Democrat, will try to pull off another Deep South win Tuesday as former college football coach Tommy Tuberville tries to recapture the seat once reliably held by Republicans. The race pits the incumbent former U.S. attorney, who has positioned himself as a moderate, against Tuberville, who has made support for President Donald Trump the central pillar of his campaign. Jones, a former U.S. attorney best known for prosecuting Klansmen who bombed a Birmingham church in 1963, three years ago became the first Alabama Democrat elected to the Senate in a quarter-century. In campaign stops, he has emphasized his bipartisan record and urged people not to listen to what he called “damn lies” such as an ad calling the avid hunter and gun collector a supporter of “gun grabbers” because he supports some gun control measures such as expanded background checks. At a Sunday rally in Gardendale, Tuberville ended with the same message he began his campaign with: fealty to Trump, saying that God sent Trump to the Oval Office.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A major overflow site is prepared for a quick start to take patients in the state if the coronavirus pandemic overwhelms bed capacity, but staffing remains a concern, officials said. Heidi Hedberg of the state Department of Health and Social Services said the hospital overflow site at Alaska Airlines Center in Anchorage can be ready for use within 48 hours, Alaska Public Media reports. The arena was converted to an overflow site in April in case hospitals were overloaded with COVID-19 patients, while another facility at the Carlson Center in Fairbanks also was prepared. Neither was used for medical treatment, but throughout the summer the Alaska Airlines Center remained ready for medical use rather than reopening for sports, said Hedberg, the department’s director of public health. The facility is prepared with patient areas, beds and nurse stations, and the state needs two days to implement the staffing, medicine and laundry services necessary to operate the center, she said. Jared Kosin, director of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association, said having enough healthy staff for operation remains an issue.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Democrats have a shot at taking control of one or both chambers of the Legislature for the first time in nearly 30 years in Tuesday’s election. The prospect has drawn millions of dollars in spending on a handful of legislative races that will determine the balance of power, with profound implications for the direction of Arizona’s government. The level of spending is unprecedented in the state, where the typical question during election season is how large of a majority Republicans will enjoy, not whether they’ll lose it altogether. The same demographic changes that have made Arizona competitive in presidential, U.S. Senate and other statewide contests have put the Legislature in play as well – a growing Latino population, rapid growth of left-leaning newcomers and unease among some suburban voters with the GOP under President Donald Trump.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State health officials reported 867 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday and 33 more deaths from the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The Arkansas Department of Health reported 757 confirmed cases and 110 probable cases. That raised the state’s totals to 113,057 probable and confirmed cases and 1,791 deaths since the outbreak struck at the start of March. Another 167 people with probable cases of COVID-19 have died in the state. The true number of cases in Arkansas is likely higher, though, because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. The health department reported a total of 10,420 active cases of the virus and said 100,666 people with confirmed and probable cases have recovered. The number of hospitalizations fell by 12 to 655.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Tuesday’s election will test the boundaries of the state’s left-leaning politics as a new generation of voters is being asked to roll back affirmative action and property tax laws put in place decades ago. California is one of the nation’s most Democratic states – the party holds every statewide office, dominates the Legislature and congressional delegation, and outnumbers registered Republicans by nearly 2 to 1. The state is famous – or notorious – for liberal-minded policies that have established some of the nation’s highest taxes, pumped billions of dollars into the homeless crisis that appears only to worsen and cut greenhouse gases to fight climate change, which critics blame for higher energy costs. The 12 propositions on the state ballot provide many issues to motivate voters and influence California’s direction on worker protections, crime and punishment, voter rights and rent control. But the signature questions involve taxes and affirmative action.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: UCHealth is recruiting 1,500 participants from Northern Colorado to test a potential COVID-19 vaccine. The study, the second vaccine trial to start at UCHealth, will include participants age 18 and older who are at higher risk for exposure due to their work, including health care workers, teachers, first responders and grocery workers. Participants may also have a stable health condition that puts them at risk of contracting COVID-19 or developing serious illness from the disease. “This will give us a large group of people who will receive the vaccine – or a placebo vaccine – to see if it’s truly effective over a few weeks, a few months and up to two years,” said Dr. Gary Luckasen, the principal investigator of the trial and medical director of UCHealth’s clinical research program in Northern Colorado.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: While town clerks across the state have so far received roughly 460,000 more absentee ballots than they did in the 2016 presidential election, hundreds of thousands of residents are still expected to go to the polls Tuesday, despite the pandemic. The Connecticut Town Clerks Association had prepared for as many as 66% of the state’s more than 2.3 million eligible voters casting their ballots by absentee in this year’s presidential election, now that COVID-19 is an allowable excuse this year. But as of Sunday, nearly 26% had done so. “It is less than we thought. I think a lot of voters are opting to go to the polls. Probably much to do with the messages, the mixed messages they’re getting out there about the election,” said Anna Posniak, the association’s president and the Windsor town clerk. “So I think there’s a comfort level for many people to go to the polls, to have the ballot in their hand and to watch it go into the tabulator.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state has released a list of coronavirus testing sites as cases rise and as health officials encourage residents to get tested. The Delaware State News reports that Delawareans can view a full list of testing locations and reserve a spot at de.gov/gettested. Gov. John Carney said testing “is the best tool we have to track spread of this virus and monitor potential outbreaks.” The state is coordinating with community sites in addition to sites at Walgreens and at various hospitals and health care locations. “In partnership with New Castle County and the Delaware National Guard, we were able to test over 110,000 people in October,” said A.J. Schall, Director of the Delaware Emergency Management Agency. “We begin November with over 30 testing sites all around the state to help keep people safe.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new group of people is allowed to vote this Election Day: convicted felons, voting from behind bars. The D.C. Council expanded those voting rights in July, WUSA-TV reports. In the past, inmates housed in the D.C. jail were already allowed to vote if they were charged with misdemeanors. The district also restored voting rights for convicted felons returning to the community, but now they can do it while they are still behind bars. Since that law passed, the D.C. Board of Elections and the D.C. Department of Corrections scrambled to inform inmates of their new rights. More than 440 eligible inmates were registered to vote a week before Election Day and will cast their ballots by mail. Department of Corrections Director Quincy L. Booth told WUSA that many of the inmates didn’t believe it was actually true. “The first few folks that were in our care began to receive their ballots the word spread like wildfire because it was proof,” he said. “They saw their name on the ballot and said they have the opportunity to vote.”\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Even if the presidential election hinges on a Florida recount like 20 years ago, hanging chads and butterfly ballots won’t be around to trip up voters and officials – changes to ballots, equipment and laws have made the Bush-Gore circus a relic never to be revisited, state elections officials believe. Though there are other scenarios that make elections officials nervous, the computer punch-card ballots that fueled 2000’s chaos are buried in history’s landfill. Casting valid ballots and processing them is now easier, even before Election Day, and the Legislature has enacted clearer laws governing recounts. The Associated Press spoke with most of Florida’s 67 county elections supervisors or top aides in recent weeks along with voting rights groups, and they expect the system to run smoothly in the nation’s largest swing state, even with the pandemic. And if the winner’s victory margin is razor-thin, recounts in 2018 for governor and U.S. Senate, while not perfect, showed the system works even when candidates, elected officials and their supporters apply pressure.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Republicans again find themselves playing defense in the state House of Representatives, as Democrats try to leap to a majority in a chamber they haven’t controlled since 2004. Democrats must capture a net of 16 seats to control the 180-seat House, overcoming the GOP’s 105-75 majority. They gained a net of 11 seats in 2018 in Atlanta’s suburbs when Stacey Abrams fell just short of capturing the governor’s mansion for the Democrats, dragging the minority party back from the brink of irrelevancy in the General Assembly. Although Democrats also harbor hopes for gains in the 56-seat state Senate, it’s unlikely the Democrats can gain enough seats to overturn the 35-21 Republican majority in the upper chamber. As many as 30 House districts have competitive races, although fewer than that are likely to change hands. House Republicans say they’re running on a record of achievement and warn that Democrats will push higher taxes and more spending.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Development of a $10.5 million facility on the Big Island to make compost using green waste and food waste has been postponed because of a shortage of the key components. Hawaii County’s contract signed in 2016 with Hawaiian Earth Recycling will wait for a new administration to include the compost facility in the county’s solid waste plans, West Hawaii Today reports. The plan is now on hold after the county and Hawaiian Earth Recycling signed a six-month “act of god” abeyance because of the coronavirus pandemic. They jointly suspended the second phase of the project, which involves building the compost facility, Environmental Management Director Bill Kucharski said. Officials said they lack food waste to make the material cook to the high temperature required for the composting process.\n\nIdaho\n\nFiler: Nearly 100,000 juvenile steelhead at a southern Idaho hatchery have been killed to prevent a virus from spreading, Idaho Fish and Game officials say. Officials told The Times-News that the 96,000 juvenile steelhead in the Magic Valley Fish Hatchery would have been released next spring into the Little Salmon River. There are 1.5 million fish at the hatchery, and losing 96,000 is not expected to have a significant impact, officials said. The fish had been shipped as eggs from Fish and Game’s Clearwater Fish Hatchery in northern Idaho and might have already had the virus then.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Illinois Department of Public Health on Sunday reported 6,890 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 35 additional deaths. The death total in Illinois since the start of the pandemic reached 9,792 with the latest numbers. There are 417,280 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the state. Sunday’s confirmed cases were the result of 78,458 tests conducted Saturday, placing the latest seven-day positivity rate for COVID-19 at 8%. As of late Saturday, 3,294 people in Illinois were reported to be in the hospital with COVID-19. Of those, 692 patients were in intensive care units, and 284 patients with the coronavirus were on ventilators.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Some buildings and businesses downtown have boarded up windows and taken other security steps to prepare for possible unrest surrounding Election Day. An eye care practice on Monument Circle and a nearby bank put up boards over the weekend after both businesses suffered extensive damage during May disturbances after the death of George Floyd, WISH-TV reports. Danielle Cooney, the general manager of Soupremacy restaurant near the circle, said she doesn’t want to board up but fears that if the election gets so heated and emotional, some people could act out. “I have to make the decision that’s best for my stuff and my store, and I do think that will be boarding up at some point,” Cooney said. Police have told Coomey they don’t believe there will be civil unrest on Election Day, but she’s not so sure. “I am prepared for it, and I’ll be prepared all week,” Coomey said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Nearly half the counties in the state – 46 as of Monday morning – are reporting 14-day coronavirus positivity rates at 15% or higher. Eleven counties are above 20%, according to the state’s virus tracking website. Of Iowa’s 99 counties, only 13 are reporting rates below 10%. The two most populous counties, Polk and Linn, are below the 15% benchmark. On Monday, Polk County’s 14-day positivity rate was 11.9%, while Linn County’s was 14.5%. Meanwhile, another 17 people with COVID-19 have died in Iowa, and there have been an additional 1,469 confirmed cases, the state reported Monday. Hospitalizations hit a new high, with the state reporting 718 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, up from 676 on Sunday. There were 156 patients in intensive care units, down from 164 on Sunday. Monday marked the first time the state reported more than 700 hospitalizations.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The area’s top public health official has cited a “lack of leadership” fighting the coronavirus pandemic in his decision to step down. Shawnee County Health Officer Gianfranco Pezzino announced at a commission meeting last week that he won’t renew his contract at the end of this year. The 66-year-old had spent the past 14 years as health officer for the county. “The lack of leadership starting at the national level that percolates down to all levels of society and the divisiveness that has been created by that … there is no surprise the same kind of division and confusion trickles down to all levels of our society,” he said. Pezzino said he was worried he might be “abandoning” his community when it needs his help but knew it was time to move on. Pezzino, who also said his physical and mental health played a role in his decision to leave, will continue his work as a senior fellow for the Kansas Health Institute.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: After a pandemic-altered campaign, Republicans are looking to reassert their dominance in the Bluegrass State, while Democrats are angling to tap into suburban support to make inroads in a state where they have struggled in recent years. After weeks of mail-in balloting and early in-person voting, traditional Election Day voting takes place Tuesday as Kentuckians choose their congressional and state legislative lineups. Headlining the election is the hard-hitting race between Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic challenger Amy McGrath. They filled the airwaves with attack ads in a mega-spending campaign that put the contrasts between the candidates on stark display. A hotly contested congressional race between Republican Rep. Andy Barr and Democratic challenger Josh Hicks, meanwhile, continues the 6th District’s reputation as a battleground.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state has adjusted its reporting of coronavirus cases found in nursing homes by adding details about the number of cases that originated at each facility to account for transfers into nursing homes with specialized care for virus patients. Health officials said the additional statistics paints a more accurate picture of outbreaks in centers housing Louisianans who are most vulnerable to COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Families with loved ones in nursing homes have been alarmed when facilities report high numbers of coronavirus cases each week, The Advocate reports. But in some cases, the numbers could be misleading because some nursing homes have set up COVID-19 isolation wards and took in patients from hospitals or other nursing homes. The previous reporting system could raise worries about lax infection-control practices when instead the facilities simply had been admitting and treating COVID-positive patients from other nursing homes, hospitals or elsewhere, said Dr. Joseph Kanter, the interim assistant secretary of public health at the Louisiana Department of Health.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Dejected voters looking to cry in their beers over Election Day’s results will have to do so at home. Monday was scheduled to be the day Maine bars reopened, but they did not, due to a surge in coronavirus cases. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills postponed the reopening of bars and tasting rooms indefinitely. Maine is coping with a spike in COVID-19 cases that has affected most of the country. The state had more than 100 cases in a single day for the first time Thursday. The continued closure of bars is a hit to the economy of a state that loves beer. Portland has the most craft breweries relative to the size of its population of any American city, according to a 2019 story in Food & Wine magazine. Other new restrictions in the state take effect Wednesday. They include a reduction in indoor capacity from 100 to 50 and stricter rules on interstate travelers.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Going into the summer, city officials knew COVID-19 would affect the tourism industry, but new data suggests the pandemic has cost Ocean City and the state of Maryland hundreds of millions of dollars since March. Crowds in Ocean City were smaller this summer due to changing travel and lodging restrictions, along with the reluctance of some to travel. The historic economic turmoil isn’t likely to improve this fall, and as a result, officials are considering cuts to the city’s 2021 budget. Tax revenue collected in Ocean City is down more than $11 million between March and August of this year compared to 2019, according to Ocean City tourism reports. Maryland lost nearly $100 million in tourism-related sales and use tax in fiscal 2020, according to data from the Maryland Office of Tourism. Fiscal 2020 ended June 30.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNewton: The 32nd annual Boston Jewish Film Festival kicks off this week, and for the first time, film buffs won’t have to trek to a movie theater to watch. All films for the festival that starts Wednesday and runs through Nov. 15 will be screened online, according to organizers, so viewers will be able to watch at a time of their choosing. The festival will showcase world premieres of international films, one-of-a-kind interactive conversations with filmmakers and guests, and a selection of narrative, comedies, documentaries and short films. The programming will cover an array of themes, including social justice and activism, Jewish history, music, LGBTQIA issues, and immigration, with a focus on female filmmakers. Tickets are available at Boston Jewish Film’s website.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Meals at restaurants across the state came with a new side dish Monday: What’s your name and phone number? The latest order kicked in from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s health department. Restaurants must be able to contact customers if there’s a virus case linked to the business. Michigan’s coronavirus cases have risen significantly, setting a new daily high Saturday at 3,792, the health department said. The Michigan Restaurants & Lodging Association insists COVID-19 transmission doesn’t occur much at restaurants. The group predicts job losses and more financial strife because of the requirement. Henry Ford Health System reported 177 COVID-19 patients Monday at five hospitals, up 60% compared to last Monday. Restaurants, bars and other venues must seat no more than six people at a table. The state said indoor settings are much more likely to drive COVID-19 outbreaks than outdoor settings.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Another inmate has died of coronavirus complications at a state prison. A 61-year-old inmate at the Stillwater prison died at the facility Sunday, authorities said. The man had existing medical conditions and tested positive for the coronavirus on Oct. 20, according to prison officials. The inmate was taken to a hospital Saturday, evaluated and released to the prison. He is the third COVID-19 death in a state correctional facility. More than 750 inmates have tested positive for the coronavirus at the Stillwater prison, which houses nearly 1,280 inmates. More than 150 staff at the prison have also tested positive, corrections officials said. Prison officials said they are being proactive in efforts to keep the virus at bay after an outbreak at the prison in September. In early October, more than 90 inmates tested positive, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An expert says having a statewide election on a flag design is unusual, and Mississippi is holding its second such election in less than 20 years. A single design is on the ballot for a yes-or-no vote. It has a magnolia on a dark blue background with red bars on either end. The state flower is encircled by the phrase “In God We Trust” and stars representing Mississippi as the 20th state. The flag also has a single star made of diamond shapes representing the Native American people who lived on the land before others arrived. In June, Mississippi legislators surrendered the last state flag that included the Confederate battle emblem that’s widely condemned as racist. The change came as protests against racial injustice were happening across the U.S., and Mississippi was under pressure from education, business, religious and sports groups – including, notably, the state Baptist convention and the Southeastern Conference. “It’s highly unusual for people to vote on the flag that represents them,” said Ted Kaye, secretary of the North American Vexillological Association.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Hospital leaders are raising alarms about bed capacity as coronavirus cases continue to spike, with some urging Gov. Mike Parson to issue a statewide mask mandate. Meanwhile, an eastern Missouri eighth grader died days after his COVID-19 diagnosis, becoming the state’s first child under age 14 to die since the onset of the pandemic. Washington School District Superintendent Lori VanLeer said in a statement that 13-year-old Peyton Baumgarth died over the weekend, less than two weeks after he last attended classes. The National Center for Health Statistics report for Oct. 28 cited just 80 COVID-19 deaths nationwide among children ages 14 or younger. Missouri, like many Midwestern states, is seeing a big rise in COVID-19 cases, and many of the illnesses are severe enough to require hospitalization. The state health department on Monday cited 1,659 hospitalizations statewide, eclipsing the record set a day earlier.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The state added 694 cases of COVID-19 early Sunday, bringing its total to 33,495 reports of the respiratory illness. Of those, 21,398 have recovered, and 11,721 remain active. The state has reported 375 deaths, one more than Saturday, with 376 people hospitalized, according to the state website covid19.mt.gov. The Cascade City-County Health Board on Wednesday reduced the number of people allowed to gather at events and in bars and restaurants, in an attempt to slow the rapid spread of COVID-19, which health officials say is stressing the health system in Great Falls. The board OK’d restricting maximum assembly at all group gatherings or planned events conducted at businesses, organizations and private residences to 50 people, both inside and outside. Gov. Steve Bullock recently said Montana is entering the cold and flu season, which will place an extra burden on health care workers and hospitals. He urged people to get a flu shot.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Health care providers and elderly and vulnerable residents will be first in line to get a coronavirus vaccination when it becomes available as early as this year, state officials say. Gov. Pete Ricketts and public health officials said they plan to give those groups top priority in their plans to distribute their limited share of the vaccine, once it’s developed and shipped. “We expect that vaccine supply will be limited early on, and initial doses will go to health care personnel and critical populations,” said Angie Ling, incident commander for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. The state’s hospitals saw a record number of coronavirus patients Sunday. Public health officials reported 613 active hospitalizations Sunday, up slightly from the day before. The numbers have surged over the past month, according to the state’s online tracking portal. Overall, 3,050 people in Nebraska have been hospitalized since the pandemic began.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A judge on Monday denied a legal bid by the Trump campaign and state Republicans to stop the count of mail-in ballots in Las Vegas, the state’s most populous and Democratic-leaning county. An immediate appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court is being considered, said Adam Laxalt, co-chairman of the Trump campaign in Nevada. Judge James Wilson Jr. acknowledged that state election law was reshaped last summer due to the coronavirus pandemic and that it allows in-person votes and mailed-in ballots to be physically handled differently. But “nothing the state or Clark County has done values one voter’s vote over another’s,” he said. Wilson heard a full day of arguments last Wednesday in Carson City during which attorney Jesse Binnall, representing the Trump campaign and state party, asked to stop the count until election officials in Las Vegas allowed “meaningful” oversight of ballot processing and let observers challenge ballots. Binnall did not challenge ballot processing in other Nevada counties, which lean Republican.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The University of New Hampshire is extending its winter break for a week but eliminating spring break in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Like many schools, UNH is sending students home for Thanksgiving and then conducting classes and final exams remotely in December. Classes will resume on campus Feb. 1, a week later than originally scheduled, UNH President James Dean said. Given the extra-long break, officials have decided to cancel spring break, but some shorter breaks are planned, he said. Some campus buildings also will be closed in December and January to save money on heating, but arrangements will be made for those who need to work on campus. Dean said 201 staff members and 44 faculty members have accepted early retirement offers made as the university seeks to recover financially from the pandemic.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMontclair: A group of residents is planning a post-election rally they hope will never take place. The new, nonpartisan group, called Protect the Vote Montclair, released a flyer to residents Tuesday, inviting them to gather at Watchung Plaza at 3 p.m. Friday to “demand that all votes are counted.” “The outcome and aftermath of the election will be highly dynamic and fluid, and organizers stress the need to be flexible and prepared for action,” the flyer says. James Cotter, one of the rally organizers, said he hopes that Democrats, Republicans and media outlets will wait to declare victory until there is a clear winner based on certified state results and that the rally won’t be necessary. But he said the group is concerned that “if one side declares victory prematurely, it will throw the election into chaos.” The rally, Cotter said, would gather people to “get on the phones to state officials across the country.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Clashes continued Saturday between Republican election challengers and an absentee-ballot counting board in a southern New Mexico county at the center of a congressional swing district race. State Republican Party Chairman Steve Pearce said another GOP challenger was ejected Saturday from a Dona Ana County vote counting facility as the person tried to get close enough to the ballot tallying machine to take a photograph of numbers on the machine. Four challengers were ejected Friday. Challengers are appointed by political parties in New Mexico to be present as county election boards verify and tally ballots and can dispute the veracity of ballots for a variety of reasons. A letter from Elections Director Mandy Vigil described reports from Dona Ana County officials that a Republican election challenger grabbed an election board member and that vote counting was interrupted.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Vehicles draped with banners supporting President Donald Trump snarled traffic around the metropolitan area two days before Election Day, and anti-Trump protesters clashed with police in Manhattan, leading to 11 arrests. Videos posted online showed hundreds of vehicles at a standstill around noon Sunday in the northbound express lanes of the Garden State Parkway near Lakewood, New Jersey. Police said the caravan caused a 5-mile traffic backup. A large caravan of Trump supporters was also seen on New York’s Mario Cuomo Bridge on Sunday afternoon prior to a rally at the Palisades Center in the Rockland County community of West Nyack. Anti-Trump demonstrators gathered at Madison Square Park in Manhattan to confront anticipated pro-Trump caravans that didn’t end up traveling through the area. Video by the New York Post showed police shoving protesters, who hurled insults at officers. Although there were reports on Twitter of journalists being among those arrested at the protest, police said none had official press credentials issued by the city.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s elections office is predicting that at the end of Election Day it will be able to tally and report at least 97% of all ballots cast. The N.C. State Board of Elections said in a news release Sunday that it will post results as quickly as possible but that its primary objective will be an accurate count. Many states have made it easier to request a mail ballot amid the coronavirus pandemic and concerns about crowded polling places. But mail ballots generally require more time to process than ballots that are cast in person. In North Carolina, mail-in ballots are not due until Nov. 12 if postmarked by Election Day. The state board is set to meet Nov. 24 to certify the final results. North Carolina is a key battleground President Donald Trump needs to win to boost his prospects of defeating Democratic nominee Joe Biden.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state entered November continuing to lead the nation in the number of new COVID-19 infections per 100,000 people, an unenviable distinction North Dakota has held many times in the past couple of months, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. There were 1,718.9 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota over the past two weeks, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. State health officials on Monday reported 975 new coronavirus cases and nine new deaths, bring the statewide death toll to 540. Health officials reported 265 of the deaths occurred in October. Hospitalizations from the disease caused by the coronavirus also reached a new high for the state at 215, with a net increase of 15 since Sunday. Hospitalizations have hit new highs in each of the past six days. There were only 209 available inpatient beds and 19 intensive care unit beds in North Dakota hospitals Monday.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Now-familiar barricades were erected around Hamilton County Courthouse and Justice Center on Monday morning ahead of Election Day – the most visible sign of preparations for possible unrest so far in the city as the country braces for Tuesday’s results. The Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office officials did not mention any specific scenarios or threats. “We’re simply taking precautions to be prepared in case we see any unrest related to the election,” spokesman Mike Robison said Monday. The bicycle rack barricades were first deployed this year after windows at the Justice Center were smashed in late May following protests over the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minnesota. Cincinnati police officials declined to speak about any specifics but said they have been and are monitoring the situation. Gov. Mike DeWine has said the Ohio National Guard could be deployed if necessary.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials reported 1,084 new confirmed cases of coronavirus in the state Monday and nine additional deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. The latest numbers reported from the Oklahoma State Department of Health bring the total number of confirmed cases in Oklahoma to 125,195 and the death count to 1,354. The true number of cases in Oklahoma is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. The agency also reported 907 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected coronavirus infections on Sunday, the most recent data available. In a bit of good news for Oklahoma, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in the state decreased over the past two weeks, going from 1,130.29 new cases per day Oct. 18 to 1,053.57 new cases per day Nov. 1, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: While national elections analysts are cautioning voters that there may not be definitive winners of tight races on election night due to the preponderance of mail ballots, the picture will likely be much clearer in the Beaver State. This is in large part due to Oregon’s experience with vote-by-mail elections and the systems in place at county elections offices that will allow them to announce a significant number of ballots immediately after polls close. There are a variety of systems at the county level to ensure the security and accuracy of elections. The Secretary of State’s Office must clear each one prior to the election. All vote-counting systems are certified by accredited agencies and tested for accuracy before any votes are counted. Voter fraud – both in Oregon and across the country – is nearly nonexistent. According to an analysis by the Legislative Fiscal Office released in mid-October, Oregonians cast about 60.9 million ballots between the years of 2000 and 2019. During that time, there were 38 criminal convictions related to voter fraud – a rate of 0.00006%.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Get a smaller bird this year. That’s the advice of the state health secretary, Dr. Rachel Levine, who is urging residents to avoid gathering with friends and family on holidays such as Thanksgiving to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. “We are asking people to stay within their households and to contact their friends and their families in a more virtual way,” Levine said. “And that’s a tremendous sacrifice that we’re asking people to make, but it is absolutely necessary at this challenging time.” She cited small gatherings as a driver of the recent spike in COVID-19 both in the state and nationally. In Pennsylvania, new daily virus cases rose more than 50% over a recent two-week period to an average of more than 2,000 per day, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The average number of people hospitalized in Pennsylvania with COVID-19 more than doubled last month.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s largest hospital group announced Monday that it is suspending most visits in response to a rising number of coronavirus cases in the state. “We have decided after great deliberation to take this step in these highly unusual circumstances to protect our patients and our workforce,” Dr. Timothy Babineau, Lifespan president and CEO, said in a statement posted on the company’s website. Exceptions may be made in special circumstances, the statement said. Hasbro Children’s Hospital will allow one parent for each patient. Newport Hospital maternity services will allow for a birthing partner only. Emergency department patients will be limited to one accompanying adult, and the length of that person’s stay will be limited. Visitors will be screened for symptoms or potential exposure to COVID-19 and will be required to wear a mask.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s $175 million U.S. Senate race has received much of the attention this election cycle, but every South Carolina incumbent trying to return to Congress has a major party challenger in 2020. The most expensive and heavily watched U.S. House race involves Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham, trying to win a second term after his upset of the century wining the seat anchored by Charleston and Hilton Head Island two years ago. His Republican opponent is state Rep. Nancy Mace. But each of the state’s seven U.S. House districts has a Republican taking on a Democrat. South Carolina voters have taken advantage of no-excuse absentee voting approved by the Legislature because of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the end of the day Friday, more than 1.2 million votes had already been cast, either in person or by mail, according to the state Election Commission. In the last presidential election in 2016, 2.1 million ballots were cast in the state. Two-thirds of the absentee ballots were cast in person. Election officials said about 57,000 absentee ballots have been sent out but not returned.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Nearly 3,000 people with COVID-19 have recovered in the past two days, while an additional 529 people have been infected with the disease, the state Department of Health reported Monday. One additional person died from the disease, bringing the statewide total of people dying with COVID-19 to 438. There were 402 people hospitalized with the disease, 19 fewer than the previous day. Minnehaha County residents accounted for 91 new infections, while Lincoln County had 33 residents test positive for coronavirus. Brown County accounted for 54 new infections, while Condington County had 40. The new results were based off 2,632 total tests, the fewest reported since Oct. 8. The state reported that 338 additional people were deemed to have recovered from the disease. That comes on top of record recoveries reported Sunday of 2,555.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A lawsuit seeking the release of absentee ballot information has been filed against state elections officials. The suit was filed Sunday in Davidson County Chancery Court by the state Democratic Party and the campaign of Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Marquita Bradshaw. It accuses elections officials of refusing to release the ballot information as required by state law. Secretary of State Tre Hargett, a Republican, and elections coordinator Mark Goings are named as defendants. According to the lawsuit, the secretary of state’s office is required by Tennessee open records law to release if requested a list of voters who have not returned absentee ballots by the end of early voting, which was Saturday. The secretary of state’s office did not comply with the request, even instructing all 95 county election offices to withhold any information. Bradshaw faces Republican Bill Hagerty in Tuesday’s election for the seat left open by retiring Republican Lamar Alexander.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Lone Star State has surpassed California in recording the highest number of positive coronavirus tests in the U.S. so far, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. As the pandemic surges across the nation, the data from Sunday – the most recent available – says there have been 937,317 cases in Texas, the nation’s second-largest state. California, the most populous state, has had 936,198 cases, followed by Florida with 807,412. In cases per 100,000 population, Texas ranks 19th. The Johns Hopkins data shows that Texas’ seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate has risen over the past two weeks from 7.12% to 10.72%, while the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases rose from about 4,470 new cases per day to about 6,070. Texas health officials have reported more than 18,000 deaths so far from COVID-19.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Thousands of people attended a Halloween party days after organizers claimed the event was canceled, authorities said. Utah County Sgt. Spencer Cannon said deputies learned about the large party Saturday near Utah Lake about 10 p.m. when a woman was taken to the hospital by ambulance after crowd-surfing, falling and being knocked unconscious. “Crowd tossing would probably be a better way to describe it. And the tossing side hadn’t communicated well with the receiving side, and she ended up landing on her head and received a pretty serious laceration and was unconscious for at least a period of time,” Cannon said. FOX 13 reported the woman is out of the hospital and is doing OK. The party was shut down shortly after because the event organizers did not have a permit to host a large-scale event, Cannon said, adding that no one was arrested but that the organizers could face criminal charges. Cellphone videos of the event posted on social media tagged The Tribe Utah and Utah Tonight and showed thousands of people close together without masks, the Deseret News reports.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state’s health commissioner said he frequently hears people questioning why residents need to be so careful about the coronavirus, but health officials know better. “I am watching hospitalizations start to pick up very slowly but real,” Dr. Mark Levine said Friday during the governor’s twice-weekly virus briefing. “And we know this is an indicator that lags several weeks behind the increase in cases.” While the number of hospitalizations is small, it is something the Health Department is following very closely, he said. As the pandemic wore on, death rates have improved nationwide even if hospitalization rates are worsening, but there’s “no evidence that this is because the virus itself has changed or is less virulent at this time,” Levine said. Vermont has become really good at protecting the most vulnerable, who are living in long-term care facilities, prisons or at home, he said. There has also been significant research in therapies, and health care providers have learned how to handle newly identified complications, such as blood clots, more quickly and effectively, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: All state Department of Motor Vehicles centers are still operating by appointment only because of the coronavirus pandemic. And most are booked three months out. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports many residents are traveling outside their county or city to get an appointment. Gov. Ralph Northam announced in March that the DMV’s 75 locations would close their doors. They started opening again in May and throughout the summer. The agency served about 17,700 people a day before the pandemic. The DMV is now serving about 11,000 people per day on average across 73 centers. Two of the 75 remain closed due to their small spaces. The department does not have an estimate for when it will catch up to the demand. The state has said vehicle registration, driver’s license renewal and title replacements can still be done virtually.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A record number of voters in the state have already returned their ballots in an election in which they’re weighing in on scores of federal and state races. Nearly 65% of the state’s more than 4.8 million registered voters had already cast their ballots by Friday night, and voters have until 8 p.m. Tuesday to drop their ballots off at almost 500 drop boxes around the state. Four years ago, just over 41% of voters had returned their ballots by the weekend before the election. Incumbent Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee, who is seeking to become the first incumbent elected to a third term in the state in more than 40 years, is facing Republican Loren Culp, the police chief of the small city of Republic who has campaigned against Inslee’s coronavirus restrictions. In the race for lieutenant governor, Democratic U.S. Rep. Denny Heck, who is retiring from Congress, faces fellow Democratic Sen. Marko Liias. All 10 of the state’s U.S. House seats are on the ballot.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: Students at the West Virginia University College of Law will help staff an election protection hotline this Election Day. The students will work with the West Virginia American Civil Liberties Union to help citizens overcome any roadblocks as they exercise their right to vote Tuesday, according to a news release. Students from the ACLU College of Law Chapter will be able to help with issues that include voter registration, problems at polling places and voter identification requirements. Law student Ian Shoulders said the combination of the pandemic and a contentious race that could bring out a lot of first-time voters means this won’t be a typical Election Day. “We will be on the phones making sure that people that want to vote are able to do it without any major issues,” he said. The hotline number is 304-355-5012.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state recorded another 3,433 coronavirus cases Monday and three more deaths, continuing a COVID-19 surge that began in early September. The seven-day average for new cases hit 4,463, nearly double what it was a month ago and more than six times as high as what it was before the surge began two months ago, based on figures from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. Wisconsin ranked third in the number of new cases per capita, behind only North Dakota and South Dakota. There have now been 2,050 deaths in Wisconsin attributed to COVID-19, which is the 27th highest in the country overall and the 39th highest per capita at 35 deaths per 100,000 people. Wisconsin’s first death from COVID-19 was reported March 20. It took nearly five months before the state recorded 1,025 deaths Aug. 14. But it’s taken less than three months for deaths to double.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Former U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson was recovering at a Denver-area hospital after suffering a minor stroke last week, his family said. Simpson, 89, was in good spirits with good vital signs at Swedish Medical Center in the Denver suburb of Englewood, said his son, Colin Simpson. The elder Simpson had been discharged from the hospital’s intensive care unit with the potential to return to his Wyoming home as soon as Saturday, Colin Simpson said Thursday. “The care at the hospital and the outreach to our family has been incredible,” said Colin Simpson, an attorney in Cody, Wyoming. Colin Simpson told the Cody Enterprise that his father suffered the stroke last Monday after recently having a blood clot removed from a carotid artery on his left side. He was taken to Cody Regional Hospital, then transferred to Swedish Medical Center on Tuesday. Alan Simpson served as a Republican senator from 1979 to 1997.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/03"}]}

Andrews, author of the 1979 gothic novel, \"Flowers in the Attic,\" since her death in 1986. She wrote eight books for Simon & Schuster's Pocket Books/Gallery. Neiderman has written 73 under her name, including four started or inspired by Andrews.\n\nAn adaptation of her sequel, \"Petals on the Wind,\" starting 10 year after \"Flowers,\" airs Monday on Lifetime with unusually high viewership expectations. The \"Flowers\" adaptation drew 6.1 million viewers for its Jan. 18 premiere — the most for a Lifetime original film since \"Steel Magnolias\" in 2012. By comparison, the March finale of HBO's \"True Detective\" attracted 3.5 million viewers.\n\nLifetime is expecting another huge audience for \"Petals,\" based on social media metrics that Lifetime says are \"ticking up.\"\n\n\"On our Lifetime fan page, we have had over 1.5 million exposures and tens of thousands of likes for the promos we have posted, which mirrors the excitement people felt before 'Flowers',\" said Lisa Hamilton-Daly, Vice President of Original Movies at Lifetime/A&E Networks.\n\nNeiderman also has been doing an unusual amount multi-media promotion for his alter ego. He manages the official V.C. Andrews Facebook fan page with Pocket Books that now has almost 146,000 likes. He helped set up more than 1,000 viewing parties across the country for \"Flowers in the Attic\" and he's doing the same for \"Petals on the Wind.\"\n\n\"To some extent, it is unusual,\" said Jean Anne Rose, a spokeswoman for Pocket Books. \"But, so is it to have such a longstanding relationship with a ghostwriter. Our situation is unique in the sense that Andrew has written so many books with the blessing of the V.C. Andrews estate.\"\n\n\"Flowers in the Attic,\" a story involving incestuous teen siblings locked in an attic for more than three years, rode its \"ewww\" factor up the bestseller lists in just two weeks in 1979. It went on to sell more than 40 million copies in 95 countries and 24 languages. Entertainment Weekly compared it to \"The Hunger Games\" plus \"Twilight\" with a healthy helping of \"Fifty Shades of Grey.\"\n\nAndrews wrote four more books about the characters in that Dollangager family with Neiderman finishing the last one, \"Garden of Shadows.\"\n\nRose says the Andrews franchise has experienced a resurgence since the Lifetime movie. \"Flowers\" was first made into a theatrical film in 1987, starring Louise Fletcher and Victoria Tennant, but it did only $15 million at the U.S. box office. With Pocket Books' blessing, Neiderman went to work pitching Andrews books for more movies.\n\n\"I worked with two producers trying to get 'Flowers in the Attic' on TV,\" he said in his home office, decorated from floor to ceilings with posters of his books. \"I worked with one for nine years.\"\n\nNeiderman, who taught high school English in upstate New York for 23 years, became Andrews' ghostwriter after sharing the same agent as Andrews. He had just moved to Los Angeles to work on getting his own books adapted to films when his agent called and told him to return to New York. Andrews was seriously ill with breast cancer and they needed him to finish some of her projects.\n\nPocket kept Neiderman's identity as the ghostwriter a secret at first, but PPS Book Title Promotion, an authors marketing service, now bills him as \"the most successful ghostwriter in American literary history.\"\n\n\"Andrew has been the sole ghostwriter for the franchise and is the voice of V.C. Andrews,\" said Rose. \"Working with him is as close as you can get to working with the late author herself.\"\n\nAs Andrews' surrogate, Neiderman promotes through social media like a teenager.\n\n\"When you do this article, I will put it out to hundreds of thousands of people, literally,\" he said. \"I'll do it through the Simon & Schuster page, through the V.C. Andrews page, through my page, through LinkedIn (contacts). It's going to be all over the place. That happens all the time.\"\n\nIn the days before \"Flowers in the Attic\" aired, Neiderman did promotional interviews with Entertainment Weekly, L.A. Buzzfeed and appeared on a panel at the Rancho Mirage Writers Festival. Lifetime followed the promotional formula of a feature film, putting up billboards, taking ads in trade publications and getting the cast booked on \"The Today Show.\"\n\nFor the viewing parties, Neiderman wrote special material for the hosts to use for their parties.\n\n\"They were all over the country,\" he said. \"It was amazing. We even had some in the Bible Belt. The irony is, in some of these places the book is still banned. It was banned in book stores and libraries.

Volume Two will reveal a secret begun in 'Flowers in the Attic' and never solved until now.\"\n\nNeiderman's luck with the Andrews franchise might be rubbing off on projects under his own name. He has a new book, \"The Terrorist's Holiday,\" about a plan to bomb a Catskills Mountains resort, due for a fall release, and four projects being developed from \"The Devil's Advocate.\"\n\nNeiderman wrote the book and lyrics for a musical theater version \"The Devil's Advocate\" a decade ago. It now has new music from the composer of \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,\" playing on London's West End, and they hope to debut the show in Germany, which has become a launching pad for new musicals because of national subsidies.\n\nHe's also developing \"The Devil's Advocate\" as a TV series and a play in the Netherlands, and writing a prequel titled \"Judgment Day,\" scheduled for a spring 2015 release.\n\nNeiderman, who was inducted into the Palm Springs Walk of Stars in 1997, credits much of his success to his appetite for promotion.\n\n\"Most authors don't do what I do,\" he said. \"I start my day writing and I break off and go right to my Facebook pages. I go to LinkedIn and I keep the stuff promoting all the time.\"\n\nHe sold \"The Devil's Advocate\" to Warner Bros., he said, on the basis of a one-line pitch:\n\n\"It's about a law firm in New York that represents only guilty people,\" he said, \"and never loses.\"\n\nToday's writers, he said, must do their own publicity.\n\n\"If you don't know how to use social media and you're not involved in it, publishing companies aren't going to do it for you,\" he said. \"With V.C.

She grew up in poverty and became enmeshed in drugs, sex work and crime at a young age. She was \"sex-trafficked, abused, underestimated and neglected − you name it,\" Newman says.\n\nDuring her reign smuggling tons of cocaine from Colombia into the U.S., Blanco was allegedly responsible for the deaths of more than 200 people in Colombia, Florida, New York and California. Her ruthless reign in Colombia lasted nearly five decades.\n\nOn Sept. 3, 2012, Blanco was gunned down by an assassin on a motorcycle as she walked out of a butcher shop in Medellín. She was 69.\n\nDid Griselda really kill her husband Alberto Bravo?\n\nThe series begins with a flustered Griselda running into her house in Colombia, tending to a gunshot wound. She flees to Miami with her three sons − Dixon (Orlando Pineda), Ozzy (Martín Fajardo) and Uber (Jose Velazquez) − to start a new life, and throughout the episode, we see glimpses of what she ran away from.\n\nIn the show, Griselda's husband, Alberto Bravo, asks her to sleep with his brother Fernando to absolve them of a debt owed to Fernando from a failed cocaine shipment. At the end of the premiere episode, Griselda shoots Alberto in a fit of rage.\n\nThere is no evidence Griselda was really forced to have sex with Alberto's brother, but according to Vice, she accused Alberto of stealing millions from the business and killed him during a shootout.\n\nSofía Vergara, Netflix sued:Griselda Blanco's family seeks to stop release of 'Griselda'\n\nHow many sons did Griselda Blanco have?\n\nUnlike in the series, she never had children with Alberto, but she did have three children with her first husband, Carlos Trujillo, who is not mentioned in the show.\n\nHe was a pimp and document forger, and she married him when she was 13. According to Vice, business got in the way of her first marriage, too, and she had Carlos killed.\n\nWhat happened to Griselda's youngest son, Michael Corleone?\n\nIn \"Griselda,\" Blanco is already a mother of three when she begins a relationship with Darío Sepulveda (Alberto Guerra) and has a child with him, her youngest son, Michael Corleone.\n\nAt the end of the series, Darío leaves Griselda and takes their son with him to protect him. But in real life, Griselda didn't take that lightly and had him assassinated.\n\n'Everything was fake':No, Sofía Vergara didn't do cocaine for role as Griselda Blanco\n\nWhat didn't make it into Netflix's 'Griselda'?\n\n\"When you have a limited amount of real estate, you need to pull characters in sometimes through other characters,\" Newman says. The men in Griselda's life were all part of the Medellín drug scene that \"predated our story,\" he adds, so timelines were condensed.\n\nThere's one story in particular about how Darío, a hit man, and Griselda met that Newman \"loved so much\" but didn't make the cut.\n\n\"A friend of hers had brought Griselda and Darío to a restaurant in Medellín,\" he says. \"A couple of tables over, there were some men who recognized Griselda who were harassing her and catcalling her, and Darío very coolly pulled a gun out and shot and killed all three of them. To Griselda, it was the most romantic thing.\"\n\nIn the show, both meet the night she's forced to sleep with Alberto's brother. The two reconnect when he's sent to Miami to find her to avenge her late husband's death.\n\nWhat's true? What's fiction?Fact checking Netflix's 'Society of the Snow' plane disaster with director J.A. Bayona\n\nHow was Griselda Blanco convicted?\n\nAfter evading the police for a decade, Griselda was arrested by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in 1985 and charged with conspiring to manufacture, import and distribute cocaine. Her case went to trial in federal court in New York, where she was found guilty and sentenced to 15 years.\n\nIn prison, she was charged with three counts of first-degree murder by the state of Florida, including the fatal shooting of one of her former enforcer's 2-year-old son, who as depicted in \"Griselda\" was killed during a failed attempt on his father's life.\n\nIn 1998, she pleaded guilty in exchange for a reduced sentence. In 2004, she was granted compassionate release from prison and deported to Colombia.\n\nIs Karol G's character in 'Griselda' based on a real person?\n\nColombian singer/songwriter Karol G makes her acting debut in \"Griselda.\" She portrays Carla, a young woman who works for Griselda and later becomes one of her most important employees.\n\nBut is Karol G's character based on a real person? Newman says no.\n\nWhy is Netflix, Sofia Vergara being sued by Griselda's family?\n\nThe estate of the Colombian drug lord filed a lawsuit against Netflix and Vergara on Jan. 17 in an attempt to halt the show's release, claiming the unauthorized use of their family's image and likeness.\n\nBlanco's son Michael is seeking $100,000 in damages in Florida's Miami-Dade County court, accusing the show's creators of using his unreleased \"artistic literary work\" and his likeness \"to depict the life story of himself and his mother, Griselda Blanco De Trujillo\" without permission or credit.\n\nAhead of the \"Griselda\" premiere, Newman told TODAY that a lawsuit from Blanco's estate \"comes with the territory.\" He added, \"I dealt with similar suits from Pablo Escobar, his family, during the making of 'Narcos.'

Not so fast, says the Doyle estate, which is considering an appeal this month. Descendants of the Scottish physician and author argue he continued to develop the characters of Holmes and Dr. Watson in the later works so they should remain off-limits until the remaining copyrights run out at the end of 2022.\n\n\"It's a bogus argument. It means you can reprint Conan Doyle's own stories freely but you can't make up a new story? It doesn't make logical sense,\" said author Leslie Klinger, who brought the case against the Conan Doyle Estate Ltd. to settle the matter.\n\nWith last week's ruling in hand, Klinger plans to finish work on \"In the Company of Sherlock Holmes,\" a book of original short stories featuring characters and other elements from Conan Doyle's work. He is co-editing the book with plans to publish this fall.\n\nIf appeals judges hold it up, the ruling could lift the threat of legal action for the untold scores of writers out there churning out pastiches and fan fiction without permission. Most of them fly under the radar. In Klinger's case, the estate demanded $5,000, he said.\n\n\"Whatever decision they make will essentially determine the fate of many characters, not just Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, but very intricate characters such as James Bond. ... What happens as copyrights expire on Ian Fleming's original stories?\" said Doyle estate attorney William Zieske.\n\nThe ruling could also weaken the value of the Sherlock franchise to the point that major publishers and movie producers could also decide to move ahead with projects without licensing deals, said Paul Supnik, a Beverly Hills, Calif., attorney specializing in copyright and entertainment law who was not connected with the case.\n\n\"At the very least it's going to affect the bargaining power as to what the estate can do in trying to sell it to the studio,\" Supnik said.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute is whether a character can be copyright protected over an entire series of works. The Doyle estate argues that a basic element of copyright law allows for that if the character is highly delineated, as opposed to a two-dimensional cartoon-like character who doesn't change much over time.\n\nIn ruling against the estate, Judge Ruben Castillo called that a \"novel legal argument\" that was \"counter to the goals of the Copyright Act.\" The lawsuit was filed in Chicago because a literary agent for the Doyle estate is based in Illinois.\n\nThere's no question that Holmes and Watson are highly complex characters. Conan Doyle produced a total of four Sherlock Holmes novels and 56 stories between 1887 and 1927.\n\nKlinger argues that everything you really need to know about Holmes and Watson is in the novels and stories published before 1923 that are in the public domain in the U.S. That includes their family backgrounds, education and a slew of character traits: Holmes' Bohemian nature and cocaine use, erratic eating habits, his Baker Street lodgings, his methods of reasoning, his clever use of disguise, his skill in chemistry and even his weapon of choice, a loaded hunting crop.\n\n\"Everything that the lay person would think of as being a characteristic of Holmes or Watson is in those pre-1923 stories,\" said Klinger, who is also an attorney and lives in Malibu, Calif. \"In fact, some would say you could pick up almost everything you need from the very first story.\"\n\nThe other 10 stories have new biographical footnotes, including a mention that Watson had a second wife and played rugby in his youth.\n\nBut the Doyle estate says there are other significant elements in those later stories, such as Holmes' \"mellowing\" personality and the shift in Holmes' and Watson's relationship from flatmates and collaborators to closest friends.\n\nThus, to depict Holmes and Watson based only on parts of the canon that pre-date 1923 would be something of an artistic crime and ignore the extent to which the characters continued to evolve, said Doyle attorney Zieske.\n\n\"That's the essence of literature, how people change through different experiences,\" Zieske said. \"And to reduce true literary characters to a cardboard cutout, parts of which can be carved off, I think does literature a great disservice.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2020/01/22/great-gatsby-copyright-expire-2021-paving-way-adaptations/4540234002/", "title": "Are new 'Great Gatsby' adaptations in our future?

W. West III, a professor emeritus at Pennsylvania State University. “They have been wonderful caretakers of Fitzgerald’s literary rights and his reputation. But under our laws all literary works eventually belong to the people. That’s probably as it should be.”\n\nCheck out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist\n\n“Gatsby” has endured in a changing industry and a changing world. It was published in 1925 by Scribner and remains a Scribner book, though now part of Simon & Schuster. Popular with general readers and a standard assignment for students, its sales are as dependable as any so-called “backlist title.” When Fitzgerald died in 1940, fewer than 25,000 copies of the book had sold. Now, worldwide sales are nearing 30 million and more than 500,000 copies sell each year in the U.S. alone, according to Scribner.\n\nPublishers specializing in older works already are preparing their own editions. The Library of America will include the novel next year in a planned hardcover volume, edited by West, of Fitzgerald’s work. The Everyman Library, which for years has published the novel in the United Kingdom, will release a hardcover edition in the U.S.\n\nPop culture's best 'Great Gatsby' references\n\nAs with such current public domain titles as “Pride and Prejudice,” “The Scarlet Letter”and “Great Expectations,” cheap paperback editions and free e-book editions are likely to proliferate.\n\nScribner editor-in-chief Nan Graham acknowledges that sales are likely to fall, but says the publisher is working to hold on to as much of the market as it can, drawing in part on its long ties to Fitzgerald’s heirs. A graphic novel, featuring an introduction from Blake Hazard, is coming out in June. In 2018, Scribner reissued the book with a so-called authoritative text, making minor changes based on Fitzgerald’s own notes. The introduction was provided by Scribner author Jesmyn Ward, a two-time National Book Award winner who wrote of how she, an African American from rural Mississippi, could relate to Fitzgerald’s saga set in Long Island, New York.\n\n“Hungry as I was to escape my own little nowhere country town, my own poor beginnings, as a teen I could only see Gatsby’s yearning. I was too young to know his wanting is wasted from the moment he feels it,” Ward writes. “The seasoned heart aches for James Gatz, the perpetual child, the arrested romantic, bound by one perfect moment to failure.\n\n“This is a book that endures, generation after generation, because every time a reader returns to ‘The Great Gatsby,’ we discover new revelations, new insights, new burning bits of language.”\n\n95 years later, why 'Gatsby' is the greatest of all\n\nHazard was closely involved with the graphic novel, which features illustrations by Aya Morton and an adaptation of the text by Fred Fordham, who worked on the graphic novel of “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Hazard researched various illustrators before coming upon “His Dream of the Skyland,” a graphic novel set in Hong Kong in the 1920s that features Morton’s drawings and words by Ann Opotowsky.\n\nMorton told the AP in a recent email that she had long admired 1920s fashion for its “structured graphic design″ and “fluid, dreamy quality.” She called Fitzgerald’s novel “incredibly visual,” and was struck by his sense of detail, whether describing cars, emotions or economic status.\n\n“Not only are the hues specific, (blue, yellow, lavender), but what deeply intrigues me is how specific color saturation is to mood and class hierarchy. For example, at the Buchanans, people are wearing white and the colors (greens, reds, peaches), have a very delicate and ‘pretty’ feel,” she wrote, adding that her illustrations also were influenced by car advertisements from the ’20s.\n\n“To me, this theme is central to the story because within American car culture is the notion, or fantasy, of mobility. In other words, the idea that we have the freedom to physically move to another place and leave behind the old problems or even the old person.”\n\nReview: Baz Luhrmann's glitzy 'Great Gatsby' quickly loses its luster\n\nFitzgerald’s novel has been used in other art forms. It’s at the heart of “Gatz,” an eight-hour stage show from 2010 in which the entire book is read. Several movie versions have come out, from a silent film released not long after “Gatsby” was published to director Baz Luhrmann’s high-energy production in 2013, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby. Hazard said she enjoyed the Luhrmann film and a 1973 version starring Robert Redford, and imagines other ways the story can be adapted to the screen.\n\n“I would love to see an inclusive adaptation of ‘Gatsby,’ with a diverse cast,” she says. “Though the story is set in a very specific time and place, it seems to me that a retelling of this great American story could and should reflect a more diverse America.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/local/2019/10/20/sarasota-bradenton-on-screen-biggest-movies-made-here/2487682007/", "title": "Sarasota-Manatee on screen: the biggest movies made here", "text": "Jimmy Geurts\n\njimmy.geurts@heraldtribune.com\n\nA circus big top housing high drama, a hotbed of government corruption and murderous get-rich schemes, and the start to a bikini-clad crime spree — Sarasota-Manatee’s played them all onscreen over the years.\n\nSince the silent movie era, Florida has lured filmmakers to the Sunshine State with its camera-ready tropical locations. Sarasota-Manatee is no exception, with its plentiful beaches and waterfronts, ornate mansions and vestiges of Old Florida.\n\nThe area’s biggest production to date remains 1952’s “The Greatest Show on Earth,” Cecil B. DeMille’s extravagant love letter to the circus. The film dazzled locals with its star-studded cast including Charlton Heston and Betty Hutton and its downtown Sarasota parade scene, and went on to be a nationwide box-office smash and Best Picture Oscar winner.\n\nNo film made here in the next few decades came near that level, though there were some intriguing curios like “Midnight Cowboy” director John Schlesinger’s road-trip comedy “Honky Tonk Freeway” or the acclaimed adaptation of Sarasota author John D. MacDonald’s novel “A Flash of Green.”\n\nThen in the late ’90s, Sarasota-Manatee experienced the excitement and bustle of a major Hollywood production again when the films “Great Expectations” and “Palmetto” came to town, bringing stars like Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Woody Harrelson and Elisabeth Shue. Five years later, Denzel Washington visited Manatee and Charlotte counties while making the thriller “Out of Time.”\n\nThose were the last blockbusters to shoot mainly in Sarasota-Manatee, though some big-budget films still visited for partial shoots. Those included Harmony Korine’s surreal St. Pete-set crime film “Spring Breakers,” which shot in Sarasota along with the Jason Statham thriller “Parker.”\n\nSince Florida ended its film tax incentives program in 2016, big-budget productions have largely abandoned the Sunshine State altogether, even those that take place here. Ben Affleck’s Ybor City-set gangster film “Live by Night,” which also partially takes place on Longboat Key, headed to Georgia instead.\n\nYet as the surprise Best Picture win for the Miami indie drama “Moonlight” demonstrated, smaller-scale films can still make a big splash nationally. That includes the Sarasota-shot “Dark Night,” which premiered at Sundance Film Festival in 2016.\n\nDating back over six decades, here’s the backstory on the biggest movies to be made in Sarasota-Manatee.\n\n“The Greatest Show on Earth” (1952)\n\nWhen renowned “Samson and Delilah” director Cecil B. DeMille decided to make his next epic film about the circus, he and some of Hollywood’s biggest stars headed to Sarasota, then the winter quarters for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\n\nTaking its name from the circus’ famous tagline, “The Greatest Show on Earth” starred Charlton Heston as a circus manager, Betty Hutton as his trapeze artist girlfriend and Cornel Wilde as another aerialist who she develops feelings for. The cast also included Dorothy Lamour as an iron-jaw performer, Gloria Grahame as an elephant girl and James Stewart as a clown. (Only Stewart didn’t film any scenes here.)\n\nJoining them were real-life Ringling Bros. circus performers and Sarasota residents such as iconic clowns Emmett Kelly and Lou Jacobs, as well as circus president John Ringling North, playing himself. And to create the film’s throng of circus fans, around 3,000 locals were hired as extras.\n\nAbout half of the movie was filmed in Sarasota during a six-week shoot in early 1951. Much of that took place at Ringling Bros.’ winter quarters, located near where Bobby Jones Golf Club is today.\n\nAn extravagant circus parade scene at the end of the film was shot in downtown Sarasota, with past Sarasota landmarks like Palmer First National Bank and Oleander Ice Cream visible in the background. An estimated crowd of 65,000 to 100,000 came out to see the film’s stars and a cavalcade of animals including elephants and lions in the parade.\n\nThe stars in town caused a great deal of excitement throughout the shoot. When Lamour arrived by train to Sarasota, the Herald-Tribune reported it “required three husky policemen several minutes” to move her a few feet past “a seething mob of male, female and juvenile bobby-soxers, camera fans and autograph hunters.”\n\nThe film returned to town a year later for a premiere at Sarasota Opera House, then known as Florida Theater. The festivities included another circus parade down downtown’s Main Street drawing tens of thousands of spectators, with elephants and a convertible carrying Kelly and Florida Gov. Fuller Warren among the procession.\n\n“The Greatest Show on Earth” went on to become the highest-grossing film of 1952 and win two Oscars, including Best Picture.\n\n“Great Expectations” (1998)\n\nBefore Alfonso Cuarón won two Best Director Oscars for “Gravity” and “Roma,\" he made “Great Expectations,” Sarasota’s most star-studded production since “The Greatest Show on Earth.”\n\nThe modern reimagining of Charles Dickens’ classic stars Ethan Hawke as the protagonist, Robert De Niro as a convict he saved as a child, Anne Bancroft as a wealthy recluse whose home he frequently visits and Gwyneth Paltrow as her niece that Hawke falls for. The film updates the novel’s locations from London and Kent to New York City and Sarasota-Manatee.\n\nThe Manatee County fishing village of Cortez serves as the town that Hawke and Paltrow grow up in. Meanwhile, John and Mable Ringling’s Sarasota winter home of the Ca’ d’Zan portrays Paradiso Perduto, the decaying mansion where Bancroft lives.\n\nHeidi Taylor, an associate registrar who’s worked for 29 years at The Ringling that houses Ca’ d’Zan, said the timing was ideal, as the mansion was preparing for restoration and had its furniture in storage. So the film began the process of transforming it into a decrepit property, adding props like a crashed chandelier on the floor and an abandoned piano outside, along with sullying the interior and exterior.\n\n“They sprayed the outside of the Ca’ d’Zan with a protective layer,\" Taylor said. “Then they dirtied that covering and fake ivy and Spanish moss and all kinds of stuff, all over the outside of it. Then afterwards it was pressure-washed off, so it was pretty amazing.”\n\nThe movie stars’ presence caused a big buzz in town. Along with the cast, Bancroft’s husband Mel Brooks and Paltrow’s then-boyfriend Brad Pitt also visited Sarasota, with Pitt reportedly leaving a tour of the Ca’ d’Zan impressed.\n\nThe film also brought a national spotlight to Sarasota-Manatee, including a theatrical trailer with multiple glimpses of Ca’ d’Zan. The movie’s final scene features Hawke and Paltrow together on the mansion’s terrace overlooking Sarasota Bay.\n\nDespite its A-list talent, “Great Expectations” came out in 1998 to mixed reviews and no major awards attention. Cuarón returned to his native Mexico for his next film “Y Tu Mamá También,” with it and every feature he’s made since either winning or being nominated for Oscars.In an interview with the Herald-Tribune during a 2017 visit to Ringling College of Art and Design, Hawke said making the film was challenging, but also fascinating for the chance to work with a future filmmaker great in Cuarón.\n\n“He really pissed me off because we had such a bad time making that movie, then he went off and made ‘Y Tu Mamá También’ right after,” Hawke said. “I called him up afterwards, ‘Why is the next movie you make brilliant, and the one you made with me flawed?’”\n\n“Palmetto” (1998)\n\nFresh off recent Oscar nominations, Woody Harrelson and Elisabeth Shue headed to Sarasota-Manatee in 1997 to make the Florida neo-noir “Palmetto.”\n\nSet in the fictional town of Palmetto — not the Manatee County city of the same name — the film stars Harrelson as a reporter framed for a crime after uncovering city council corruption and Shue as a femme fatale who recruits him for a scheme once he’s released from prison. Gina Gershon, Chloe Sevigny and Michael Rapaport co-star, with the filmmaker of the Oscar-winning “The Tin Drum” Volker Schlondorff directing.\n\nPerhaps the most recognizable onscreen location is historic downtown Sarasota bar Gator Club, used as a local watering hole where Harrelson and Shue meet for the first time.\n\nGator Club’s then-owner Ernie Ritz, who sold the bar in 2005, said the film’s crew chose it because they considered it the most authentic Florida bar they could find. Several changes were nonetheless made to Gator Club before filming, including adding a phone booth, pool table and window blinds.\n\nThe shoot took four days, with Shue leaving in a limousine every day after filming, Ritz said. But Harrelson, not unlike the “Cheers” bartender character Woody that made him famous, would hang around the bar for hours.\n\n“He would talk to everybody that wanted to talk to him,” Ritz said. “He autographed a baby’s diaper, he autographed girls’ T-shirts, he autographed whatever you gave him. He was one hell of a great guy. After a while, everyone just referred to him as, ‘Hey, Woody!’ as though we were old friends.”\n\nPelican Shore Cottages on Manasota Key in Englewood also plays a prominent role in the film, serving as a retreat for Harrelson where he has rendezvouses with Shue and Sevigny. Anna Maria City Pier, Manatee County Courthouse and a Casey Key residence were among the other filming locations.\n\n“Palmetto” received a lukewarm critical and commercial response when it hit theaters nationwide. Perhaps its greatest cultural footprint remains at Gator Club, which has a display with film shoot photographs on its wall and the wooden blinds still on its windows.\n\n“Woody Harrelson put those blinds in,” Ritz said. “Best gift I ever got.”\n\n“Out of Time” (2003)\n\nJust months after winning the Best Actor Oscar in 2002 for playing corrupt L.A. cop Alonzo in “Training Day,” Denzel Washington hopped from the West Coast to Florida’s sunny Gulf Coast to film “Out of Time.”\n\nHe reunited with his “Training Day” co-star Eva Mendes and “Devil in a Blue Dress” director Carl Franklin for the thriller. Washington played police chief Matt, estranged from his detective wife (Mendes) and having an affair with the married Ann (Sanaa Lathan). But when Ann and her husband appear dead in a fire and the evidence points to Matt, he must cover his tracks and find the real culprit.\n\nMultiple Florida locations were used to create the fictional town of Banyan Key, where the movie is set. Those included Cortez, with a dock in Cortez Cove Marina transformed into Matt’s sea shack home.\n\nThe house is seen multiple times in the movie, including the final scene with an aerial shot soaring over the water. Karen Bell, an owner of Cortez’s A.P. Bell and Star Fish Company as well as the marina, said the dock used to be a net camp where fishermen would store their cotton nets.\n\n“It was amazing how quickly they did it,” Bell said of the shack’s construction. “Of course, it wasn’t built to code or anything, it was just slapped together. But it looked great, it just looked very authentic and real.”\n\nIn between filming scenes, Bell said Washington would fish by a fuel dispenser on the docks near A.P. Bell and Star Fish.\n\n“He liked to catch sheepshead,” Bell said. “My uncle went out and spoke with him and he had no clue who he was, and just sat there and talked. Real low-key, they said he was really nice.”\n\nThe movie also filmed at The Fishery restaurant in Placida in Charlotte County, and Boca Grande on Gasparilla Island, with the film’s opening scene featuring the sign for Temptation Restaurant in Boca Grande.\n\n“Out of Time” hit theaters a year later and proved moderately successful critically and commercially, opening at No. 2 in its opening weekend behind “School of Rock.” The shack has since been dismantled, but the dock is still there.\n\n“Honky Tonk Freeway” (1981)\n\nOscar-winning director John Schlesinger’s most famous film, “Midnight Cowboy,” ended with a road trip to Florida. Then a decade later, he made a movie where that was the entire premise, which ended up being a historic box-office bomb.\n\n“Honky Tonk Freeway” centers on a fictional Florida town called Ticlaw, featuring a safari park that boasts a water-skiing elephant named Bubbles. The mayor (William Devane) attempts to pay officials off to get a Ticlaw freeway exit that would draw more tourist traffic, but is unsuccessful.\n\nFrom there, it follows a sprawling cast of characters headed to Florida, including an aspiring children’s book author (Beau Bridges), a woman transporting her mother’s ashes in an urn (Beverly D’Angelo) and an elderly couple planning their retirement (Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn). Their paths finally intersect when Ticlaw’s mayor, in a desperate last gambit, blows up an overpass.\n\nMost of the Ticlaw scenes were shot in the central Florida city of Mount Dora, but the movie’s two most remarkable stunts were filmed here. An overpass of a then-under-construction Interstate 75 in the Fruitville area of Sarasota was detonated. Then in the movie’s final scene, a truck carrying safari animals accidentally jumps over the blown-up overpass, causing a pile-up and releasing the animals.\n\nIn an interview with the Herald-Tribune in July while filming the movie “Acting: The First Six Lessons” in Sarasota, Bridges said his main memory of “Honky Tonk Freeway” was sitting on a freeway with D’Angelo in “hot as hell” 100 degree weather.\n\n“They shut down one whole side of the freeway and they had wild animals out on the freeway, rhinos and lions and crap,” Beau said. “But what they forgot to do was shut down and control the other side of the freeway, so you had people rubbernecking and looking at all this craziness happening.”\n\nSuch stunts proved costly, with the film’s budget estimated at $24 million plus at least $5 million in marketing, according to the New York Times. When it was released nationwide in August 1981, it struggled to make back $2 million, leading the Times to call it “the unquestionable commercial disaster of the summer.”\n\nReviews were also generally negative, but the film has since found a cult following, including with Floridians proud of this piece of their history. Bridges called it “a bizarre movie,” but enjoyed working with Schlesinger, calling him “one of our better ones.”\n\n“A Flash of Green” (1984)\n\nAfter starring in “The Right Stuff,” Ed Harris visited Sarasota-Manatee for “A Flash of Green.” Based on the novel by Sarasota literary luminary John D. MacDonald, it was also made by one of Florida’s most acclaimed filmmakers.\n\nVictor Nunez, who later directed the Florida-set movies “Ulee’s Gold” and “Ruby in Paradise” and currently teaches film at Florida State University, had MacDonald suggested to him by his production partner Sam Gowan, who worked at University of Florida’s library where the author’s collection resides.\n\nHarris stars as Jimmy Wing, a newspaper reporter in the fictional Palm City. County commissioner Elmo Bliss (Richard Jordan) wants to develop on Grassy Bay and bribes Jimmy for his help. Though Jimmy initially agrees, his relationship with a woman (Blair Brown) opposing the development and threats other environmental activists begin to receive trouble him.\n\nThe movie filmed in several Sarasota-Manatee locations such as Casey Key and Cortez. Sarasota restaurant Waffle Shop (now Waffle Stop) acts as a diner where characters meet, while Sarasota County Courthouse served as the setting for the commission meetings.\n\nIt also employed local actors in prominent roles, including Asolo Repertory Theatre veteran Isa Thomas, who played scientist Doris. Actual county commissioners and other state politicians even agreed to play commissioners, in an example of the film shoot’s heavy community involvement.\n\n“Doing a movie was a novelty,” Nunez said. “I just thought we were local filmmakers having a good time, but because we had Ed Harris and Blair Brown and Richard Jordan, we ended up having to have a press conference for everybody. (Wayne) Mixson, who was lieutenant governor at the time, he flew his helicopter down there to come and visit on the set.”\n\n“A Flash of Green” played film festivals like Toronto and Cannes before airing on television in 1986 as part of the PBS anthology series “American Playhouse.” IFC did a restoration of the film about a decade ago, which currently remains limited to theatrical screenings.\n\nThose who praised the film included Roger Ebert and the New York Times’ Vincent Canby, as well as MacDonald before his death in 1986. The author, whose novel “The Executioners” was filmed as \"Cape Fear\" in 1962 and 1991, attended a Sarasota premiere. According to Gowan, MacDonald said it was the best film based on his writing he’d seen.\n\n“This was a very emotional, I think, novel for John, and it’s strangely timely,” Nunez said. “John was no tree-hugger, but he was passionate about what he felt was just this blind destruction of the very reason that people were there.”\n\n“Spring Breakers” (2013)\n\nBefore partying in Pinellas County for Harmony Korine’s Florida crime film “Spring Breakers,” Disney stars Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens first made a stop in Sarasota.\n\nGomez and Hudgens, along with “Pretty Little Liars” star Ashley Benson and Harmony’s wife Rachel Korine, play four college students desperate to go on spring break. Their debauchery becomes increasingly criminal when they cross paths with drug dealer and rapper Alien (James Franco.)\n\nSarasota plays the town where the girls go to college, with the film spending a week at Ringling College in March during the school’s own spring break. It was also the movie’s first week of filming overall, said Christine Meeker Lange, who managed the shoot while then working at the college.\n\n“It was exhausting — we were probably filming at least 12 hours a day, and then the set-up and take-down was additional time,” Lange said. “But they always say that the first week of the shoot is critical to determine how the rest of it will go, and they were just so thrilled. I couldn’t be happier in how it went.”\n\nOn-campus locations included the college’s academic center for a classroom scene with a sea of computer screens illuminated in the dark, representative of the film’s day-glo visual style. Some cottages on vacant property Ringling College owned were converted into fraternity houses used for one of the film’s several party scenes.\n\nFranco didn’t visit the Sarasota shoot, but the four leading ladies did, with fans gathering near the set in hopes of glimpsing Gomez or her then-boyfriend Justin Bieber. Lange said the spectators were very respectful, except for one who jumped a fence and another who hid under a stairwell with a camera.\n\n“Spring Breakers” also filmed at Sarasota’s New College of Florida for exterior shots and a gleeful nighttime run. The Sunshine Skyway Bridge appears in multiple scenes as well.\n\nThe movie hit theaters nationwide a year later in March 2013 and was both a commercial and critical success. There was even talk of a sequel to be written by “Trainspotting” author Irvine Welsh without Harmony’s involvement, but that has yet to materialize.\n\nHarmony did shoot his next film in South Florida, this year’s Matthew McConaughey stoner comedy “The Beach Bum,” and moved to Miami. Other potential projects the director has discussed — Miami gangster film “The Trap,” an adaptation of Alissa Nutting’s novel “Tampa” — are also set in Florida, so don’t be surprised if he returns to Sarasota-Manatee someday.\n\n“Parker” (2013)\n\nThe same year “Spring Breakers” hit multiplexes, so did “Parker,” another Florida film with big-name stars partially filmed in Sarasota.\n\nThe movie was based on the criminal character of the same name in Donald E. Westlake’s novels, previously portrayed by actors like Lee Marvin in “Point Blank” and Mel Gibson in “Payback” under different monikers. Jason Statham played Parker in this 2013 adaptation, with “Ray” filmmaker Taylor Hackford directing.\n\n“Parker” was primarily set and shot in Palm Beach, where Parker searches with the help of a local real estate agent (Jennifer Lopez) for a group of robbers who double-crossed him. But a climactic scene where the robbers pull off a heist at a jewelry auction was filmed at Ca’ d’Zan.\n\nSarasota County Film and Entertainment Office Director Jeanne Corcoran said the film struggled to find a suitable Palm Beach mansion for the scene, with Mar-a-Lago being too expensive. Sarasota-based crew member Pamela Alessandrelli then suggested Ca’ d’Zan. The production was interested, but wondered if they could find enough extras who could provide their own tuxedo and gown wardrobes.\n\n“I laughed and said, ‘You absolutely can, you know this is Sarasota, right?’” Corcoran said. “‘With the opera and the ballet and the theater and the galas, I don’t think there’s any problem whatsoever with people having their own tuxedos and gowns.’”\n\nAround 300 locals were ultimately hired, including members of Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office Marine Unit for the robbers’ getaway on the water. Smoke-based pyrotechnics were also used during the shoot, which Corcoran said spent about $500,000 overall.\n\nStatham and Lopez didn’t visit Sarasota, but other stars did, including Emmy-winning “The Shield” actor Michael Chiklis, who played the robbers’ leader Melander. Hackford’s wife, Oscar-winning British actress Helen Mirren, also accompanied him to Sarasota, Corcoran said.\n\nDespite its pedigree, “Parker” received poor reviews and a No. 5 box-office debut. The movie was suggested as the potential start of a franchise before its release, but no follow-up film has since been announced.\n\nCa’ d’Zan remains one of Sarasota-Manatee’s most popular filming locations, however. Singer Jackie Evancho’s PBS special used it as a backdrop, as did the Palmetto-set TNT crime series “Claws,” which primarily shoots in Louisiana.\n\n“Dark Night” (2017)\n\nIndie drama “Dark Night” easily has the lowest budget and least-known stars of any movie on this list, but it nonetheless scored national attention, and could represent the future of Sarasota-Manatee filmmaking.\n\nThe film is loosely based on the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting during a screening of “The Dark Knight Rises” that resulted in 12 deaths and 70 injuries. The story follows several strangers throughout their everyday lives leading up to the shooting, which is not shown onscreen.\n\nMultiple recognizable Sarasota locations appear throughout the film, with downtown’s Regal Hollywood and its neon-lit lobby serving as the backdrop for the ending. In another scene, one character meets someone for drinks at beloved Sarasota dive bar Memories Lounge.\n\nYet it’s also set largely in anonymous strip malls, as well as the actual houses of local cast members, the majority of whom weren’t professional actors. Sutton told the Herald-Tribune in a previous interview that he was drawn to Sarasota because of its “universal” suburban landscape.\n\n“The landscape of the film was always supposed to feel like Florida, but it could be Arizona or Connecticut,” Sutton said.\n\nThe film’s crew was a similar blend of professional and aspiring filmmakers, including several from Ringling College, where the movie also shot. Students worked in key roles including assistant camera and the art department, alongside Sutton and Independent Spirit Awards-nominated cinematographer Helene Louvart.\n\n“Dark Night” premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival. Unsurprisingly, given its sensitive subject matter and experimental nature, reviews were divided. But the positive ones were often highly so, such as Entertainment Weekly’s Leah Greenblatt, who called it “a haunting, thought-provoking piece of work.”\n\nAnd the setup of making movies with a blend of professionals and Ringling College students has continued in Sarasota.\n\nKevin Smith’s horror anthology film “Killroy was Here” wrapped filming last year at Sarasota locations like Booker Middle School and Fruitville Grove and is currently in post-production. So is Beau Bridges’ “Acting: The First Six Lessons,” which used Ringling College students on its crew as well.\n\nThese indie films may not boast the glitz and glamour of “The Greatest Show on Earth,” but they could be what continues Sarasota-Manatee’s long history of filmmaking into the new decade.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/arts/2021/08/27/ri-reading-groups-providence-kingston-attleboro-ma-library-authors-indigenous-queer-lgbtq-black/5582842001/", "title": "RI book clubs: What they are reading, where the meet and why they ...", "text": "Robin Kall\n\nSpecial to The Journal\n\nRhode Island may be the smallest state in the country, but what we lack in size we make up for in book clubs per capita.

In those long days indoors, many of us have spent vast amounts of time entertaining ourselves at home, which means we're watching more TV, streaming more movies, blasting more music and reading more books. At least, it meant that for the USA TODAY Life staff, since we spend most of our time finding the best entertainment choices for our readers.\n\nTo entertain a group of entertainment reporters, a movie, TV show, book, album or podcast has to be more than just good enough. It has to stand out from all the pop culture we spend our time reviewing and writing about. So here are 100 things that managed to divert and distract us from the news at a difficult time (and a few that fell decidedly flat).\n\nMovies\n\n1. “13th”: I was not prepared for the visceral reaction I had when I watched this Netflix documentary. Directed by Ava DuVernay, this powerful film tackles the history and policies that have produced the current prison boom in the United States, from the enactment of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, to the present day prison system where African Americans are unfairly over-represented. It is a must-watch film. -Mary Cadden\n\nCheck out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist\n\n2. “American Psycho”: We’ve all been feeling a little “psycho” being locked up during stay-at-home orders, but nothing compares to the serial-killing tendencies of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a wealthy New York investment banker. -Jenna Ryu\n\n3. “Athlete A\": I’m a former gymnast and a current journalist, so when those two worlds collide, I’m all in. This documentary, chronicling how the Indianapolis Star broke the story of systemic abuse at USA Gymnastics, is triumphant and gut-wrenching in equal measures. It speaks to the power of a free press and the ability of the human soul to overcome tragedy. -Alison Maxwell\n\n4. “Bad Education”: A story of school administrators embezzling from a high-achieving, Long Island, N.Y., school system doesn’t sound like the most scintillating movie pitch, but Hugh Jackman and Allison Janney create compelling, entertaining characters in HBO’s darkly comic look at the corrupting effects of the American drive for success. -Bill Keveney\n\n5. “Barry Lyndon”: A grievously underrated 1975 Stanley Kubrick masterpiece. I spent three full hours exclaiming, “Look at that depth of field!” and “It’s like a painting!” to an empty room. I am cool and all the boys like me. -Barbara VanDenburgh\n\n6. Black-and-white movies: More time at home offers a chance to revisit film classics or finally get to ones you’ve heard about but haven’t seen. My random sampler includes: “The Best Years of Our Lives” (1946), which poignantly depicts the toll war takes on the winning soldiers; “A Face in the Crowd” (1957), which offers a sharp-eyed, early look at the demagogic power of television; and Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove” (1964), a dark comedy about nuclear self-destruction famed for Peter Sellers’ three-role tour de force. -B.K.\n\n7. The “Bourne” film franchise: Matt Damon as an amnesiac spy with a devastating kill set delivers the thrills, even upon repeat watching. For a decidedly different action film set in Europe, try 1968’s “Where Eagles Dare,” an exciting if somewhat implausible World War II rescue adventure starring a fascinating duo: Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. -B.K.\n\n8. “Braveheart”: July 4th weekend felt like a good time to conquer this three-hour event of a movie, which lived up to its campy, bloody and epic reputation. -Kelly Lawler\n\n9. \"Dark Waters”: A must watch for anyone who loves a legal thriller or a movie based on a true story, about chemical contamination of a small town. -Morgan Hines\n\n10. “Disclosure”: Quarantine is an opportunity to educate oneself. The documentary, which counts Laverne Cox as an executive producer, traces transgender representation in TV and movies. -Erin Jensen\n\n11. Disney animated movies (a lot of them): After several weekend days spent in the wonderful world of Disney+, I have the following assessments: The “Frozen” music is mostly terrible, the live-action “Lady and the Tramp” is wildly underrated and we should go back to the glory days of 90-minute animated musicals like “Mulan” and “Aladdin.” - K.L.\n\n12. “Elf”: One day in lockdown, my pre-K daughter wanted to pretend it was Christmas. We decorated sugar cookies with red and green sprinkles, made Santa hats from construction paper and watched Will Ferrell prance around New York City in tights proclaiming, “The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.” -Jennifer McClellan\n\n13. “Emma”: Anya Taylor-Joy is perfectly cast as Emma, a wealthy youth with hubristic views on her matchmaking abilities. The chemistry between her and Johnny Flynn’s Mr. Knightley is undeniable and, like all great Jane Austen adaptations, peaks while they are dancing at a ball. -J.M.\n\n14. “Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga”: If there was ever a time for a feel-good movie, it is now. And that movie is “Eurovision.” Inspired by the actual Eurovision song contest, and even featuring some of its past contestants and winners. The Netflix film is a perfect balance of sweet and slapstick. Stars Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams are everything.Well, almost everything. Dan Stevens steals quite a few scenes and there is, of course, the music of Abba. I laughed, I cried, I downloaded the film’s \"Song a Long\" and have it on constant repeat. -M.C.\n\n15. “Hamilton”: Having never seen the stage production, I’d always regretted not being able to watch Daveed Diggs rap 6.5 words per second while jumping off a table during “Guns and Ships.\" On Disney+, \"Hamilton\" was as good – if not better – than I expected. But it was the little things that stood out to me while watching the filmed performance of the Broadway musical: the use of the bullet as a character, that look on Leslie Odom’s face when he defiantly sings, “I am the one thing in life I can control” during “Wait for It.\" All in all, I’m satisfied. -Jayme Deerwester\n\n16. “Her”:\" Maybe watching a 2013 movie about a man falling in love with a Siri- or Alexa-like voice wasn’t the greatest idea during the height of quarantine and lack of human connection. But also, who cares? Get yourself some catharsis and watch a movie for which Joaquin Phoenix should’ve won an Oscar. -David Oliver\n\n17. “Hitch”: I rewatched the 2005 Will Smith film during quarantine, and it remains my favorite rom-com. Enough said. -M.H.\n\n18. “Inception”: Ten years after its release, I rewatched “Inception,” a movie I had never conceptually been able to understand until now (kind of). The 2010 Christopher Nolan film, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, follows a corporate espionage plan to infiltrate the dreams of a competitor. -J.R.\n\n19. James Bond movies: About halfway through an attempt to watch all of the Bond films, I mostly resent my parents for letting me watch “Austin Powers” before showing me what inspired the parody. -K.L.\n\n20. Orson Welles films (other than \"Citizen Kane\"): If you like “Kane” (1941), often voted the greatest film of all time, don’t miss two other Welles-Joseph Cotten collaborations: as director and star in 1942’s “The Magnificent Ambersons” and as actors in 1949’s “The Third Man,” which has the added bonus of zither music! -B.K.\n\n21. “Palm Springs”: Yes, the plot is just like Bill Murray’s “Groundhog Day.” I don’t care. This winning comedy starring Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti was a treat on Hulu, after bypassing theaters. The pair had great chemistry and the movie was sweet, funny and sort of thought-provoking, too. -Gary Levin\n\n22. “Showgirls”: I don’t know what it says about me that watching 1995's “Showgirls” (streaming on HBO Max) for the first time has been a highlight of self-quarantine. I love a movie that's so bad it’s good, and this is an all-timer of the genre. -B.V.\n\n23. \"The Surrogate\": This 2020 feature debut of filmmaker Jeremy Hersh tells a thought-provoking story of a woman (Jasmine Batchelor) who agrees to carry a child for her married gay friends, only to learn the fetus has Down Syndrome. It’s a complex and emotional film that deftly explores weighty issues of race, class and ability. -Patrick Ryan\n\nTV shows\n\n24. “13 Reasons Why”: I started this show back when it first made waves years ago, but after going back to the beginning and watching all four seasons during the pandemic, I highly recommend you don’t do the same (at least not when the world is already stressful enough). This Netflix series is packed with heavy and disturbing elements, so instead of providing an interesting escape, it turns into a depressing undertaking. -Sara Moniuszko\n\n25. “Better Call Saul”: With final-season production postponed by the pandemic, you’ve got time to catch up with AMC's “Breaking Bad” prequel, which might be the best spinoff series ever. Bob Odenkirk is great in the title role, but Rhea Seehorn’s Emmy-worthy performance was the jewel of the just-concluded Season 5. -B.K.\n\n26. “Big Little Lies”: I’m embarrassed to say it took me this long to watch HBO's incredible miniseries. Although a lot of the plotlines and themes are heavy, the series provides the perfect binge option that will keep you hooked. (And the twists and turns may even help you escape from the world’s problems for a bit.) -S.M.\n\n27. “Damages’’: Glenn Close and Rose Byrne are terrific in every season of FX's legal thriller. -Dawn Gilbertson\n\n28. “Dead to Me”: The Netflix series starring Christina Applegate and Linda Cardellini will surely take you to the “Are you still watching?” screen. With twists and turns in every episode, we’re grateful they are renewing it for a third and final season. -Amy Haneline\n\n29. “A Discovery of Witches”: Witches and vampires. Good and evil. Love and hate. Supernatural power struggles and scientific discovery. This Netflix series (and book series on which it’s based) has it all (including Matthew Goode as a brooding, love-struck vampire). -J.M.\n\n30. “Dispatches From Elsewhere”: Created by Jason Segel (\"How I Met Your Mother\"), AMC's \"Elsewhere\" focuses on four diverse strangers, struggling through challenges in life, who unite to find magic in the world. It’s fantastical, surreal, mind-bending, and one of the few things that has made me smile during this dark time. -A.M.\n\n31. “Doc McStuffins”: When you become a parent, your bingeing takes a turn. But we admittedly love watching Disney Channel's confident Black doctor care for her toys even when we wish to never hear “time for a checkup, time for a checkup” ever again. -A.H.\n\n32. “Elementary”: I had always loved Sherlock Holmes-like detectives on shows like “Monk” and “Psych,” and enjoyed this CBS take on the most famous literary detective, played by Johnny Lee Miller. But the real reason I devoured all seven seasons was Lucy Liu's Watson. -K.L.\n\n33. “Expecting Amy”: Anyone who loves Amy Schumer's brand of honest comedy will enjoy this HBO Max docuseries, an unwatered-down recount of her difficult pregnancy, during which she suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, an extreme form of morning sickness, and attempted to tour and film a stand-up special. -E.J.\n\n34. “Felicity”: I adored J.J. Abrams’ college-set WB series, even if I was one of the fans who checked out after Felicity Porter’s (Keri Russell) ill-advised Season 2 haircut. Finally, I’m seeing this Felicity-Ben-Noel love triangle (Team Noel!) through to graduation. -Kim Willis\n\n35. “Five Came Back”: This documentary series on Netflix highlights the work of five Hollywood directors who, at the top of their careers, joined the U.S. military during World War II to document the many facets of the war. Modern-day directors analyze both their predecessors and the films. It's powerful on its own, and life-changing if paired with the documentary “Nazi Concentration Camps,” which shows some of the government-funded footage shot by the directors. -M.C.\n\n36. “Floor is Lava”: I started watching this Netflix competition show about an extreme version of the childhood obstacle game to be ironic, and now I can’t stop. -Hannah Yasharoff\n\n37. “Friday Night Lights”: An NBC show that I watched only sporadically the first time around, this combo of sports and soap, which followed Buzz Bissinger’s book and a movie, won me over. -G.L.\n\n38. “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” I rewatched “The Good Wife” and caught up on “The Good Fight,” and couldn’t help but fall in love all over again. Both are perfect ways to view how the world changed under both the Obama and Trump administrations, respectively – with smart writing and brilliant performances. Watching both series is like taking walks up and down a spiral staircase: Spinning around and around only to arrive somewhere new yet alarmingly familiar. -D.O.\n\n39. “The Great British Baking Show” My favorite form of comfort TV is this quaint British series full of soggy bottoms and delectable treats. I watched all the streaming seasons in the first few weeks of quarantine. -K.L.\n\n40. “Holey Moley” Come on. Sometimes, you just want to see a miniature-golf player knocked into the drink by a whirling windmill blade. If so, ABC has you covered. -B.K.\n\n41. “Jane the Virgin’’: This CW series (streaming on Netflix) has long been on my to-watch list and I loved it, even the over-the-top antics of Rogelio de la Vega (Jaime Camil). -D.G.\n\n42. “John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City”: John Mulaney’s performance in his Netflix stand-up special “Kid Gorgeous\" is as close to a perfect routine as I’ve seen. -E.J.\n\n43. “Justified”: I binge-watched six seasons of this FX gem on Hulu in less than a month, one of them in a single day. And now I desperately miss Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant) and Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins). -D.G.\n\n44. “The Last Dance”: ESPN’s 10-episode documentary (streaming on Netflix July 19) is a great retrospective about the Chicago Bulls’ six NBA championships, but it also reveals much about the players – Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Steve Kerr and others – and about sports and culture in the 1990s. -B.K.\n\n45. “Little Fires Everywhere”: If you binged “Big Little Lies” and are looking for your next drama/mystery series, look no further than Hulu's “Little Fires,” starring Kerry Washington and Reese Witherspoon. What’s even better? It’s only one season, so no long commitment required! -S.M.\n\n46. “Lovesick”: This British show (Netflix) follows Dylan (Johnny Flynn), a perpetually in-love man who tests positive for chlamydia and must contact women he’s slept with to let them know. As he revisits past flames, he reveals a backstory that has consequences for Dylan’s present, when he’s in love with his best friend (Antonia Thomas), who’s engaged to someone else. But don’t let that description fool you: The show is hilarious and its characters nuanced and compelling. -J.M.\n\n47. “Mad Men”: AMC's take on the Madison Avenue advertising world is just as intoxicating now as it was when Don Draper (Jon Hamm) and company finished their run five years ago. Aside from the obvious Mid Mod eye candy, the show’s abruptly changing 1960s culture and depiction of a business constantly on the brink of collapse feel oddly timely amid the coronavirus crisis. -K.W.\n\n48. “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”: I’ll admit, I was late to the game with bingeing this feel good, award-winning Amazon series about a 1950s housewife turned aspiring stand-up comic. But what better time to catch up on all the shows I wished I watched than during a pandemic? Cheering on Midge (Rachel Brosnahan) as she uproots her life and starts anew felt like a fitting story for a time when many people are reflecting on the world and their priorities. -Charlie Trepany\n\n49. “Medici: Masters of Florence”: I’m a sucker for any kind of historical fiction, and binged through all three seasons on Netflix during time off, which provided entertainment and a new topic of interest. I spent a good deal of time Googling and reading up on the Medici family after various episodes to compare historical sources with the show. -M.H.\n\n50. “Money Heist”: This Spanish Netflix series is excellent. I thought I wouldn’t be able to get past watching a show dubbed into English, but the plot line is so exciting (and anxiety inducing) that I don’t even notice anymore. -Rasha Ali\n\n51. “Motown Magic”: I’d like to thank the creators of this Netflix kids show for allowing me to listen to The Temptations, The Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas and Marvin Gaye while my kids watch TV. -J.M.\n\n52. “Nate Bargatze: The Tennessee Kid”: To boost my mood during the current climate, I’ve been turning to beloved stand-up specials. Bargatze’s delivery in this Netflix special makes me laugh out loud! “Olivia?” -E.J.\n\n53. “The Office”: I was a fan of the British version starring (and co-created by) Ricky Gervais, but never quite cottoned to Steve Carell’s Michael Scott. But a pandemic binge-watch of NBC's nine seasons of this series endeared me to a stellar supporting cast (and there are so many of them!) and far more nuance than the UK edition could accomplish in its measly 14 episodes. -G.L.\n\n54. “Ozark”: When your days are spent indoors, a thriller like “Ozark” can bring some much-needed excitement. My family turned this on because we’d heard it was good and thought, “Why not?” Once we started watching, we couldn’t stop. -C.T.\n\n55. “Queer Eye”: The latest season of Netflix's “Queer Eye” dropped June 5 and has provided such a pick-me-up during the pandemic. Have I imagined what the experts – Bobby Berk, Jonathan Van Ness, Karamo Brown, Tan France and Antoni Porowski – would say to help me improve my life? Absolutely! -E.J.\n\n56. “Ramy\": This Hulu series has been on my “to watch” list for far too long, and I’m so glad I finally started. Star and creator Ramy Youssef’s semi-autobiographical dramedy, which follows a millennial Muslim man in New Jersey torn between his faith and wanting to fit in with American culture, is fun to watch and unlike anything else on TV right now. -H.Y.\n\n57. “Reconstruction: America After the Civil War”: As an alternative to cable news shows fixated on the controversy of the moment, often with little context, try history. PBS’ four-hour 2019 documentary from Henry Louis Gates is a great starting point to learn more about the history of racism, voter suppression and other topics that are just as relevant today. -B.K.\n\n58. “Say I Do\": So maybe you’re ready to release with a good cry? The couples featured in Netflix's “Say I Do” (and their devotion to each other) will have you bawling – in the best way. Each receive the wedding of their dreams with help from interior designer Jeremiah Brent, fashion designer Thai Nguyen and chef Gabriele Bertaccini. -E.J.\n\n59. “Schitt’s Creek”: This six-season Pop TV comedy (now on Netflix) is a riches-to-rags delight that has heart, charm and so many witty and quotable one-liners. Watching the Rose family navigate going from bazillionaires to living in a small town they once purchased as a joke was the perfect mindless diversion. As Alexis frequently said, “love that journey for me.” -A.M.\n\n60. \"Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker\": If quarantine has left you feeling less than motivated, this Netflix period drama chronicling the story of Madam C.J. Walker, whose fierce determination made her the first African American self-made millionaire, might just be the kick in the pants that you need. -A.H.\n\n61. “Snowpiercer”: Sure, the 2013 Bong Joon-ho sci-fi movie about class struggle was awesome, but TNT's new remake gives us Daveed Diggs as the world’s coolest post-apocalyptic homicide detective on a 1,001-car train bound for nowhere. -Brian Truitt\n\n62. “The Sopranos”: In the time it took Meadow Soprano to parallel park in the divisive series finale, I binge-watched David Chase's HBO mob masterpiece and am already itching to start it again. It's a funny, tear-jerking and often surreal exploration of family in a moral gray area, and Edie Falco as Carmela Soprano is the GOAT. -P.R.\n\n63. “Supernatural”: Worried that I was running through too many TV shows in quarantine, I came up with a solution: Watch one really, really long series. There are 15 seasons of CW’s (and formerly WB's) mystical drama (minus a few episodes in the final season yet to shoot because of the pandemic), and the brotherly ghost fighting has been more than satisfying. Bonus: I’m only nine seasons in. -K.L.\n\n64. “Treme\": Revolving around a national emergency, racial tensions and police corruption, David Simon's HBO series set in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina couldn’t feel more on-point right now. The show’s exhilarating, authentic music and conspicuously great food are pretty good coping mechanisms for COVID-19, too. -K.W.\n\n65. “Unorthodox”: I needed to be immersed in a TV show to distract myself from the increasingly tragic news about the pandemic, and this four-episode Netflix series, about a woman who escapes an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, certainly sucked me in. -K.L.\n\n66. “Upload”: This new Amazon comedy from Greg Daniels (“The Office”) offers a funny, insightful take on the benefits and dangers of technology as the consciousness of a dead man (Robbie Amell) is moved to a digitally created virtual afterlife. The complicated relationship forged with the very alive tech worker assigned to manage his afterlife (Andy Allo) is poignant and funny. -B.K.\n\n67. “We’re Here”: In this HBO series, three former competitors on “RuPaul's Drag Race” – Shangela Laquifa Wadley, Bob the Drag Queen and Eureka O’Hara – transform residents of small towns for a drag show, which (spoiler alert!) typically helps ignite an internal makeover as well. -E.J.\n\n68. “Yellowstone”: This popular Paramount Network drama has something for fans of Westerns and Kevin Costner. But what it really offers to viewers stuck at home is the most marvelous Big Sky, wide-open scenery, vistas of mountains and fields and streams from location shooting in the Rocky Mountain states. -B.K.\n\nBooks\n\n69. “And Then There Were None” by Agatha Christie: I had never read any of Christie’s classics, so I started with this one, which tops many best-of lists. It did not disappoint. The tale reads like a game of “Survivor” as visitors lured to an island die one by one. The twist at the end is worth the wait. -A.M.\n\n70. The Charlotte Holmes series by Brittany Cavallaro: The four mystery-filled novels center on teenagers John Watson and Charlotte Holmes, whose great-great-great grandfathers were quite the crime-solving duo. The kids are a formidable pair in that same vein, too, though they also have to navigate their own complicated family legacies and feelings about each other. -B.T.\n\n71. “The Cruel Prince” by Holly Black: I love young adult fantasy fiction, and Black has a compelling series about fairies, politics and finding your place in the world, starting with this novel, which I read in a single day. -K.L.\n\n72. “Death in Her Hands” by Ottessa Moshfegh: After thoroughly enjoying the emotion, humor and writing style of “My Year of Rest and Relaxation,” I couldn’t wait for Moshfegh’s next book. Unfortunately, the story is a bit of a snoozefest, and Moshfegh gets a little too caught up in the inner workings of the protagonist’s mind. -A.M.\n\n73. “Ex Machina” by Brian K. Vaughan and Tony Harris: Not the slick sci-fi movie but the even better 50-issue comic-book series that marries “The West Wing” and superheroes. The mayor of New York City is a former masked vigilante who balances running the Big Apple with dealing with supervillains and interdimensional threats. -B.T.\n\n74. “The Fire Next Time” by James Baldwin: Esteemed writer Baldwin's book is split into two: The first part, a letter to his nephew about the history of race in America; the second, an essay on his experiences with religion and race. Baldwin's writing is beautiful and striking, and his prose will stick with you long after you reach the final page. -H.Y.\n\n75. “Fleishman Is in Trouble” by Taffy Brodesser-Akner: This was the first title that my quarantine book club read, and it proved a fruitful discussion starter. Conversation ranged from how much being a woman/man is part of one’s identity to whether it’s OK to grow together and apart in relationships. Much wine was happily consumed. -Carly Mallenbaum\n\n76. “Florence Adler Swims Forever” by Rachel Beanland: I reviewed this book and it was the first that entirely held my attention. I was so enthralled by the plot that I woke up thinking about it at 3 a.m. after the first afternoon of reading. -M.H.\n\n77. “Followers” by Megan Angelo: I came for the interesting premise of two women trying to game the social media influencer system; I stayed for the nail-biting commentary about the dangers of internet usage and the downsides to celebrity culture. -H.Y.\n\n78. “Hard Times: An Oral History of the Great Depression” by Studs Terkel: The current economic climate is stressful and I thought I might read up on a similar time – the Great Depression. I have heard stories from my parents, who were born into the Depression. They have passed, but I found a great deal of additional perspective from the late author and historian Terkel, who compiled a book of experiences from a cross section of people, both socially and economically diverse, who lived through that dramatic period of history. -M.C.\n\n79. “How to Make a Plant Love You” by Summer Rayne Oakes: To supplement my quarantine gardening hobby, I picked up this highly recommended book on plant parenthood. More than a guide on how to not kill plants, the book ponders our relationship with nature, something I’ve been thinking about a lot from the confines of my apartment. -K.L.\n\n80. “Know My Name” by Chanel Miller: Miller, the survivor in the Brock Turner rape case formerly known as Emily Doe, tells her empowering story about reclaiming her name and healing after surviving sexual assault. -J.R.\n\n81. “Learn to Lucid Dream” by Dr. Kristen LaMarca: The internet has endless resources on how to lucid dream (should you be as interested as I am on the topic), but LaMarca’s book efficiently condenses all of the most effective practices into one book. So far, I’ve had two lucid dreams! -C.M.\n\n82. “A Little Life” by Hanya Yanagihara: Who knew someone could write 800+ pages of torture and never let up? A trigger warning disguised as a novel, this disturbing work is full of unrelenting trauma. I will discuss this book with you if you read it, for sure, but I can’t in good faith recommend it. To anyone. -D.O.\n\n83. “The Long Call” by Ann Cleeves: In the North Devon-set novel, Detective Matthew Venn investigates a murder that hits close to home: One that could possibly involve the church community he turned his back on years ago or his beloved husband, with whom he has made a new life. A serious page-turner that keeps you guessing. -M.C.\n\n84. “A Man Called Ove’’ by Fredrik Backman: I haven’t stopped recommending this beautiful book about a curmudgeon and his outgoing neighbors. -D.G.\n\n85. “Normal People” and “Conversations With Friends” by Sally Rooney: After binge-watching and falling in love with Hulu's “Normal People,” I went back to read the source material. I didn’t think I could love it more than the series, but I did. That prompted me to read Rooney’s earlier hit, “Friends,” which Hulu is also developing into a series. Book or series, Rooney’s meditations on the messiness of love will hook you. -A.M.\n\n86. “Red, White and Royal Blue” by Casey McQuiston: The queer romantic comedy novel I wish I had as a kid. The president’s son and the Queen of England’s grandson falling (literally) into a forbidden romance? Don’t walk – run – to read this. Surprisingly steamy to boot. -D.O.\n\n87. “The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company” by Robert Iger: I’m a Disney junkie, so I jump at the chance to learn about anything behind the scenes from the House of Mouse. In addition to providing an interesting look into Disney’s relationship with Pixar, Marvel and more, it has some great insight about how one of the world’s most recognizable CEOs got to where he is today. -H.Y.\n\n88. Ruth Ware’s books: Ware is the contemporary queen of the psychological crime thriller. Here’s my ranking of the books from best to great: “The Death of Mrs. Westaway,” “The Lying Game,” “The Turn of the Key,” “The Woman in Cabin 10,” “In a Dark, Dark Wood.” -A.M.\n\n89. “So You Want to Talk About Race” byIjeoma Oluo: Oluo’s book was written for many types of people, including white people working toward becoming effective allies. For that group, I can say that it’s an educational gift. -C.M.\n\n90. “War and Peace” by Leo Tolstoy: OK, so I still have 300 pages left, but I’m in the home stretch of this massive Russian tome. I plucked my dusty, unread copy off the shelf back in March, so when people asked what I did during the great plague of 2020, I could say I read “War and Peace.” -B.V.\n\nMusic\n\n91. “Chromatica” by Lady Gaga: This high-energy pop album was probably meant to be blasted at crowded clubs rather than in my living room with just me and my dog, but I’ll take my dance parties where I can get them. -C.T.\n\n92. “Dear Evan Hansen Original Broadway Cast Recording”: The soft pop score of this Tony-winning musical, with vocals from the great Ben Platt, helped get me into a work-from-home groove, unseating other Broadway cast albums in my recently played feed on Spotify. -K.L.\n\n93. “Fetch the Bolt Cutters” by Fiona Apple: Apple couldn’t have known the world she’d be releasing her fifth album into when she recorded it, but this primal scream of righteous anger is exactly what these plague times call for. “Kick me under the table all you want/ I won't shut up” is my new life motto. -B.V.\n\n94. “Hamilton Original Broadway Cast Recording”: What’d I miss? Five years of listening to this infectious blend of rap, R&B, jazz and good ol’ musical-theater standards, that's what. Spotify may think I have a problem. -B.T.\n\n95. “Let’s Dance” (2018 remastered) by David Bowie: I’ve head-bobbed my way through the opening hook of “Modern Love” about a hundred times since quarantine started, and it’s not getting old. When this classic Bowie album was released in 1983, we used to have family dance parties around the record player in our living room. Now I’m streaming it as I do burpees and push-ups inside my condo. It’s still perfect. -A.M.\n\n96. “RTJ4” by Run the Jewels: Rap duo Killer Mike and El-P wrote most of this album in 2019, well before the racial reckoning currently cascading across the U.S., but the lyrics are eerily prescient. Listening now is a powerful call to action, a message of urgency to fix so much that is broken. You’ll be singing earworm “Ooh la la” for days. -A.M.\n\nPodcasts\n\n97. \"Armchair Expert\": The weekly podcast by actor Dax Shepard and co-host Monica Padman isn’t exactly an escape from reality, but their conversations with celebrities, journalists and academics about deep things like addiction, racism and yes, even the coronavirus pandemic, are sure to stretch your mental muscles. And there’s no better time than now to try to improve upon ourselves. -A.H.\n\n98. “The Happiness Lab”: The show from Laurie Santos, the professor behind the super-popular Yale course about “the science of well-being,” is the soundtrack for my outdoor walks because it has a winning podcast combination: fascinating stories, science and self-help. -C.M.\n\n99. “The Office Ladies”: To keep myself from re-watching “The Office” for the billionth time, I instead turned to a weekly recap podcast that goes episode by episode, hosted by actresses Jenna Fischer (who played Pam Beesly) and Angela Kinsey (Angela Martin) with occasional cameos from the rest of the cast. -H.Y.\n\n100. “This Is Love”: The latest season of this audio series about romance and connection (which I listen to while I fold my laundry) is all about animals. Of course, I tear up over the episodes of a heroic guide dog and the goose with a human BFF. I tend to immediately retell the \"Love” stories to my loved ones. -C.M.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2021/04/01/science-museum-oklahoma-planning-blockbuster-summer-exhibits-sherlock-holmes-worst-case-scenario/7057548002/", "title": "Science Museum Oklahoma plans Sherlock Holmes and survival ...", "text": "From solving mysteries in Sherlock Holmes to escaping from quicksand, Science Museum Oklahoma is planning to immerse its visitors in not one but two marquee traveling exhibitions this summer.\n\n\"Sherlock Holmes: The Exhibition\" and \"The Worst-Case Scenario: An Ultimate Survival Experience\" will open May 1 and continue through Sept. 6 at the Oklahoma City landmark.\n\n\"I'm calling it a historic opportunity — and it really is,\" said Linda Maisch, the museum's vice president of organizational development and community engagement. \"We've never brought in two major travelers like this before.\"\n\nAfter struggling to cope with COVID-19 over the past year, the museum's staff was able to turn the pandemic to its advantage to land the summer exhibits.\n\n\"We have an incredibly talented staff and a large building, and these traveling exhibit groups were struggling trying to find placement for their exhibits during times when many museums are closed. So, they reached out to us and said, 'Hey, would you be interested in hosting this exhibition when the time is right, but you would have to take delivery of it right now?'\" said Science Museum Oklahoma President Sherry Marshall.\n\n\"We kind of pooled our collective talents and found space, so we were able to store the exhibits for several months before thinking about opening them. So, that helped out the exhibit companies because they're not having to pay for storage.\n\n\"And it helps us because we're able to get not one but two crazy, amazing exhibits that we would not normally have the resources to obtain. ... Either one of these would be considered a traveling blockbuster and have been featured in other museums throughout the nation as such, as their summer blockbuster exhibitions.\"\n\nWhere will the exhibits be?\n\nAn encompassing interactive experience based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic fictional detective, \"Sherlock Holmes: The Exhibition\" will be located on the more than 390,000-square-foot museum's second floor.\n\nAdapted from the popular book series, \"The Worst-Case Scenario: An Ultimate Survival Experience\" also will be upstairs in the space normally occupied by the permanent exhibit \"Mind Games.\"\n\n\"We were able to rearrange. We didn't lose anything off the floor; everything's still here. But our staff was able to unload 18 semi-truck trailers full of exhibit content and find a place to store it,\" Marshall said.\n\nThe museum will bring the energy of the two special exhibits to the whole building, Maisch said.\n\n\"We are creating immersive environments for both of these exhibits — and that starts outside the exhibit. All of the staff they encounter are going to be fully costumed and in character for both exhibits. So, that experience starts at the door,\" she said.\n\n\"When we talked to the national reps for these exhibits, they thought that was so groundbreaking in our approach to these exhibits that they haven't seen anywhere else — and 'Sherlock' has toured internationally. They've never seen a museum that has turned their staff into characters. And that's what we're doing ... to bring those experiences alive for our guests and make them meaningful and fun and fully engaging.\"\n\nWhat's in the exhibits?\n\nAlthough each exhibit has a different vibe, Marshall said both offer interactive experiences that support the museum's mission of revealing the wonder and relevance of science.\n\n\"'Sherlock Holmes' is an incredibly immersive and thoughtful environment. You're definitely seeing the influence of the Conan Doyle estate with this partnership ... because you walk in and you're transported to Baker Street, you go into the office, you're doing these experiments, basically, the exact same way Sherlock Holmes would. ... The activities are incredibly engaging, incredibly hands-on,\" Marshall said.\n\n\"You see that engagement in 'Worst-Case Scenario,' but it's a little more active approach. It's more colorful, it's bright, it's very energetic. You're guided through this exhibit, with basically your '80s gym coach, working with you and supporting you through all these experiences.\"\n\n\"Sherlock Holmes: The Exhibition\" pays homage to the legendary character's continued influence on the sciences, literature and popular culture, including in Guy Ritchie's movies starring Robert Downey Jr. and in the recent television series \"Sherlock\" on the BBC and \"Elementary\" on CBS.\n\n\"There's a gallery section that includes artifacts and really neat manuscripts and props from the current Sherlock Holmes movies and the Conan Doyle estate. ... So, the history buffs are going to love this as well, because they're going to get to see some of these artifacts that come from the estate. It's a little bit of history, it's going to have the movie props. If they're a fan of the current movies, they're going to see something for them in there: We're getting the getting the car from 'Game of Shadows,'\" Maisch said.\n\n\"The whole concept is kind of looking at Sherlock Holmes through a lot of different lenses ... What those books talked about, what Conan Doyle talked about during that time period, that science from back then, it's still relevant. It's the fundamentals of forensic science that we're using today: There's blood splatter patterns, there's footprint analysis. ... That's what the guests are going to do: they're going solve a mystery by using all of those techniques. And we're not gonna give them the answer, by the way, they've got to solve it.\"\n\nAlthough the activities are recommended for visitors 7 and older, Maisch said the visual nature of the exhibit will give it all-ages appeal.\n\nAlso intended for all ages, the tongue-in-cheek \"The Worst-Case Scenario\" will challenge visitors to escape quicksand, land a plane and outsmart a mountain lion.\n\n\"These are real-life scenarios — though unlikely — and how would you deal with it? And it's using science, it's using critical thinking, it's using logic, engineering. From knowing how to defuse a bomb or how to jump off a moving train — my favorite is lock-picking — it's true worst-case scenarios,\" Marshall said.\n\n\"It's not part of our model to bring in these traveling exhibitions, because we think that Oklahoma deserves quality all the time, not just every now and then. So, we invest in experiences that they can access at any time of the year. But if we find an opportunity to bring in exhibitions of this caliber that we can keep at a reasonable price for our community, we'll take advantage of it.\"\n\nWhat will the exhibits cost?\n\nIt's unlikely that visitors would see two traveling exhibits of this size on display at the same time at any other science center in the country, Marshall said.\n\n\"Sometimes you'll see it in places like Vegas where a mall or an empty building will open these two exhibitions, but they make the price point so high. You're looking at an entry ticket price for both of these combined around $50 a person elsewhere. We're not going to charge that,\" Marshall said.\n\nScience Museum Oklahoma will offer both special exhibitions for one premium ticket. Tickets are $9.95 for adults and $7.95 for children and seniors plus general admission.\n\nGeneral admission to the nonprofit is $16.95 for adults and $13.95 for children and seniors.\n\nMuseum members will receive a $2 discount on their premium tickets for the traveling exhibits.\n\n\"That's always important to us is that we keep those tickets affordable — and we negotiated hard to get that,\" Maisch said. \"One of the reasons that we like this combination of exhibits is that (with) one ticket, you're going to be able to have a really great experience, no matter what your interests are, or what your ages are. Because there is literally something for everybody between these two exhibitions.\"\n\nAfter struggling with COVID-19 over the past year, Marshall said museum staffers are looking forward to an exciting summer with the special exhibits.\n\n\"Last year was rough financially for a hands-on, interactive museum during a pandemic. It is challenging. So while we are looking at strategies to forge a successful path ahead, this is one way to sort of celebrate where our state is in getting our vaccinations and getting back to what our new normal is going to be,\" she said.\n\n\"It will benefit us in the long run, but it's also kind of like a big celebration of our grit and our determination and, even though it's not over, the progress that we are making.\"\n\nCOMING SOON\n\n'Sherlock Holmes: The Exhibition' and 'The Worst Case Scenario: An Ultimate Survival Experience'\n\nWhen: May 1-Sept. 6.\n\nWhere: Science Museum Oklahoma, 2020 Remington Place.\n\nInformation: www.sciencemuseumok.org.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/11/high-line-milestones-iowas-big-stink-muscle-beach-makeover-news-around-states/39566201/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Researchers are in the midst of recording the city’s civil rights history in a new way. Three archaeologists and an architect are wearing yellow vests and carrying iPads, snapping pictures and recording information about every structure built before 1969. Those actions are part of a two-week effort, during which Paleowest Archaeology will visit 2,500 structures in west Montgomery neighborhoods to identify culturally significant buildings, histories and landmarks related to the struggle for civil rights. Once the data is compiled, a historian and researcher will comb through the information to provide a complete history of the culturally significant neighborhoods. “Montgomery has a rich civil rights history,” said Robert Smith, planning director for the city and the mastermind behind the project. “The city does not have a comprehensive document of that civil rights history.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A state labor department report says recent job gains after three years of losses could signal the end of the state’s recession.

The Anchorage Daily News reports the department revises job numbers after releasing initial estimates. While the growth was small, department economist Karinne Wiebold says it strengthens the case that the economy is recovering. The numbers remain subject to change, and Wiebold says it’s too early to say the downturn is truly over. The recession, which began in 2015, is the longest Alaska has seen, though it wasn’t on the level of an economic crash that occurred in the 1980s.\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: Dozens of Asian-owned businesses have set up shop in western Mesa, with two large supermarkets serving as anchors for development that includes restaurants and other businesses. The commerce cluster is aided by proximity to Mesa Community College and the presence of Arizona State University’s main campus in neighboring Tempe. With the closing of the Chinese Cultural Center in Phoenix last year, many see the Asian business district in Mesa as a natural successor to become a hub for Asian-Americans in metro Phoenix. Property manager Steven Diep says when Mekong Plaza opened in 2008, fewer than 10 Asian-owned businesses were open in the area. Now, Mekong is at full occupancy with 28 tenants and has spurred development in the rest of the Asian business district in Mesa.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Hemp and CBD producers are hopeful about the future of the industry in the state. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that CBD has been extracted from Arkansas’ first legal hemp harvest. CBD is a chemical compound derived from cannabis plants, and users say it can ease pain, anxiety, epilepsy, nausea and hangovers. It doesn’t cause a high and is often sold as a dietary supplement. Hemp also belongs to the cannabis family and can be used in products including rope and paper. Congress legalized industrial hemp in December. Industry experts expect the CBD market in Arkansas to explode over the next five years. Some farmers hope they’ve found their newest cash crop. The Food and Drug Administration is assessing how it should regulate CBD, which is largely unregulated by the state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Clarita: A fast-moving brush fire erupted near a huge amusement and water park Sunday, sending hundreds of visitors to the exit to escape clouds of smoke and ash before fire officials asked them to stay put while they worked to contain the blaze. Six Flags Magic Mountain and Hurricane Harbor announced the evacuation shortly after noon, citing concern for the safety of park visitors and employees. About a half-hour later, the park said on its Twitter account that fire officials asked guests to shelter in place due to nearby road closures. Park visitors were asked to move to the back of the 260-acre property, away from firefighting activity near the entrance, said Rachel Gallat, who was visiting a friend who works at the park. “I was getting iced coffee and when I walked outside, ash was raining down on me,” she said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A ski resort trade association expects visits to the state’s ski resorts to be up 13% from last year following a snowy winter and spring that extended the ski season. The Denver Post reports Colorado Ski Country USA released its projections Thursday, showing a nearly 12% increase in visits from the five-year average. The group that represents 23 resorts expects the season to end with 13.8 million skier days, which measures people participating in skiing or snowboarding for any part of one day at a resort. The Rocky Mountain region is projected to end the season with 24 million skier days. The region includes Utah, New Mexico, Wyoming and Montana.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMiddletown: Wesleyan University’s Center for the Arts has received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to support residency activities of the dancer Netta Yerushalmy. The $15,000 Art Works grant also will support a performance by Yerushalmy on Oct. 4 in the Center for the Arts Theater. Center for the Arts director Sarah Curran said support from the NEA is central to its ability to bring contemporary dance to audiences that might not otherwise be able to see it. Yerushalmy grew up in Israel and has been based in New York since attending college there.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Parts of a neighborhood damaged in the 1968 riots ignited by Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination are set to be redeveloped after many years of empty restoration promises. The 36-block West Center City neighborhood never rebounded from the riot and an ensuing nine-month occupation by the National Guard. It has struggled with vacant homes and gun crimes ever since. For decades, city officials promised restoration and development initiatives that didn’t happen. Now state grants to demolish and rebuild several properties have been awarded, and the Wilmington Housing Authority also plans to renovate and sell about 20 properties. A demolition and rebuilding project by the nonprofit Wilmington Land Bank started last week and is set to be completed by March.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Logan Circle in northwest D.C. has been named one of the nation’s 28 friendliest neighborhoods, WUSA-TV reports. The National Geographic Traveler magazine list is based on user-generated data such as walkability, home affordability, and social surroundings such as the number of nearby restaurants, breweries and cafes. National Geographic Traveler also used perception data from TripAdvisor and Yelp to create the unranked list of the United States’ most open-minded and open-hearted neighborhoods. Logan Circle made the list for its design-centric shops and dozens of restaurants in early 20th-century and contemporary buildings. The list features Colada Shop for its rooftop Cuban cocktails and empanadas, as well as Miss Pixie’s Furnishings & Whatnot for unique finds like old postcards and 1960s lamps.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: A famous part of South Beach is getting a makeover. City of Miami Beach officials unveiled tons of new equipment Sunday for the popular outdoor workout area along A1A, known as Muscle Beach. Locals and tourists frequent the area, which includes equipment for push-ups and pull-ups. Muscle Beach is free and open to the public. But the area was lacking in strength training equipment. The city added a multi-modality training center for up to 80 people including 18 pull-up stations, a rope climb tower and five squat stations. There are also medicine balls, kettle bells, bumper plates and battle ropes.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: The Richmond County Coroner’s Office has made progress in matching the military grave markers that were discovered at an old funeral home. Coroner Mark Bowen says the majority are for veterans who have been buried locally. The National Cemetery Administration, the Richmond County Vital Records Office and Richmond County Cemetery Services are also assisting in finding the graves of the veterans whose names are inscribed on the markers. About 125 bronze and marble markers were found. They date back to the late 1960s. The Augusta Chronicle reports that a deputy had discovered the markers in packages under old blankets and trash in the home’s garage. The deputy was assisting a land official who was preparing to show the property to Atlanta investors when the grave markers were discovered.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The head of Honolulu’s planned rail line has submitted a revised recovery plan for the $9.2 billion project. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation CEO Andrew Robbins hand-delivered the plan to federal officials in San Francisco on Friday. The Federal Transit Administration has been withholding about $744 million in promised funding until it approves an updated recovery plan. The agency demanded that the city submit a recovery plan when the project’s price tag jumped from $5.3 billion. The City Council approved the plan by an 8-1 vote on Wednesday. The 20-mile-long rail line is due to connect Honolulu’s western suburbs to the airport, downtown and the Ala Moana Center, Oahu’s biggest mall.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal authorities are taking public comments on a plan to conduct an extensive environmental study involving killing wolves and other predators in the state that attack livestock, deer and elk. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that it will take comments through July 10 on a planned environmental impact statement. A federal judge ordered the study last year after ruling the Agriculture Department’s Wildlife Services violated environmental laws by not providing the justification to support its decision to expand killing mountain lions, coyotes, bears and other predators in Idaho. The new environmental impact statement will replace the agency’s 2016 Idaho environmental assessment involving those predators, as well as its 2011 wolf environmental assessment that guides its wolf-killing decisions in the state.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Dispensaries in the state are staffing up and remodeling in preparation for the legalization of recreational marijuana. The General Assembly approved the marijuana legislation last month, and it now awaits a signature from Gov. J.B. Pritzker. He plans to sign it, making Illinois the 11th state, along with the District of Columbia, to permit recreational use. Under the new law, adults could buy and possess up to an ounce of marijuana for personal use. The measure would let the state’s 55 medical marijuana dispensaries submit applications to set up two more dispensaries to sell marijuana for recreational use. Companies already in the medical marijuana market said expansion to meet recreational needs could result in a hiring boom. If approved, sales would start Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The fifth annual Chreece hip-hop festival will bring Talib Kweli to the city. Kweli, a rapper known for eight solo albums as well as collaborations with Mos Def, Kanye West and Hi-Tek, headlines a 70-act lineup announced Monday. Chreece is slated for Aug. 24 at multiple Fountain Square venues. Kweli, who made landmark 1998 album “Black Star” with Mos Def, is one of multiple national acts on the festival’s roster. Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine and Benny the Butcher will share the stage, representing Griselda Records. Houston rapper Fat Tony will promote his 2018 album “10,000 Hours.” The Chreece roster includes high-profile Indiana acts Flaco, Drayco McCoy, Trajik, Sirius Blvck & John Stamps, Clint Breeze & the Groove, Mathaius Young and Parris LaDame.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: It’s a stinky distinction, but the state leads the nation when it comes to the amount of poop its people and livestock generate, research from a University of Iowa scientist shows. Christopher Jones, a UI research engineer, calculated Iowa’s population would be the equivalent of 168 million people, based on the waste from the state’s 3.2 million people and nearly 110 million chickens, pigs, turkeys and cattle. It’s about as many people as in Bangladesh, a country in south Asia. Factor in land size, and Iowa ranks first in the nation for waste creation, Jones writes in a blog he’s titled “50 Shades of Brown.” “Just to ensure clarity, in Iowa, we are generating as much fecal waste in every square mile as 2,979 people,” he says. “For reference, Iowa City is the second-most densely populated city in Iowa and has 2,775 people per square mile. So imagine an Iowa-sized Iowa City.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: May was the wettest month in state history. The Kansas State University Weather Data Library says average rainfall in May was 10.26 inches, the wettest month on records going back 125 years. The Kansas News Service reports the deluge broke the previous record set in June 1951. In addition, 19 weather stations recorded monthly totals of more than 20 inches. The rainfall was uneven but followed typical patterns of being drier in the west and wetter in the east. Southeast Kansas stations averaged 17 inches in May, while west central Kansas stations averaged only 5.31 inches, which is still 175% of normal rainfall for the region in May. The amount of water moving through the state was the highest the U.S. Geological Survey’s Kansas Water Science Center has ever seen.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: An analysis of traffic stop data has found African Americans in the city are disproportionately stopped and are three times more likely to be searched than white drivers. Of 130,999 stops between 2016 and 2018, African Americans accounted for 33% of the stops, although they make up only about 20% of Louisville’s driving-age population. Of 8,942 searches, 57% involved African Americans. That’s despite a much higher incidence of contraband found with white drivers. According to the analysis, police found contraband in 72% of the searches of whites versus only 41% for African Americans. Speaking before the Metro Council Public Safety Committee on Wednesday, Police Chief Steve Conrad outlined changes in which stops will no longer be “a matter of routine.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nSt. Joseph: New cabins are open at Lake Bruin State Park. The Louisiana Office of State Parks opened the accommodations at the site in St. Joseph on Friday. The park is in the Mississippi River delta, in the state’s southeast. Two standard cabins and one deluxe cabin are available for reservations. The one-bedroom cabins sleep up to four people and have a barbecue pit, fire ring and picnic table. They rent for $85 a night Sunday through Thursday and $95 a night on Friday and Saturday. The three-bedroom deluxe cabin sleeps up to eight people and has a two-car carport and two dedicated boat slips. It rents for $150 per night Sunday through Thursday and $175 per night on Friday and Saturday.\n\nMaine\n\nSkowhegan: Apparently hungry and thirsty vandals have trashed a fairgrounds booth, stealing 120 whoopie pies and drinking half a gallon of iced tea. John Youney, a director of the Skowhegan Lions Club, tells the Morning Sentinel that a refrigerator full of cookies was also emptied and that plastic gloves and silverware littered the floor. Youney says there’s about $1,000 worth of damage or stolen goods. The group discovered the break-in at its Skowhegan fairground booth Sunday morning and believes it occurred overnight Saturday. Youney says whoever is involved can confess and work off their crime by assisting the club with its volunteer work. A police officer said he could not comment on the investigation.\n\nMaryland\n\nBurkittsville: A video game inspired by the Maryland-based horror film “The Blair Witch Project” is expected to come to PCs and Xboxes in August. The Baltimore Sun reports the game was announced Sunday at a video game conference in Los Angeles. The game will draw on events from the 1999 film, with a release date of Aug. 30. The movie was shot in locations in Maryland, including the town of Burkittsville. The film follows a group of college students as they create a documentary in the Maryland woods about the legend of the Blair Witch. The low-budget film earned a reputation as a cult classic that popularized the “found footage” horror genre. According to the trailer, the game follows a detective’s search for a missing person amid supernatural occurrences.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNantucket: The town is taking a literary twist this week. The eighth annual Nantucket Book Festival opens Thursday and runs through June 16. It features more than 30 local authors, including Nantucket native and bestselling writer Nathaniel Philbrick. Philbrick will discuss the third book in his Revolutionary War series, “In the Hurricane’s Eye: The Genius of George Washington and the Victory at Yorktown.” Other participating award-winners include “Washington Black” writer Esi Edugyan, “The Library Book” author Susan Orlean, and Dave Cullen, who’s authored books about the Columbine and Parkland school shootings. The festival is operated by the Nantucket Book Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded to celebrate and promote the joys and rewards of reading, writing and literacy.\n\nMichigan\n\nHolland: Families can follow the yellow brick road as a project brings “The Wizard of Oz” to a local park. The Holland Sentinel reports that yellow bricks have been laid in Centennial Park as part of the Holland Oz Project. It’ll direct visitors to a living mosaic book that’s been constructed out of plants and flowers in a tribute to the L. Frank Baum novel and classic 1939 film. The outdoor exhibit in western Michigan will also include life-sized bronze sculptures of characters that Dorothy met along her journey through the whimsical world of Oz. The sculptures will be installed in August. The city has collaborated with the Holland Area Convention and Visitors Bureau, Holland in Bloom and the Herrick District Library to bring the project to life.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinnetonka: A local dog rescue organization says it’s saving the lives of golden retrievers by flying them to the U.S. from China, where they’re used in the dog meat trade. KARE-TV reports that Retrieve a Golden of the Midwest says its volunteers in China take in dogs that have been rescued from butchers and slaughterhouses. The Minnetonka-based group says its Chinese shelters can house hundreds of rescued dogs at a time. Humane Society International estimates that 10 million dogs are consumed each year in China. RAGOM board member Nicole Stundzia says a volunteer family recently traveled to the country to bring five golden retrievers to the U.S. Stundzia says volunteers are limited in the number of dogs they can travel with. The group says such rescues are challenging and costly.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state Supreme Court has changed the rules to say a person seeking to become a lawyer has to pass the bar exam within three attempts or will have to go back to law school for at least 12 semester hours before they can retake it. The rule change comes after the annual passage rate on the Mississippi Bar exam has dropped from 79% in 2014 to 48% last year. The rule change says an applicant has to successfully complete 12 additional semester hours of law school courses at an American Bar Association accredited law school on subjects covered by or skills necessary to pass the bar exam. After going back to law school and successfully completing the 12 hours or additional course work, an applicant will be permitted to take the bar exam one additional time, the state Supreme Court order says.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Area attorneys whose underwire bras had been setting off jail metal detectors can now see their clients without removing their lingerie for screening, but only if they agree to talk to their clients by phones separated by glass. KCUR-FM reports that the new protocol was announced Thursday, the same day nearly 100 defense attorneys signed an open letter complaining that the restrictions were making it difficult to represent inmates. Jackson County Department of Corrections Director Diana Turner described the option of allowing attorneys to have non-contact visits without clearing metal detectors as a “happy medium.” But it didn’t sit well with attorney Denise Kirby, who signed the open letter. She says the compromise shows a lack of understanding about what it takes to defend an inmate.\n\nMontana\n\nStevensville: Trumpeter swans have built a nest in a wildlife refuge that biologists hope will lead to the first offspring documented in the Bitterroot Valley following restoration efforts. The Ravalli Republic reports the large waterfowl couple constructed the nest on top of a muskrat lodge on a remote pond at the Lee Metcalf National Wildlife Refuge. Refuge project leader Tom Reed says he discovered the nest in recent weeks. Reintroduction efforts began decades ago after the swan population was decimated by hunters and feather collectors. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes wildlife director Dale Becker says 60 trumpeter young were recorded from about 18 nests in Montana last year. He says the young usually appear right after Memorial Day, but this year they’re a bit late.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Health officials in the eastern part of the state are taking steps to control mosquito populations that carry West Nile and other diseases as a wet spring has led to more breeding grounds for the biting insects. The Douglas County Health Department says it’s using mosquito larvicide in potential breeding sites or stagnant waterways to help curb the spread of West Nile virus. The department is also trapping mosquitoes every other week. Trapped mosquitoes are counted and tested for Zika, West Nile virus and chikungunya at the state public health lab. The department also has begun collecting dead birds – including crows, black-billed magpies and blue jays – to test them for West Nile virus. Nebraska reported a nation-high 245 West Nile cases in humans last year, including 11 deaths.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Lawmakers have agreed to let voters decide next year whether to amend the state Constitution to recognize same-sex marriages, add a voters’ bill of rights and overhaul the state board of pardons. The measures are among a handful of proposed changes to Nevada’s Constitution that lawmakers took on during their legislative session this year. As in most states, it isn’t easy to amend Nevada’s Constitution. Changes can either come from a citizen-driven ballot initiative, which would need to be approved by voters twice, or from the Legislature. Any proposal from lawmakers to amend the Constitution must be approved by the Legislature two sessions in a row and then approved by voters on the ballot. The state Constitution currently includes an unenforceable ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state would join more than a dozen counterparts requiring insurance coverage of fertility treatments under a bill that passed the House. Supporters of the bill said the requirement would help the state attract young families as its population ages. They said they heard from many couples who said they work in Massachusetts in order to obtain coverage. Opponents said they were concerned about the impact such a mandate would have on insurance premiums for small businesses. The House passed the bill and sent it back to the Senate, which previously passed a different version.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: “Seinfeld” star Jason Alexander, rock band The Smithereens, rocker Southside Johnny Lyon, New York Giants Harry Carson and Bart Oates, and legendary basketball player and coach Anne Donovan are among this year’s inductees to the New Jersey Hall of Fame. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the winners of the Hall’s 11th class Monday at a ceremony at Newark Liberty International Airport. They include “Jaws” author Peter Benchley of Pennington, longtime Star-Ledger sport columnist Jerry Izenberg of Neptune and “Game of Thrones” author George R. R. Martin of Bayonne. Other winners include Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez of Old Bridge, Hoboken teachers activist Elizabeth Allen, and Newark cardiac surgeon Victor Parsonnet. The induction ceremony will be held Oct. 27 in Asbury Park.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest city is the latest to embark on upgrades to its portion of the historic Route 66 Highway. Officials in Albuquerque want to see improvements to a barren stretch of Route 66 in an area that some complain is a forgotten part of the city, KRQE-TV reports. City officials are eyeing a $2.3 million plan that would add medians, landscaping and lighting along the Mother Road west of downtown. Currently, there are no sidewalks, landscaping or bike lanes and very few streetlights. Albuquerque has the largest part of Route 66 in an urban area. The move comes as an endangered federal program that has helped preserve the historic Route 66 Highway for two decades is set to end, and federal legislation to designate Route 66 as a National Historic Trail remains stalled in Congress.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The creators of the High Line park turned a disused rail line into an urban oasis, art showcase and tourism magnet that welcomes 8 million visitors a year. The park is now marking two milestones. Its final section opened Wednesday, days before the 10th anniversary Sunday of the opening of the first section on June 9, 2009. The elevated rail line was built in the 1930s to raise freight trains above street level. Efforts to preserve the line started in the 1980s, after the trains stopped running. The blocks surrounding the High Line then were largely undeveloped and considered dangerous by some. Anthony Annaruma remembers the area when it was frequented by sex workers. Now, he’s working on a new building where apartments will sell for millions of dollars.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nBrevard: The General Assembly is looking to impose stricter guidelines on zip lines and high ropes courses after some deaths in the state. A bill before the North Carolina Senate seeks greater oversight of the “aerial adventure course” industry, just in time for summer camp season. But some camp owners say they feel the law could increase expenses and paperwork and force some operations to close altogether. Some course owners also questioned whether safety would improve. The bill is known as Sanders’ Law, named for 12-year-old Sanders Burney, who died in 2015 when her harness snapped during a zip line accident at a YMCA camp.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nNew Salem: A mud run is expected to draw hundreds of people for good, dirty fun in western North Dakota. Medieval Rush will be held Saturday in New Salem. It’s billed as the longest mud run in North Dakota, at 3.2 miles. The event has a medieval theme and runs rain or shine. Gates open under the big cow statue “Salem Sue” at 9 a.m. Opening ceremonies are set for at 11 a.m. This year’s event also will add a medieval dirt bike race through the mud. Participants must be at least 14 years old. The Bismarck Tribune reports about 700 people take part each year.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A new interactive exhibit at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is set to open next month. Cleveland.com reports that the “Interactive Garage” exhibit opening July 1 will enable visitors to play instruments on their own or with friends or strangers at the museum. Visitors can get help with instruments from trained professionals on site. Rock Hall president and CEO Greg Harris said earlier this year that the museum has been working to create a more immersive, hands-on experience for visitors. The exhibit opens July 1 and will take up the entire second floor of the museum. It will include keyboards, mixing boards, guitars, drums, studio space and a lounge for playing acoustic instruments.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Researchers at the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University are jointly developing drone technology to more accurately forecast the weather. The Journal Record reports that OU School of Meteorology professor Phil Chilson says he launched the project in 2008, and it received a boost of National Science Foundation funding in 2015. Chilson said a “long-recognized lack of observation” in the bottom 2 miles of the atmosphere hinders storm forecasting. OSU is building the drones, and OU is focusing on the meteorology portion, which includes what type of information and equipment is required for the unmanned aircraft. Both schools are working through regulatory concerns with the Federal Aviation Administration. OSU professor Jamey Jacob says the development of drones for more accurate storm prediction will cause a “paradigm shift.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Two protesters have been sentenced to five days in jail for throwing horse lubricant mixed with gold glitter on two police officers at a protest. The Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office says the defendants were protesting against a rally organized by a right-wing group called Patriot Prayer when the officers asked to see what was in two 4-gallon buckets they were carrying. Prosecutors say Robert Majure and Tristan Romine-Mann instead sprayed the slimy liquid on the officers and ran. Prosecutors say the two attempted to “fist bump” in celebration after they were arrested and cuffed in a patrol car. A jury convicted them of harassment and acquitted them of a charge of disorderly conduct.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDeer Lake: The rustic training camp where Muhammad Ali prepared for some of his most famous fights has undergone an elaborate restoration and opened to the public Saturday as a shrine to the heavyweight icon’s life and career. The famed Deer Lake camp was in disrepair when California real estate investor Mike Madden, son of retired broadcaster and NFL Hall of Fame coach John Madden, bought it shortly after Ali died in June 2016 at age 74. Ali bought the wooded, out-of-the-way property about 90 miles from Philadelphia in 1972 and installed 18 primarily log buildings, including a gym, dining hall, small mosque, visitors’ cabins and a horse barn. It was at Deer Lake where Ali prepared for his epic bouts against George Foreman and Joe Frazier, attracting crowds who watched him work. He trained at the camp until his last fight in 1981.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Community College of Rhode Island is using a sensory tool to help the public understand what it’s like to live with dementia. CCRI bought an instructional program known as the Virtual Dementia Tour with help from the state. For the first time, it’s offering free demonstrations to the public. The demonstrations will be held Tuesday at the Lincoln campus, June 18 at the Providence campus, June 21 at the Warwick campus and June 25 at the Newport campus. The demonstrations, facilitated by CCRI nursing staff, take about half an hour. Registration is required in advance. CCRI says it’s the only college in the state to offer this technology, and it’s trying to do more to help caregivers and health care professionals understand how to treat people with dementia.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state has passed a new law that bars protein grown in a laboratory via stem cells from being advertised as “meat.” Primary sponsor Republican Rep. Randy Ligon of Chester says he didn’t want people to confuse lab-grown protein with the real thing. The lawmaker and member of the South Carolina Cattlemen’s Association told The Post and Courier of Charleston he doesn’t want to stop research into the alternative food, but he does want to make sure consumers understand what they are getting. The bill passed both the House and Senate unanimously, and Gov. Henry McMaster signed it into law last month. Lab-grown meat hasn’t made it into stores yet, but federal agencies have announced how they will regulate the industry.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A Native American woman is bringing attention to the impact of methamphetamine addiction from within the South Dakota Women’s Prison. Heather Shooter, 37, started the support group Sober is Sacred to encourage other inmates to join the fight to demand more drug treatment services at the Pierre facility. Within the past year, the group has put on two anti-meth rallies at the women’s prison, where many inmates share stories about how the drug derailed their lives. About 64% of women in the prison are incarcerated on a primary drug charge, most of which involved meth. Shooter has been in prison since April 2017 for participating in a high-speed police chase with her 6-year-old in the car while high on meth. “That was my wake-up call,” she said. “This is my chance to change.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee Promise scholars can fulfill their community service requirement during a volunteer event in state parks this month. According to a news release, 54 of the state’s 56 parks will be offering a volunteer event. Most of those will take place Saturday, June 22. Work projects include landscaping, invasive plant removal, litter pickup and trail maintenance. Tennessee Promise provides scholarships for eligible students to attend state community and technical colleges for free. Students must complete eight hours of community service. The deadline to complete the service this year is July 1. Details of Tennessee Promise Saturday events are available on the state parks website.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The Houston Zoo’s new Texas Wetlands Exhibit showcases some whooping cranes that were relocated from Maryland after their federally funded habitat closed last year. The Houston Chronicle reports that the $20 million Texas complex, which opened in late May, is the first of four exhibits being built to mark the zoo’s 100th anniversary in 2022. The cranes are among three species featured in the exhibit. The other two are American alligators and bald eagles, and all three are native to Texas. At one time, all were nearing extinction. Zoo CEO Lee Ehmke says that the goal is to make the new exhibit engaging and genuine, for both visitors and animals. Whooping cranes have been listed as endangered since 1967.\n\nUtah\n\nMapleton: A woman in Utah County is celebrating 15 years rehabilitating wildlife in her backyard. The Daily Herald reports Patti Richards rescues hundreds of birds each year, including falcons, eagles, hawks and talking crows. Richards said she channeled her passion for birds and bears into starting the Great Basin Wildlife Rescue out of her home. The rescue has also taken in bobcats and foxes. Richards said the majority of the birds are released back into their natural habitat once they’ve recovered from their injury or illness, but some are relocated to zoos and animal facilities throughout the country. The rescue is also home to several education birds who work at schools, memorials and fundraisers. Richards said the rescue has received a lot of community support that has helped it continue to thrive.\n\nVermont\n\nWhite River Junction: The state attorney general’s office says a second forum for a hate-free Vermont is being held this week in White River Junction. The office says the event was organizated in conjunction with the Vermont NAACP, the Vermont Partnership for Fairness and Diversity, and others. Organizers say the purpose is to generate community conversation about bias incidents and hate crimes in Vermont. The moderator says the series “is intended to take the pulse of Vermonters’ experience of discrimination” and to bring together policymakers and community members to discuss the issues. Community members are encouraged to tell their stories. The event takes place Thursday from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Hartford High School.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: He was known as the man Norfolk never forgave. David Farragut, the U.S. Navy’s very first admiral and a major player in Union Navy operations during the Civil War, called Norfolk home before the war. But when Virginia seceded from the Union, his loyalty to the United States led him to flee north and continue to serve with the Union Navy – a “betrayal” that residents of this Southern city didn’t forget, The Virginian-Pilot reports. In 2016, more than 150 years after the war’s end, Norfolk named a quarter-acre pocket park in Freemason after Farragut. The park, essentially a small lawn and dog park, was dedicated in May. The park’s name stands out in Norfolk history and is perhaps indicative of a shifting attitude: Many public spaces and buildings in the city bear the names of Confederate military men. Farragut’s park is the first to recognize a Union officer.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: Skagit County officials estimate the growing elk population in the region is costing farmers $1.4 million a year. The Skagit Valley Herald reports that figure is slightly down from the $1.5 million estimate released in January. The new estimate by the Skagit County Assessor’s Office is based on 140 survey responses from farmers involved in a state program that offers tax benefits to keep farms in production. In survey responses, damage to fences and crops were listed as the top issues. Assessor Dave Thomas says the average for farms reporting elk damage was $13,000. Individual damages were as high was $150,000. Rural property owners have complained about damages as the North Cascades – or Nooksack – elk herd has grown in recent years.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMinden: Thirty years after residents marched to bring attention to the PCB contamination causing cancer in their community, members of Minden Community Action say more work must be done. The Register-Herald reports the group organized a Saturday march as a re-enactment of a 1989 march for the contaminated Fayette County community. The march aimed to draw attention to ongoing problems and also honor local residents who pushed the federal government to act. Minden was contaminated after workers at the now-defunct Shaffer’s Equipment Co. dumped the carcinogenic industrial chemical PCB around the town. There have been three cleanup efforts by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and none has fully removed the contamination.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State agriculture officials are concerned farmers will be tempted by quick access loans and credit cards as many take on more debt this year. Frank Friar, an economic development specialist for the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, tells Wisconsin Public Radio the state agency is worried farmers may turn to predatory lending agencies after years of low crop prices. The American Farm Bureau Federation warns that farm debt is at a record high, lending standards are tightening, and the cost of credit is rising. Katie Wantoch, an agriculture agent with the University of Wisconsin-Extension, says farmers in debt may also spend more on their credit cards, which will likely worsen their financial situation. Wantoch says there may be more fees they didn’t anticipate.\n\nWyoming\n\nPine Bluffs: Roman Catholics from the region have marked the 20th anniversary of a shrine featuring one of the largest concrete sculptures in the U.S. A 30-foot sculpture of the Virgin Mary stands at the center of the Our Lady of Peace Shrine outside Pine Bluffs in southeast Wyoming. It’s the largest sculpture in the state. Nearby at the shrine are 14 carvings representing the Stations of the Cross, a series of events in the life of Jesus. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports a Mass and devotional prayers took place at the shrine Saturday. Ted and Marjorie Trefren of Cheyenne built the shrine in 1999 after touring shrines in Europe.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/11"}]}

Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and called the funding announcement a \"historic moment that will serve as a foundation for a new industry.\"\n\nThe funding comes from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which authorized spending more than $4.5 billion for intercity passenger rail funding for lines outside the rail-rich Northeast Corridor.\n\nRosen, who led congressional efforts to fund the high-speed line through letters and press conferences, called the announcement a “game changer” for the state’s tourism economy.\n\nNew Brightline advertisements have been seen in Las Vegas, which includes fencing along its proposed Las Vegas station, located on Las Vegas Boulevard between Warm Springs and Blue Diamond roads.\n\nBrightline West’s 218-mile system will mostly run within the Interstate 15 right-of-way, with trains capable of 200 miles per hour.\n\nThe Rancho Cucamonga station will connect to Metrolink’s regional rail network, which includes stations in Los Angeles, Riverside, Orange, San Diego, and Ventura counties.\n\nNo date was announced for work to start. But Rosen said electric-powered trains could carry passengers when Los Angeles hosts the Summer Olympics in 2028.\n\n“We’re ready to get to work,” Wes Edens, founder and chairman of Florida-based Brightline, said in a statement ahead of a Friday event in Las Vegas that may coincide with a visit by President Joe Biden.\n\nRosen and U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, both Democrats, led a bipartisan group including all of Nevada’s elected federal lawmakers and four House members from California that in April urged Biden to commit up to $3.75 billion in federal infrastructure funds toward what they call a public-private partnership.\n\nPlanners say trains carrying passengers at nearly 200 mph (322 kph) could cut in half a four-hour freeway trip from a station in Las Vegas through Victorville, California, to a suburban Los Angeles light rail line in the San Bernardino County city of Rancho Cucamonga.\n\nThey say the service could help alleviate weekend or end-of-holiday travel traffic jams that often stretch for 15 miles on I-15 near the Nevada-California line.\n\n“Connecting Las Vegas and Southern California by high-speed rail will create tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs, boost our Southern Nevada tourism economy, and finally help us cut down on I-15 traffic,\" Cortez Masto said Tuesday in a statement.\n\n218 miles in two hours:High-speed rail between LA and Vegas can break ground by end of year, CEO says\n\nFinancial stops\n\nThe grant award brings hope to Brightline, who first eyed a groundbreaking for its West Coast line in 2020.\n\nEvery year since then, Brightline officials and those associated with the project have shared expectations of a groundbreaking by year’s end.\n\nBrightline was ready to move dirt in 2020 after receiving tax-exempt private activity bond allocations from California, Nevada, and the Department of Transportation that infused $4.2 billion into the project.\n\nHowever, the plan for bond sales was halted in early 2020 due to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and a lack of investor enthusiasm for the train’s original Southern California terminus in Apple Valley.\n\nDuring that year, Brightline announced that Fortress Investment Group, its parent company, had put the brakes on the $8 billion privately financed XpressWest project when it could not complete financing.\n\nIn April 2021, Brightline West CEO Mike Reininger predicted that construction of the line would start “in a matter of weeks” if there were no further delays to the project, according to Railway Journal.\n\nFlorida-based Brightline Holdings LLC, which built the only privately owned and operated intercity passenger railroad in the U.S., is expected to model the service line it began in 2014 on Florida's east coast.

On its worst days, even the 35-mile trek from Dallas to Fort Worth can take hours.\n\nSince December, it seems to become a greater reality for Texans.\n\nAs part of a nationwide high-speed rail initiative, President Joe Biden announced on Dec. 8 the allocation of $8.2 billion in new grants for these projects, including $500,000 toward Amtrak's high-speed railway in Texas.\n\nWhat is the high-speed railway project?\n\nHigh-speed railway transportation, also known as bullet trains, can travel at speeds of up to 200 mph.\n\nIn Texas, the initiative would connect the state's two largest cities, Dallas and Houston, shortening the travel time from hours to 90 minutes. Nearly 100,000 residents travel the 240-mile journey between the two cities each week — and some even more frequently, according to a 2012 study conducted by NYU's Rudin Center for Transportation.\n\nMore:Travis County Judge wants Austin included in planned Houston-Dallas bullet train project\n\nWith stations planned at The Cedars neighborhood near Downtown Dallas and the Northwest Mall site in Houston, the train would depart every 30 minutes during peak periods each day and hourly during off-peak periods, according to Texas Central, a Dallas-based company that devised the plan. The train would also make one stop along the route in Grimes County.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Congressman Seth Moulton, D-Mass, who served as the former managing director at Texas Central, emphasized the urgent need for the project as Texas' population grows.\n\n“If you don’t build high-speed rail between Dallas and Houston, then you only have two options,” Rep. Moulton said in the interview. “You can either expand the airport or expand the highway. It’s not going to decrease the travel time between those cities. It’s still going to take at least three hours to get between Dallas and Houston.”\n\nHow much will the Texas bullet train cost?\n\nAccording to an estimate from the Reason Foundation, the project is expected to cost at least $33.6 billion.\n\nWhy is the bullet train project controversial?\n\nStretching approximately 240 miles, the railway will go through private property.\n\nIn 2022, the Texas Supreme Court determined that Texas Central, a private entity, met the legal criteria to be classified as a public interurban electric railway company. As a result, the court granted the company the power of eminent domain, enabling it to proceed with construction on private land for the project.\n\nThese private properties include residences, in addition to farms and ranches.\n\nOne Dallas-based farmer told CNBC that he struggles to sleep at night worrying that the high-speed rail could pass through his property.\n\n“When I was notified by my nephew through an article about eminent domain, I was absolutely shocked,” Jody Berry said in the interview. “Finding out that the high-speed rail could potentially go through our property has made it very difficult for me to sleep.\"\n\nBerry's family has operated Morney-Berry Farms, which sits along the route, for several generations.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/albany/2019/12/26/ny-has-dreamed-high-speed-rail-why-cuomo-revisit-2020/2749110001/", "title": "NY has dreamed of high-speed rail.

Or fast rail service from Montreal to the city, or even from Albany to Penn Station — one of the busiest routes in the nation.\n\nAll of it has been talked about, proposed and even some funding secured for decades, but the plans have always ended up with various logistical hurdles and money woes.\n\nSo the trains still average a mere 51 mph across the Empire Corridor, which runs from Buffalo to New York City.\n\nOn Thursday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo pledged that 2020 would be different. It is time, he said, to revisit the decades-long dream of better connecting New York's cities through a high-speed rail system, which is commonplace in Europe and other parts of the world.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nCuomo vowed that in his State of the State address Jan. 8, he will announce a new panel of outside experts to reexamine why high-speed rail has repeatedly fallen off the tracks.\n\nHow can high-speed rail in New York be re-envisioned?\n\nHis panel of engineers will dust off the moribund studies, rethink how to create a high-speed rail system and create a plan that is faster, energy-efficient and more reliable than ones proposed in the past, the Democratic governor vowed.\n\n\"High-speed rail is transforming economies around the world,\" Cuomo said in a statement.\n\n\"We've been told that bringing this technology to our state is too expensive, too difficult and would take too long — that's not an acceptable attitude for New York.\"\n\nCuomo, entering his 10 year in office, has prided himself on trying to rebuild the state's infrastructure, whether it is the airports, the transit system or the $4 billion Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge in the Hudson Valley.\n\nMore:The new Mario M. Cuomo Bridge toll has been proposed. Here's what it would be.\n\nHe said the new focus on high-speed rail will take the same approach as the long-elusive goal of repairing the L Train Tunnel between Brooklyn to Manhattan that is now 6-months ahead of schedule and set to be finished in April.\n\n\"When we developed our plan to repair the L Train Tunnel, the team of experts we assembled questioned every assumption and brought new creativity to a seemingly intractable problem,\" Cuomo said.\n\n\"We not only found a way to repair the tunnel without shutting down service, we are doing it ahead of schedule. This kind of outside-the-box thinking will help us determine how we could deliver high-speed rail for New York.\"\n\nMore: High-speed rail service eyed for upstate\n\nWhat high-speed rail could do for New York's economy\n\nCuomo noted that most of the state's population lives a short distance from the Empire Corridor, which is the 463-mile stretch that runs north and south between Albany and New York City, and east and west between Albany and Niagara Falls.\n\nBut with slow trains and numerous stops, driving is still much quicker and less expensive — albeit less comfortable that a care-free train ride, state officials have long contended.\n\nEfforts for high-speed rail have long stalled, though, as costs became too prohibitive and the time it would take to build new rail lines became too daunting.\n\nIn fact, New York in 2012 auctioned off for $400,000 about 20 cars and locomotives it bought in the 1990s that were seen as the first step toward a system where trains could travel 125 mph between the cities.\n\nBut the system, among other issues, needs electrification, not turbine engines, and the trains were left to rot for a decade.\n\nCuomo came into office in 2011 with renewed hope for high-speed rail. New York in 2011 secured $354 million in federal funding as part of $8 billion for rail systems under American Recovery and Reinvestment Act approved by Congress and President Barack Obama.\n\nNew York even benefitted from additional money than initially expected after some states, including Florida, Wisconsin and Ohio, rejected Obama's money amid a political fight.\n\nWhile some states have backed off high-speed rail plans, California has been most ambitious.\n\nBut even it has had to scale back its dreams: Gov. Gavin Newsom abandoned plans last February for a rail line between Los Angeles and San Francisco as the cost ballooned to an untenable $77 billion.\n\nThe state is still moving ahead with the nation's first high-speed rail train in central California, but it is facing new obstacles after the Trump administration yanked $1 billion for the project in June.\n\nMore:Alstom, Amtrak ink deal\n\nWhat will happen next with high-speed rail in New York?\n\nIn New York, the state Department of Transportation and the Federal Railroad Administration in 2014 released a preliminary review of high-speed rail.\n\nThe agency proposed five different options that ranged from $290 million for basic upgrades to $14.71 billion that would add an entirely new 247-mile rail corridor connecting Albany and Buffalo.\n\nThe proposal led to public hearings across the state, but the next step — a final environmental impact study — has not yet been released. The next target date is May, a year later than originally scheduled.\n\nCuomo said Thursday the various recommendations haven't really changed that much over the past two decades.\n\nThe process may simply need a new set of eyes that can incorporate all the work has been done and meld that with projects that have been completed around the world.\n\nCuomo enacted a $100 billion infrastructure plan when he took office and now is undertaking a second five-year, $150 billion infrastructure initiative.\n\nBut at the same time, New York faces its worst fiscal problems in a decade: a $6 billion deficit for the upcoming fiscal year that is estimated to balloon to $8.5 billion by 2023.\n\nSo any new funding for high-speed rail would need to be approved by the state Legislature during the budget process for the fiscal year that starts April 1 amid a difficult financial climate.\n\nMore:New York faces its largest budget crisis in a decade.

The Louisville selection would be part of the Federal Railroad Administration's Corridor Identification and Development, Corridor ID, program.\n\n\"The (Corridor ID) is a comprehensive intercity passenger rail planning and development program that will help guide intercity passenger rail development throughout the country and create a pipeline of intercity passenger rail projects ready for implementation,\" the U.S. Department of Transportation website stated.\n\nIn March, the Kentuckiana Regional Planning and Development Agency, in conjunction with Metro Government, applied for a $500,000 planning grant with the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Railroad Administration to attempt to bring back rail service between Louisville and Indianapolis, the Courier Journal previously reported. The Indiana Department of Transportation submitted a similar plan. Now, nine months later, the proposal has been accepted for early stages.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?Submit a letter to the editor.\n\nShortly after the announcement outside Metro Hall, Mayor Craig Greenberg posted on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, \"This is the first step in our journey to bring Amtrak service back to our city, linking us to Indianapolis and beyond.\"\n\n“We are so excited to begin the process to potentially bring Amtrak back to Louisville, which would provide travelers new and efficient ways to get to and from Indianapolis, Chicago, and beyond,” said Greenberg. “We’ve heard from so many Louisvillians eager to take advantage of this service and we can’t wait to get to work on developing a plan to make it a reality.”\n\nThe Louisville project is expected to enter the first phase of Corridor ID which requires the development of a scope, schedule, and cost estimate for preparing, completing, and documenting its service development plan.\n\n“Today, we are one step closer to bringing passenger rail service back to Greater Louisville,\" Sarah Davasher-Wisdom, president and CEO of Greater Louisville Inc., the metro area chamber of commerce said. \"This is a top priority for the Louisville business community and GLI continues to advocate for expansion of passenger rail service to our region with the U.S. Department of Transportation. Connectivity with the rest of the world is critical for continued economic growth, and we are optimistic that a new point of connection between Louisville, Indianapolis, and Chicago would open new opportunities for our region to attract top businesses and talent.”\n\nHere's what we know about the potential revival of Amtrak in Louisville.\n\nDidn't Louisville try and get Amtrak recently?\n\nIn 2021, as part of its \"Connect US\" aspirational plan, Amtrak envisioned and released a plan to create railways between Louisville, Indianapolis, Chicago and potentially a connection to Cincinnati.\n\nThe plan envisioned up to 30 or more potential new rail routes and up to 160 more communities served around the country by 2035, the Courier Journal previously published. At the time, the Amtrak plan made it clear that \"significant government funding\" would be needed to \"build and operate these new and improved routes,\" which could expand and improve rail service for roughly 20 million people.\n\nThe proposed expansion would offer four daily round trips between Chicago and Louisville, creating an estimated economic impact of $448 million annually.\n\nWhen will Louisville’s Amtrak routes start?\n\nAt this time it is still too early to determine.\n\n\"Some are in the early stages ... some are in more advanced stages and already have a completed service development plan and can move forward more quickly,\" a member of the U.S. Department of Transportation said during a media call on Thursday. \"So, you've got different projects at different stages of development.\"\n\nWhat Amtrak routes will be available?\n\nThe goal is to create an Amtrak route from Louisville to Chicago with at least one stop in Indianapolis.\n\n\"This 115-mile-long corridor [between Louisville and Indianapolis] would provide premium public transportation and prioritize safety, accessibility, and equity with the resurgence of passenger rail,\" a release from the mayor's office stated.\n\nWith the combined railway from Louisville to Indianapolis and Indianapolis to Louisville, the 313-mile route would reconnect Louisville to Chicago for the first time in decades.\n\n\"This is critical for our city’s economic development and will revitalize transportation between our two cities,\" U.S. House of Representatives member Morgan McGarvey said in regard to the potential route between Louisville and Indianapolis.\n\nWhere is the Louisville Amtrak station?\n\nThe current Amtrak station in Louisville is located at 10th Street and West Broadway. Known as Union Station, the facility is home to the offices of the Transit Authority of River City, or TARC, which operates buses around the Louisville area.\n\nWhat are Amtrak ticket prices?\n\nExact ticket prices vary and are dependent on departure location and final destination. Amtrak offers a variety of tickets including:\n\nSale fares, the lowest available fares, limited availability and no flexibility\n\nValue fares are regular rate for fares and limited availability\n\nFlex fares are fully refundable and no cancellation fees\n\nBusiness fares provide a business class experience such as extended legroom, and complimentary non-alcoholic drinks located in a dedicated car or section of the train\n\nFirst Class fares offer private rooms and premium amenities such as complimentary onboard food and beverage services and access to lounges\n\nDoes Amtrak have WiFi?\n\nAmtrak offers \"free basic WiFi service\" on many Amtrak trains and at stations across the country.\n\nCan I bring my dog on Amtrak?\n\nFor those looking to travel with pets, Amtrak allows you to bring your dogs and cats up to 20 pounds, including the weight of the pet carrier. Pets can join for rides up to seven hours in duration. Pets other than dogs and cats are not welcome aboard.\n\nAre there already Amtrak routes in Kentucky?\n\nLouisville once enjoyed Amtrak service via the Floridian line, which covered roughly 1,600 miles between Chicago and Miami, the Courier Journal previously reported. The Floridian stopped operating in 1979.\n\nThen in 2003, the Kentucky Cardinal was discontinued and stopped taking travelers from Louisville to Chicago.\n\nCurrently, Amtrak provides bus services in Louisville via Thruway motorcoach busing which takes riders between Louisville, Indianapolis, and Chicago.\n\nBefore Amtrak, Louisville travelers could choose between Louisville & Nashville Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad to take them to destinations across the country.\n\nDespite not having railway options for travelers out of Louisville for decades now, Amtrak has continued to service smaller towns in Kentucky including Ashland, Fulton, Maysville, and South Portsmouth.\n\nThis story will be updated.\n\nContact reporter Olivia Evans atoevans@courier-journal.com or on Twitter at @oliviamevans_", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/10/03/brightline-trains-doubling-its-trains-from-miami-to-central-florida/71050597007/", "title": "Brightline trains doubling its trains from Miami to Central Florida", "text": "Brightline, which began its long-awaited South Florida-to-Orlando route less than two weeks ago, will double its train service starting Monday, the high-speed train line announced Tuesday evening.\n\nBrightline will run 30 trains daily between Miami and Orlando starting Oct. 9, with 15 daily departures from Miami and Orlando.

Michael Reininger, Brightline's CEO. \"We have reinvented what it means to travel by train. We have tried to build a guest experience through the lens of modern American travel … and we did this from the ground up.\"\n\nThe ultra-modern, high-speed Brightline followed a route first tracked by railroad baron Henry Flagler more than a century ago. Nonetheless, faster train service between populous South Florida and Central Florida's theme park mecca was a much sought-after transportation infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to Brightline, the federal government-subsidized Amtrak train runs routes across Florida, and Tri-Rail has long served commuters across South Florida. But all eyes had been on the development of the Brightline service in part for its promise of speed and more upscale amenities.\n\nMore:How Brightline's $5 billion passenger train project has to change the minds of Americans\n\n\"People of this state will have more transportation options, and everyone loves trains,\" said Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, who traveled on the first train. \"Traveling by train is faster. This train in particular, it's easier and it will significantly reduce travel time to Orlando.\"\n\nThe densely populated nature of the route, Reininger said, caps Brightline's speed on the north-south directional tracks between Miami and Cocoa at 110 miles per hour. But after Cocoa, when the tracks run east-west, Reininger said higher speeds up to 125 miles per hour are permitted, and he claimed once Brightline clocked in at that top speed it would make it the \"second-fastest train\" in the United States.\n\n\"Our maximum speed in this geography is 110 miles an hour, and that has to do with the nature of the area,\" he said Sept. 22. \"When we make the turn, we're in a completely sealed corridor, there are no grade crossings, and it's a higher class of track, it's all brand new track, and so that's why we can accelerate the speed there to 125.\"\n\nFrom Fun-Train to Brightline:The 25-year journey to Miami-Orlando passenger rail service\n\nHow much are Brightline tickets?\n\nBrightline tickets from Miami to Orlando range from $79 to almost $300 for a one-way ticket.

And before that, the short-lived Florida Fun Train rode the rails, too.\n\nThe Fun Train and the high-speed bullet train constitutional amendment proved to be swampland-in-the-Everglades dreams, but they were colorful sagas on the Sunshine State's business and political path to a Miami-to-Orlando choo-choo train.\n\nThe bullet train first approved by voters statewide via a constitutional amendment in 23 years ago was scrapped by a do-over constitutional amendment four years later that voided the earlier ballot initiative. The Fun Train, four guest cars with a decidedly cheery decor, brightly colored seats and glass roofs for all-around views, launched exactly 25 years ago, in September 1998. It ceased operations a few months later.\n\nThen came Brightline.\n\nBrightline to Orlando:What riders can expect for this weekend's inaugural trips and beyond\n\nBack in 2012, the company was called All Aboard Florida. It was a venture led by Flagler's legacy company, Florida East Coast Industries, with backing from the hedge fund Fortress Investment Group.\n\nWes Eden, co-founder of Fortress Investment, said the idea of building what would become Brightline originated after he read a biography of Flagler.\n\n\"It is a remarkable story of a man that had a lot of success in his business life and then, in his mid-50s, decided to pack up and move to Florida, at a time when the state was one of the poorest and least populated states in the country, and started to build a train,\" Edens said. \"And we stand here today on the shoulders of Henry Flagler.\"\n\nEdens said Sept. 22 he believes the Brightline route is \"the beginning of a true rail renaissance\" in the United States. He noted that European and Asian countries have invested heavily in high-speed rail systems that operate profitably and \"move millions if not billions\" of people, and now the United States lags far behind.\n\nHe added Brightline is a model from which to develop other high-speed rail links and create a \"rail industry\" that generates millions of jobs. He said other routes that are prime for high-speed rail service include Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Charlotte to Atlanta, Portland to Seattle and Houston to Dallas. The federal government, he noted, stepped up with $66 billion for passenger rail, including $12 billion for high-speed projects, in the $1.2 trillion infrastructure.\n\n\"We are in the first minute of the first day of a real renaissance in rail travel in this country,\" he said.\n\nStill, Brightline's trek to Orlando required years and many millions of dollars worth of improvements to the FEC's tracks followed. Political and legal fistfights, primarily with Treasure Coast counties and residents, were part of the landscape, too. Those obstacles have been cleared away, but resentment lingers in some quarters.\n\nBrightline's next move: Stations in Tampa, Space and Treasure coasts?\n\nNext up, Reininger said, could be an Orlando-to-Tampa leg, which by then would connect 75% of the state's population via a Brightline train. The rail line also is looking to add stations between West Palm Beach and Orlando along the Treasure Coast and Space Coast corridors.\n\nIn 2015, Cocoa and Melbourne leaders lobbied for their respective cities to rise atop a target list of potential sites for what was then All Aboard Florida to build a passenger train station along the Space Coast.\n\n\"All roads lead through Cocoa first. And that's the reason why we should be the designated location — permanent designated location,\" Cocoa Mayor Mike Blake said in April while attending the \"unveiling\" of the Orlando station.\n\n\"Location is everything. Access to the port area. Direct line to the (Orlando) airport. Cocoa is the chosen spot,\" Blake said.\n\nIn the Treasure Coast, issues with Brightline go back a long time as well.\n\nIn 2013, after the idea of a high-speed rail was proposed, officials in Indian River and Martin counties filed state and federal lawsuits against the rail line in an effort to derail the plans for a train.\n\nIn 2018, Brightline, Martin County and a coalition of Treasure Coast and South Florida residents against rail expansion reached a settlement that called for the construction of a Brightline station somewhere on the Treasure Coast to be completed within five years of the start of the Miami-to-Orlando route.\n\nIt will be in either Martin County or St. Lucie County, but Brightline hasn’t yet chosen a location.\n\nPalm Beach Post editor Jim Coleman, Florida Today and TCPalm contributed to this report.\n\nAntonio Fins is a politics and business editor at The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA TODAY Florida Network.

In New York, no other official fires up the defibrillator more often than Rep. Louise Slaughter.\n\nShe did it again on Monday, telling an audience at Rochester Institute of Technology that she wants Washington to pay for a high-speed rail link between Rochester and Buffalo.\n\nSlaughter said the train would allow residents of metropolitan Rochester, which shed the highest number of regional private sectors jobs in the state in the past year, to more easily access new jobs in Buffalo, which is booming by the sorry standards of western New York.\n\nShe didn't offer any specifics on costs or speed, though, and that's because there are none.\n\n\"I don't have any idea,\" Slaughter said in a phone interview. \"That's not the question right now. We just want to see the possibility of it. … You have to start somewhere.\"\n\nThis is a train to nowhere that shouldn't leave the platform.\n\nFederal investments in high-speed rail make sense in places where there are the aforementioned overcrowded highways and airports and, you know, people.\n\nThe populations of Monroe and Erie counties are stuck in neutral. That doesn't make them bad places to live, but it does make them bad places to invest in high-speed rail.\n\nTheir airports echo and on most days their highways are humming. Linking these communities with high-speed rail, which would involve laying 70-plus miles of new track, is a waste of money.\n\nBecause what Slaughter's talking about isn't even true high-speed rail like the trains zipping around Europe at 186 mph. She's really talking about higher-speed rail.\n\nIn a galaxy far, far away, higher-speed trains would never make the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs. Here, they barely outrun a Major League fastball.\n\nTwo years ago, the Federal Railroad Administration released a long-awaited study that offered five options for upgrading train service between Niagara Falls and New York City, known as the Empire Corridor.\n\nThere was a do-nothing option. Two other options allowed for speeds up to 90 mph between Schenectady and Buffalo at costs ranging from $1.7 billion to $5.6 billion.\n\nThe final two options would allow for speeds of up to 110 mph and 125 mph at costs of between $6.3 billion and $14.7 billion, respectively.\n\nThe priciest option would cut travel time between downtown Rochester and downtown Buffalo to 42 minutes from the current 78 minutes on Amtrak and 75 minutes by car — if you drive like your grandmother.\n\nThat sounds appealing. But consider that travelers would have to drive downtown to catch the train and find ground transportation in Buffalo.\n\nInvesting in a Rochester-Buffalo link ignores two universal rules of high-speed rail: the travel sweet spot and ample public transit options at the destinations.\n\nExperts peg the sweet spot as journeys between 150 and 600 miles. Anything less, it's cheaper for most travelers to drive. Anything more, it's more convenient for most travelers to fly.\n\nAs for the transit options in either city, they don't exist.\n\nRochester and New York City were identified in a 2009 study as among the best city pairs for a high-speed rail route in the United States. But the route was 50th out of 50 on the list.\n\nThe best pairing was — surprise! — New York City and Washington. Fifth on the list was Los Angeles and San Francisco, where a $68 billion high-speed rail project is already lumbering along.\n\nSlaughter was right when she said high-speed rail has to start somewhere and that the federal government should lay the tracks.\n\nThat somewhere just isn't western New York.\n\nDavid Andreatta is a Democrat and Chroniclecolumnist.

Tammy Baldwin on Wednesday announced the five routes received planning and development grants through the Federal Rail Administration's Corridor ID Program. The program is a first step toward being able to tap $66 billion in rail expansion funds included in the bipartisan Infrastructure bill.\n\n“Passenger rail helps people get to work and school safely, boosts tourism and recreation, and grows our local economies, and I am proud to deliver funding to help expand it in Wisconsin,” Baldwin, D-Wis., said in a media release.\n\nThree of the routes selected would be new train service out of Milwaukee — to Green Bay, Madison and Eau Claire. The other two awards will explore expanding Amtrak's existing Hiawatha schedule between Milwaukee and Chicago and its Empire Builder schedule line between Chicago and the Twin Cities via La Crosse.\n\nLarry Rueff, a member of the advocacy group NEW Rails and longtime supporter of Amtrak expansion to northeastern Wisconsin, said he was \"really happy\" to learn five Wisconsin projects were selected.\n\n\"I think it's great we can use federal planning dollars to look ahead,\" Rueff said.\n\nGreen Bay Mayor Eric Genrich tooted the region's horn over being selected, but also noted Corridor ID is merely the first stop on the region's journey, not the end of the line.\n\n\"We are thrilled to have the extension of passenger rail service to Green Bay included in USDOT’s Corridor ID and Development program,\" Genrich said. \"This decision is not the end of the line, but it’s a critical piece of the journey to restore passenger train travel to Green Bay.\"\n\nGenrich said he looks forward to working with state and local officials and rail service supporters \"to determine the best path forward for our community and region.\"\n\nAmtrak expansions would connect Wisconsin's largest regions with Chicago, Twin Cities\n\nThe five routes picked for further study would extend service out of Milwaukee to the 500,000-plus residents in the Madison metro area, the more than 820,000 residents along the I-41 corridor between Fond du Lac and Green Bay, and the 160,000-plus residents in Eau Claire.\n\nRail expansion to Waukesha County, Madison, Green Bay and other communities could attract 250,000 new riders within a decade and 1.6 million by 2050, according to Wisconsin Department of Transportation data published in May.\n\nThe routes and proposals to be studied are:\n\nMilwaukee to Green Bay : Extend the current Chicago-to-Milwaukee Hiawatha service north to include stops in Fond du Lac, Oshkosh, Appleton and Green Bay.\n\n: Extend the current Chicago-to-Milwaukee Hiawatha service north to include stops in Fond du Lac, Oshkosh, Appleton and Green Bay.

Rail expansions like the five Wisconsin routes to be studied would require the state to pay any operating costs that ticket revenues do not.\n\n\"We will need some kind of support from the state of Wisconsin to make this a reality,\" Genrich said.\n\nState Assembly Speaker Robin Vos in December 2022 did not mince words on the topic: \"No state funding,\" he said.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Eric Wimberger, whose district includes Green Bay and Marinette, said bus ridership between Green Bay and Milwaukee seems the most \"cost-effective and practical\" way to provide transportation options. He is confident the Corridor ID study will show train service to Green Bay would be expensive and ridership not there to cover operating costs, but said the study will help everyone make an informed decision.\n\n\"There's not enough information out there right now to make an informed decision,\" Wimberger said. \"We'll see how it shakes out.\"\n\nBucks, Packers among more than 60 businesses, colleges, chambers and tourism groups to back rail expansion\n\nThe Green Bay Packers and Milwaukee Bucks joined more than 60 of Wisconsin's major employers and health care providers, tourism agencies, universities, technical colleges and business groups that signed a statement in support of passenger rail expansion in Wisconsin.\n\n\"We support the expansion of passenger rail service in high-potential Wisconsin corridors as a needed and worthwhile investment for the economic future of our state. Frequent service to more cities will help attract and retain business and the talent critical to its success; provide a convenient, economical, and environmentally friendly alternative to driving; accelerate economic growth opportunities; improve quality of life; increase tourism; and add resiliency to our transportation system,\" the statement reads.\n\nBusinesses that signed onto the letter include Mercury Marine, Cellcom, Madison Gas & Electric, Schneider National, UW Health and Festival Foods. Chambers of commerce and tourism agencies representing Eau Claire, Chippewa Falls, the Fox Cities, greater Green Bay, Madison and Oshkosh also signed the letter.\n\nPackers President and CEO Mark Murphy on Thursday released a statement saying the team was very pleased with the support to study passenger rail expansion.\n\n\"Passenger rail has a rich history with the Packers and our fans, and its return would provide benefits to economic development and tourism, as well as add another great resource for everyone who lives and works in our region,\" Murphy said.\n\nAppleton, Oshkosh, Green Bay mayors backed passenger rail expansion more than 50 years after last train left Green Bay\n\nThe last passenger train left Green Bay's Chicago and Northwestern Depot, on Dousman Street, in 1971. Some residents likely remember taking the train to watch the Green Bay Packers play the Chicago Bears in the 1950s and 1960s, too.\n\nRail advocates never gave up hope of restoring passenger train service to Green Bay, Appleton, Oshkosh and Fond du Lac. They got a glimmer of hope more than 50 years later when President Joe Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which included $66 billion to extend passenger rail service to new cities and increase service on existing routes.\n\nIn December 2022, seven mayors and city managers from cities along Interstate 41 backed the request to include northeastern Wisconsin in Corridor ID.\n\nHow long would Amtrak take to get from Chicago or Milwaukee to Madison?\n\nAmtrak's ConnectUS vision for expanding Hiawatha rail service to Madison proposed four daily round trips between Chicago and Madison with Illinois stops in Chicago and Glenview followed by Wisconsin stops in Sturtevant, at Mitchell International Airport, in Milwaukee, Oconomowoc, Watertown and Madison.\n\nAmtrak projected initial trip times of one hour and 48 minutes from Madison to Milwaukee and three hours and 18 minutes from Madison to Chicago.\n\nLike in northeastern Wisconsin, the Madison-Milwaukee expansion garnered the support of government leaders from Madison, Pewaukee and Watertown.\n\nGenrich: Amtrak from Green Bay to Milwaukee, but Oshkosh to Appleton where 'big impact' lies\n\nAs Corridor ID launched in 2022, Amtrak also released its \"vision\" for what passenger rail service from Milwaukee to Green Bay would look like.\n\nThe northeastern Wisconsin rail expansion would operate three round trips each day with a Green Bay-to-Milwaukee trip taking just under three hours and the trip from Green Bay to Chicago taking 4 hours, 20 minutes. The service map includes stops in Green Bay, Appleton, Oshkosh and Fond du Lac. Amtrak currently connects Green Bay to Milwaukee via a bus service.\n\nGenrich said the biggest impact wouldn't be Chicago to Green Bay ridership, but the opportunity for train travel within northeastern Wisconsin's major cities.\n\n\"The connection between Green Bay and Milwaukee and Chicago is really great, but the more meaningful impact of this service will be between Fond du Lac and Green Bay,\" Genrich said. \"That's where this rail service could have the big impact.\"\n\nContact Jeff Bollier at (920) 431-8387 orjbollier@gannett.com.

In addition, one of the stops in Newark, N.J., is a 10-minute cab ride to Newark Airport. This will significantly reduce traffic along I-80 and I-84, easing congestion and reducing emissions,” said U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright, whose 8th District covers most of the route within Pennsylvania.\n\nThe study’s release on Wednesday comes as the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Railroad Authority and New Jersey Transit, submits an application to the Federal Railroad Administration’s Corridor Identification and Development Program. The FRA will decide which corridors move ahead and begin to receive money for engineering and planning.\n\nPocono train to NYC:Could we know Amtrak's fate by summer?\n\n“Passenger rail service in and out of Scranton was discontinued in 1970, only one year before Amtrak was created,” said Amtrak CEO Stephen Gardner. “Restoring and expanding this corridor with daily multi-frequency service would dramatically boost mobility and economic development for residents of Scranton and Northeastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and the broader Northeast region.”\n\nLarry Malski, president of the PNRRA, which paid for the study, said that it “reinforces what we have advocated for decades that rail passenger service to this region is a huge economic positive.”\n\nThe economic impact, which factors in employment, tourism spending and other activity, would be $84 million if the recommended schedule is used.\n\nAmtrak figures another $20 million in “user benefits” such as “travel time saved and the quality, safety, and reliability of the rail transportation compared to alternatives” and productivity gains made possible by not having to drive. “External benefits” such as “increased public safety from reduced roadway travel and reduced public health costs due to reduced air pollution” are worth $7 million.\n\nThe proposed schedule\n\nAmtrak’s proposed service plan includes three trips daily in each direction. Four possible schedules were simulated with software, and Option D was recommended because it does not conflict with existing commuter trains in New Jersey. This plan would have Scranton departures at 7 a.m., 12:58 p.m. and 6:57 p.m. and New York departures at 9:18 a.m., 2:48 p.m. and 8:11 p.m.\n\nOption B has earlier departures: 6:07 a.m., 11:51 a.m. and 5:44 p.m. for Scranton and 7:37 a.m., 1:50 p.m. and 8:09 p.m. for New York. However, that schedule “may have a commuter train conflict that remains unresolved.”\n\nDespite the earlier schedule perhaps suiting commuters with a 9-5 office job better, Option D was modeled to have higher demand: 473,500 by fiscal year 2030 compared to 451,800 for Option B.\n\nOne-way run times are under three hours. This is achieved by eliminating the Tobyhanna stop included in the 2021 proposal, and assumes speeds of up to 60 or 80 mph (depending on how straight or curved different sections of track are) on PNRRA-owned track. Speeds would be up to 110 mph on the Lackawanna Cut-Off after it is rebuilt.\n\nCurrently, the 60-mile section from Scranton to Delaware Water Gap is a Class 2 track, meaning the maximum speed for passenger trains is 30 mph. Upgrades to allow for higher speeds would include signals and Positive Train Control, a system described by the Federal Communications Commission as one “designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, derailments caused by excessive speeds, unauthorized train movements in work zones, and the movement of trains through switches left in the wrong position.”\n\nOf interest:$3.7M grant will fund railroad ties that allow for Amtrak speeds in Poconos\n\nCosts for upgrades\n\nLast fall, a $3.7 million grant was awarded to Monroe County Industrial Development Authority through Pennsylvania’s Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program to cover half the cost of 43,000 new railroad ties — an upgrade Malski explained at the time would be necessary to achieve Amtrak’s desired speeds.\n\nUpgrades on the PNRRA track would cost $99 to $176 million, depending on whether improvements are limited to “strictly necessary projects to begin service” or if additional steps are taken, such as replacing track components “with 10 or fewer years of remaining service life.”\n\nCosts for rebuilding the Lackawanna Cut-Off were outside this study’s scope. However, New Jersey is working on a 7-mile section of the 28-mile gap, and a 2019 study estimated that the remaining work would cost almost $289 million.\n\nRail advocates note that the cost of this project has long been a challenge, but under the infrastructure law passed in 2021, the federal government would pay 80%.\n\nTrain cars would be serviced and cleaned in Scranton. The study identified four possible sites in the Steamtown National Historic Site area.\n\nService could begin “no sooner than 2028,” Amtrak found. In addition to design and construction, the necessary steps include hiring and training crews (which Amtrak notes can take 12 to 18 months), acquiring the actual trains and executing an operating agreement.\n\nIn addition to the information in the study itself, “the biggest thing that stands out is that this exists, which is very exciting,” said Tyler Kusma, executive director of the Scranton Rail Restoration Coalition, which has collected more than 10,000 signatures on a petition calling for the restoration of the Lackawanna Cut-Off. “I know for many people this train has been five years away for 25 years” but this document from Amtrak finally lays out a schedule and the steps required to make service happen.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/03/12/brightline-gives-green-light-to-cocoa-stop-for-its-rail-service/72940551007/", "title": "Brightline Cocoa station in the works for high-speed train", "text": "Next stop: Cocoa.\n\nThat's the word from passenger rail company Brightline, which on Tuesday said it plans to have a Brevard County train stop at what's known as \"the Cocoa curve,\" on land it owns in north Cocoa, although it hasn't yet said when construction of a station would begin.\n\nBrightline currently operates 32 trains a day — 16 in each direction — from early morning to late evening on the roughly 3½-hour route between Orlando International Airport and Miami. But it has no stop in Brevard County.\n\nWhat to know about Brightline:Cocoa's getting a Brightline station, but where does the train go, how much is a ticket?\n\nThe Cocoa City Council at a workshop last week unanimously voted to commit $5 million in city money for a Brightline station project at that site, which helped trigger Brightline's commitment to have the train stop there.\n\n\"This is as transformative a project as the city of Cocoa will ever see,\" Cocoa City Manager Stockton Whitten told City Council members at the workshop before seeking their commitment to earmark $5 million toward design and construction of the station.\n\nThe timeline for construction is still to be determined, as is the total cost of the project.\n\nThe Space Coast Transportation Planning Organization has said it will set aside a total of $15.5 million in federal grant money it is set to receive in the 2026-27 and 2027-28 budget years to help cover design and construction work for the station.\n\nIn addition, Brevard County Commission Chair Jason Steele plans to push for a tourism capital grant for the station, using revenue generated from Brevard County's 5% tourist development tax on hotel rooms, vacation rentals and other short-term rentals.\n\nWhitten said Cocoa also will pursue federal and state grants for the rail station project.\n\nKatie Mitzner, director of public affairs for Brightline, said the rail company \"is ready to begin the formal process with Space Coast stakeholders to fulfill our vision for a Brevard County station. The Space Coast TPO, Brevard County, city of Cocoa and other community leaders have started to bring the region together to identify potential federal, state and local resources for a station to be located in Cocoa. We agree the time is now to finalize a plan.\"\n\nWhy Cocoa for the new Brightline station?\n\nThe Cocoa curve location makes sense for the company. In addition to owning the land, the area is where Brightline trains must slow down, as they switch from an west-to-east configuration to a north-to-south configuration.\n\nCocoa Mayor Michael C. Blake said the city now will begin to coordinate with community stakeholders to present a financial proposal to Brightline detailing station funding plans.\n\nBlake said a Cocoa station \"represents a significant infrastructure investment, and will have great economic impact on our community, with the goal of improving connectivity and accessibility for residents and visitors to the Space Coast.\"\n\nSeeking funding options:County Commissioner Steele enlisted to help find money for Brevard Brightline station\n\nOther City Council members and residents also were excited about the prospects of a Brightline stop in Cocoa.\n\n\"It's worth a lot to us\" to have the station, Cocoa City Council Member Lorraine Koss said, adding that she anticipates that having the station will boost local property values.\n\nIn public comment during last week's City Council workshop, Alex Greenwood, a downtown Cocoa commercial property owner and former City Council member, said having the train stop in Cocoa \"is the biggest catalyst that we could see to help this area.\"\n\nSteele, who also is chair of the Brevard County Tourist Development Council, said Brightline's decision is \"a pivotal moment for Brevard County.\"\n\n\"I am excited about Brightline’s announcement of plans for a station in the city of Cocoa,\" Steele said. \"Now, our community and local partners must pull together to make the station a reality.\"\n\nThe Space Coast Transportation Planning Organization had previously identified the Cocoa curve location near Clearlake Road/U.S. 1 and State Road 528 as the best site for a Brightline station.\n\n\"We have pursued a Brightline station since 2016,\" TPO Executive Director Georganna Gillette said. \"We will continue to work diligently with our community and regional partners to secure funding to build a Brightline station in Cocoa.\"\n\nCocoa officials said among other positives about the Cocoa station site is its proximity to Port Canaveral, the world's second-busiest cruise port.\n\nIn reacting to Brightline's announcement, Port Canaveral CEO John Murray said: “We’re projecting over 7 million passenger movements this year, and we are thrilled that our guests will have another transportation option to embark on a cruise from Port Canaveral.”\n\nAlso, as Brightline potentially pursues extending its passenger service north to Jacksonville, a Cocoa stop makes sense as the junction of the routes.\n\nOther commercial and residential development also could spring up near the Cocoa station site.\n\nIn pushing for the $5 million commitment from the City Council, Whitten said it was \"a chicken-and-egg sort of argument,\" indicating that Brightline was seeking a signal from the city that it would financially support the station project before the rail company committed to the Cocoa site.\n\nWhitten also said an option for the City Council might be to create a special municipal economic development zone around the station site. In that zone, new municipal property tax revenue generated by the station and surrounding development could go toward helping pay for the station's construction.\n\nWhitten said that mechanism would have to be approved by the City Council.\n\nBrightline also building Stuart station\n\nBrightline currently has stops at Orlando International Airport, and in West Palm Beach, Boca Raton, Fort Lauderdale, Aventura and Miami.\n\nBrightline announced earlier this month that it also will have a stop in downtown Stuart, after selecting a proposal for a $60 million rail station project there. The station could open as soon as late-2026.\n\nThe station — a collaboration of Stuart, Martin County and Brightline — will cost the city and county $45 million, with Brightline covering the remainder of the costs. State and federal grants could cut the city and county's combined cost to less than $10 million, Martin County officials said.\n\nStuart had been chosen from among five Treasure Coast sites for Brightline's seventh station.

Steven McCraw said.\n\nThe gunman was killed more than an hour after he started shooting inside Robb Elementary School. Members of a specialized Border Patrol unit had entered the classroom, with one holding a shield followed by at least two others who engaged the shooter, according to a US Customs and Border Protection official.\n\nThe gunman is believed to have waited for the agents to enter the room, then kicked open the closet door and began shooting, the source said.\n\nThe agents had used a key to get into the classroom, opening the door while standing off to the side since the gunman had been shooting through the door, the source said.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the detail on the gunman emerging from the classroom closet.\n\nThe timeline of events that were part of the law enforcement response became more clear and more disturbing to the victims’ families Friday as McCraw explained the school district police chief was the incident commander who made the decision not to breach the classroom door.\n\nYet as officers stood in the hallway, children inside Robb Elementary School classrooms 111 and 112 in Uvalde repeatedly called 911 and pleaded for help, he said. They were in the middle of the deadliest school shooting since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre.\n\n“From the benefit of hindsight where I’m sitting now, of course it was not the right decision,” McCraw said of the supervisor’s call not to confront the shooter. “It was the wrong decision. Period. There’s no excuse for that.”\n\nLATEST UPDATES ON THE UVALDE SCHOOL SHOOTING\n\nThe official who was the school district police chief, Pedro “Pete” Arredondo, officials said Friday.\n\nArredondo has nearly three decades of law enforcement experience, according to the school district, and was recently elected to a seat on Uvalde’s city council. He previously served as a captain at a school district police department in Laredo, Texas, and in multiple roles at the Uvalde Police Department.\n\nArredondo has not spoken about the shooting publicly since two very brief press statements on the day of the tragedy. CNN attempted to reach him at his home on Friday, but there was no response.\n\nIn all, 80 minutes passed between when officers were first called to the school at 11:30 a.m. to when a tactical team entered locked classrooms and killed the gunman at 12:50 p.m., McCraw said. The tactical team was able to enter using keys from a janitor, he added.\n\nWithin that period, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos killed 19 children and two teachers – marking at least the 30th shooting at a K-12 school in 2022. And while, as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said, the massacre could have been worse, the law enforcement response suggests it could have been better.\n\nThe delayed response runs contrary to commonly taught active shooter protocol, established after the Columbine school shooting of 1999, to stop the shooter as quickly as possible and even bypass helping the injured. The revelations also help explain why officials have offered contradictory information over the past three days as to what law enforcement did in response.\n\n“The levels of failure are just incredible, beyond belief,” said Anthony Barksdale, the former acting Baltimore police commissioner.\n\nAlfred Garza, the father of 10-year-old Amerie Jo Garza, who was killed in the attack, said he believes someone should be held accountable for the delayed response.\n\n“They should have reacted quicker, faster,” he said. “Had they done that? You know, maybe we would have a different result.”\n\nGovernor livid over misinformation\n\nGov. Abbott told reporters Friday he was misled by authorities the day after the shooting, and he is livid.\n\nAbbott said he took careful notes from his briefing on Wednesday, calling what he told the public “a recitation of what people in that room told me.” He added, “As everybody has learned, the information that I was given turned out, in part, to be inaccurate, and I’m absolutely livid about that.”\n\nThe governor was in Uvalde for a news conference about the state response for the families of those affected by the shooting, but reporters pressed Abbott on the law enforcement response and the information given to the public about the shooting.\n\n“My expectation is the law enforcement leaders that are leading the investigations … they get to the bottom of every fact with absolute certainty,” he said.\n\nAbbott said the people who deserve accurate answers the most are the families whose “lives have been destroyed.”\n\n“It is inexcusable that they may have suffered from any inaccurate information whatsoever,” he said.\n\nSchool back door had been propped open\n\nThe area around the Robb Elementary School signs has become a memorial dedicated to the victims of the May 24 mass shooting.

That 911 call came at 11:30 a.m.\n\nThe gunman then moved toward the school parking lot and began shooting into classroom windows, McCraw said. A school resource officer, who was not on campus at the time, heard the 911 call and rushed to the school but drove past the suspect, who was hunkered down behind a vehicle, McCraw said.\n\nThe suspect then entered the school via the propped door at 11:33 a.m. and went to the adjoining classrooms 111 and 112, where he continued shooting, McCraw said.\n\nTwo minutes later, seven officers arrived to the school and approached the locked classrooms where the gunman had barricaded himself. Two of the officers were shot by the suspect from behind the door and suffered graze wounds, McCraw said.\n\nThe gunman fired 16 more rounds inside the locked classrooms between 11:37 and 11:44 a.m., and more officers continued to arrive to the hallway, McCraw said.\n\nAt about the same time, the Robb Elementary School posted on its Facebook that the school was on lockdown due to gunshots in the area. Outside the school, distraught parents soon began to arrive, desperate to know whether their kids were still alive, leading to confrontations with police trying to set up a perimeter.\n\nInside the school, there were as many as 19 law enforcement officers in the hallway at 12:03 p.m., yet they remained outside and waited for further tactical team and equipment, McGraw said.\n\nThat very minute, at 12:03 p.m., police received a 911 call from a girl who identified herself and whispered she’s in Room 112, McCraw said. She stayed on the phone for 1 minute, 23 seconds. At 12:10 p.m. she called back and said there were multiple people dead. She called again three minutes later.\n\nMembers of the Border Patrol tactical team, known as BORTAC, arrived with shields at 12:15 p.m. There they waited.\n\nThe girl called again at 12:16 p.m. and said there were eight to nine students alive, McGraw said. Another student called 911 from Room 111 three minutes later but hung up at the urging of another student. On a 911 call at 12:21 p.m., three shots can be heard, he said.\n\nThe gunman had fired over 100 rounds in the first minutes of the shooting, but the gunfire after that was sporadic and aimed at the door, McCraw said.\n\n“The belief was that there may not be anybody living anymore and that the subject has now tried to keep law enforcement at bay or entice them to come in to (die by) suicide,” he said.\n\nA female student called 911 at 12:36 p.m. that lasted for 21 seconds, but then called back and was told to stay on the line and remain quiet. At 12:43 p.m. and 12:47 p.m. she asked 911 to please send police now.\n\nFinally, at 12:50 p.m., the tactical team entered the room and shot and killed the suspect.\n\nSurviving children describe what happened inside\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 10-year-old survivor says 'almost all' of his friends died in the shooting 02:42 - Source: CNN\n\nChildren who survived the shooting described what happened inside the school during the mayhem.\n\nTo survive the nightmare, Miah Cerrillo, 11, smeared her friend’s blood all over herself and played dead, she told CNN.\n\nMiah and her classmates were watching the movie “Lilo and Stitch” when teachers Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia got word of a shooter in the building. One teacher went to lock the door, but the shooter was right there – and shot out the door’s window, Miah said.\n\nAs her teacher backed into the classroom, the gunman followed. He then looked a teacher in the eye, said “Goodnight,” and shot her, the girl recalled.\n\nAnd then he opened fire, shooting the other teacher and many of Miah’s friends. Bullets flew by her, Miah said, and fragments hit her shoulders and head. The gunman next went through a door into an adjoining classroom. Miah heard screams and more gunshots. When the firing stopped, the shooter started playing music that was “sad, like you want people to die,” the girl said.\n\nScared he would come back to kill her and her few surviving friends, Miah put her hands into the blood of a slain friend lying next to her and smeared herself with it, she said. The girl and a friend managed to grab a dead teacher’s phone and call 911 for help, she said. She told a dispatcher, “Please send help because we’re in trouble.”\n\nThe pair then lay down and played dead.\n\nAnother student in a different classroom, 10-year-old Jayden Perez, said when he and his classmates heard gunfire, his teacher locked the door and told them to “hide and be quiet.”\n\nJayden said he was hiding near the storage area for backpacks during the shooting. Others in his class were under a table. The entire time, he wondered what was going to happen to them.\n\n“It was very terrifying because I never thought that was going to happen,” he told CNN. “(I’m) still sad about some of my friends that died.”\n\nHe does not want to go back to school again.\n\n“No, because after what happened. I don’t want to. I don’t want anything to do with another shooting or me in the school,” he said. “And I know it might happen again, probably.”\n\nParents outside school begged for action\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Parents seen frustrated with police at shooting scene in new video 06:08 - Source: CNN\n\nOutside the school, chaos and confusion reigned as distraught parents showed up and implored law enforcement to force their way in and kill the gunman. One father even asked officers to give him their gear, he said.\n\n“I told one of the officers myself, if they didn’t want to go in there, let me borrow his gun and a vest, and I’ll go in there myself to handle it. And they told me no,” Victor Luna told CNN. His son survived.\n\nInstead, officers held parents behind yellow police tape, refusing to let them enter as crying and screaming echoed around them, several videos show.\n\nMembers of the US Marshals Service can be seen in one video holding back parents who pleaded to enter the school. US Marshals said in a statement they were called to the school at 11:30 a.m. and arrived about 40 minutes later from Del Rio, about 70 miles away.\n\nThe first deputy US Marshals to arrive entered the school to assist the Border Patrol tactical team already engaging with the shooter. The deputies also rendered aid to victims. Other deputies were asked to secure the perimeter around the school, but never arrested or placed anyone in handcuffs, the agency said.\n\n“Our deputy marshals maintained order and peace in the midst of the grief-stricken community that was gathering around the school,” the agency said.\n\nUvalde Police Chief Daniel Rodriguez issued a statement Thursday defending his officers’ response to the shooting amid the growing criticism.\n\n“It is important for our community to know that our officers responded within minutes” alongside school resource officers, he said.", "authors": ["Priscilla Alvarez Eric Levenson Virginia Langmaid Shimon Prokupecz Nora Neus", "Priscilla Alvarez", "Eric Levenson", "Virginia Langmaid", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Nora Neus"], "publish_date": "2022/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/world/thwaites-doomsday-glacier-sea-level-climate/index.html", "title": "Thwaites 'doomsday glacier' is holding on 'by its fingernails ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAntarctica’s so-called “doomsday glacier” – nicknamed because of its high risk of collapse and threat to global sea level – has the potential to rapidly retreat in the coming years, scientists say, amplifying concerns over the extreme sea level rise that would accompany its potential demise.\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier, capable of raising sea level by several feet, is eroding along its underwater base as the planet warms. In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, scientists mapped the glacier’s historical retreat, hoping to learn from its past what the glacier will likely do in the future.\n\nThey found that at some point in the past two centuries, the base of the glacier dislodged from the seabed and retreated at a rate of 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) per year. That’s twice the rate that scientists have observed in the past decade or so.\n\nThat swift disintegration possibly occurred “as recently as the mid-20th century,” Alastair Graham, the study’s lead author and a marine geophysicist at the University of South Florida, said in a news release.\n\nThe floating ice edge at Thwaites Glacier margin in 2019. Robert Larter\n\nIt suggests the Thwaites has the capability to undergo a rapid retreat in the near future, once it recedes past a seabed ridge that is helping to keep it in check.\n\n“Thwaites is really holding on today by its fingernails, and we should expect to see big changes over small timescales in the future – even from one year to the next – once the glacier retreats beyond a shallow ridge in its bed,” Robert Larter, a marine geophysicist and one of the study’s co-authors from the British Antarctic Survey, said in the release.\n\nRán, a Kongsberg HUGIN autonomous underwater vehicle, near the Thwaites Glacier after a 20-hour mission mapping the seafloor.

Alexandra Mazur/University of Gothenburg\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier, located in West Antarctica, is one of the widest on Earth and is larger than the state of Florida. But it’s just a faction of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which holds enough ice to raise sea level by up to 16 feet, according to NASA.\n\nAs the climate crisis has accelerated, this region has been closely monitored because of its rapid melting and its capacity for widespread coastal destruction.\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier itself has concerned scientists for decades. As early as 1973, researchers questioned whether it was at high risk of collapse. Nearly a decade later, they found that – because the glacier is grounded to a seabed, rather than to dry land – warm ocean currents could melt the glacier from underneath, causing it to destabilize from below.\n\nIt was because of that research that scientists began calling the region around the Thwaites the “weak underbelly of the West Antarctic ice sheet.”\n\nA workboat recovering the Rán autonomous vehicle in one of the fjords of the Antarctic Peninsula during the expedition to Thwaites Glacier in 2019. Alexandra Mazur/University of Gothenburg\n\nIn the 21st century, researchers began documenting the Thwaites’ rapid retreat in an alarming series of studies.\n\nIn 2001, satellite data showed the grounding line was receding by around 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) per year. In 2020, scientists found evidence that warm water was indeed flowing across the base of the glacier, melting it from underneath.\n\nAnd then in 2021, a study showed the Thwaites Ice Shelf, which helps to stabilize the glacier and hold the ice back from flowing freely into the ocean, could shatter within five years.\n\n“From the satellite data, we’re seeing these big fractures spreading across the ice shelf surface, essentially weakening the fabric of the ice; kind of a bit like a windscreen crack,” Peter Davis, an oceanographer with the British Antarctic Survey, told CNN in 2021. “It’s slowly spreading across the ice shelf and eventually it’s going to fracture into lots of different pieces.”\n\nMonday’s findings, which suggest the Thwaites is capable of receding at a much faster pace than recently thought, were documented on a 20-hour mission in extreme conditions that mapped an underwater area the size of Houston, according to a news release.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See Bill Nye's warning about 'doomsday' glacier (2021) 02:30 - Source: CNN\n\nGraham said that this research “was truly a once in a lifetime mission,” but that the team hopes to return soon to gather samples from the seabed so they can determine when the previous rapid retreats occurred. That could help scientists predict future changes to the “doomsday glacier,” which scientists had previously assumed would be slow to undergo change – something Graham said this study disproves.\n\n“Just a small kick to the Thwaites could lead to a big response,” Graham said.", "authors": ["Angela Fritz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/us/university-of-virginia-shooting-wednesday/index.html", "title": "UVA Shooting: Suspect accused of killing 3 University of Virginia ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe student accused of killing three University of Virginia football players after a school field trip was denied bail Wednesday during a court hearing in Charlottesville.\n\nAccording to a witness, suspect Christopher Darnell Jones Jr. shot one of the players, Devin Chandler, while he was sleeping, the Albemarle County prosecutor said.

He received suspended sentences for all of the offenses.\n\nJones remains in custody in Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, according to online records. He was assigned a public defender until his next hearing in December – a status hearing that will discuss whether Jones has retained private counsel, Albemarle County Commonwealth’s Attorney James Hingeley said.\n\nJones was on a field trip Sunday with fellow UVA students to see a play in Washington, DC, a university spokesperson said.\n\nWhen the bus returned to the Charlottesville campus, authorities said, the 22-year-old opened fire on the bus, killing Chandler, Davis and Perry.\n\nJones faces three charges of second-degree murder and three counts of using a handgun in the commission of a felony, UVA Police Chief Timothy Longo Sr. said.\n\nChristopher Jones Henrico County Sheriff's Office\n\nHe also faces two counts of malicious wounding, each accompanied by a firearm charge.

In 2018 he was younger than the legal age (21) to buy a handgun and was denied a purchase. Three years later he tried to buy a rifle, but failed a background check, according to Dance.\n\nIn an email to CNN, Virginia State Police Spokesperson Corinne Geller said an investigation into the attempted purchase on July 8, 2021 revealed that the state police firearms transaction center denied Jones’ request based on an ongoing legal matter.\n\n“The pending charge was reduced to a misdemeanor by the court in October 2021, thereby removing the prohibition against future purchases,” Geller said.\n\nCNN has reached out to University of Virginia Police for comment on the shooting investigation and the gun used but has not heard back.\n\nUVA’s scheduled game against Coastal Carolina on Saturday has been canceled, the university’s athletics department announced Wednesday.\n\n“The game would have been Virginia’s final home game of the 2022 season,” a statement from the athletics department said.\n\n“A decision if Virginia will participate in its final game of the season, a Nov. 26 (Saturday) date against Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, has not been made at this time.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Atlantic Coast Conference released guidance Wednesday describing how the rest of the conference will support UVA going forward.\n\n“The ACC is a family and when one member of our family hurts, we all hurt,” said Jim Phillips, ACC commissioner, in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with all of those impacted and we will continue to support UVA in any way possible during this difficult time.”\n\nThe ACC produced UVA helmet decals that will be worn by every conference school, and a moment of silence will be observed at all ACC home football games this upcoming weekend, according to a statement from the conference.\n\nThe ACC has also produced UVA strong graphics for conference schools to use on social and digital media.\n\nJones was subject of a gun-related probe\n\nPrior to Sunday’s shooting, Jones was the subject of a pending case with the university’s judicial council as Sunday’s shooting unfolded, officials said.\n\n“On September 15, in the context of reviewing a potential hazing issue, UVA Student Affairs heard from a student that Mr. Jones made a comment to him about possessing a gun,” said Brian Coy, the university spokesperson.\n\nThat person “did not see Mr. Jones in possession of a gun,” and the “comment about owning a gun was not made in conjunction with a threat,” Coy said.\n\n“In the course of their investigation, University officials spoke with Mr. Jones’ roommate, who gave no indication of the presence of any weapons. In the course of their investigation, University officials discovered that Mr. Jones previously had been tried and convicted of a misdemeanor concealed weapons violation in 2021, for which he received a 12-month suspended sentence and a small fine.”\n\nCoy said throughout the investigation “Mr. Jones repeatedly refused to cooperate with University officials who were seeking additional information about the claims that he had a firearm and about his failure to disclose the previous misdemeanor conviction.”\n\n“The Threat Assessment Team escalated his case for disciplinary action” on October 27, Coy said.\n\nThe school’s judicial council took over the case, and the results are pending, Longo, the school’s police chief, said.\n\nJones was also involved in a hazing investigation on campus that was closed because witnesses would not cooperate, Longo said.\n\nJones is listed on UVA’s athletics website as a football player in 2018 who, as a freshman, did not participate in any games. A UVA spokesperson told CNN Jones had a pre-existing injury that prevented him from playing on the football team in 2018.\n\nJones went through medical treatment and rehabilitation during his time with the team and was only a member of the team for one season, the spokesperson says.\n\n“What I do know is the young man was a student beginning in 2018 and was a walk-on for one semester with our football program,” Williams said Tuesday.\n\n‘We’re going to celebrate their lives’\n\nOn Tuesday, UVA football head coach Tony Elliott spoke publicly for the first time since the shooting. He described the days following the attack as a nightmare.\n\n“I’m ready for somebody to pinch me and wake me up and say this didn’t happen,” Elliott said, adding that Tuesday “was much better, we were able to transition from the pain to finding a little bit of joy in celebrating the lives of Lavel, D’Sean and Devin.”\n\nThe deaths of players Chandler, Davis Jr. and Perry left three enormous holes on a team that felt more like family than anything, the coach said. He went on to describe them, calling Chandler “the life of the party,” Davis “the big man on campus” and Perry “the quiet guy everyone wanted to know about.”\n\nFrom left to right: Devin Chandler, D'Sean Perry and Lavel Davis Jr.\n\nElliott commended the strength of his team and staff for coming together and being able to process the shooting. Elliott said the team has inspired him to keep pushing forward. At the same time, he said staff has made it their mission to ensure the team had all the resources they need and that no one went into isolation.\n\n“The message to the team is we’re going to celebrate their lives going forward and the impact that they’ve made thus far and the legacy that they’re going to be a part of helping us establish going forward,” Elliott said.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly spelled the last name of UVA Health spokesperson Eric Swensen.", "authors": ["Joe Johns Aileen Graef Amir Vera Holly Yan", "Joe Johns", "Aileen Graef", "Amir Vera", "Holly Yan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/10/12/memphis-residents-react-to-violent-conflict-of-israel-hamas-war/71152527007/", "title": "Memphis residents react to violent conflict of Israel-Hamas war", "text": "While more than 6,500 miles separate Memphis and the deepening war between Israeli and Palestinian forces, Memphians are not unaffected by the tragedies unfurling across the world. Whether through family, friends, religion, history or many other bonding factors, the renewed onset of violence has deeply impacted many in the Mid-South.\n\nSince the outbreak of renewed fighting over the weekend, more than 1,200 Israelis have been killed, according to Israeli authorities, and Palestinian authorities say more than 1,400 have been killed in Gaza. Thousands more have been injured on each side of the Gaza border.\n\nA group of 44, mostly from Memphis, were on a pilgrimage to Israel led by Father Dexter Noblefranca of St. Patrick Catholic Church in Downtown Memphis when violence broke out. On Wednesday, a member of the group told The Commercial Appeal they had safely made their way to Jordan and would be heading home soon.\n\nDays after the onset of renewed violence, Rabbi Micah Greenstein of Temple Israel found himself uncharacteristically stumped on what to say.\n\nIsrael-Hamas War newsletter: Sign up to get the latest news and analysis from USA TODAY into your inbox.\n\n\"I struggle to find words at this point, quite frankly. The tragic outcomes just days after this bloodbath are dark and deeply disturbing,\" said Greenstein.\n\n'They don't deserve to perish'\n\nJohn Kaltner, the chair of religious studies at Rhodes College who specializes in the Middle East, and has taught courses on Islam, Muslim-Christian relations, Arabic and other topics, said it was too soon to say exactly why renewed violence sparked over the weekend but that he was surprised by the Hamas attacks on Israel.\n\n“Like many people, I was quite shocked when I saw the words ‘Israel at war’ on my television screen on Saturday morning,” he said via email.\n\nHe added it was important to note that while religion has played a role in the conflict throughout the decades, disputes between the Israelis and Palestinians are not solely about religious differences. He added that “the ideology and methods of Hamas do not represent those of Islam and the vast majority of Muslims.”\n\n“Just as Jews and Christians are horrified when those who claim to be members of their religions engage in acts of violence and terror, so too Muslims are now outraged by what is being done in the name of their faith,” he said.\n\nKaltner said the roots of the conflict “predate the emergence of Hamas in the 1980s, and it ultimately centers on the land and who has a claim to it.”\n\nMusa Banat works at Christian Brothers University and is getting his master's degree in criminology from the University of Memphis. His father is Palestinian and Banat has been vocal about Palestinian rights. He said there is a lot of misinformation about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n\"To understand it means that you would have to understand history. And this isn't a new event, it's been going on for 80 years. And the violence is a product of an ongoing occupation,\" he said. \"It's an occupation that we as Americans, and as Westerners in general have turned a blind eye to.\"\n\nBanat said violence against any civilians, Israeli or Palestinian, is a tragedy.\n\n\"They don't deserve to perish in this manner. They deserve an equal chance at life like any other human deserves,\" he said of Israeli civilians killed in recent attacks. \"Obviously, when resorting to attacking civilians, it's not fair. And it's not right. The world has turned their eye to feel sympathy towards Israel's people, which is fair. But on the on the flip side... there's never been an outcry like this for the Palestinians.\"\n\nAta Amro, a 25-year-old Shelby County resident and medical school student, also agreed the recent bloodshed of Israeli citizens at the hands of Hamas is an atrocity. He's also frustrated though.\n\nAs Israeli forces continue to bomb the Gaza Strip, residents are running out of food, medicine, and other critical supplies. He wonders where the outrage, the condemnation of human rights violations committed by the Israeli government is. Amro said it feels as though the outrage is cherry-picked, and he wants to know why it's so easy for so many to view Palestinians as less deserving of empathy and protection.\n\n\"My biggest frustration stems from this: when it comes to coverage of both sides, there’s a huge disparity in perception and a huge disparity in how these things are reported,\" Amro said.\n\nAmro, who has family in the West Bank, and Banat said misinformation about the conflict had spread rapidly on social media, amplified by some news outlets.\n\nDisinformation, Amro said, only serves to further dehumanize a population that has suffered greatly for decades.\n\n\"Now when Israel bombs the Gaza Strip — people’s first reaction isn’t usually 'oh that’s a human rights violation it’s…oh, they had it coming.'\"\n\n'Thousands of lives have been tragically ended'\n\nFor Greenstein, conversations with friends in Israel who bore witness to some of the atrocities, he said, \"has made it difficult to sleep.\"\n\nThe number of Jews murdered within Israel's borders, more than 1,200 as of Thursday, is the largest lethal attack of its kind targeting Jews since the Holocaust. Hamas, Greenstein pointed out, means \"violence\" in Hebrew. He said the group is not interested in peace and harmony.\n\n\"Just death and the annihilation of Israel and Jews everywhere,\" he said.\n\nGreenstein knows the reaction by the Israeli forces has inflicted pain on the people of Palestine and will continue to. The actions of Hamas, he noted, have nothing to do with helping the Palestinian people, but Palestinians will suffer regardless.\n\n\"Peace does not require love. If Israel acts with hatred, I will criticize. But Israel will have to exact justice. The pursuit of justice is not the same as acting with hatred,\" Greenstein said.\n\nKaltner also said that he does not see a clear resolution to the most recent outbreak of violence.\n\n“Thousands of lives have been tragically ended or permanently altered so far, and I believe it will continue on for some time. In particular, the fact that there are so many hostages will complicate efforts to end the conflict,” he said.\n\nWhile Memphis has not seen some of the large-scale demonstrations other American cities have seen since the outbreak of the war, a pro-Palestinian protest organized by University of Memphis students took place earlier in the week and hundreds gathered at the Jewish Community Center in East Memphis Wednesday evening to show support for Israel. A demonstration in support of those in Gaza was planned for Friday afternoon in Memphis.\n\nWhen did the most recent conflict start?\n\nOn Saturday, Hamas launched a multi-pronged surprise attack which started with rockets, followed by a ground attack. Crossing the border into several towns in Southern Israel, Hamas fighters kidnapped dozens.\n\nThose attacks included a massacre at the Supernova music festival in a section of open desert near Kibbutz Re’im, about 2 miles from the Gaza border where at least 260 concert-goers were killed and others taken hostage. As of Thursday, Hamas was believed to be holding at least 150 hostages, including some U.S. citizens, and has threatened executions.\n\nIn response, Israel launched days of missile attacks that have hit homes, hospitals and at least one mosque in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised speech Sunday “We are at war and we will win it.” The Israeli military has been preparing for a ground invasion of Gaza which could come at any time.\n\nAs retaliatory strikes from the Israel Defense Forces continue, it is estimated that at least 250,000 people have fled their homes in Gaza, mostly taking shelter in packed United Nations schools.\n\nLive updates:Blinken meets Netanyahu, says US backs Israel; death toll tops 2,500\n\nHamas, classified as a terrorist group by the U.S., the European Union and others, said it attacked Israel in response to mounting Palestinian suffering under Israeli occupation and blockade of Gaza.\n\nGaza has endured a 16-year blockade by Israel and Egypt since Hamas took control of the area which has devastated Gaza's economy. According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, 81.5% of the population in Gaza lives in poverty and 63% are food insecure and depend on international assistance.\n\nThe Gaza Strip has an overall unemployment rate of 46.6%, according to UNRWA, and a youth unemployment rate of 62.3%.\n\nUSA Today and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/24/us/chesapeake-virginia-walmart-shooting-thursday/index.html", "title": "Walmart mass shooting: The motive behind the attack in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter an ordinary workday turned deadly at a Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia, survivors and investigators are spending the Thanksgiving holiday questioning the motive of an employee who opened fire on coworkers, killing six before fatally turning the gun on himself.\n\nEmployees were preparing for an overnight shift Tuesday when a manager opened fire with a handgun in the break room just after 10 p.m., officials said.\n\nAuthorities identified the people killed as Randy Blevins, 70, Lorenzo Gamble, 43, Tyneka Johnson, 22, Brian Pendleton, 38, Kellie Pyle, 52, and a 16-year-old boy, who’s not being named because he’s a minor.\n\nTwo people injured in the shooting remained hospitalized in critical condition on Thanksgiving, and one injured victim was discharged Wednesday, a Sentara Norfolk General Hospital spokesperson said.\n\n“I know this community, and I know it well. And I know that we will come together and lend a helping hand to the victims’ families,” Chesapeake Mayor Rick West said Wednesday in a video message.\n\nThe shooting, yet another example of how horrific gun violence upends American life in the most conventional settings, has left many grieving the loss of loved ones and survivors traumatized from what they witnessed. As the long journey of processing those emotions begins, questions on what could have led to the killings linger as investigators continue to dig for a motive.\n\nDonya Prioleau was inside the employee break room when the shooter began firing at coworkers, she said.\n\n“We don’t know what made him do this,” Prioleau said. “None of us can understand why it happened.”\n\n(From top left) Lorenzo Gamble, Kellie Pyle, Brian Pendleton, Tyneka Johnson and Randy Blevins Family Handout\n\nThe gunman was identified as Andre Bing, who was working as overnight “team lead.” The 31-year-old had been working for Walmart since 2010, the company said. Authorities have said he had one semi-automatic handgun and several ammunition magazines.\n\nBing shot three of Prioleau’s friends “before I took off running. Half of us didn’t believe it was real until some of us saw all the blood on the floor,” she said.\n\nTwo slain victims and the shooter were found in the break room, another victim was found at the front of the store, and three others died at the hospital, Chesapeake city officials said. Officials were still trying to determine the exact number of injuries as some people may have taken themselves to hospitals.\n\nThe mayor plans to hold a vigil Monday evening at City Park, according to a tweet from the city.\n\n“Today we are focused only of those hurt by Tuesday’s tragic event, but the police investigation continues and we expect to have additional information available tomorrow,” officials said in a Thursday tweet.\n\nThis week’s violence was at least the third mass shooting in Virginia this month, according to the Gun Violence Archive, and comes against the backdrop of grief many Americans around the country are enduring this Thanksgiving as loved ones were lost or wounded in shootings.\n\nJust 170 miles west of Chesapeake, a 22-year-old student at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville allegedly opened fire on fellow students November 13, killing three of them on a bus returning to campus from a field trip to Washington, DC.\n\nOver the weekend, a 22-year-old suspect shot and killed five people at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and injured 19 others, authorities said. And six months ago Thursday, a gunman in Uvalde, Texas, killed 19 students and two teachers, a tragedy in which victims are still seeking answers.\n\n“How do you celebrate when your devastated. How do you give thanks, when you have nothing left to give. How do you fake it and smile when you wake up crying,” Brett Cross wrote Thursday of his nephew, Uziyah Garcia, who was killed in Uvalde.\n\nOverall, the US has suffered more than 600 mass shootings so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Both the nonprofit and CNN define mass shootings as those in which four or more people are shot, not including the assailant.\n\nSpeaking to the epidemic, Arizona’s former US Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was seriously wounded in a 2011 mass shooting, tweeted a Thanksgiving Eve plea for reforms: “We cannot continue to be the nation of gun violence and mass shootings. We cannot live like this. We must act.”\n\n‘I stayed just so they wouldn’t be alone’\n\nIn Chesapeake, the horror began less than an hour before the store was set to close after a busy holiday shopping day.\n\nJessie Wilczewski, who was recently hired, told CNN she was in a regularly scheduled meeting in the break room when she saw the shooter in the doorway pointing a gun.\n\nInitially, she didn’t think what she was seeing was real, but then she felt her chest pounding and her ears ringing as a torrent of gunshots erupted, she said. At first, it “didn’t register as real,” she said, until the sound of the shots reverberated through her chest.\n\nWilczewski hid under a table as the gunman walked down a nearby hallway. She could see some of her coworkers on the floor or lying on chairs – all still and some likely dead, she said. She stayed because she didn’t want to leave them alone.\n\n“I could have ran out that door … and I stayed. I stayed so they wouldn’t be alone in their last moments,” Wilczewski said in a message to the families of two victims.\n\nWhen the shooter returned to the break room, Wilczewski said, he told her to get out from under the table and go home.\n\n“I had to touch the door which was covered (in blood),” she said. “I just remember gripping my bag and thinking, ‘If he’s going to shoot me in the back – well, he’s going to have to try really hard cause I’m running,’ and I booked it. … and I didn’t stop until I got to my car and then I had a meltdown.”\n\nLashana Hicks (left) joins other mourners Wednesday at a memorial for those killed in a mass shooting at a Walmart Supercenter in Chesapeake, Virginia. Nathan Howard/Getty Images\n\nBriana Tyler, also a newly hired employee, had just begun her shift when the gunfire erupted.\n\n“All of a sudden you just hear pa pa pa pa pa pa pa,” Tyler told CNN, adding she saw bullets flying just inches from her face. “It wasn’t a break in between them to where you could really try to process it.”\n\nThe shooter had a “blank stare on his face” as he looked around the room and shot at people, Tyler said.\n\n“There were people just dropping to the floor,” she said. “Everybody was screaming, gasping, and yeah, he just walked away after that and just continued throughout the store and just kept shooting.”\n\nWhat we know about the suspect\n\nThe shooter displayed some disturbing behavior in the past, other employees said.\n\nShaundrayia Reese, who worked with the shooter from 2015 to 2018, described him as a loner.\n\n“He was always saying the government was watching him. He didn’t like social media and he kept black tape on his phone camera. Everyone always thought something was wrong with him,” Reese said.\n\nJoshua Johnson, a former maintenance worker at the store, said the shooter had made ominous threats if he ever lost his job.\n\n“He said if he ever got fired from his job, he would retaliate and people would remember who he was,” Johnson said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear Walmart employee who witnessed shooting describe manager's reputation 02:34 - Source: CNN\n\nNeither Johnson nor Reese reported any concerns about Bing to management, they said.\n\nIn a statement, Walmart said it was working with local law enforcement in the investigation.\n\n“We feel tragedies like this personally and deeply.

And on Monday, he took his deadly arsenal to Central Visual and Performing Arts High School and wreaked terror on his alma mater.\n\nBy the end of the rampage, a talented student and a heroic teacher were dead. Harris was killed by officers.\n\nAnd community members are stunned as to why the proactive interventions described by police didn’t seem to work.\n\n‘They made every effort’\n\nIn addition to removing Harris’ firearm from the house and getting mental health treatment for the teen, the gunman’s family took additional steps to help prevent trouble.\n\n“They would search his room on occasion because they were concerned,” the police commissioner said. “They were constantly in touch with the medical providers who were providing medical care for him.”\n\nHarris’ family also had a system to track the items he received in the mail and monitored his interactions with others to try to ensure he was engaging with people and felt loved, Sack said.\n\n“I’ve got to give credit to the family,” the police chief said. “They made every effort that they felt that they reasonably could. And I think that’s why the mother is so heartbroken over the families that paid for his episode.”\n\nMore details emerge from a revealing note\n\nAfter the gunman forced his way into the school and opened fire, investigators found a notebook and a handwritten note left in the car he drove, Sack said.\n\n“I don’t have any friends. I don’t have any family. I’ve never had a girlfriend. I’ve never had a social life. I’ve been an isolated loner my entire life,” the note said, according to Sack. “This was the perfect storm for a mass shooter.”\n\nThe notebook also revealed Harris seemed to feel a disconnect with the school community and had targeted his former high school, Sack said.\n\nThe gunman also wrote that his family didn’t know about his plans, Sack said. The police chief said the family never had access to the notebook.\n\n“Mental health is a difficult thing. It’s hard to tell when somebody who’s going to be violent, or act out, or if they’re just struggling, they’re depressed and they might self-harm,” the police commissioner said.\n\n“It’s just a terrible thing, and it’s hard to try and figure out what might have been in somebody’s mind.”\n\nTerrified students jumped from windows\n\nSt. Louis police said Orlando Harris used this AR-15-style rifle in Monday's school shooting. AP\n\nAfter the gunman burst into the school, a school official got on the intercom an urgent, coded message: “Miles Davis is in the building.”\n\nIt was a signal only heard during active shooter drills. But this time, it was real.\n\nTeacher Kristie Faulstich heard the phrase and locked her classroom door.\n\nLess than a minute later, someone started “violently jostling the handle, trying to get in,” Faulstich said.\n\nAlex Macias’ health teacher, Jean Kuczka, also locked her classroom door, the student told CNN affiliate KSDK.\n\nBut the gunman managed to “shoot his way in,” Alex said.\n\n“He did shoot Mrs. Kuczka, and I just closed my eyes,” Alex said. “I didn’t really want to see anything else. But then as I thought he was leaving, I opened my eyes to see him standing there making eye contact with me.\n\n“And then after he made eye contact, he just left.”\n\nStudents started jumping from the windows to escape, Alex recalled.\n\nBut her health teacher, Kuczka, was killed. The 61-year-old died trying to shield her students from the gunman, Faulstich said.\n\nA student, 15-year-old Alexandria Bell, was also killed. The avid dancer was less than a month away from celebrating her Sweet 16.\n\nThe school’s Dean of Arts Manfret McGhee ran for his life after a bullet missed him in a hallway, he told KSDK.\n\nHe hid in a bathroom, not knowing his own 16-year-old son had been shot. Then he ran to his son’s health class.\n\n“When I first saw him, I saw a massive hole in his pant leg, and all I could think of was, ‘My God, what did he get shot with?’” he said.\n\nMcGhee used his belt to stop the bleeding.\n\n‘It doesn’t take long to burn through a magazine’\n\nThe gunman was wearing a chest rig with seven magazines of ammunition, the police commissioner said. He also carried more ammunition in a bag and dumped additional magazines on the stairway and in the corridors along the way.\n\n“It doesn’t take long to burn through a magazine as you’re looking at a long corridor or up or down a stairwell or into a classroom,” Sack said.\n\nThe police commissioner has credited a quick police response, locked doors and prior training for preventing more deaths.\n\n“It was not by the grace of God and that the officers were as close as they were and responded in the manner that they did,” Sack said.\n\nSeven security personnel were also at the school when the gunman arrived, but the shooter did not enter through a checkpoint where security guards were stationed, said DeAndre Davis, director of safety and security for Saint Louis Public Schools.\n\nThe security guards stationed in the district’s schools are not armed, Davis said, but mobile officers who respond to calls at schools are.\n\n‘The building is riddled with bullets’\n\nThe mass shooting raised questions about whether it would have made a difference if the first person to confront the gunman was also armed.\n\nMatt Davis, the president of the St. Louis public school board, had a blunt answer: “The assailant had a high-powered rifle – so much so that he could force himself into a secured building. The building is riddled with bullets.”\n\n“I don’t know how much firepower it would take to stop that person. You saw the police response, it was massive. It was overwhelming,” Davis said.\n\n“I know what would have been different is if this high-powered rifle was not available to this individual. That would have made the difference.”\n\nThe St. Louis tragedy follows a long spate of school shootings committed by teenagers using AR-15-style rifles – including those in Uvalde, Texas; Parkland, Florida; and Newtown, Connecticut.\n\n“The fact that it takes this level of response to stop a shooting like this because people have access to these weapons of war and can bring them into our schools can never be normal,” Davis said.\n\n“This is our worst nightmare. … And it can’t happen again.”\n\nThe Saint Louis Public Schools district is planning to add gun safety to its curriculum, Superintendent Dr. Kelvin Adams said.\n\n“Not just reading, writing, and arithmetic, but reading, writing, arithmetic and gun safety,” he said.\n\nAdams said helping students understand how dangerous guns can be will help protect them in school, in their neighborhoods, and “quite frankly, everywhere now.”", "authors": ["Nouran Salahieh Holly Yan Rebekah Riess", "Nouran Salahieh", "Holly Yan", "Rebekah Riess"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/us/st-louis-school-shooting/index.html", "title": "St. Louis school shooting: Gunman who killed 61-year-old woman ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA teen and an adult were killed in a shooting at Central Visual and Performing Arts High School in St. Louis on Monday morning, police Commissioner Michael Sack said.\n\nOfficers arrived at the school four minutes after the first 911 call and it took them eight minutes to find the gunman. After a two-minute gun battle, the suspect was reported down, Sack told reporters at a news conference.\n\nAuthorities did not immediately identify the victims, but Sack said a 61-year-old woman was pronounced dead at a hospital and a 16-year-old girl was killed at the scene.\n\nThe commissioner identified the gunman as Orlando Harris, a 19-year-old who graduated from the school last year. He died at a hospital, Sack said.\n\nAuthorities are working to “try and come up with what might have led him to this. There’s suspicion, there may be some mental illness that he was experiencing. We are working on developing that information right now,” Sack said.\n\nThe shooter had no prior criminal history.\n\nSeven other teenagers were hurt and went to the hospital, Sack said. Some had gunshot or graze wounds and some had abrasions. One had a fractured ankle. They are all in stable conditions, the commissioner said.\n\nThe commissioner said the gunman had a long gun and around a dozen 30-round ammunition magazines with him.\n\nSack would not say how the gunman entered the school but said the school doors were locked, which delayed the suspect and bought responding officers time.\n\n“The security staff did an outstanding job identifying the suspect’s efforts to enter and immediately notified other staff and ensured that we were contacted,” Sack said.\n\nThere were security guards at the school at the time of the shooting, according to St. Louis Public Schools Communications Director George Sells.\n\n“We had the seven personnel working in the building who did a wonderful job getting the alarm sounded quickly.

Someone with an adult voice could be heard screaming, “You are all going to f**king die,” he recalled.\n\nShortly thereafter, a bullet came through one of the windows in his classroom, Williams said.\n\nThe gunshots picked up pace, he said.\n\nAbout then, officers from tactical teams arrived – a huge group of them, well organized – and there was another round of gunshots before Williams heard a woman announcing herself as police, he said.\n\nWilliams and the students ran to an emergency exit, he said, adding the ordeal lasted about 40 minutes.\n\nPolice engaged the shooter on the third floor, where Williams’ classroom is located, Sack said.\n\nSt. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly M. Gardner said many people reacted as trained to help save others from being hurt.\n\n“The situation is still developing and we will know more in the coming days, but one thing that is clear is that lockdown procedures – which St. Louis Public School’s administrators, teachers and students at Central Visual and Performing Arts High School and first responders followed as this attack unfolded – were essential in preventing further violence,” Gardner said.\n\nFBI, ATF assisting\n\nThe roughly 400-student high school is a magnet school about 6 miles southwest of downtown.\n\nStudents were being evacuated from campus “to safe and secure sites,” the district said.

On November 1, Nikolas Cruz will be sentenced for the February 2018 shooting at Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 people died.\n\nAs the investigation into the St,. Louis shooting was unfolding, a Michigan prosecutor addressed the nation’s gun violence in the wake of Crumbley’s guilty plea.\n\n“It’s not just about sharing with other departments. Gun violence is preventable. That’s what I’ve learned, and the fact that there is another school shooting does not surprise me – which is horrific,” Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said. “It is preventable, and we should never, ever allow that to be something we just should have to live with.”\n\nDuring a news conference at the White House, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre demanded Congress take action and pass an assault weapons ban.\n\n“Our hearts go out to everyone impacted by today’s senseless violence, particularly those injured and killed, their families as well as the first respondents,” she said. “We need additional action to stop the scourge of gun violence.\n\n“Every day that the Senate fails to send an assault weapons ban to the President’s desk, or waits to take another – other common-sense actions is a day too late for our families and communities impacted by gun violence.”\n\nThe FBI’s St. Louis field office is assisting local law enforcement in its response to the shooting, spokesperson Rebecca Wu said.

Vinicius Junior appeared completely unmarked at the far post on the hour mark to turn home Federico Valverde’s low cross and secure the 1-0 win and Real’s 14th European crown.\n\nReal defender Nacho described what his team had done in the knockout stages of the Champions League as “magic” and many questioned whether those improbable escape acts were possible outside of the Bernabeu.\n\nBut doubt Real at your peril. This team always has another trick up its sleeve.\n\nWhen the full time whistle went, Real’s bench erupted and emptied onto the pitch. Beside themselves with joy, some players sank to the floor and others ran to share the moment with their fans.\n\nIt was yet another night of trials and tribulations for Real in this season’s Champions League, but there is little anyone can do – even this remarkable Liverpool side – when Los Blancos seemingly have a date with destiny.\n\nAncelotti summed it up perhaps as well as anyone can hope to. “This club is special,” he said.\n\nReal Madrid's players celebrate on the pitch as the referee blew the final whistle. ANP/Getty Images\n\nUgly scenes pre-match\n\nReal Madrid fans had filled their end of the stadium almost entirely more than an hour before kick-off and treated their players to a thunderous welcome as they emerged from the tunnel for their warmup.\n\nIt took a little while longer for Liverpool supporters to filter into the ground, but those that had taken their seats serenaded the men in red with a bellowing rendition of ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ as the warm ups came to an end.\n\nThe atmosphere generated by both sets of fans was spine-tingling and there was an electricity in the air that is reserved only for these kinds of occasions.\n\nHowever, kick-off was delayed by more than 35 minutes due to unsavoury scenes outside the stadium, with many fans unable to get in and with tear gas used by authorities.\n\nSome people were seen climbing over the closed gates to make their way into the ground as a dangerous bottleneck formed around one particular entry point.\n\nEuropean football’s governing body, UEFA, released a statement saying “the turnstiles at the Liverpool end became blocked by thousands fans who had purchased fake tickets which did not work in the turnstiles.”\n\nIt added: “As numbers outside the stadium continued to build up after kick off, the police dispersed them with tear gas and forced them away from the stadium.”\n\n“UEFA is sympathetic to those affected by these events and will further review these matters urgently together with the French police and authorities, and with the French Football Federation.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Paris Police Prefecture said: “People without tickets forced the barriers and tried to get inside the stadium to watch the match. These attempts created crowd movements.”\n\nHowever, many fans with tickets say they were held back from entering the stadium in over crowded areas.\n\nIn a statement, Liverpool said it was “hugely disappointed” by the issues outside the stadium and called for a formal investigation.\n\n“I couldn’t speak to my family yet, but I know the families had real struggles to get into the stadium,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said after the game.\n\n“I heard a few things that were not good, it was obviously pretty tricky out there but I don’t know more about it.”\n\nLiverpool fans struggled to get into the stadium prior to the match. Matthias Hangst/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nThe length of the delay meant the teams had to reemerge for a second warm up before the game had started.\n\nWith both sets of fans gearing up for the original 9 p.m. local kick-off time – and no in-stadium update coming until fifteen minutes later – there was a palpable tension in the air with many confused conversations taking place between supporters.\n\nBut the appearance of FIFA president Gianni Infantino on the big screens roused the fans from slumber, as he was met with resounding boos and jeers from the entire stadium.\n\nWhen singer Camila Cabello finally began the pre-match entertainment almost half an hour after the match should have kicked off, supporters of both teams took it in turns to drown out her singing, which was barely audible over Real’s ‘Ole, Ole, Ole’ and Liverpool’s Allez, Allez, Allez.’\n\nLiverpool dominance\n\nThe delay had clearly affected the players, as both teams struggled to find any sort of rhythm in the opening stages. Passes were going astray, clearances were being skewed and both sides struggled to find any inroads into the opposition’s area.\n\nWhen the first chance finally arrived more than 15 minutes into the game it was thanks to fine individual work from Trent Alexander-Arnold, who weaved his way past two Real defenders before digging out a low cross into the box.\n\nMo Salah was there to meet it, but it arrived at his feet somewhat awkwardly and Thibaut Courtois was equal to it. Salah’s second chance arrived soon after, but this one was hit straight at the Real goalkeeper.\n\nIt was the first time either team had managed to exert any sustained pressure on the other, and the Liverpool fans were soon groaning once again as Alexander-Arnold blazed high over the bar when well placed inside the box.\n\nAfter more than five minutes of continuous waves of red shirts battering the Real defense, Sadio Mane thought he had found the opener only for Courtois to improbably get a hand to his shot and palm it onto the post.\n\nIt’s a testament to just how remarkable the save was that most of the Liverpool fans at the other end of the stadium had already started celebrating in anticipation of the net rippling.\n\nAt this stage, almost 30 minutes in, the best Real was able to muster was an overhit cross from Vinicius that looked for a split second like it might trouble Alisson in the Liverpool goal.\n\nThere was now a clear pattern emerging; those in white were penned into their own half, rattled and unable to escape the Liverpool onslaught.\n\nVinicius Junior scores the only game in the final. Matthias Hangst/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nReal’s fans, to their credit, continued to chant and wave their flags and scarves in an attempt to breathe life into their floundering team. They had the best seats in the house to witness Liverpool’s near-perfect first half, but fortunately for them the only thing they hadn’t seen up close was a goal.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, Carlo Ancelotti’s side looked as though it had taken the lead completely against the run of play. After the ball had ricocheted around the penalty area, Benzema pounced to slot the ball home under Alisson, only to see his goal immediately ruled out by the linesman’s flag.\n\nWhat initially looked like an easy offside decision ended up taking what felt like an age to confirm, as VAR officials struggled to decide whether the initial ball had come off a Liverpool player.\n\nEventually, after a nerve-racking wait, it was those in red celebrating boisterously as the offside decision was confirmed. It was a suitably tense end to what had been an enthralling first half.\n\nReal pounces\n\nThere was a familiarity with the way the second half began to unfold, as Liverpool maintained the pressure on a Real side that quickly looked to be sinking under the weight of the occasion.\n\nIt was a strange sight. After all, this is a team that has made it’s name in this competition, constantly rewriting the record books and pulling off the seemingly impossible.\n\nThen the goal came. It was against the run of play, yes, with Liverpool looking like the only team that would score for the opening hour but, in truth, this goal still felt inevitable. It always does when Real Madrid is playing.\n\nValverde found himself in space down the right and drilled a teasing low pass across the face of the goal, with Vinicius on hand at the far post to tap the ball into an empty net.\n\nCue bedlam. The concrete stairs inside the Stade de France began to shudder as the celebrations from Real fans lasted almost five minutes. Numerous flares were let off as that end of the stadium began to glow red and smoke filled the chilly Parisian air.\n\nSalah did his best to drag Liverpool level, cutting inside and bending a wonderful shot towards the far post, but Courtois was once again able to palm it away at full stretch.\n\nThibaut Courtois produced a stunning display in goal for Real Madrid. Matthias Hangst/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nCourtois saves Madrid\n\nVinicius will take the plaudits for his winning goal, but when the dust settles, Courtois’ performance will be spoken about as one of the all-time greats from a goalkeeper in a Champions League final.\n\nAs the clock ticked down, he once again kept Salah at bay, this time flicking the ball behind for a corner as the Egyptian’s shot hurtled for the far corner.\n\n“When the goalkeeper is man of the match, something is going wrong for the other team. In the last third we could have done better,” Klopp said after the match.\n\nWith every opportunity squandered, the inevitability of a Madrid win grew. Real fans felt it; so did Liverpool’s.\n\nThough Klopp’s side continued to press until the end, celebrations had already started for the Madrid fans. The outpouring of joy when the full-time whistle went was largely tinged with relief – those fans know what an ordeal this night was.\n\nReal Madrid should not have made it this far. Three times it was staring defeat in the face during the campaign and three times it somehow came out the other side.\n\nBut once it made it to Paris, perhaps there should have been no doubt this would be the final outcome.", "authors": ["Matias Grez"], "publish_date": "2022/05/28"}]}

While most of the dust quickly settles down, some small particles can be carried by the wind and can travel huge distances, even reaching Europe.\n\nIn the current situation, an area of low pressure over Libya prompted strong southerly winds which brought in high concentration of dust and sand from North Africa into Greece, especially on Tuesday, BBC said. The winds also brought hot desert air with them causing the temperatures to rise significantly across the Greek mainland and islands.\n\nThe strong southernly winds have also prompted early wildfires in the country's south.

Germany recorded its hottest day of the year as temperatures reached 104.5 F (40.3C) at a measuring station in Bad Mergentheim-Neunkirchen, in the center of the country, while Hungary and Italy have been hit with high temperatures of around 100 F (nearly 38C) in places.\n\nThe European Forest Fire Information System put 19 European countries on “extreme danger” alerts for wildfires on Wednesday, across an expanse stretching from Portugal and Spain in the southwest to Albania and Turkey in the southeast.\n\nThere was some respite in the UK, where temperatures dipped from an all-time high of 40.3 C (104.5 F) on Tuesday back into the 20s. But some residential areas around London were left in ruins after fires broke out across parts of the capital, stretching the fire service to its limits.\n\n“Yesterday was the busiest day for the fire service in London since the Second World War,” London’s mayor Sadiq Khan told Sky News on Wednesday, as residents of the capital watched their homes destroyed in heat-triggered blazes they never thought possible.\n\nA resident of Wennington, a London suburb affected by Tuesday’s fires, told CNN that the gardens on his street were “like a tinder box” in the days leading up to the fire. Stock lost his home, eight chickens and two beehives when the fire broke out.\n\n“I didn’t sleep last night. I was in the hotel room thinking how bad it could have gone. I just thank god that everyone got out alive,” he said. “We’ve lost everything. But when we get back, we can clear the site, put some fences up, get a couple of mobile homes and we’ll start again.”\n\nLondon had no available fire engines at one point in the afternoon amid unprecedented demand, a senior fireman with the London Fire Brigade’s special rescue team told CNN.\n\nIn the United States, local leaders are urging caution and issuing health warnings as a heat wave that shows no sign of slowing before the weekend continues to bake the south-central regions of the country.\n\nAnd in China, millions of densely-populated cities are responding to extreme heat.

The warmth, dryness and strong winds associated with the dust clouds have been shown to suppress tropical cyclones.\n\n\"SAL activity typically ramps up in mid-June and peaks from late June to mid-August, with new outbreaks occurring every three to five days,\" Principal Investigator Dr. Jason Dunion, a University of Miami hurricane researcher, said.\n\n\"During this peak period, it is common for individual SAL outbreaks to reach farther to the west — as far west as Florida, Central America and even Texas — and cover extensive areas of the Atlantic.\"\n\nHow does the SAL influence weather and climate?\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, there are three characteristics of these Saharan dust outbreaks that can affect tropical cyclones, tropical disturbances, and the general climatology of the Atlantic tropical atmosphere:\n\nExtremely Dry Air: The Saharan Air Layer’s dry, dusty air has about 50% less moisture than the typical tropical atmosphere. This extremely dry air can weaken a tropical cyclone or tropical disturbance by promoting downdrafts around the storm. African Easterly Jet: Strong winds in the Saharan Air Layer (25-55 mph or 10-25 meters per second) can substantially increase the vertical wind shear in and around the storm environment. This “mid-level jet” of enhanced winds, typically found at a height of 6,500-14,500 feet (2000-4500 meters), can cause tilting of the tropical cyclone vortex with height and can disrupt the storm’s internal heat engine. Warm Temperatures: The Saharan Air Layer’s warmth acts to stabilize the atmosphere, which can suppress the formation of clouds. This stabilizing effect is produced when the Saharan Air Layer’s warm, buoyant air rides above relatively cooler, denser air. The Saharan Air Layer’s suspended mineral dust also absorbs sunlight, which helps maintain its warmth as it crosses the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nSaharan dust has vibrant sunsets\n\nIn short terms... Because of the special way Saharan dust scatters sunlight, the best times of day to spot it are usually a few hours after sunrise and in the late afternoon, according to the SAL website. During the day, the sky will have a hazy white look and sunsets will take on an orange glow.\n\nIn long terms... The sun's white light is composed of all the colors of the rainbow. Our skies are normally blue because the gases that make up the atmosphere naturally scatter blue hues (shorter wavelengths) as opposed to the yellow-orange-red hues (longer wavelengths). Sunsets and sunrises take on more yellow and reddish hues because the low-angle sunlight passes through more of the atmosphere before it reaches your eyes. A heavy load of dust in the atmosphere can enhance this effect, leading to longer-lasting, duskier colors that cause vivid sunsets and sunrises.\n\nWhat to expect the rest of August\n\n“Quite a bit” of Saharan dust comes across the Atlantic around this time of year, according to Brendan Schaper, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Melbourne, Florida.\n\n“It can continue. Right now we're seeing a decent plume across the tropical Atlantic,” Schaper said. “And that may continue for the next couple of weeks, depending on the flow off of the coast of Africa.”\n\nHe said activity in the tropics will “determine the strength and nature of where that layer actually kind of goes.”\n\nIn terms of the Treasure Coast, Schaper said, rain chances are expected to increase over the weekend.\n\n“We've got around 50% there on Saturday, and then on Sunday going up into the 60% and 70% range,” he said. “We do expect a kind of a moistening of the atmosphere in general across East Central Florida this weekend.”\n\nHe said there is nothing on the radar in the near future in terms of storms.\n\nGrace Pateras is a digital producer for the USA TODAY Network.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has spied clouds on one of the solar system’s most intriguing moons.\n\nIn November, the space observatory turned its infrared gaze on Saturn’s largest moon, Titan. It’s the only moon in our solar system that has a dense atmosphere — four times denser than Earth’s.\n\nTitan’s atmosphere is made of nitrogen and methane, which gives it a fuzzy, orange appearance. This thick haze obscures visible light from reflecting off the moon’s surface, making it difficult to discern features.\n\nThe Webb telescope observes the universe in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye — on November 5, the telescope spotted a bright cloud in Titan’s northern hemisphere and, soon after, detected a second cloud in the atmosphere.\n\nThe larger cloud was located over Titan’s northern polar region near Kraken Mare, the largest known liquid sea of methane on the moon’s surface.\n\nTitan has Earth-like liquid bodies on its surface, but its rivers, lakes and seas are made of liquid ethane and methane, which form clouds and cause rain from the sky. Researchers also believe Titan has an internal liquid water ocean.\n\nThe Webb telescope's instruments captured these views of Titan. Clouds and other features are labeled, including a methane sea called Kraken Mare, the sand dunes of Belet and a bright spot called Adiri. NASA/ESA/CSA\n\n“Detecting clouds is exciting because it validates long-held predictions from computer models about Titan’s climate, that clouds would form readily in the mid-northern hemisphere during its late summertime when the surface is warmed by the Sun,” cowrote Conor Nixon, a planetary scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, on NASA’s Webb blog.\n\nNixon is also the principal investigator on the Webb observation program for Titan.\n\nThe team of astronomers studying the Webb observations reached out to colleagues at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to see if follow-up observations could reveal if the clouds were moving or changing shape.\n\n“We were concerned that the clouds would be gone when we looked at Titan two days later with Keck, but to our delight there were clouds at the same positions, looking like they had changed in shape,” said Imke de Pater, emeritus professor of astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley, and lead of the Keck Titan Observing Team, in a statement.\n\nAstronomers compared Webb (left) and Keck images of Titan to see how clouds evolved. Cloud A seems to be rotating, while Cloud B seems to be dissipating. NASA/ESA/CSA\n\nAtmospheric modeling experts helped the team determine that the two telescopes had captured observations of seasonal weather patterns on Titan.\n\nWebb’s Near-Infrared Spectrograph instrument was also able to collect data on Titan’s lower atmosphere, which can’t be seen by ground-based observatories such as Keck due to interference from Earth’s atmosphere, in different wavelengths of infrared light.\n\nThe data, which is still being analyzed, was able to see deeper into Titan’s atmosphere and surface than the Cassini spacecraft, which orbited Saturn and its moons for 13 years. Webb’s observations could also reveal the cause of a bright feature over Titan’s south pole.\n\nThe cloud observations were a long time coming.\n\n“We had waited for years to use Webb’s infrared vision to study Titan’s atmosphere, including its fascinating weather patterns and gaseous composition, and also see through the haze to study albedo features on the surface,” Nixon said, referring to the bright and dark patches.\n\n“Titan’s atmosphere is incredibly interesting, not only due to its methane clouds and storms, but also because of what it can tell us about Titan’s past and future — including whether it always had an atmosphere. We were absolutely delighted with the initial results.”\n\nThe team is planning more observations of Titan in June that may provide additional information about the gases in its atmosphere.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/health/easing-covid-restrictions-pandemic-end-explainer/index.html", "title": "This map is the key to when US might start easing Covid-19 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThere is now more optimism that the worst of the coronavirus pandemic may be ending – and as other nations lift certain Covid-19 restrictions, some public health experts question whether US counties and cities should consider easing their guidance on mask-wearing or social distancing, as well.\n\nBut others warn not to relax such measures too soon.\n\nDenmark has decided to lift all Covid-19 restrictions within the country, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced Wednesday evening, adding that Covid-19 “should no longer be categorized as a socially critical sickness.”\n\n“Denmark will be completely open from 1 February,” Frederiksen said. “Tonight we can start lowering our shoulders and find our smiles again.\n\n“The pandemic is still here, but with what we know now, we dare to believe that we are through the critical phase,” Frederiksen added, highlighting the success of Denmark’s vaccination program and booster shots.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, people in England no longer have to show their Covid-19 vaccination passes to get into nightclubs and other large venues. Masks aren’t required in any public places, although they remain recommended on public transport. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are also easing their restrictions.\n\nBut in the United States, “we know there is still much to be done to stop the spread of COVID-19 and end the pandemic. We are still seeing far too many new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths,” Kristen Nordlund, a spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote in an email to CNN on Friday.\n\nThe US daily average of cases is near 500,000, with more than 1,000 deaths, according to the CDC, which encourages everyone to get vaccinated and boosted if they’re eligible.\n\n“As we look forward to the spring, it’s important to continue practicing prevention measures that we know work – vaccinating, wearing a mask in public, indoor settings, staying home when you are sick, and washing your hands frequently,” Nordlund wrote.\n\nMany US counties and cities rely on coronavirus transmission rates to determine when or if to ease restrictions and recommendations – and nearly every single county is still experiencing high levels of spread.\n\nCommunity transmission is still key metric\n\nIn the United States, most Covid-19 orders happen at the local level.\n\nAnd the CDC’s data on coronavirus transmission by county is used as a key metric in decision-making around public health policies and when certain restrictions should be implemented or lifted, Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nThe CDC tracks and measures the spread of the virus by county and presents its findings on a map using a four-tiered, color-coded system that shades in counties with “high” levels of transmission as red, those with “substantial” levels as orange, “moderate” levels as yellow and “low” levels as blue.\n\n“This is really important,” Freeman said of the data.\n\n“It’s based on new cases per 100,000 persons in the past seven days. Low is less than 10. Moderate is another range, substantial another and high is another,” she said. “And then a secondary indicator is percentage of positive (nucleic acid amplification) tests during the past seven days.”\n\nThe CDC defines low transmission of the coronavirus as a community having fewer than 10 new cases per 100,000 people in the past week and less than 5% test positivity during the past week. High transmission is at least 100 new cases per 100,000 people in the past week, and 10% or greater percentage of positive tests.\n\nAs of Monday, nearly all counties are in the red, with high levels of transmission.\n\nOnly four are identified as having low levels: Kalawao County, Hawaii; King County, Texas; Arthur County, Nebraska; and Terrell County, Texas. Glasscock County, Texas, is identified as having substantial transmission.\n\n“The whole country is still red,” Freeman said. “So we haven’t yet overcome this latest surge.”\n\nIn Columbus, Ohio, the recommendation for the city’s mask order is “that we need to be in CDC’s yellow category for moderate community transmission for four consecutive weeks” before the order can be lifted, spokesperson Kelli Newman wrote to CNN in an email Friday.\n\nIn North Carolina’s Mecklenburg County, there is an indoor mask mandate in place that will automatically lift once the percent positivity rate for the county falls below 5% for seven consecutive days, Raynard Washington, the county’s public health director, told CNN on Friday.\n\n“Within that mandate, there’s actually a stipulation that’s tied to community transmission, at which once the community reaches a certain level of transmission, as measured by percent positivity, the mask mandate itself will automatically be rescinded,” Washington said.\n\nHe added that right now, the county is “a bit away” from reaching that low level.\n\nIn San Francisco, city officials announced Thursday that even though Covid-19 cases are “still high,” they are “dropping rapidly” and beginning Tuesday, city office workers, gym members and some other groups of people may remove their masks indoors if they are “up to date” on their vaccinations.\n\nIn Colorado, the state Department of Public Health and Environment on Friday removed the requirement that people must show proof of vaccination to attend unseated, public indoor events of more than 500 attendees in Arapahoe, Adams, Boulder, and Jefferson counties — as well as the City and County of Denver, and the City and County of Broomfield.\n\nHealth officials in Colorado have told reporters that the statewide percent positivity remains high, but shows “encouraging” decreases.\n\nThere is no definitive, blanket guidance from the CDC on when communities should lift certain Covid-19 policies and return to some version of normal.\n\nBut NACCHO plans to hold brainstorming and listening sessions this spring with local and federal public health officers to discuss what the end of the pandemic might look like – and how to determine when we’ve reached the end.\n\n“NACCHO is having meetings coming up in the spring where we’re really actively focused on these discussions, but we’re hoping before then, we’ll have a little bit more direction and guidance to go on,” Freeman said, adding that the first meeting is scheduled for April.\n\nShe expects representatives from the CDC, Health and Human Services’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be in attendance.\n\nIt is going to be a “real challenge” to determine a clear benchmark for when Covid-19 health measures should lift in the United States, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said Sunday.\n\n“Right now, you look at a lot of federal health guidance and it says that these measures should be lifted when there’s low prevalence,” Gottlieb told CBS’s Margaret Brennan on Face The Nation.\n\n“That was the old measure. In the age of Omicron, with a much more contagious variant and with the fact that the population has a lot of immunity, so we’re less susceptible overall, we may need to rethink that,” Gottlieb said Sunday.\n\n“We may need to decide that once we get to 20 cases per 100,000 per day that may be the point at which we start to withdraw these things,” he said. “I’m not so sure we’re going to get to 10 anytime soon. Right now, Washington DC is at 15. New York’s at 75. With this new Omicron strain that’s circling we may stall out around 20 – and that may be the point where we have to consider withdrawing a lot of these measures.”\n\n‘We’re in a better place now’\n\nAs the United States marks two years since the first laboratory-confirmed case of Covid-19, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said last week he’s feeling positive about the direction the nation is headed.\n\n“I am more optimistic about the pandemic today than I have been since it was declared a pandemic nearly two years ago,” Frieden, currently the CEO and president of a global health initiative called Resolve to Save Lives, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nFrieden added that the “flash flood” of cases stemming from a surge of the Omicron variant should soon slow, largely as a result of effective vaccines.\n\n“We don’t know if there will be another wave, but we do know that we’ve got much stronger defenses than we’ve ever had,” Frieden said. “We’re in much better shape than we’ve ever been. But we do need to hang on for just a few more weeks, until the Omicron flood recedes, so we don’t overwhelm the hospitals, which are really stressed out.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nUS Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has said he shares Frieden’s optimism that the nation is in better shape, but he urges Americans to remain vigilant against Covid-19.\n\n“I certainly share the optimism that we’re in a better place now, and we will be in a better place in a few weeks, but I don’t think that means that we should take our foot off the accelerator,” Murthy told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Thursday, though he added that we shouldn’t underestimate the coronavirus.\n\n“What gives me more optimism and hope, Jake, is the fact that we not only have abundantly available vaccines – we not only see that they’re working well to protect people against hospitalization and death – but we have more therapeutics,” Murthy said.\n\n“These together, along with a targeted use of tests and masks, this is what I believe is going to help us get through future waves, as well.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard Carma Hassan", "Jacqueline Howard", "Carma Hassan"], "publish_date": "2022/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/weather/buffalo-winter-storm-new-york-blizzard-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Winter storm in Buffalo: Crews work to clear snow-covered roads ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe winter storm death toll has risen to 37 in Erie County, New York, as crews continue to clear roads and first responders check on people they couldn’t reach days ago when the catastrophic weather system swept the nation, officials there said Wednesday.\n\nAt least 25 others across 11 US states also have been reported dead in the storm, which buried the city of Buffalo in nearly 52 inches of snow, trapping residents in western New York at home – many without heat as the Christmas weekend blizzard took out power lines.\n\n“It’s a horrible storm with too many deaths,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said at a news conference as he praised first responders, without whom “more people would have died.”\n\nNow, authorities are going door-to-door to conduct wellness checks, Poloncarz said: An EMS task force is checking locations of emergency calls that authorities could not reach during the storm, while the National Guard will spend the next couple days checking every house in neighborhoods that lost power.\n\n“We are fearful that there are individuals who may have perished living alone or people who were not doing well in an establishment, especially those that still don’t have power,” Poloncarz said.\n\nBuffalo police completed sifting through 911 calls going back to the early days of the storm, Commissioner Joseph A. Gramaglia said Wednesday. He told CNN’s Pamela Brown that it was a “tremendous” effort that also resulted in the recovery of a “substantial” number of bodies. The task included requests for welfare checks.\n\nGramaglia said he expects rising temperatures in the coming days will melt the snow and uncover more storm victims.\n\nAmid the frigid, whiteout conditions, “people … got stranded in their vehicles and passed away in their cars. We have people that were walking during blizzard conditions and passed away on the street, passed away in snowbanks,” Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said. “And we have people that were found that passed away in their homes.”\n\nNational Guard members check on Buffalo residents on Wednesday, December 28, 2022.

In one of those cases, emergency responders could not get to the person because of the snow, he told CNN a day earlier.\n\n“They were blocked, and by the time they got there it was too late,” Poloncarz said.\n\nOne Buffalo EMT told CNN she was stuck in her ambulance for hours Friday after trying to respond to an emergency call during the snowstorm.\n\n“The main reason we were getting stuck is because there were cars in the way,” said Joycelyn Benton, an advanced EMT at American Medical Response of Western New York.

Two-thirds of the equipment dispatched to help clear winter snow during the height of the storm also got stuck, he said.\n\nPoloncarz was asked Wednesday about the timing of the driving ban, which went into effect Friday at 9:30 a.m. as the storm hit, and whether there had been discussion among officials about issuing such a ban earlier.\n\nOfficials started discussing a potential ban last Thursday, Poloncarz said, but they initially believed the snow band wouldn’t reach the Erie County until 10 a.m. the next morning. They opted to wait, in part, because officials wanted workers to be able to get home before temperatures dropped below freezing, he said.\n\nOn Friday morning, temperatures “dropped dramatically,” going from rain to sleet to snow within five minutes around 8:40 a.m., he said. Whiteout conditions didn’t occur until about 10 a.m., he noted, after the ban was issued.\n\n“But we have to take a lot into consideration,” Poloncarz said. “If anyone is to be blamed, you can blame me. I’m the one who has to make the final call on behalf of the county.”\n\nCity faces criticism over cleanup; mayor says city working hard\n\nPoloncarz, the county executive, on Wednesday criticized how Buffalo’s mayor has handled storm cleanup efforts, saying Brown has not been on daily coordination calls with other municipalities and that the city has been slow to reopen.\n\n“I am a city resident myself, I live in the city of Buffalo, and it pains me to see the other 25 towns and two small cities opened in times when the city isn’t,” Poloncarz said, adding that the county should take over cleanup efforts so the city can fully reopen.\n\nWhen asked about those remarks, the mayor dismissed the criticism, telling CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday evening, “I’m not concerned about those comments, my concern is for the residents of the city of Buffalo.”\n\n“I’ve just completed hours of touring neighborhoods throughout the city, watching the plowing operations,” Brown said, adding there were agencies from the city, county and state working in recovery efforts who have been doing a “great job working together, working around the clock.”\n\n“We believe that by tonight, we’ll have 100% of streets opened up in the city of Buffalo and it’s my hope to be able to lift the … driving ban before the start of business tomorrow,” Brown added.\n\nOther local leaders have urged a review of how the storm was handled.\n\nA person clears snow along a Buffalo road on Wednesday, December 28. Jeffrey T. Barnes/AP\n\nDozens of people rescued by National Guard\n\nThere were 580 New York National Guard soldiers and airmen on the ground Wednesday in the Buffalo area, according to the force’s public affairs office.\n\nThey have two separate missions: Teams of four soldiers go door-to-door to see if residents have power, heat and food – and distributing ready-to-eat meals, or MREs, and water as needed; and teams of two soldiers and two medical providers conduct wellness checks, spokesperson Eric Durr told CNN.\n\nAs of Tuesday, they had rescued at least 86 people “from hazardous situations,” according to a news release, including a woman taken to a hospital just before giving birth.\n\nSeparately, a member of the 105th Military Police Company “learned from his mother that a pregnant woman he was close to had gone into labor,” the release said.\n\n“He went to her home,” it said, “helped deliver the baby, then reported for duty.”\n\nPreparations for flooding\n\nMeantime, Buffalo faces a small risk of flooding as rising temperatures begin to melt the massive amount of snow and 2 inches of rain is forecast through the weekend, the National Weather Service said.\n\nBut “it should take around an inch of rain from this system before flooding becomes a concern,” the weather service said.\n\nIn a news release on Wednesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced she directed state agencies to help support the affected communities with flood response resources.\n\nResources including generators, pumps and more than 700,000 sandbags were available for deployment from state stockpiles in Erie and Monroe counties, the release said.\n\nNationwide death toll rises\n\nIn Erie County, 29 who died were in the city of Buffalo, while seven were located in the suburbs, Poloncarz said Wednesday, adding he did not know where one person was found. Multiple bodies remain unidentified, Poloncarz added.\n\nHe has asked that anyone with a missing family member to call local police to help with the ID process.\n\nAmong the storm’s victims is Anndel Taylor, 22, whose family said she was found dead in Buffalo over the holiday weekend after getting trapped in her car by the blizzard.\n\nAfter losing contact with her, the family posted her location to a private Facebook page related to the storm to ask for help, and a man called to say he had found her without a pulse, her sister said.\n\nThe winter storm’s grim effects have been widespread, with at least 62 storm-related deaths reported across several states:\n\n• New York: In addition to the 37 deaths in Erie County, one fatal carbon monoxide poisoning was reported in Niagara County. The preliminary investigation indicates snow “covered the external furnace causing carbon monoxide to enter the residence,” the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release Wednesday, identifying the victim as 27-year-old Timothy M.

The snowfall and blizzard conditions made roads impassable, froze power substations and left more than a dozen people dead, Erie County officials said.\n\nThe conditions eased slightly on Sunday, allowing emergency responders to get out and see the extent of the problem.\n\n“I don’t want to say that this is going to be it because that would be a fallacy for me to say that, because we know that there are people who have been stuck in cars for more than two days,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said Sunday. “There are people in homes who are below freezing temperatures.”\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul called it the “most devastating storm in Buffalo’s long storied history” due to its power and its extended length.\n\n“It’s a crisis of epic proportion,” Hochul told CNN’s Paula Reid on Sunday.\n\nOver the past week, this winter storm brought dangerously cold temperatures, blizzard conditions and coastal flooding to almost the entirety of the US, wrecking Christmas plans along the way.\n\nMore than 55 million people were under wind chill alerts Sunday morning, and freeze warnings are in effect across the South.\n\nThe blizzard conditions persisted Sunday across the Great Lakes, while frigid cold temperatures gripped the eastern two-thirds of the country.\n\nSome major cities in the Southeast, Midwest and East Coast recorded their coldest Christmas in decades. In Florida, it will be the coldest December 25 since 1983 for Miami, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach.\n\nNew York City also saw record cold temperatures on Christmas Eve at several locations, including its JFK and LaGuardia airports. The high at Central Park was 15 degrees, marking it the second-coldest December 24 in at least 150 years, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nTemperatures are forecast to rebound later in the week with a much-welcomed warming trend with above-normal temperatures.\n\nAbout 250,000 homes and businesses in the US had no electricity service as of about 11 a.m. ET Sunday, with nearly half of those affected in Maine and New York, according to PowerOutage.us.

The operator warned rolling blackouts could happen if the strain becomes too much.\n\nIn New York, utility companies Con Edison and Natural Grid US also urged customers to conserve energy, citing extreme weather conditions and increased energy demand on interstate pipelines carrying natural gas into the city.\n\nMeanwhile, a shortage of electricity in Texas prompted the US Department of Energy to declare an emergency Friday, allowing the state’s energy provider to exceed environmental emissions standards until energy usage drops.\n\nIn Jackson, Mississippi, frigid temperatures are hampering efforts to repair a large water main break late Saturday, which has caused a loss in water pressure for residents, city officials said.\n\n“We are grateful to the crews who are braving these frigid temperatures on this Christmas Eve night, while working to restore pressure to residents. Their sacrifice does not go unnoticed and is appreciated not only by this administration, but also by every resident who is affected,” the release stated.\n\nThe brutal weather conditions have also snarled travel during the busy holiday weekend, with more than 5,000 flights canceled Friday, more than 3,400 flights canceled Saturday, and more than 2,800 canceled for Christmas Day.\n\nDangerous weather conditions claim lives\n\nSnow covers a vehicle on December 24, 2022, in Hamburg, New York.

Details about a third death, confirmed by a county spokesperson Saturday afternoon, weren’t immediately available.\n\n“The loss of two lives in Buffalo – storm related – because people were not able to get to medical attention, is again a crisis situation that unfolds before your eyes and you realize that lifesaving ambulances and emergency medical personnel cannot get to people during a blizzard situation,” New York Gov.

Don’t go out.”\n\nHe said emergency responders will go, and have gone, to homes without heat and take people to warming shelters. Too many people, including residents just going out to see the massive snowfall, are going out in their vehicles and getting stuck and blocking recovery efforts, he said.\n\nErie County Executive Mark Poloncarz tweeted that 14 people in the county had died of exposure, three people were found in their vehicles, four had no heat, three were from “shoveling/(snow) blowing cardiac events, and three people passed away after EMS services were delayed.\n\nHe told CNN that unfortunately it appears the numbers will go up.\n\n“I am aware of additional bodies that have been recovered and are being brought to our temporary morgue,” he told The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. “We’ve had so many bodies that various hospitals are full and we’re just having to go through and determine if the individuals have died from a blizzard-related death.”\n\n“It’s just been a horrible, horrible situation,” he added.\n\nThe deadly storm comes just one month after the region was slammed with a historic snowstorm.\n\nAnd snow was continuing to fall Monday. At a morning news conference, Poloncarz noted officials expect between 8 and 12 more inches of snow to fall between Monday morning and 1 p.m. Tuesday. “This is not helpful as we’re trying to recover and clear off streets and get into areas that still have not” been plowed, he said.\n\nWhile driving bans have been lifted in some communities, one such order remains in place in Buffalo, Poloncarz said, describing the city is “impassable in most areas,” with abandoned vehicles scattered everywhere.\n\nEven emergency and recovery vehicles sent out to help have gotten stuck in the snow as rescue crews and hundreds of snowplow drivers fanned out on Christmas. Eleven abandoned ambulances were dug out Sunday, officials said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See houses frozen over by massive winter storm 01:00 - Source: CNN\n\n“We had to send specialized rescue crews to go get the rescuers,” Poloncarz told “CNN This Morning” Monday, adding it was the worst storm he could remember. “It was just horrendous, and it was horrendous for 24 hours in a row.”\n\n“We’re used to snow here, we can handle snow,” he said. “But with the wind, the blinding views – it was complete whiteouts – and the extreme cold, it was some of the worst conditions that any of us have ever seen.”\n\nSnow covers downtown Buffalo, New York, on Monday, December 26, 2022, in this photo from New York Gov. Kathy Hochul's Twitter page. Gov. Kathy Hochul/Twitter/AP\n\nThe storm has drawn widespread comparisons to Buffalo’s famous blizzard of 1977. Poloncarz said in Monday’s news conference the current storm’s “ferocity … was worse than the blizzard of ’77.” The death toll in that storm was 23 people, 22 of whom died in Erie County.\n\nAnd in a news conference Sunday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called this storm the “most devastating storm in Buffalo’s long storied history.” On Monday, she requested President Joe Biden issue federal emergency declarations for Erie and Genesee counties.\n\n“I spoke with @GovKathyHochul to get an update on the extreme winter weather hitting New York,” Biden tweeted. “We stand ready to make sure they have the resources they need to get through this. My heart is with those who lost loved ones this holiday weekend. You are in my and Jill’s prayers.”\n\nHundreds of National Guard troops have been deployed to help with rescue efforts in New York. State police had been involved in over 500 rescues by Sunday, including delivering a baby, Hochul said.\n\nWhile abandoned vehicles pepper the snow-covered roadways, conditions are also difficult inside homes.\n\nSome residents have remained in their homes for more than two days, some without power in the freezing cold, Hochul said Sunday – due not to a lack of resources, but the challenges utility companies face in terms of mobility and access. As of Sunday evening, however, 94.5% of Erie County residents and 87% of Buffalo residents have had their power restored, Hochul said.\n\nAs of Monday, fewer than 10,000 customers were without power, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said in an afternoon news conference, adding temperatures in his own home dropped to 40 degrees. “We certainly understand the challenges that so many families are going through and the frustration that people are facing.”\n\nWinter storm warnings remain in effect in New York for Jefferson and Lewis counties until 1 p.m. Tuesday. Forecasts show an additional 8 to 16 inches of snow could fall, according to the National Weather Service. Erie County could see another 4 to 8 inches and is under a winter weather advisory.\n\nSnow blankets buildings in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday, December 28.

And now he and his country will bear the consequences,” said Biden.\n\nSpeaking in Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia’s attack on Ukraine as a “brutal act of war” and said it put “countless innocent lives” at risk.\n\n“Peace on our continent has been shattered. We now have war in Europe, on the scale and of the type we thought belonged to history,” he said. “NATO allies condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms.

The Russian claim of a need to “denazify” Ukraine is one Putin has touted repeatedly over the years and is baseless. Zelensky, the Ukrainian President, is Jewish.\n\nThe Russian strongman urged Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms and go home, saying all responsibility for possible bloodshed would be entirely on the conscience of the Ukrainian government.\n\n“Our plans are not to occupy Ukraine, we do not plan to impose ourselves on anyone,” he said, but threatened “those who may be tempted to intervene” on Ukraine’s behalf.\n\n“Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so to create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia’s response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences as you have never experienced in your history,” he said.\n\nResidents refuel at a gas station in Mariupol, eastern Ukraine.

At least seven people were killed and 17 were wounded in a missile attack on a military area northeast of the capital, Ukrainian authorities said.\n\nZelensky said Ukrainian forces were doing “exceptionally” in the Donbas region, and while Russian troops were slowly advancing in the Chernihiv region in Ukraine’s north, Ukrainian defenses were holding elsewhere. Russian forces did seize the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the scene of Europe’s worst nuclear disaster.\n\nUkraine’s borders were reportedly under attack from Russian forces to the north in Belarus and the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. The Russian military claimed Ukraine’s border service “did not provide any resistance” and claimed to have “suppressed” Ukraine’s air defenses.

Johnson's job at risk.", "text": "WASHINGTON – The House approved a set of long-awaited foreign aid bills on Saturday that would send funds to Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region after months of it being stalled by Republican infighting.\n\nPassage of the bills also could cost Speaker Mike Johnson his leadership position and status as second in line to the presidency.\n\nThe bills mostly mirror an earlier foreign aid package the Senate passed this year. But this one is broken up into pieces as an attempt by Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, to appease his conference by allowing GOP lawmakers to pick and choose what aspects of the bill they support.\n\nJohnson’s foreign aid plan includes three bills that separately fund Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region, along with a fourth bill that includes various GOP-backed foreign policy priorities as a sweetener to entice Republicans to back the proposal. Those provisions would include seizing frozen Russian assets to fund the Ukrainian war effort along with legislation that could result in a nationwide ban on the popular social media app TikTok.\n\nAll bills passed the House on a bipartisan basis, but the legislation funding Ukraine proved to be the most contentious as U.S. support for Kyiv continues to fall among the House GOP ranks. The House passed the bill providing roughly $60 billion in Ukraine by a vote of 311-112.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe Israel bill also proved to be problematic among progressive Democrats who have called for conditioning aid to the country over its conduct in the war-torn Gaza Strip as international aid organizations warn of incoming famine in the territory. Lawmakers approved more than $26 billion in Israel funding and humanitarian assistance in the region by a vote of 366-58.\n\nAid to the Indo-Pacific region aimed at deterring China was far less controversial, and lawmakers passed about $8 billion to the region by a vote of 385-34. The sweetener bill also passed, 360-58.\n\nAll four bills will be compiled into one package to send to the Senate, which is expected to approve the legislation as well. President Joe Biden has vowed to sign the package “immediately to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends, and we won’t let Iran or Russia succeed.”\n\nThe final package was a long time coming and came together after months of dithering by Johnson, who was under intense pressure by leaders from both sides of the aisle to advance foreign aid. At first, Johnson sided with ultraconservative lawmakers who insisted that any assistance abroad must be paired with significant changes to border and immigration policy to address the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nBut in recent days, the speaker appeared to have shifted in his views of foreign aid, delivering remarks to reporters on Wednesday about the urgent need for the U.S. to show support for its allies.\n\n“Providing lethal aid to Ukraine right now is critically important. ... I really do believe the intel in the briefings that we’ve gotten. I believe Xi (Jinping) and Vladimir Putin and Iran really are an axis of evil. I think they’re in coordination on this. I think that Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed,” Johnson said.\n\n“To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,” Johnson continued, adding that his son is entering the U.S. Naval Academy this fall. “This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families. This is not a game. This is not a joke.”\n\nPassage of the foreign aid package also appears like it will leave Johnson’s speakership in peril. Conservative firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., along with two other Republicans, are seeking to oust the speaker for working with Democrats to pass legislation. Greene has declined to offer a timeline for when she would move to remove the speaker but has previously suggested she would do so the moment the House passes Ukraine aid.\n\nRegardless, Johnson said his “philosophy is you do the right thing and you let the chips fall where they may” and that he was “willing to take personal risk” for his job if it meant Congress could pass foreign aid.\n\nA small group of bipartisan negotiators in the Senate cobbled together a foreign aid package that did include sweeping changes in border and immigration policy that looked ready to clear the upper chamber earlier this year, but at the behest of former President Donald Trump, who opposed the bill, congressional Republicans ultimately killed thedeal.\n\nThe Senate later passed the foreign aid package completely stripped of changes in border policy and as months went by, Senate leaders from both parties called on Johnson to pass the deal immediately.\n\nThe speaker ultimately opted to split the bill into several different components with slight modifications to win Republican support, including converting direct financial assistance to Ukraine as a loan that can eventually be forgiven by the U.S.\n\nIn an attempt to placate the hard-right who were incensed by the speaker’s decision, a fifth bill that resembled a strict partisan bill Republicans passed last year to address the southern border – referred to as H.R. 2 – was offered a vote on the floor, but failed to garner the support necessary to pass. Conservatives derided the bill which appeared to be a peace offering as an attempt from the speaker to save face.\n\nWhat happens next in the lower chamber is uncertain, as House lawmakers began a weeklong recess right after passing the foreign aid package on Saturday.

Legislation on the app picks up momentum", "text": "WASHINGTON – TikTok's day of reckoning in Congress is fast approaching.\n\nThe House has included a version of its plan to force TikTok's Chinese parent company to sell the social media platform or face an effective ban in the U.S. in a foreign aid bill sailing toward passage in both the House and Senate. President Joe Biden has already said he would sign it into law immediately.\n\nThe move effectively forces the Senate – which has been sitting on the House's original bill for a month – to consider legislation that would have implications for 170 million Americans.\n\nIf you're an active user of the mega-popular video app, here's what you need to know about where the TikTok bill stands now.\n\nIs the TikTok bill gaining momentum in Congress?\n\nThe odds that the effective TikTok ban is passed are high: Most senators say they're convinced TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, poses a national security threat. TikTok critics argue the app is being used for propaganda and that American data could be accessed by the Chinese government.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe legislation has already passed the House 352-65, a wide bipartisan margin, and does not have significant opposition in that chamber. Now that the push is being wrapped into a pivotal foreign aid package, its chances in the Senate have skyrocketed.\n\nHowever, the social media platform has pushed back against lawmakers. TikTok has argued that the Chinese government cannot access U.S. user data and has derided the legislation as an outright ban.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,\" the company posted on X Wednesday evening.\n\nThe company launched an intense lobbying campaign over the last month as the Senate considered the legislation. It organized influencers to come to Capitol Hill to protest the bill, and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew visited the Capitol to meet with senators. The app also prompted users to call Congress, leading to an influx of calls that frustrated many officials.\n\nWho supports the TikTok bill?\n\nLawmakers in the House and Senate are in wide agreement that the legislation should become law.\n\nCommerce Committee Chair Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., emerged as the upper chamber's bottleneck, as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he would leave it up to her and Intelligence Committee Chair Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., to determine next steps after the House passed its original bill targeting the app.\n\nCantwell and others raised concerns that the legislation could face legal challenges because it targets a specific company, and said they wanted to hold hearings to consider other options. Some, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said the chamber should consider regulations on all leading social media platforms, regardless of ownership.\n\nBut the new version that will be included in the House foreign aid package would give ByteDance more time to sell the app, increasing the timeline from six months to nine months, and allowing the president to extend that deadline by another 90 days.\n\nCantwell released a statement Wednesday night saying she made that recommendation to the House and that she is \"very happy\" it was included.\n\n\"As I’ve said, extending the divestment period is necessary to ensure there is enough time for a new buyer to get a deal done. I support this updated legislation.\"\n\nOnly Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., remains vocally opposed to the TikTok legislation, which he argues would unconstitutionally restrict Americans' free speech and could impact small business owners on the platform.\n\nSo will the TikTok bill pass?\n\nThe legislation is set to be bundled with others that have proven even more controversial: $95 billion of dollars in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The Senate passed funding for all three earlier this year, but the House Republican caucus is divided over sending additional aid to Ukraine. Some right-wing lawmakers argue the U.S. has done enough to help the country as it fights Russia's invasion.\n\nDemocrats, too, face internal divisions over sending more aid to Israel, with progressive lawmakers calling for more humanitarian assistance to Gaza and the end of offensive weapons transfers to Israel.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced earlier this week that the lower chamber would take a vote on each of the three foreign aid bills separately, along with a fourth bill that includes the TikTok legislation and a bill to seize Russian assets and send them to Ukraine.\n\nWhatever gets a majority vote on the House floor will be sent to the Senate in a single bill. Leadership in the Senate and Biden have supported the strategy because it \"mirrors\" foreign aid legislation the Senate already passed.\n\nCongress' attitude toward TikTok – in some cases informed by closed-door briefings with intelligence officials – contrasts with those of the public, who are split on the need for TikTok regulation. A Pew Research poll from December indicated 38% supported a TikTok ban and 27% opposed one, down from 50% support in March last year.\n\nIt also may have political implications. Adults under age 30 are the only age group where opposition to a ban outweighs support, according to the Pew survey, and younger voters more heavily skew Democratic. That's led some Democrats to warn the ban could be a mistake in an election year where the next president is likely to be decided by just a sliver of voters.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/23/politics/fbi-investigation-huawei-china-defense-department-communications-nuclear/index.html", "title": "CNN Exclusive: FBI investigation determined Chinese-made ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nOn paper, it looked like a fantastic deal. In 2017, the Chinese government was offering to spend $100 million to build an ornate Chinese garden at the National Arboretum in Washington DC. Complete with temples, pavilions and a 70-foot white pagoda, the project thrilled local officials, who hoped it would attract thousands of tourists every year.\n\nBut when US counterintelligence officials began digging into the details, they found numerous red flags. The pagoda, they noted, would have been strategically placed on one of the highest points in Washington DC, just two miles from the US Capitol, a perfect spot for signals intelligence collection, multiple sources familiar with the episode told CNN.\n\nAlso alarming was that Chinese officials wanted to build the pagoda with materials shipped to the US in diplomatic pouches, which US Customs officials are barred from examining, the sources said.\n\nFederal officials quietly killed the project before construction was underway. The Wall Street Journal first reported about the security concerns in 2018.\n\nThe canceled garden is part of a frenzy of counterintelligence activity by the FBI and other federal agencies focused on what career US security officials say has been a dramatic escalation of Chinese espionage on US soil over the past decade.\n\nSince at least 2017, federal officials have investigated Chinese land purchases near critical infrastructure, shut down a high-profile regional consulate believed by the US government to be a hotbed of Chinese spies and stonewalled what they saw as clear efforts to plant listening devices near sensitive military and government facilities.\n\nAmong the most alarming things the FBI uncovered pertains to Chinese-made Huawei equipment atop cell towers near US military bases in the rural Midwest. According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, the FBI determined the equipment was capable of capturing and disrupting highly restricted Defense Department communications, including those used by US Strategic Command, which oversees the country’s nuclear weapons.\n\nWhile broad concerns about Huawei equipment near US military installations have been well known, the existence of this investigation and its findings have never been reported. Its origins stretch back to at least the Obama administration. It was described to CNN by more than a dozen sources, including current and former national security officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nF.E. Warren Air Force Base, a strategic missile base, is located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, an area near a host of cell towers using Huawei equipment. From F.E. Warren Air Force Base/Facebook\n\nIt’s unclear if the intelligence community determined whether any data was actually intercepted and sent back to Beijing from these towers. Sources familiar with the issue say that from a technical standpoint, it’s incredibly difficult to prove a given package of data was stolen and sent overseas.\n\nThe Chinese government strongly denies any efforts to spy on the US. Huawei in a statement to CNN also denied that its equipment is capable of operating in any communications spectrum allocated to the Defense Department.\n\nBut multiple sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN that there’s no question the Huawei equipment has the ability to intercept not only commercial cell traffic but also the highly restricted airwaves used by the military and disrupt critical US Strategic Command communications, giving the Chinese government a potential window into America’s nuclear arsenal.\n\n“This gets into some of the most sensitive things we do,” said one former FBI official with knowledge of the investigation. “It would impact our ability for essentially command and control with the nuclear triad. “That goes into the ‘BFD’ category.”\n\n“If it is possible for that to be disrupted, then that is a very bad day,” this person added.\n\nTurning doves into hawks\n\nFormer officials described the probe’s findings as a watershed moment. The investigation was so secret that some senior policymakers in the White House and elsewhere in government weren’t briefed on its existence until 2019, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThat fall, the Federal Communications Commission initiated a rule that effectively banned small telecoms from using Huawei and a few other brands of Chinese made-equipment. “The existence of the investigation at the highest levels turned some doves into hawks,” said one former US official.\n\nIn 2020, Congress approved $1.9 billion to remove Chinese-made Huawei and ZTE cellular technology across wide swaths of rural America.\n\nBut two years later, none of that equipment has been removed and rural telecom companies are still waiting for federal reimbursement money. The FCC received applications to remove some 24,000 pieces of Chinese-made communications equipment—but according to a July 15 update from the commission, it is more than $3 billion short of the money it needs to reimburse all eligible companies.\n\nAbsent more money from Congress, the FCC says it plans to begin reimbursing approved companies for about 40 percent of the costs of removing Huawei equipment. The FCC did not specify a timeframe on when the money will be disbursed.\n\nIn late 2020, the Justice Department referred its national security concerns about Huawei equipment to the Commerce Department, and provided information on where the equipment was in place in the US, a former senior US law enforcement official told CNN.\n\nAfter the Biden administration took office in 2021, the Commerce Department then opened its own probe into Huawei to determine if more urgent action was needed to expunge the Chinese technology provider from US telecom networks, the former law enforcement official and a current senior US official said.\n\nThat probe has proceeded slowly and is ongoing, the current US official said. Among the concerns that national security officials noted was that external communication from the Huawei equipment that occurs when software is updated, for example, could be exploited by the Chinese government.\n\nDepending on what the Commerce Department finds, US telecom carriers could be forced to quickly remove Huawei equipment or face fines or other penalties.\n\nReuters first reported the existence of the Commerce Department probe.\n\n“We cannot confirm or deny ongoing investigations, but we are committed to securing our information and communications technology and services supply chain. Protecting US persons safety and security against malign information collection is vital to protecting our economy and national security,” a Commerce Department spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Inside Huawei's connection to rural America 02:55 - Source: CNN\n\nUS counterintelligence officials have recently made a priority of publicizing threats from China. This month, the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center issued a warning to American businesses and local and state governments about what it says are disguised efforts by China to manipulate them to influence US policy.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray just traveled to London for a joint meeting with top British law enforcement officials to call attention to the Chinese threats.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN, Wray said the FBI opens a new China counterintelligence investigation every 12 hours. “That’s probably about 2,000 or so investigations,” said Wray. “And that’s not even talking about their cyber theft, where they have a bigger hacking program than that of every other major nation combined, and have stolen more of Americans’ personal and corporate data than every nation combined.”\n\nAsked why after years of national security concerns raised over Huawei, the equipment is still largely in place atop cell towers near US military bases, Wray said that, “We’re concerned about allowing any company that is beholden to a nation state that doesn’t adhere to and share our values, giving that company the ability to burrow into our telecommunications infrastructure.”\n\nHe noted that in 2020, the DOJ indicted Huawei with racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to steal trade secrets.\n\n“And I think that’s probably about all I can say on the topic,” said Wray.\n\nCritics see xenophobic overreach\n\nDespite its tough talk, the US government’s refusal to provide evidence to back up its claims that Huawei tech poses a risk to US national security has led some critics to accuse it of xenophobic overreach. The lack of a smoking gun also raises questions of whether US officials can separate legitimate Chinese investment from espionage.\n\n“All of our products imported to the US have been tested and certified by the FCC before being deployed there,” Huawei said in its statement to CNN. “Our equipment only operates on the spectrum allocated by the FCC for commercial use. This means it cannot access any spectrum allocated to the DOD.”\n\n“For more than 30 years, Huawei has maintained a proven track record in cyber security and we have never been involved in any malicious cyber security incidents,” the statement said.\n\nIn its zeal to sniff out evidence of Chinese spying, critics argue the feds have cast too wide a net — in particular as it relates to academic institutions. In one recent high-profile case, a federal judge acquitted a former University of Tennessee engineering professor whom the Justice Department had prosecuted under its so-called China Initiative that targets Chinese spying, arguing “there was no evidence presented that [the professor] ever collaborated with a Chinese university in conducting NASA-funded research.”\n\nAnd on Jan. 20, the Justice Department dropped a separate case against an MIT professor accused of hiding his ties to China, saying it could no longer prove its case. In February, the Biden administration shut down the China Initiative entirely.\n\nThe federal government’s reticence across multiple administrations to detail what it knows has led some critics to accuse the government of chasing ghosts.\n\n“It really comes down to: do you treat China as a neutral actor — because if you treat China as a neutral actor, then yeah, this seems crazy, that there’s some plot behind every tree,” said Anna Puglisi, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “However, China has shown us through its policies and actions it is not a neutral actor.”\n\nChinese tech in the American heartland\n\nAs early as the Obama administration, FBI agents were monitoring a disturbing pattern along stretches of Interstate 25 in Colorado and Montana, and on arteries into Nebraska. The heavily trafficked corridor connects some of the most secretive military installations in the US, including an archipelago of nuclear missile silos.\n\nFor years, small, rural telecom providers had been installing cheaper, Chinese-made routers and other technology atop cell towers up and down I-25 and elsewhere in the region. Across much of these sparsely populated swaths of the west, these smaller carriers are the only option for cell coverage. And many of them turned to Huawei for cheaper, reliable equipment.\n\nBeginning in late 2011, Viaero, the largest regional provider in the area, inked a contract with Huawei to provide the equipment for its upgrade to 3G. A decade later, it has Huawei tech installed across its entire fleet of towers, roughly 1,000 spread over five western states.\n\nAs Huawei equipment began to proliferate near US military bases, federal investigators started taking notice, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Of particular concern was that Huawei was routinely selling cheap equipment to rural providers in cases that appeared to be unprofitable for Huawei — but which placed its equipment near military assets.\n\nFederal investigators initially began “examining [Huawei] less from a technical lens and more from a business/financial view,” explained John Lenkart, a former senior FBI agent focused on counterintelligence issues related to China. Officials studied where Huawei sales efforts were most concentrated and looked for deals that “made no sense from a return-on-investment perspective,” Lenkart said.\n\n“A lot of [counterintelligence] concerns were uncovered based on” those searches, Lenkart said.\n\nBy examining the Huawei equipment themselves, FBI investigators determined it could recognize and disrupt DOD-spectrum communications — even though it had been certified by the FCC, according to a source familiar with the investigation.\n\n“It’s not technically hard to make a device that complies with the FCC that listens to nonpublic bands but then is quietly waiting for some activation trigger to listen to other bands,” said Eduardo Rojas, who leads the radio spectrum lab at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. “Technically, it’s feasible.”\n\nTo prove a device had clandestine capabilities, Rojas said, would require technical experts to strip down a device “to the semi-conductor level” and “reverse engineer the design.” But, he said, it can be done.\n\nAnd there was another big concern along I-25, sources familiar with the investigation said.\n\nWeather camera worries\n\nAround 2014, Viaero started mounting high-definition surveillance cameras on its towers to live-stream weather and traffic, a public service it shared with local news organizations. With dozens of cameras posted up and down I-25, the cameras provided a 24-7 bird’s eye view of traffic and incoming weather, even providing advance warning of tornadoes.\n\nBut they were also inadvertently capturing the movement of US military equipment and personnel, giving Beijing — or anyone for that matter — the ability to track the pattern of activity between a series of closely guarded military facilities.\n\nThe intelligence community determined the publicly posted live-streams were being viewed and likely captured from China, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Two sources briefed on the investigation at the time said officials believed that it was possible for Beijing’s intelligence service to “task” the cameras — hack into the network and control where they pointed. At least some of the cameras in question were running on Huawei networks.\n\nViaero CEO Frank DiRico said it never occurred to him the cameras could be a national security risk.\n\n“There’s a lot of missile silos in areas we cover. There is some military presence,” DiRico said in an interview from his Colorado office. But, he said, “I was never told to remove the equipment or to make any changes.”\n\nIn fact, DiRico first learned of government concerns about Huawei equipment from newspaper articles — not the FBI — and says he has never been briefed on the matter.\n\nDiRico doesn’t question the government’s insistence that he needs to remove Huawei equipment, but he is skeptical that China’s intelligence services can exploit either the Huawei hardware itself or the camera equipment.\n\n“We monitor our network pretty good,” DiRico said, adding that Viaero took over the support and maintenance for its own networks from Huawei shortly after installation. “We feel we’ve got a pretty good idea if there’s anything going on that’s inappropriate.”\n\nScouring the country for Chinese investments\n\nBy the time the I-25 investigation was briefed to the White House in 2019, counterintelligence officials begin looking for other places Chinese companies might be buying land or offering to develop a piece of municipal property, like a park or an old factory, sometimes as part of a “sister city” arrangement.\n\nIn one instance, officials shut down what they believed was a risky commercial deal near highly sensitive military testing installations in Utah sometime after the beginning of the I-25 investigation, according to one former US official. The military has a test and training range for hypersonic weapons in Utah, among other things. Sources declined to provide more details.\n\nFederal officials were also alarmed by what sources described as a host of espionage and influence activities in Houston and, in 2020, shut down the Chinese consulate there.\n\nUS Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Richard P. Donoghue announcing indictments against China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, several of its subsidiaries and its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on January 28, 2019. Joshua Roberts/Reuters\n\nBill Evanina, who until early last year ran the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, told CNN that it can sometimes be hard to differentiate between a legitimate business opportunity and espionage — in part because both might be happening at the same time.\n\n“What we’ve seen is legitimate companies that are three times removed from Beijing buy [a given] facility for obvious logical reasons, unaware of what the [Chinese] intelligence apparatus wants in that parcel [of land],” Evanina said. “What we’ve seen recently — it’s been what’s underneath the land.”\n\n“The hard part is, that’s legitimate business, and what city or town is not going to want to take that money for that land when it’s just sitting there doing nothing?” he added.\n\nA complicated problem\n\nAfter the results of the I-25 investigation were briefed to the Trump White House in 2019, the FCC ordered that telecom companies who receive federal subsidies to provide cell service to remote areas — companies like Viaero — must “rip and replace” their Huawei and ZTE equipment.\n\nThe FCC has since said that the cost could be more than double the $1.9 billion appropriated in 2020 and absent an additional appropriation from Congress, the agency is only planning to reimburse companies for a fraction of their costs.\n\nGiven the staggering strategic risk, Lenkart said, “rip and replace is a very blunt and inefficient remediation.”\n\nDiRico, the CEO of Viaero, said the cost of “rip and replace” is astronomical and that he doesn’t expect the reimbursement money to be enough to pay for the change. According to the FCC, Viaero is expected to receive less than half of the funding it is actually due. Still, he expects to start removing the equipment within the next year.\n\n“It’s difficult and it’s a lot of money,” DiRico said.\n\nSome former counterintelligence officials expressed frustration that the US government isn’t providing more granular detail about what it knows to companies — or to cities and states considering a Chinese investment proposal. They believe that not only would that kind of detail help private industry and state and local governments understand the seriousness of the threat as they see it, but also help combat the criticism that the US government is targeting Chinese companies and people, rather than Chinese state-run espionage.\n\n“This government has to do a better job of letting everyone know this is a Communist Party issue, it’s not a Chinese people issue,” Evanina said. “And I’ll be the first to say that the government has to do better with respect to understanding the Communist Party’s intentions are not the same intentions of the Chinese people.”\n\nA current FBI official said the bureau is giving more defensive briefings to US businesses, academic institutions and state and local governments that include far more detail than in the past, but officials are still fighting an uphill battle.\n\n“Sometimes I feel like we’re a lifeguard going out to a drowning person, and they don’t want our help,” said the current FBI official. But, this person said, “I think sometimes we [the FBI] say ‘China threat,’ and we take for granted what all that means in our head. And it means something else to the people that we’re delivering it to.”\n\n“I think we just need to be more careful about how we speak about it and educate folks on why we’re doing what we’re doing.”\n\nIn the meantime, the “rip and replace” program has remained fiercely controversial.\n\n“It’s not going to be easy,” DiRico said. “I’m going to be up nights worrying about it, but we’ll do what we’re told to do.”\n\nThis story has been updated to reference Wall Street Journal reporting.", "authors": ["Katie Bo Lillis"], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/19/arizona-primary-2024-presidential-preference-election-live-updates/73018613007/", "title": "Arizona presidential preference election: Biden, Trump post ...", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nPresident Joe Biden made his first Arizona visit of the 2024 campaign season on the day registered Democrats in the state overwhelmingly supported his return to the White House.\n\nBiden arrived in Arizona on Tuesday after a stop in Las Vegas.

Meanwhile, Trump is focused on division and personal gain for him and his wealthy friends. Trump ripped away women’s freedoms by overturning Roe, and now he wants to go further, banning abortion and attacking birth control nationwide.\n\n“Four years ago, Arizonans chose President Biden’s promise of freedom and a fair shot for every family over the chaos and dysfunction of Trump, and we’ll do it again this fall.”\n\n— Dan Nowicki\n\nArizona Democratic Party leader calls for focus on policy wins\n\nArizona Democratic Party Chair Yolanda Bejarano acknowledged some Latino voters are drawn to the Republican Party.\n\n“I think it's that we have not been talking to folks about the issues that President Biden has been delivering on. … Things like jobs, the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, lowering prescription drug prices,” she said after the “Latinos con Biden-Harris\" campaign event at El Portal restaurant in Phoenix.\n\nShe argued the recent fraud judgment against former President Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, undercuts the idea he has been a successful businessman.\n\nBejarano added: “People like to be entertained. And sometimes, Donald Trump, what he does is it provides entertainment. People laugh at his rallies. It's like they're going to a circus.”\n\n— Laura Gersony\n\nVote Ceasefire AZ urged protest vote against Biden\n\nKai Newkirk, an organizer for AZ Ceasefire Now, voted for Democrat Marianne Williamson as a part of an effort to protest President Joe Biden's actions surrounding the war in Gaza.\n\nNewkirk voted at Arizona State University's Tempe campus and spoke to students there about joining the effort.\n\n\"You talk to a number of them, and when you do connect with somebody, you can say, 'Hey, the polling place is right there,\" Newkirk said.\n\nVote Ceasefire AZ is a coalition of Arizona voters who are trying to send a message to Biden that they oppose his stance on the violence occurring in Gaza perpetrated by Israel’s government and his failure to call for a long-term cease-fire.\n\nThey pushed voters to vote for Williamson, instead of Biden, in Arizona’s presidential preference election.\n\nWhile not an endorsement of Williamson, because of Arizona’s lack of “uncommitted” or “write-in” options for the preference election, the coalition is using her name because she is a pro-cease-fire candidate with name recognition.\n\nBecause of Biden’s win by just more than 10,000 votes in Arizona in 2020, the coalition was shooting for the same number of votes for Williamson in an attempt to highlight the power of the group’s message in the important swing state.\n\nIn the first tally of votes Tuesday, Williamson had garnered 7,572 votes, or 3.4%. Biden had 200,254 votes, or 90%.\n\nSarah Leon, an organizer for AZ Ceasefire Now, works at Phoenix City Hall and walked to the Maricopa County Recorder's Office to cast her protest vote for Williamson.\n\nLeon dropped off her mail-in ballot she revived months ago.\n\n\"I voted for Marianne Williamson.

They are also expecting to receive tens of thousands of early ballots that were dropped off on election day. Counting those ballots will take longer because they must be signature verified and separated from their signed affidavit envelope by a bipartisan team before tallying.\n\nBiden, Trump dominate early returns in Arizona election\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump were dominating their respective party elections in the first tally of ballots released Tuesday.\n\nThe unofficial results in Arizona’s presidential preference election, or primary, suggested both men would easily win, as expected. The final numbers will be sought to determine how prevalent dissent was within Democratic and Republican ranks.\n\nCounting is expected to extend beyond Tuesday as mail-in ballots dropped off on election day are verified as legitimately signed by legal voters.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\nWhen will Arizona election results be available?\n\nArizona voters can expect a first batch of unofficial election results about an hour after the polls close on Tuesday, but full results are likely to take days.\n\nState law gives county election officials until April 1 to officially wrap up counting for the presidential preference election.\n\nThe results released first typically include early ballots cast by mail or dropped off before election day. Then, counties usually update results sporadically on election night as results roll in from polling places across the state.\n\nIn the days after the election, officials will count early ballots dropped off immediately before and on election day. Elections staff will later process any ballots that require more investigation and follow-up, such as those with missing or mismatched signatures.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nPolls close at 7 p.m. in Arizona election\n\nIf the polls close while you are still in line to vote, don't leave. As long as you are in line at 7 p.m., you have a right to cast your ballot.\n\nThe state's first round of unofficial election results is expected around 8 p.m. After that, counties will update results at different times throughout the night as results roll in from polling places across Arizona.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nPima County in-person voting accelerates post-COVID-19 trend\n\nLiberals in Pima County have long been more likely to vote by mail than conservatives, who favor in-person voting on election day. But that trend has become especially pronounced in recent years as the COVID-19 pandemic popularized early voting nationwide.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential preference election, about 80% of Democrats and 76% of Republicans voted early. That’s the most recent preference election in which both parties have held races.\n\nIn recent state primary elections, the percentages of Democrats and Republicans voting early versus at the polls has diverged. In 2022, nearly 95% of voters casting a Democratic ballot in Pima County used an early ballot, compared with 76% of those casting a Republican ballot.\n\nComplete early voting data for Tuesday’s election won’t be available until early next week.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nGOP voters dominate in-person turnout in heavily Democratic Pima County\n\nVoters across southern Arizona headed to the polls Tuesday – but most showing up to the polls in heavily Democratic Pima County were Republicans.\n\nThe county, which stretches along the U.S.-Mexico border from Tucson to Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, is home to roughly 239,000 registered Democrats and 176,000 registered Republicans. By midday Tuesday, county officials said about 700 Democrats and 4,300 Republicans had cast ballots at the polls.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nStanton, tribal leader meet Biden on tarmac\n\nRep. Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., and Gila River Indian Community Gov. Stephen Roe Lewis waited at the tarmac to greet President Joe Biden for his Phoenix arrival. Alluding to a CHIPS Act-related announcement the president will make Wednesday, Stanton said he looks forward to supporting Biden’s efforts to strengthen microchip manufacturing in Arizona and beyond.\n\n“This is the epicenter of the most advanced manufacturing in America,” Stanton said. “The jobs that are going to make us competitive on the international stage, that’s happening right here in Arizona.”\n\nStanton added that he expects Biden to be spending more time in Arizona as the presidential election creeps closer.\n\n“The growth economically, the growth in people, the amazing diversity we have — we are a microcosm of America,” Stanton said of Arizona. “You want to win the presidency, you got to win Arizona.”\n\nAbsent were Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, the state’s top Democrat, and Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., the party’s leading Senate candidate. They also didn’t attend Vice President Kamala Harris’ visit to Phoenix in early March, which was focused on the issue of abortion.\n\nReached for comment, Hannah Goss, Gallego's spokesperson, wrote \"there were votes in the House today\" and Gallego was \"in DC representing his district.\" Hobbs' spokesperson Christian Slater said the governor would attend Biden's Wednesday event in Chandler, which will focus on the CHIPS and Science Act.\n\n— Alexis Waiss and Laura Gersony\n\nBiden: Latinos 'a large part of why we beat Donald Trump'\n\nPresident Joe Biden spoke in downtown Phoenix on Tuesday to launch “Latinos con Biden-Harris,” a nationwide effort to mobilize Latino voters.\n\nBiden noted that Latinos make up about one-quarter of Arizona’s voters.\n\n“Anybody that doesn’t pay attention to them is really stupid,” Biden, leaning into the microphone, said to an audience of around 75 supporters at El Portal, a Mexican restaurant operated by community leaders Mary Rose and Earl Wilcox, both longtime Democrats.\n\n“You were a large part of why we beat Donald Trump. … I desperately need your help,” he said.\n\n— Laura Gersony\n\nBiden lands in Phoenix\n\nPresident Joe Biden has landed in Arizona after Air Force One touched down at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport at 4:10 p.m.\n\nBiden on Tuesday will kick off a new campaign initiative called \"Latinos con Biden-Harris,\" which aims to \"engage and mobilize Latino voters, communities, and leaders across the country,\" his reelection campaign said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden is expected to announce a multi-billion dollar award for the technology company Intel to expand its semiconductor production in the U.S.\n\n— Alexis Waiss\n\nBiden set to unveil Latino mobilization effort\n\nAt a campaign event on Tuesday evening, President Joe Biden was expected to launch Latinos con Biden-Harris, an effort to mobilize Latino voters nationwide. Polling suggests the president’s support among Hispanic voters has eroded since he took office, and Democrats’ longtime advantage with voters of color is slipping.\n\nThat comes even as former President Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee, has called migrants “vermin” or said they are “poisoning the blood” of the country, echoing the language of fascist dictators like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.\n\nBiden’s campaign has been investing early in outreach to Arizona’s Latino population, opening their first office in Phoenix’s majority-Latino neighborhood of Maryvale.\n\n— Laura Gersony\n\nOrganizers want Democrats to back Marianne Williamson over Biden in Arizona election\n\nSimarn Singh was at Burton Barr Library on Tuesday morning handing out flyers and talking to voters about the protest vote campaign. Singh said organizers are hoping to get at least 11,000 votes for Marianne Williamson.\n\n“We’re hoping that this puts pressure on Biden that shows that Democrats aren’t satisfied with what he’s doing,” Singh said. “Especially the majority Muslim community here, people of color, we really want him to switch his stance.”\n\n— Reagan Priest\n\nRepublican voter who preferred DeSantis votes for Trump\n\nJocelyn Gomez voted at the Burton Barr Library. She said her preferred candidate is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, but she settled for former President Donald Trump since DeSantis dropped out of the race.\n\n“I don’t think he’s the best candidate, but I think we got a lot done under him and I felt like we were moving forward,” Gomez said.\n\n— Reagan Priest\n\nPhoenix voters jam to Fleetwood Mac, The Beatles as they cast ballots\n\nVoters at Burton Barr Library on Tuesday were greeted by local DJ Robens Caimitte, who was playing a mix of '70s tunes ranging from The Beatles to Fleetwood Mac. Caimitte works with a group called DJs at the Polls that aims to increase voter turnout by making voting fun.\n\n“As people were coming in and out, they’re like, ‘Oh my God, the tunes are amazing,’ so they’re energized, they’re ready to vote,” Caimitte said. “It looks like I added to their morning.”\n\nSeveral voters sang along as they walked into the vote center. Others stopped to chat with Caimitte.\n\n— Reagan Priest\n\nKari Lake calls for voters to turn out, honor ‘sacred’ duty\n\nDespite criticizing the Maricopa County voting system for its long lines that “punish” Arizonans submitting their vote on Election Day, Lake said she encourages Arizonans to go out and vote because that vote “sacred.”\n\n“People are struggling, and I don’t want to see that struggle anymore,” Lake said. “I want to see a great future for our country and a vote for Donald J. Trump will give us that great future.\"\n\nThose comments came as the Grand Canyon University polling place where she cast her ballot stood mostly empty. Many other polling places across the county estimate there is no wait time.\n\nLake added that she has not had contact with Blake Masters, a former U.S. Senate candidate who is now running for a U.S. House seat. She said she would back Abe Hamadeh in that congressional primary.\n\n— Alexis Waiss\n\nUS Senate candidate Kari Lake casts ballot for Donald Trump\n\nKari Lake will be putting all her support behind former President Donald Trump in the presidential election, she said at Grand Canyon University’s polling station in Phoenix. Lake arrived to the polls with her husband, Jeff Halperin, at 10:25 a.m. to vote in Arizona’s presidential preference election.\n\n“I voted for him every single time he’s been on the ballot,” Lake said. “And I can’t wait to vote for him again on November 5th, when I’m on the ballot with him, and we’re going to take back our country and make America great again.”\n\nIn addition to expressing enthusiastic support for the former president, Lake criticized \"open border\" policy and bipartisan efforts to reform America’s immigration system.\n\n“When President Trump gets in office, when I get into the Senate, we are going to have the largest repatriation operation this country has ever seen,” Lake said. “If you come to here illegally, you cannot stay. We’re not going to support people who commit crimes and come here illegally.”\n\n— Alexis Waiss\n\nIcy conditions, snowstorms lead to ‘slow start’ to Arizona election in Coconino County\n\nScattered snowstorms on Monday led to icy conditions and “a slow start” to election day in northern Arizona, according to Coconino County officials.\n\nElection staff said the county, located about 150 miles north of Phoenix, was seeing only “moderate” voter turnout. Flagstaff received about six-tenths of an inch of snow on Monday, per the National Weather Service. The city is the largest in the region and serves as the county’s seat.\n\nThe National Weather Service forecast called for a chance of rain and snow showers in the city on Tuesday, with a high near 45 degrees.\n\nYavapai, Pinal and Maricopa counties also reported light voter turnout, but no adverse weather conditions.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\n‘Smooth sailing’ so far in Arizona election, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes says\n\nSecretary of State Adrian Fontes told reporters that by mid-morning, Arizona election operations appeared to be “smooth sailing.”\n\nHe acknowledged that interest may be low, given Biden and Trump have already secured enough votes to win their respective parties’ nominations.\n\nBut Fontes urged Arizonans to vote anyway, as long as they are registered with either the Democratic or Republican parties. “It’s a good habit to have,” he said, of voting in all eligible elections.\n\nFontes said his office will be providing election updates throughout the day.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\nCounty official knows ‘stakes are high’ in Arizona elections\n\nOn the eve of Arizona's presidential preference election, officials from Arizona's largest county said \"the stakes are high\" for smooth election operations.\n\nThe comments from Maricopa County Supervisor Bill Gates came during a media briefing before a live Arizona PBS roundtable with other election officials. Maricopa County has been in the spotlight since allies of former President Donald Trump tried to pressure county supervisors to question their ballot tallies after he lost the 2020 presidential race.\n\nSince then, its leaders have repeatedly faced false allegations of election fraud and slews of threats. They also saw a rough 2022 general election in which the county experienced widespread printer problems.\n\n\"Every election is important, even in an election where frankly, we know who the nominees are going to be for each of these parties,\" Gates said. \"We know people are watching it closely.\"\n\nHe added: \"There is no such thing as a perfect election. Something will go wrong tomorrow. And we will learn from that.\"\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nWill I be assigned a polling place?\n\nIt depends on which county you live in.\n\nMost counties will use a voting center model for this election, which allows voters to cast ballots at any polling site within its borders. Those counties include:\n\nCochise County\n\nLa Paz County\n\nMaricopa County\n\nNavajo County\n\nPima County\n\nSanta Cruz County\n\nYavapai County\n\nYuma County\n\nOther counties will use a precinct-based voting model in which voters are assigned a polling place based on where they reside. Those counties include:\n\nApache County\n\nMohave County\n\nPinal County\n\nSome counties will use a hybrid model, offering some vote centers and some precinct-based voting options in specific areas. Those counties include:\n\nCoconino County\n\nGila County\n\nGraham County\n\nGreenlee County\n\nCheck with your local election officials to find polling places in your county.\n\nHere’s what to know about voting in person.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nWho is on the ballot?\n\nSecretary of State Adrian Fontes in December announced nine Republicans qualified for Arizona's presidential preference election. Among them are former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\nPresident Joe Biden will be running in the presidential preference election on the Democratic side. Fontes announced in December six other Democrats qualified for the ballot: Frankie Lozada, Gabriel Cornejo, Marianne Williamson, Jason Palmer, Stephen Lyons and Dean Phillips.\n\nBiden and Trump have already clinched their parties' nominations for the presidential race. Nonetheless, voters will still weigh in on their choice of presidential nominee.\n\nHere’s what to know about counting ballots.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nWhat should I do if I encounter issues at the polls?\n\nIf you run into any issues at the polls, you can get help by calling the Arizona Secretary of State's Office at 877-THE-VOTE.\n\nHere’s what to know about voting in person.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nI’m dropping off my ballot on election day. Can I skip the line?\n\nYes. If you are just dropping off a mail-in ballot, you can skip the line and go straight to the drop box when you arrive at the polling site.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nVoters trickle into Maricopa County voting sites\n\nTurnout was low on Tuesday morning as polls opened in Maricopa County, the state’s most populous. County officials said roughly 3,100 had checked in at polling sites as of 8:30 a.m.\n\nThat’s a far cry from the tens of thousands that turned out to vote in the early hours of the 2022 primary and general elections.\n\nAbout a third of the county’s electorate isn’t registered with the Democratic or Republican parties and cannot vote in Tuesday’s election. That accounts for some of the drop.\n\nBut county officials said turnout was still comparatively low on Tuesday morning. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have already clinched their parties’ nominations, making Arizona’s results largely inconsequential.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nWhere can I find election results?\n\nYou can find unofficial statewide results on election night at https://www.azcentral.com/elections/results/2024-03-19/arizona or on the Arizona Secretary of State's website.\n\nHere’s what to know about counting ballots.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nCan I track my ballot?\n\nYes, you can. Arizona voters can track their early ballots and check the status of their provisional ballots at the Arizona Voter Information Portal.\n\nMaricopa County voters can track their ballots online on their voter dashboard at BeBallotReady.Vote.\n\nMaricopa County voters can also text “JOIN” to 628683 to receive text notifications of when their ballot gets counted, verified and other details.\n\nHere’s what to know about voting in person.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nI'm an independent. Can I vote in Arizona's primary?\n\nNo. Voters who aren't registered with a political party cannot vote in the presidential preference election.\n\nIndependents will be eligible to vote in the July primary election, but must choose between a Republican, Democratic or municipal-only ballot. Even if you’re an independent on the Active Early Voting List, you won't be automatically mailed a primary ballot unless you contact your county recorder to select a party.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nDo I need to show ID at the polls?\n\nYes, you must show identification at the polls, unless you are dropping off a mail-in ballot in a signed affidavit envelope.\n\nAcceptable forms of ID include:\n\nYour valid Arizona driver's license\n\nYour valid state identification card\n\nYour tribal enrollment card\n\nOther government-issued identification\n\nTwo items, such as a utility bill and a bank statement, that bear your name and address\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nPolls open at 6 a.m. across Arizona\n\nPolling locations across Arizona were set to open at 6 a.m. and ready to receive presidential preference voters. Polls will remain open until 7 p.m., though those still in line at that time have a right to cast a ballot.\n\nHere’s what to know about voting in person.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nWhere to cast a ballot in the Arizona primary\n\nMaricopa County will have more than 150 voting centers open on Tuesday, and registered Republicans and Democrats can cast a ballot at any of those locations.\n\nFind a list of voting locations at http://locations.maricopa.vote.

I am surrounded by miracles and blessings,” she told Ralph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition during the banquet’s last sit-down interview.\n\nHaley, who during the GOP presidential debate last month shared similar sentiments, explained that a federal abortion ban would need the majority of the House, 60 Senate votes and a president’s signature.\n\n“We haven't had 60 Republicans (in the Senate) in over 100 years. We might have 45 pro-life senators,” she said, “so no Republican president can any more ban abortions than a Democrat president can ban those state laws.”\n\nHaley added her goal is to support moms, save as many babies as possible and continue to “humanize” the issue.\n\n“The way we do that is to bring people together,” she said to a quiet crowd. “Can’t we all agree that we should ban late-term abortions? Can't we all agree that we should encourage adoptions and good quality adoptions? Can't we all agree that doctors and nurses who don't believe in abortions shouldn't have to perform them?\"\n\n“And can't we all agree that no woman who has an abortion should get a prison sentence or the death penalty?\" she added. \"Let's start there.”\n\nDuring the interview, Haley also recounted one of the toughest moments she faced while serving as the governor of South Carolina: the mass shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.\n\n“This was the first time we had a shooting in a place of worship, and it brought South Carolina to her knees,” she said.\n\nHaley spoke about the grief that washed over her communities and how issues of racism and gun control surfaced. As governor, she made the decision to remove the Confederate flag over the state capitol building into a museum.\n\n“I will tell you it was a defining moment in my life because it was the only way I was able to pull through and get through it,” Haley said, as she shared how she leaned on her faith. “But more than that I was able to see South Carolina through in a way that she showed real strength and grace.\n\n“We didn't have riots. We had vigils. We didn't have protests. We have hugs, and the rest of the world saw what happens when you bring people together.”\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, pressed by Bird on FBI, commits to eliminating agency\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, the 38-year-old businessman who has proposed swaths of cuts across numerous federal agencies, committed to eliminating the FBI when questioned on the policy by Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird.\n\n\"I don't think reform of that agency is actually possible,\" Ramaswamy said, after Bird said she believes that \"they serve an important role\" and asked for clarity on his position. \"I think you have to shut it down. This is more than a slogan to me. This is deeply practical.\"\n\nRamaswamy has proposed cuts that would encompass around 75% of the federal employee headcount, arguing that it's the duty of the president to shrink the executive branch. He said that of the list of proposed judicial appointees he has released, \"they share my fundamental skepticism\" about the federal bureaucracy.\n\n\"Every one of those justices we appoint will share that conviction in common,\" Ramaswamy said.\n\nOffice workers at the FBI and other agencies, he said, would have to \"go home and find honest work in the private sector,\" while others would be reassigned across existing and consolidated departments.\n\nAnd he committed to a robust relationship with Israel if elected, saying there are policies enacted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would \"love to learn from.\"\n\n\"I would love border policies like Israel's in this country,\" Ramaswamy said. \"I would love tough-on-crime policies, like Israel's infrastructure, a strong national identity that they have for their youth.\"\n\nMike Pence warns Republican competitors are 'walking away' from conservative principles\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence accused his Republican competitors of ignoring traditional Republican values like a strong national defense, leadership in the world, fiscal responsibility and the right to life.\n\n“There are many vying for your support in that Jan. 15 caucus that are walking away from those very same timeless principles and ideals that have minted our party and defined our movement over the last 50 years,” he said.\n\nPence warned in a speech in New Hampshire this month that other Republican candidates are embracing populism over conservatism, saying Republicans must choose traditional conservatism.\n\nMore:Mike Pence warns 'populist' Republican candidates like Trump traffic in 'performative outrage'\n\n“There’s already a party that believes in appeasement on the world stage,” Pence said. “There’s already a party that wants to ignore the debt crisis facing future generations. There’s already a party that wants to marginalize the right to life. I think the Republican party should be the conservative party for the United States of America and offer a vision to bring this country back based on our timeless principles.”\n\nPence reiterated his belief that arming the Ukrainian military is in the United States’ interests so that Russia doesn’t invade a country that the U.S. is obligated by treaty to defend.\n\n“My former running mate and others who you’ll even hear from tonight have walked away from American leadership in the world,” he said.\n\nPence also said he supports a national ban on abortion at 15 weeks, while encouraging states to pass laws that go further, like Iowa has done.\n\n“Why would we leave unborn babies in California and Illinois and New York to the devices of liberal state legislatures and liberal governors?” Pence said. “We need to stand for the unborn all across America and as your president I promise you’ll have a champion for life in the Oval Office.”\n\nPence also said he “absolutely” supports the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden launched by House Republicans this month, but he declined to say he would vote to impeach Biden if he were serving in Congress.\n\n“I don’t want to jump to conclusions about this,” he said. “But I must tell you, where there’s smoke there’s usually fire in Washington, D.C. And the American people deserve the facts.\"\n\nMore:In Iowa, Mike Pence welcomes House Republicans' impeachment inquiry into President Biden\n\nRyan Binkley talks about 'how to win the middle'\n\nTexas businessman and pastor Ryan Binkley said he was raised in a Christian household — that he gave his life to God at 13, drifted from his faith for a bit but at 24 recommitted his life to God and later opened a church.\n\nBinkley told Iowa Bird he thinks it's important to share his faith even in places where it might not be welcomed.\n\n“We have a freedom of religion, not freedom from religion, and we have a right to express it,” he said.\n\nHe shared further that the \"far-left woke agenda” is one of the most divisive issues in the country but talked about building bridges with members of the LGBTQ community who attended one of his events.\n\nThat agenda \"is one of the things we need to stand against,\" but Binkley said conservatives need to focus on \"how do we win the middle\" and \"the hearts of the people and show love.\" Now, he added, is the time \"for us to respect each other.\"\n\nOn foreign policy, Binkley told Bird that it's vital to show strength abroad and said he would support aid to Israel from the United States.\n\n“It’s so important for the world to know our heartfelt connection and spiritual connection as Christians and believers here tonight and what Israel means to us,” he said.\n\nPerry Johnson criticizes the Republican National Committee\n\nMichigan businessman Perry Johnson criticized the Republican National Committee during his interview with Bird.\n\nJohnson, who has claimed he was excluded from the first GOP presidential debate in August, says the RNC has “corrupted” the election process.\n\n“Instead of having us focus on Iowa, they want us to go national,” Johnson said, insisting that it’s time to “stop that.”\n\nJohnson during the interview emphasized the importance of family — that parents can choose what school to send their children to — before briefly segueing into his plan to dismantle the Department of Education.\n\n\"There is nothing more important to our country than our children,\" he said. \"They are our future.\"\n\nWill Hurd: U.S. must protect relationship with Israel, be critical of Iran\n\nFormer Texas congressman Will Hurd called for the U.S. to renew the strength of its partnership with Israel, saying Biden had not prioritized that relationship amid a string of critiques on the administration's foreign policy.\n\n\"Those that are running for the highest office in the land need to recognize who are our friends, who are our enemies,\" Hurd said. \"Israel is our friend and we should be supportive.\"\n\nHe also criticized the administration's prisoner swap with Iran that unfroze $6 billion, arguing the nation had \"destabilized the region.\"\n\nAsked by Bird how he would address \"election integrity,\" he said his solution was simple: to require identification to vote.\n\nHe said he supported a 15-week abortion ban and called for adequate resources to address neonatal health for new mothers.\n\nIn some parts of the country, \"their chances of dying are higher than some places in the developing world,\" Hurd said. \"To me that's unacceptable.\"\n\nLarry Elder says he doesn't support a federal law banning abortion\n\nRadio personality Larry Elder said he does not support passing a federal law restricting abortion and that the issue should be left to the states.\n\n“I feel so strongly about this issue. I personally believe that life begins at conception,” Elder said. “I do not, however, believe that it is an issue that the federal government should take over.”\n\nElder said Democrats were able to successfully use the issue of abortion against Republicans in the 2022 midterm elections by saying Republicans wanted to ban the procedure nationwide. He said he wants to see Democrats face more scrutiny over their abortion policies.\n\n“They want to call us extremists when they’re the ones who are the extremists,” he said.\n\nAbortion opponents believed the issue should be left to the states prior to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide, Elder said, and passing a federal law would undermine their historic arguments about states’ rights.\n\nElder said the only way he could support federal involvement in abortion legislation would be through a constitutional amendment.\n\n“That’s the only real way to do this,” he said. “Doing it with legislation is, to me, again, a refutation of everything we said about Roe v. Wade.”\n\nBut he said he doesn’t believe such a constitutional amendment would be successful. Instead, he said abortion opponents should help people experiencing crisis pregnancies by pointing them to options like adoption.\n\n“I think it’s far more important for us to use our resources, time and energy to make the moral case against abortion and to tell people that they have all sorts of options,” he said.\n\nSen. Tim Scott says COVID-19 vaccine mandates are \"bad,\" addresses his love life\n\nU.S. Sen. Tim Scott kept his answer simple when Bird asked him his thoughts on COVID-19 vaccine mandates.\n\nHe said they were “bad.”\n\n“We should never ever have mandates. I trust people to make their own decisions,” he explained.\n\nScott told Bird that “one of the worst decisions” made was to temporarily close schools during the pandemic and keep students at home. Students' “scores went down” and crime and unemployment rates “went up,\" he said.\n\nDuring the conversation, Scott said he supports school choice and if elected, he would take Gov. Kim Reynolds model and expand it on a national level. Scott stressed that he wants students, including those growing up in poverty or in rural America, to have quality education.\n\nBird also got personal with Scott and asked him about his love life, a topic that has made headlines in the past week.\n\n\"Other than your mom, is there a special lady in your life?\" Bird asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Scott, who is the only unmarried Republican presidential candidate. He didn't reveal her identity — only that she is \"a lovely Christian girl.\"\n\nAsa Hutchinson hits Trump, other Republicans on abortion & immigration policies\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, searching for momentum in the polls, criticized several of his challengers for their stances on immigration policy and abortion — including Trump.\n\nHe called restricting abortion \"a matter of conviction,\" and pointed to a recent news story that identified the former president as wanting to be a mediator between \"both sides\" of the issue. Reed, interviewing Hutchinson, clarified that it was Trump who had made that comment.\n\n\"Both sides aren't going to like you,\" Hutchinson said. \"This is going to be a fight for life, and we've been doing that for 40 years. You take a stand, you state your position.\"\n\nAsked about what needs to be done on the southern border, Hutchinson urged caution toward other Republican candidates who have called for an effective military invasion of Mexico to combat cartel activity, instead urging a more cooperative approach.\n\n\"They're a friend and country, we can't invade Mexico, we shouldn't invade Mexico,\" Hutchinson said. \"But we've got to pressure them economically to work with us to enforce the rule of law.\"\n\nHutchinson, who served as an impeachment manager in the House during the Clinton administration, said he supported House Republicans' new inquiry into President Joe Biden, saying there were \"a lot of unanswered questions.\"\n\nRon DeSantis says he supports Sen. Tommy Tuberville's hold on military appointments\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis was the first candidate to speak at Saturday night's event. Faith and Freedom Coalition Chair Ralph Reed asked DeSantis whether U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama is right to hold up the promotions of senior military officers over the Defense Department's abortion policies.\n\n\"Yes,\" DeSantis said. \"I support what he’s doing. First of all, what the Defense Department is doing is outside the law. They are breaking, violating the law by funding abortion tourism with tax dollars, and so when agencies do that, the Congress has to stand up and push back against it.\"\n\nTuberville has held up more than 300 promotions for senior military officers that require Senate confirmation this year due to his objection to the Defense Department's policy to pay for traveling expenses for service members who travel out of state for abortions.\n\nDeSantis said if he's elected president, Biden's policy \"goes into the trash can where it belongs.\"\n\n\"We have a limited amount of money in the defense budget,\" DeSantis said. \"We’re running low on ammunition. Our recruiting is in the absolute gutter now and you’re funding abortion tourism? Is that really something that is helping to protect this country?\"\n\nReed also asked DeSantis to talk about how his Catholic faith sustains him and informs what he does as a leader.\n\n\"Faith in God provides you with the strength to be able to weather the storms that come when you’re exercising leadership,\" DeSantis said, pointing to political battles in Florida over COVID policies and LGBTQ instruction in schools.\n\n\"People sometimes ask me, ‘What does it take to be an effective leader?’\" DeSantis said. \"And to me, I would say first, put on the full armor of God. Then you can be an effective leader when you do that.\"\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds kicks off night of speeches\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, greeted by a standing ovation, kicked off the night’s speeches to a roomful of about 1,100 people.\n\n“Like our founders, this organization understands that faith in God is the very foundation of our freedom, making us strong, resilient, and confident in the defense of those rights,” she said. “And let me tell you a bold, self-confident faith is what this nation needs now more than ever.”\n\nShe touted Iowa’s “fetal heartbeat” six-week abortion ban, its ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth and a sweeping “school choice” law that lets families use taxpayer funds to help pay for private schools.\n\nReynolds said she hopes to set a turnout record in the 2024 Republican caucuses.\n\n“To do that, we need everyone in the fight,” she said. “And this incredible turnout tonight gives me so much hope and it’s so encouraging, that I know that we can do this.”\n\nCandidates travel Iowa on Saturday before arriving at banquet\n\nSeveral candidates made campaign stops around the state Saturday before arriving in Des Moines to speak at the Faith & Freedom banquet.\n\nDeSantis stopped by the Fort Des Moines Church of Christ for a campaign event on Saturday afternoon alongside the Faith Wins activist group. He was there to draw attention to an issue he said \"does not get the attention it deserves\": the \"preservation and the restoration of religious freedom.\"\n\n\"Recently, over the recent decades, you've seen a steady chipping away of what the founders viewed as true religious freedom,\" DeSantis said. \"And the left in this country is intent on infringing your religious freedom.\"\n\nJoined by pastors, business owners, legislators and others from Iowa and outside of the state, DeSantis and his assembled allies focused much of their frustration on pandemic-era restrictions that in some states limited or halted religious services in the early months of the virus.\n\nThey criticized the liberal Supreme Court justices who voted against recent rulings on religious expression; Democratic elected officials and governors; and transgender people.\n\n\"They're trying to establish a religion,\" DeSantis said. \"It's a religion of leftism.\"\n\nCandidates spend morning trap shooting in Newton\n\nEarlier in the day, four presidential candidates took turns shooting trap at the Jasper County GOP’s annual trap shoot.\n\n“I’m Mike Pence. I’m from Indiana. I like to shoot guns and I’m running for president of the United States of America,” the former vice president began his remarks to the group of local Republicans lining up to shoot.\n\n“I look forward to shooting with all of you,” Pence said. “They’re giving me a couple of real experienced guys to shoot with me and I said if you want to go ahead and shoot at the same time I shoot that’d be just fine.”\n\nWearing cowboy boots, jeans and a leather pouch of shotgun shells, Pence stepped up to take his turn at the trap shoot, where he hit 12 out of 25 targets\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said inflation is hurting the country.\n\n“We always talk about the cost of eggs, the cost of goods in the store and the cost of gasoline,” he said. “Well, let me tell you, inflation hits the cost of shotgun shells as well.”\n\nTexas businessman and pastor Ryan Binkley joked that some of the regulars gave him some tips.\n\n“Hopefully I can hit a few,” he said. “I got some tips from the young guys, so I think I’m in good shape.”\n\nE. W. Jackson said he was angry about what’s happening in the country, criticizing New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham for issuing an order temporarily suspending the right to carry firearms in public places.\n\n\"The New Mexico governor had the unmitigated gall to suspend the 2nd Amendment for 30 days,” Jackson said. “What's next?\"\n\nNikki Haley shares 'hard truths' as she returns to Iowa\n\nHaley hit the ground running with a slew of campaign events in Iowa, marking her first return to the Hawkeye State since the Iowa State Fair on Aug. 12.\n\nHaley, who had a strong performance during last month’s first Republican debate, has split her time in her home state of South Carolina and New Hampshire.\n\nOn Friday, Haley held a three-part event at Crystal Creek Enterprise in Grand Mound, meeting with hundreds of voters and speaking to state and agricultural leaders. On Saturday, before the Faith and Freedom event in Des Moines, Haley held a town hall at Jethro’s BBQ in West Des Moines and appeared at a Q&A event with former Gov. Terry Branstad in Indianola.\n\nThroughout the weekend, Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and U.N. ambassador, spoke of “hard truths” — that Republicans are also to blame for the $32 trillion of federal debt.\n\n“Republicans have put in the budget $7.4 billion worth of pet projects in earmarks. Democrats put in $2.8 billion. You tell me who the big spenders are now,” she said Friday to a crowd of more than 100 attendees.\n\nHaley also touted plans to close the southern border while highlighting the gaps in America's immigration system. She wants to do away with quotas and instead \"vet and approve\" immigrants based on their merits and employ them in industries in need of workers such as farming, construction and tourism.\n\n\"Don't let anyone tell you that we have to deal with the border or illegal immigration. We deal with both at the same time,\" she said. \"Our legal immigration system is broken. It should not take someone 10 years to become a citizen.\"\n\nTim Scott starts his Saturday with a town hall in a Dubuque church\n\nOn his way to Des Moines, Scott stopped in Dubuque for a town hall event at the Word of Life Church. There he worked the crowd and touted his recently-released economic platform while comparing Biden’s record on the economy to the Jimmy Carter administration.\n\n“That was a nation in retreat,” Scott said. “18% interest rates. Getting a home was 15%. Running out of gas and the gas stations spiking your prices. But in less than four years, we were talking about the city on the hill. … You see when you’re in a retreat, all you have to do is change the leadership and turn it around.”\n\nScott, who often points to his poor upbringing on the trail, said he wants to restore a sense of the dignity of work, and that he rejects other forms of social advancement.\n\n“Equity cannot be given. It must be earned. I will not be the president that gives away equity. I think this whole notion we give people something they haven’t earned is destroying the soul of our country,” he said. “… I want to restore the sense of urgency, that all things are possible, and frankly those of us who are American citizens, you won the lottery. Use it. Go to work.”\n\nDes Moines Register reporter William Morris contributed reporting.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/business/kroger-albertsons-merger/index.html", "title": "Kroger-Albertsons merger: Two of the largest supermarkets in ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nKroger announced Friday that it plans to buy Albertsons in a nearly $25 billion deal that could change the US retail industry and impact how millions of customers buy their groceries.\n\nThe deal, which is expected to close in 2024, would combine two of the largest supermarket chains in the country and create one of its largest private employers. The two companies have a combined 710,000 workers – most of them unionized in an industry with low union rates – nearly 5,000 stores and more than $200 billion in sales. The companies say they reach 85 million households.\n\nThe retail industry has consolidated in recent years, and merging would give the companies greater scale to fend off competition from Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT) and other retail giants. Traditional supermarkets have been pressured by these companies and others – discount chains such as Dollar General (DG) and Aldi, warehouse clubs like Costco (COST), and online grocers.\n\nThe merger “accelerates our position as a more compelling alternative to larger and non-union competitors,” Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said in a statement Friday.\n\nIf the deal is completed, it would be one of the largest mergers in US retail history – dwarfing Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion. The company would become the third largest retail chain in America by sales. Its combined market share in the $1.4 trillion grocery industry would be 13.5%, according to Morgan Stanley, making it the second largest grocer behind Walmart’s 15.5% share.\n\nThe move also comes as companies battle higher costs and food inflation reaches its highest level in decades. Prices at grocery stores continued to soar last month. The food at home index, a proxy for grocery store prices, increased 0.7% in September from the month prior and 13% over the last year.\n\nKroger said the deal would benefit consumers and it will use half a billion dollars in cost savings from the merger to invest in lower prices. Albertsons is known for having higher prices than Kroger and analysts say Kroger may try to lower the chain’s prices.\n\nKroger (KR) will buy Albertsons for $34.10 a share — a roughly 30% premium above the grocery chain’s average share price over the course of the past month. Shares of Kroger (KR) slid 5% in early trading Friday, while Albertsons dropped 7%.\n\nThe two companies operate dozens of grocery chains. Kroger operates Ralphs, Harris Teeter, Dillons, Fred Meyer and others, while Albertsons owns Safeway and Vons. The companies said they will spin off nearly 400 stores to form a new rival in an effort to gain antitrust clearance.\n\nAnalysts expect some store closures if the deal goes through and also say it will be a significant hurdle to pass antitrust scrutiny.\n\n“A deal of this size that has a direct impact on consumers would face significant scrutiny from regulators and take a long time period to be approved,” Joseph Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said.\n\nConsumer watchdogs, unions, and Democrats have already come out strongly against the deal. They say it would harm consumers by raising prices and driving out competition. It could also spur a new wave of consolidation in the industry among smaller companies attempting to compete.\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), which represents 1.3 million workers in grocery stores, meatpacking plants and other essential industries along the food supply chain also voiced some concern about the proposed merger.\n\n“The proposed merger has serious implications for hundreds of thousands of our UFCW members and America’s families who are more concerned than ever about inflation’s impact on the price of their food and groceries, prescription drugs, and gas. As America’s largest union of essential workers, protecting the livelihoods of this nation’s grocery workers, union and non-union, is our highest priority,” UFCW International president Marc Perrone, said in a statement Friday.\n\n“To be clear, the UFCW will oppose any merger that threatens the jobs of America’s essential workers, union and non-union, and undermines our communities,” he said.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders called it a “absolute disaster” and called on the Biden administration to reject the deal. The American Economic Liberties Project, an anti-monopoly organization, said the “merger would be disastrous for market competition, small businesses, and especially – consumers’ pockets.”\n\nFTC chair Lina Khan is critic of corporate consolidation, and the regulator has blocked large retail mergers in the past, including Staples’ attempts to combine with Office Depot.\n\nThe FTC is currently looking into anti-competitive practices in the grocery industry and requested information last year from Kroger and others on the causes of empty shelves and surging prices in the United States.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn Jordan Valinsky", "Nathaniel Meyersohn", "Jordan Valinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/us/2022-in-review-fast-facts/index.html", "title": "2022 In Review Fast Facts | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nHere is a look back at the events of 2022.\n\nNotable US Events\n\nJanuary 3 - The US Food and Drug Administration expands the emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine boosters to children ages 12 to 15.

University trustees announced the gift from Dr. Marnix Heersink on Tuesday. The medical school will be named for Heersink, and the money will be used to establish global health and biomedical innovation institutes, university officials said. An additional $5 million is being contributed by Triton Health Systems, bringing the total pledge to $100 million. The money will also help recruit and retain scientists and physicians in priority areas such as pulmonology, oncology and neurology through endowed chairs and professorships, officials said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A second hospital in Alaska has invoked crisis standards of care, allowing a committee of physicians to determine clinical decisions regarding patient treatment as the state continues to see a spike in COVID-19 cases. The Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corp. in Bethel announced the activation of the guidelines in a statement posted on its website Wednesday, the same day the facility was operating at capacity. The standards allow overwhelmed hospitals to modify their usual, expected level of care. Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage, the state’s largest health care facility, earlier invoked the same guidelines. Health officials at the Bethel hospital said there might be delays transferring people to a referring hospital, along with expanded nurse-patient ratio and longer wait times for elective procedures such as colonoscopies and pediatric dental procedures. The decision to continue these types of elective procedures are made on a daily or weekly basis.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Passenger rail service is one step closer to returning to Phoenix for the first time in 25 years as a federal infrastructure plan that would provide billions for rail gains traction in Congress. As part of a nationwide expansion, Amtrak is proposing to connect Tucson to Phoenix for the first time since 1996. The plan calls for extending the line through the West Valley, where it would then connect to Los Angeles. Phoenix is the largest city in the country without Amtrak service. Service never resumed after shutting down in June 1996 for a criminal investigation into the derailment of a train in western Arizona that killed a crewman and injured 78 people. Rail service runs from Tucson to Los Angeles through Maricopa, which is about 35 miles south of Phoenix. The plan has received support from mayors along the proposed line. About a dozen mayors from both political parties sent a letter on Tuesday to the state’s congressional delegation calling on lawmakers to provide funding to implement the new route. They said the route would diversify transportation options, connect the state’s two largest metropolitan areas and spur development along the line.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lawmakers considered competing redistricting proposals that would divide the state’s most populous county between congressional seats on Wednesday. The House and Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs committees did not advance any proposals for redrawing districts as the Legislature reconvened to redraw the state’s four U.S. House boundaries. Both panels showed support for plans that would divide Pulaski County. One bill pending before the House committee would split the county, which includes the Little Rock area, between the 1st and 2nd congressional districts. Another before the Senate panel would split the county between the 2nd and 4th districts. Pulaski is part of the 2nd District, which Democrats have tried unsuccessfully to flip in recent elections. Republicans hold all four of the state’s congressional seats and majorities in both chambers of the Legislature. Proponents of splitting up Pulaski have said it makes sense given the county’s location in the state’s center and that it could prevent dividing up even more counties around the state. But Democrats in Pulaski County oppose the move, saying it would divide the community. Arkansas’ current congressional map divides up five counties.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDublin: Ray J. Garcia, the warden of the Federal Correctional Institute Dublin in California’s San Francisco Bay area, has been charged with sexually abusing an inmate, authorities said Wednesday. Garcia, 54, of Merced, allegedly groped at least one of his female wards, asked at least two inmates to strip naked for him and took and stored photographs of a naked inmate in a cell at the prison, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney’s office. Garcia also is accused of trying to deter a victim from reporting the abuse by telling her “that he was ‘close friends’ with the individual responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct by inmates and … that he could not be fired,” according to the statement. Garcia was associate warden at the all-female low-security lockup at the time of the alleged abuse, prosecutors said. He later became warden but was placed on leave in July and he was charged last week with sexual abuse of a ward. It’s the latest of at least three sexual abuse cases involving employees at FCI Dublin, located 20 miles southeast of Oakland.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A judge on Wednesday dismissed an attempt by a group of Denver police officers to block the city’s vaccine mandate from taking effect. In a lawsuit filed last week, seven officers claimed the city lacked the authority to impose the mandate under a local disaster emergency declared by Mayor Michael Hancock at the beginning of the pandemic. They noted Democratic Gov. Jared Polis rescinded his statewide emergency pandemic order in July. The officers said the city should have instead followed the more drawn-out process laid out in state law to impose regulations. However, Judge Shelley Gilman ruled that law applies only to state agencies. Under city law, the officers should have appealed the vaccine mandate, first issued on Aug. 2, to the health board before filing a lawsuit, she said. Since they did not, Gilman said she had no jurisdiction to decide the case and dismissed it, granting a request made by the city in its response to the lawsuit filed Tuesday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nCoventry: Uncertainty about the species of a massive catfish that was eaten before it could be vetted by authorities in August has led Connecticut to withdraw its awarding of a new state record. Connecticut Fish and Wildlife wrote in a Facebook post on Monday that because it was not able to examine the actual fish, authorities cannot confirm it was a white catfish. “Without the ability to examine the actual fish, identification is left to still images and videos, which have proven to be ambiguous and inconclusive to definitively identify the species of catfish in this case,” state Fish and Wildlife wrote, adding that it is not disputing the weight of the catch that was made on Aug. 21. Ben Tomkunas, 25, of Coventry, who caught the 21.3-pound fish, said he gave it to his grandfather the morning after he caught it and it was eaten. “I can’t believe that they think it’s OK to do this to someone,” Tomkunas told the Journal Inquirer. “It’s such an embarrassment.” It can be difficult to distinguish between white catfish and channel catfish, which are generally larger. The previous state record for a white catfish was 12.7 pounds. The International Game Fish Association has recorded the world record for a white catfish catch to be 19.3 pounds for a fish caught in 2005 in California.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A Wilmington officer has been placed on administrative duty after video circulating on social media showed him repeatedly banging a man’s head during an arrest, news outlets reported. The Wilmington Police Department said its Office of Professional Standards immediately launched an investigation into the Sept. 21 incident. A clip from a security video circulating online showed an officer shove a man in a convenience store, then grab his head and slam it twice into plexiglass before taking him down. “It shows clear abuse of power and unwarranted excessive force,” said Wilmington activist Coby Owens. “That’s 100% unacceptable.” Police said the patrol officer has been with the department for three years, but didn’t identify him. “The video of this incident is concerning and we will conduct a thorough investigation and take any necessary action to ensure all of our members adhere to the highest standards of service to our community,” police department spokesman David Karas said. Police were responding to a report that the man harassed daycare employees, Karas said. Court documents that the officer signed state that “after a brief physical struggle (that the man) attempted to physically resist, he was taken into custody.” He was charged with harassment, resisting arrest and other offenses.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Through Oct. 15, Metro customers will be able to save up to 50% on select passes, WUSA-TV reported. For the first time, Metro launched a sales event that will allow riders to purchase discounted passes with unlimited trips on Metrorail and Metrobus, whether they travel one day, one week or one month. During the sale, customers can purchase the one-, three-, and seven-day passes to use anytime. Monthly passes will be valid for use from Friday to Oct. 31, Metro said in a release. “This is a great way to come back to work, restaurants, theater, museums, sports events and outdoor activities this fall with a pass that lets you ride at a deep discount,” said Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld in a statement. “We have also enhanced cleaning on buses and trains and improved the ventilation, making it safer and now more affordable for customers to give Metro a try.” Along with fare and service improvements, Metro officials hope the pass sale will attract riders back to Metro following a dip in ridership because of the pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers:Florida’s grasshopper sparrow subspecies was the rarest bird in the continental U.S. just a few years ago, but a captive breeding program has numbers climbing. In the past three years, Audubon Florida has helped release almost 500 grasshopper sparrows from a captive breeding program. “It was scary because you have this bird you’ve raised in captivity and you just throw them out in the wild but it turned out that they did very well,” said Paul Gray, a bird expert and scientist with Audubon Florida. Grasshopper sparrows can be found from the Orlando area south to Lake Okeechobee – in Highlands, Okeechobee, Osceola and Polk counties. Males establish their territories from March to July by producing a series of calls, or songs, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Grasshopper sparrows build dome-shaped nests from grasses that are typically found beside or under a dwarf oak or saw palmetto. Breeding occurs throughout the year, and the grasshopper sparrow might nest upward of three times during a season. Three to five eggs are laid, with hatching taking place in 11 to 12 days. Like many endangered and threatened species in Florida, habitat loss is one of the top threats for the tiny sparrows. Grasshopper sparrow habitat can also be degraded when vegetation becomes overgrown (Florida’s landscape evolved with regular fires), or when invasive species work their way into the grasses and take over.\n\nGeorgia\n\nKingsland: A federal agency said it’s again delaying a final decision on whether to permit construction of a launchpad for commercial rockets on the Georgia coast. The Federal Aviation Administration now plans to issue a decision on Spaceport Camden by Nov. 3 “due to ongoing consultation efforts,” agency spokesman Steve Kulm said in a statement. Previously, the FAA had said it intended to make a final determination on the project by the end of July, then shifted its target date to the end of September. Camden County in Georgia’s coastal, southeast corner has spent nine years and $10 million seeking permission to build what would be the nation’s 13th licensed commercial spaceport. The proposal took a big step forward in June, when the FAA issued an environmental impact study that concluded building the spaceport would be its “preferred alternative.” The National Park Service and its parent agency, the U.S. Department of the Interior, pushed back over the summer. They disputed the FAA’s conclusion that the spaceport poses minimal risks or adverse impacts to Cumberland Island, a federally protected wilderness that lies along the proposed flight path for rockets 5 miles east of the launch site.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: More than 160 Oahu business operators have been cited, warned or arrested in the weeks since Honolulu imposed new COVID-19 safety rules, including requiring proof of vaccination or negative test results. Honolulu police have issued citations or made arrests in 44 cases since the new mandates went into effect Sept. 13, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Police have also issued over 100 written warnings for a variety of violations and made an unspecified number of “verbal, non-written warnings.” City officials could not immediately break down the number of arrests versus citations because they are compiled together in the same records-keeping category, said Honolulu Police Department spokesperson Michelle Yu. But she said the majority were citations, and very few were arrests. The greatest number of arrests or citations – 17 – were for lack of face coverings, and 11 were for not following social or physical distances. Violations carry a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a fine of $5,000.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A coalition of journalists is asking an Idaho judge to hold the state’s lieutenant governor in contempt of court for refusing to turn over public documents despite the judge’s order that she do so. Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin, a Republican, was ordered more than a month ago to release the documents regarding her newly created Education Task Force, which was tasked with investigating alleged “indoctrination” in the state’s public school system. The order came in response to a lawsuit filed by the Idaho Press Club on behalf of several journalists who said McGeachin’s office wrongly denied their public records requests for the material. But McGeachin never released the public documents despite multiple attempts from the Idaho Press Club’s attorney, Wendy Olson, to get McGeachin to comply, according to court documents filed Wednesday. McGeachin earlier filed a motion asking the judge to reconsider the case, but then never filed the supporting documentation required by the judge. McGeachin did not immediately respond to a voice mail and email from the Associated Press requesting comment. The Idaho Press Club said in a prepared statement that it is “truly unfortunate” that the case reached the point where the organization had to file the contempt of court petition.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A northern Illinois man has died of rabies after apparently being bitten by a bat – the first human case of rabies in the state since 1954, health officials reported Tuesday. The diagnosis has been confirmed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Illinois Department of Public Health said in a release. The man’s name was not released. Officials said he was in his 80s and lived in Lake County. He woke up in mid-August and found a bat on his neck. The bat was captured and later tested positive for rabies. The man declined to begin post-exposure rabies treatment, health officials said. The rabies virus attacks the central nervous system and causes disease and brain death. The man began experiencing neck pain, a headache, difficulty controlling his arms, finger numbness, difficulty speaking and other symptoms of the disease. A bat colony later was found in his home. “Sadly, this case underscores the importance of raising public awareness about the risk of rabies exposure in the United States,” Lake County Health Department Executive Director Mark Pfister said. “Rabies infections in people are rare in the United States, however, once symptoms begin, rabies is almost always fatal, making it vital that an exposed person receive appropriate treatment to prevent the onset of rabies as soon as possible.” Thirty bats have tested positive in Illinois this year for rabies, according to the health department.\n\nIndiana\n\nPortage: Preliminary tests indicated iron-contaminated wastewater that leaked from a northwestern Indiana steel plant into a Lake Michigan tributary presented no risk to public health, the Environmental Protection Agency said. U.S. Steel Midwest idled the plant in Portage, about 30 miles east of Chicago, as a precaution after it said a wastewater treatment facility experienced “an upset condition” that sent the rusty colored plume containing elevated levels of lead into the Burns Waterway on Sunday. The EPA said it tested surface water samples taken near the plant’s outfall. Federal and state agencies were continuing to investigate the cause of the discharge, possible Clean Water Act compliance issues and impacts to the environment, the agency said. The plant was back up and running Wednesday, according to The (Northwest Indiana) Times. Indiana Dunes National Park also closed all of its beaches and the Portage Lakefront and Riverwalk until further notice and Indiana American Water shut down its Ogden Dunes treatment facility, both as a precaution.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Mayor Bruce Teague has “indefinitely extended” the city’s emergency order requiring masks in indoor gathering spots and when social distancing is not possible. The emergency order, first issued on Aug. 19, was set to expire Thursday. “We have to do what we can individually to protect ourselves, as well as everyone else,” Teague said. He said a number of factors went into his decision to extend the mandate indefinitely. He noted the prevalence of the delta variant and Johnson County’s high level of community transmission – a problem in all of Iowa’s 99 counties, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Face coverings will continue to be required in indoor public settings such as grocery and retail stores, pharmacies, restaurants and bars, movie theaters and houses of worship, among other locations in the city. Masks are also required when using public transportation, taxis or ride share. The order also requires masks be worn in public school buildings and in University of Iowa academic buildings and businesses offices. But UI administrators previously advised campus leaders that the mandate does not apply to them because of state law. And the Iowa City Community School District unanimously reinstated its own mask mandate earlier this month after a federal judge issued a restraining order barring the state from enforcing a law that prevents local school boards from issuing mask mandates.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Thousands of people turned out Wednesday to honor a Kansas priest as he was laid to rest 70 years after he died in a prisoner of war camp during the Korean War. Mourners filled Hartman Arena for a funeral service for the Rev. Emil Kapaun and later lined streets to watch his body being carried by a horse-drawn caisson from Veterans Memorial Park to the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, where he was interred. “We are here today to provide for father what was not provided for him 70 years ago, a mass of Christian burial,” Bishop Carl A. Kemme of the Wichita diocese told the crowd. Speakers extolled Kapaun’s Christian love and his courage during his days as a prisoner or war, which he spent providing comfort to his fellow soldiers. They also said it was appropriate that his body had finally returned to the state where he was born. Kapaun, an Army chaplain, was captured in 1950 near Unsan, North Korea, while tending to fellow soldiers. He died in May 1951 at the POW camp while continuing to minister to fellow prisoners. He was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2013. In 1993, the Catholic church named him a “Servant of God,” the first step of a lengthy process that could lead to canonization.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Statewide test results from last spring showed that less than half of students scored at the proficient or distinguished levels in many Kentucky schools. The tests scores were aimed at better understanding how students performed academically amid learning disruptions caused by COVID-19. State education officials cautioned the latest test scores can’t be compared with pre-pandemic scores. Students faced challenges as schools switched to remote learning for months because of the pandemic. “We knew these results would not be what we wanted to see, but the previous two school years saw extreme challenges,” state Education Commissioner Jason Glass said in a news release Wednesday. “We can use this information to address the gaps caused by COVID-19 disruptions and provide our students with the supports they need to be successful.” Because the pandemic affected many aspects of education in the past school year, the state Education Department received a waiver from federal accountability. As a result, school accountability indicators and ratings weren’t part of the 2020-2021 reporting.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Louisiana has recovered a missing lunar rock gifted to the state to commemorate the last manned U.S. mission to the moon after it turned up in the hands of a man who recycles wooden plaques. The rock from the 1972 Apollo 17 landing was in the possession of the Louisiana State Museum on Tuesday, The Advocate of Baton Rouge reported. It was returned to the state late last year by a Florida man who planned to use wood from the plaque that held it to repair a gun, according to the newspaper. But the recovery was not revealed until Monday when a journalist and space historian, Robert Pearlman, reported it in the online publication CollectSpace, The Advocate said. “As you can appreciate, I’m just happy that it is here now,” museum interim Director Steven Maklansky said. The lunar fragment was one of hundreds presented to states, territories and foreign nations in the early to mid-1970s by the administration of former President Richard Nixon. They included samples taken by Neil Armstrong and the Apollo 11 crew during the first moon landing in 1969. But many of them later went missing. Louisiana also had an Apollo 11 rock that was thought to be missing, but The Advocate discovered it was in storage at the Louisiana Art and Science Museum.\n\nMaine\n\nBelfast: A tuna weighing 600 pounds was donated to a Belfast soup kitchen for its meals last week by a lobster fishing crew that netted the fish. The crewmembers from J & J Lobster were catching bait near the coast when the massive bluefin tuna hit their net, the Bangor Daily News reported. “It was an adrenaline rush to say the least,” the owner of J & J Lobster, Jamie Steeves, told New England Cable News. The crew was not initially authorized to bring the tuna to shore, since they were fishing specifically for bait. But Steeves called the state Marine Patrol, which said it would allow the crew to bring the fish in if they could find a place to donate it. They reached out to the Belfast Soup Kitchen and its executive director, Cherie Merrill. “He cold-called, asking ‘Can you use a 600-pound tuna?’ ” Merrill told the Bangor Daily News. “I never say no to anything, but all I could picture was dropping this 600-pound fish off at the door.” Volunteers from the kitchen and J & J Lobster salvaged about 300 pounds of meat from the tuna. The first tuna steaks were served Tuesday.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A conservative Roman Catholic media outlet seeking to stage a rally during a U.S. bishops’ meeting in Baltimore claims city officials canceled the event because they disapproved of its religious message. The city said the gathering posed a threat to public safety, claiming the fringe group cheered on rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in January. The event planners are asking a federal judge to decide whether the city is trampling on their First Amendment rights. U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander scheduled a hearing Thursday on a lawsuit filed Sept. 13 by St. Michael’s Media against the city, Mayor Brandon Scott and City Solicitor James Shea. Michigan-based St. Michael’s Media, also known as Church Militant, is a tax-exempt nonprofit and digital media outlet. The group said it publishes news stories on its website about the Catholic Church and often criticizes church leadership. St. Michael’s planned to hold a “prayer rally” Nov. 16 at a city-owned waterfront pavilion. An event advertisement touted speeches by former President Donald Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon and activist Milo Yiannopoulos. In a court filing, the city said it instructed the contractor that manages the pavilion to cancel the event “out of a legitimate fear that it would incite violence in the heart of downtown Baltimore.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state Supreme Judicial Court rejected a claim that county jails across the state violated the due process rights of inmates during the coronavirus pandemic. The state public defenders agency and the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union argued the sheriffs who run the jails failed to implement regular across-the-board coronavirus testing, and they had not adequately followed an earlier court ruling to reduce their inmate populations, The Salem News reported. The Supreme Judicial Court in Tuesday’s decision acknowledged the risks COVID-19 posed to inmates, but said under the circumstances, the responses of the 13 county sheriffs “are not unreasonable.” The public defender’s agency, the Committee for Public Counsel Services, had no response to the decision, a spokesperson said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: State lawmakers are poised to consider bipartisan bills aimed at helping potentially thousands of sex abuse victims sue for damages, including those molested by a University of Michigan sports physician. It is the second time since 2018 the Legislature might overhaul laws in the wake of a major abuse scandal. Similar legislation was enacted following the conviction of Larry Nassar, who sexually abused hundreds of female athletes under the guise of medical treatment, including at Michigan State University. Under the new measures, victims of the late Dr. Robert Anderson at the University of Michigan and others would get additional time to bring lawsuits that might be barred by a statute of limitations. Government entities could not use the immunity defense if they knew or should have known of an accused’s prior sexual misconduct and failed to intervene. Similar government immunity legislation stalled three years ago – after Michigan State agreed to a $500 million settlement for Nassar’s victims – amid pushback from universities, schools, municipalities, businesses and the Catholic Church over the financial implications of facing an unknown number of suits for old allegations. Opposition could form again.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State wildlife officials said two Minnesota farms received deer from a Wisconsin farm where chronic wasting disease was detected last month. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said the news was “extremely concerning” and the agency is “actively considering management responses” to the threat facing the state’s wild deer population. A recent report in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said that the Wisconsin deer farm where the disease was detected sold nearly 400 deer to 40 farms across seven states in the past five years. Two of those farms were in Minnesota. One was at a now-defunct farm in Stillwater, which received two deer in 2016. Those deer were eventually transferred back to Wisconsin in 2019. Investigators are working to determine if those deer are still alive and have been tested, WCCO-TV reported. The other Minnesota farm to receive deer from the contaminated farm was in Clear Lake. Officials said the farm received three deer in 2017, two of which were killed earlier this year. The disease was not detected in them. The third deer is still alive and the owner is awaiting payment befoe making the animal available for testing. The Clear Lake farm’s entire herd is under quarantine.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Two street preachers who were convicted of misdemeanor simple assault for calling a woman a “Jezebel” and waving a Bible in a man’s face were released from jail Wednesday after a judge found they were being held under “grossly unreasonable” bond.The $500,000 appearance bond for each preacher was at least 500 times the amount recommended by the Mississippi Rules of Criminal Procedure for bail pending trial. “I’ve seen bonds set in rape cases, aggravated assault cases far more serious than this, and nowhere near half a million dollars,” said Judge Jess H. Dickinson, a retired Mississippi Supreme Court justice appointed to help with a backload of cases in Hinds County Court. Dickinson reduced the bond to $5,000 each. Allan Grant Siders and Bryan Peden, preachers for Church at Jackson, were convicted Sept. 22. Jackson Municipal Judge Jeffrey Reynolds sentenced Siders to six months and Peden to three months in jail. The men were preaching outside businesses in Jackson’s Fondren neighborhood when Jackson resident Matthew Camp said they shouted at him and his girlfriend repeatedly using a voice amplification system, calling her a “Jezebel” and calling them “filthy fornicators.” He said they waved a Bible in his face in a threatening way and yelled at him so closely that spit landed on his face.\n\nMissouri\n\nChesterfield: Racist graffiti found on school bathroom walls in suburban St. Louis that led to a mass student walkout last week was scrawled by a Black student, school district officials said. The student admitted to administrators to writing the graffiti in multiple bathrooms at Parkway Central High School, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. In a letter to students, their families and staff on Tuesday, Superintendent Keith Marty said the student’s race “does not diminish the hurt it caused or the negative impact it has on our entire community.” Marty said the vandalism was a significant violation of multiple codes of conduct and that the matter had been referred to law enforcement. He also said the student would face “severe disciplinary consequences,” but did not details what those would be. Hundreds of students at Parkway Central walked out of class in protest last Thursday, a day after the racial slurs were found in boys’ bathrooms in Parkway Central and Parkway North. District spokeswoman Cathy Kelly said officials were close to finding the person who wrote the graffiti at Parkway North. School officials do not believe the incidents are related.\n\nMontana\n\nBig Sky: Authorities said unauthorized drone flights over a Montana wildfire prevented firefighting aircraft from being used against the blaze burning in rugged terrain south of Big Sky. Custer Gallatin National Forest officials said the fire in the drainage for Upper Taylor Fork creek grew to more than 70 acres by Wednesday. Drones over the area forced officials to ground aircraft for safety twice since the fire was first reported Monday afternoon, forest spokesperson Marna Daley said. The lack of air support meant crews on the ground had to take a less direct approach to suppressing the fire, which allowed it to grow. About 40 personnel were working on the fire with more due to arrive.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A four-month police operation targeting gang activity in Omaha and surrounding communities led to more than 230 arrests and the seizure of dozens of guns and more than $800,000 worth of illegal narcotics, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. The service said in a news release Tuesday that Operation Triple Beam/Operation K.O. was conducted from May through August and was led by the U.S. Marshals Service’s Metro Fugitive Task Force and the Omaha and Lincoln police departments. In addition to 231 arrests, officers seized 86 guns, about 42 pounds of narcotics worth nearly $822,000, more than 800 fentanyl pills and about $49,000 in cash, according to the release. Officers also found three missing children and recovered two stolen vehicles. The operation was part of a national effort developed by the Marshals Service to reduce gang violence by arresting violent fugitives, gang members and those who have committed violent crimes.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A judge dismissed a trademark infringement lawsuit filed by Evel Knievel’s son a year ago against the Walt Disney Co. and movie company Pixar over a “Toy Story 4” daredevil character named Duke Caboom. “We’re obviously disappointed,” Kelly Knievel said in a Monday email. “We are considering our options” at the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. U.S. District Judge James Mahan in Las Vegas dismissed the case against Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures on Sept. 23. The judge wrote that although the Caboom character was “reminiscent” of Knievel, “Disney’s use of Evel Knievel’s likeness contains significant transformative elements” and is not a literal depiction. An email message from The Walt Disney Co. spokesman Jeffrey R. Epstein said he was traveling and unavailable for immediate comment. Kelly Knievel, head of Las Vegas-based K and K Promotions, had characterized the Caboom character as “a direct knock-off of the legend and historical significance” of Knievel’s father, the famous stunt motorcyclist who died in 2007 at 69 in Florida of lung disease. The lawsuit filed in September 2020 accused Disney and Pixar of intentionally modeling the “Toy Story 4” character on Knievel, whose stunts included motorcycle jumps in 1967 over the Caesars Palace fountain in Las Vegas – including a spectacular near-fatal crash – and in 1975 over a row of buses at Wembley Stadium in London.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Angry opponents of the Biden administration’s new vaccine mandate forced the postponement of Wednesday’s Executive Council meeting, further delaying a vote on $27 million in federal aid to boost New Hampshire’s vaccination efforts. The Republican-controlled council, a five-member panel that approves state contracts and nominations to courts and agencies, had voted this month to table a request from the state Department of Health and Human Services to spend federal pandemic relief money on a public health program manager and a dozen workers to promote the COVID-19 vaccine and address public concerns about it. Republican lawmakers on the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee, which also must approve the request, have done the same. The request was back before the council on Wednesday, but the meeting in Manchester was called off after protesters moved around the room, shouting, “Shut it down,” according to video shared by WMUR-TV. After Councilor David Wheeler said state employees attending to answer questions about agenda items were in fear for the lives, one man shouted, “Mission accomplished!”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: A company that has received preliminary approval to build a wind farm off the southern coast of New Jersey is planning a second project. Atlantic Shores, a joint venture between EDF Renewables North America and Shell New Energies US, already has approval from New Jersey regulators to build a wind farm about 8.7 miles off the coast. But in a construction plan filed with the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Atlantic Shores revealed it is planning a second such project, one it has not publicly announced. That project could be considered in the next round of offshore wind project solicitations by New Jersey regulators in the third quarter of 2022. “Atlantic Shores’ second project, Project 2 … is being developed to support these future New Jersey solicitations,” the company wrote in its filing. The company has not said how many megawatts of power the second project might provide. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico students will take the SAT in spring 2022 as the state phases in a pandemic-delayed testing requirement aimed at increasing participation that varies widely by racial and ethnic groups. Those disparities were stark this spring as high school students were offered the test but didn’t have to take it. There were deep differences in high school juniors’ participation according to racial and ethnic groups, with particularly low totals among Indigenous students, data released by New Mexico’s education department showed. The state had planned to require high school juniors to take the English and Math exams this spring, replacing previous statewide assessments. About a dozen states including Ohio and New Jersey require students to take the SAT or list it as one of the options to fulfill federal requirements for standardized testing. But the pandemic made it harder for students nationwide to take the SAT. Logistical complications from the virus spurred New Mexico to get a waiver from federal testing requirements. Exactly 25% of eligible high school juniors took the test this spring in New Mexico, according to data released by the state’s Public Education Department this week. The rate was far lower for Indigenous students, with only 11% of high school juniors in that group taking the test.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The hit Broadway show “Aladdin” was canceled Wednesday night when breakthrough COVID-19 cases were reported within the musical’s company, a day after the show reopened following 18 months of being shuttered by the pandemic. It was a worrying sign for Broadway’s recovery. “Through our rigorous testing protocols, breakthrough COVID-19 cases have been detected within the company of ‘Aladdin’ at the New Amsterdam Theatre,” the show announced on social media. “Because the wellness and safety of our guests, cast and crew are our top priority, tonight’s performance, Wednesday, Sept. 29 , is canceled.” It was the first Broadway COVID-19 cancellation since shows resumed with Bruce Springsteen’s concert returning in July and “Pass Over” as the first play to debut in August. “Aladdin” said the status of future performances “will be updated.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Entertainer Nick Cannon is promising to pay off the loan debt of seven students at historically black colleges, including three in North Carolina, when they graduate. Cannon played host to students from Saint Augustine’s University, North Carolina A&T State University, Winston-Salem State University and other HBCUs on his nationally syndicated talk show Monday, The News & Observer of Raleigh reported. They spoke about the adversity they faced and their desire to attend college, particularly an HBCU. Cannon then told the students their outstanding college debt would be paid off when they graduate through a scholarship in partnership with the United Negro College Fund and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. He is an alumnus of Howard University, an HBCU in the District of Columbia. Mackenzie Estrep, a senior at Saint Augustine’s University, is a first-generation high school graduate and college student who is working three jobs to help pay for tuition. Sharandica Midcalf, a student at Winston-Salem State University, was homeless and said a school counselor told her she didn’t have the grade-point average to get into college, which motivated her to succeed as a first-generation college student. Christian Kornegay talked about how he overcame a learning disability and got accepted to North Carolina A&T University, where he’s working to become a professional host and entertainer.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A cold front moving through the region has eased record-breaking heat this week in North Dakota. According to the National Weather Service, Tuesday’s reading of 100 in Dickinson appeared to be the latest in the year that the state has recorded a triple-digit temperature. The temperature in Dickson was 2 degrees higher that the city’s previous record, set in 1905. Bismarck also had a record high Tuesday of 98 degrees, 1 degree higher than the city’s 1905 record for the date. Hot weather also covered eastern North Dakota. Grand Forks eclipsed its century-old record with a high of 91 degrees, the Bismarck Tribune reported. A cold front returned temperatures in the region to more seasonable levels Wednesday with readings in the 50s, 60s and 70s. The latest drought briefing from the weather service said “October is favored for continued above-average temperatures” across the state.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:Ohio's minimum wage will increase from $8.80 to $9.30 an hour for nontipped employees next year because of inflation. The minimum wage for tipped employees will increase from $4.40 to $4.65. The changes take effect Jan. 1 and apply to employees of businesses with annual gross receipts of more than $342,000 a year. A 2006 constitutional amendment ties annual increases in the rate to inflation. The Consumer Price Index increased by 5.8% over the 12-month period from Sept. 1, 2020 to Aug. 31. Next year's 50-cent increase is the largest in one year increase since the amendment raised the rate from $4.25 to $6.85 in 2007. For employees at smaller companies and 14- and 15-year-olds, the state minimum wage is the same as the federal wage, $7.25 an hour. Ohio is one of 18 states that makes automatic adjustments to the state minimum wage. Democrat-backed bills to raise the state wage to $15 per hour have failed to pass the GOP-controlled General Assembly.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTahlequah: The Oklahoma-based Cherokee Nation said it has reached 400,000 tribal citizens and expects to become the most populous indigenous tribe in the United States again. “In the coming months, Cherokee Nation Registration will be adding thousands more tribal citizens whose applications are already pending and awaiting verification, making the Cherokee Nation the largest tribe in the United States,” Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. said in a statement. In March, the Arizona-based Navajo Nation announced that it had become the nation’s most populous tribe when it reached a population of nearly 400,000 to surpass the Cherokee Nation, which then had about 392,000 citizens. However, the Cherokee Nation’s registration department has received up to 2,000 citizenship applications weekly since Hoskin announced a $2,000 COVID-19 assistance payment to all citizens and those approved as citizens by June 2022, according to the tribe. The applications for citizenship increased 10-fold from before the payment announcement, according to the tribe. Navajos also saw an enrollment increase as the tribe offered hardship assistance payments from last year’s federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, boosting the tribe’s rolls from about 306,000 to nearly 400,000 citizens.\n\nOregon\n\nNewberg: A school board that acted last month to ban educators from displaying Black Lives Matter and gay pride symbols has broadened the policy to prohibit district employees from displaying all types of political symbols. The move by the Newberg School Board last month to keep staff from displaying BLM or gay pride flags prompted strong criticism and threats to boycott the town of about 25,000 people southwest of Portland and its businesses. Oregon Public Broadcasting reported the board rescinded that rule Tuesday night and enacted a more sweeping policy banning any kind of political symbols, including those that support BLM or LGBTQ issues. “We need to get moving back toward education,” said Board Chair Dave Brown, who joined the majority in the 4-3 vote approving the new policy. “We’ve been derailed for quite a while.” The board’s initial move last month generated a backlash from Newberg city councilors and members of color of the Oregon Legislature. The Oregon State Board of Education called on the school board to reverse course, saying student identities should be welcomed and affirmed. Newberg School Board Vice Chair Brian Shannon said after Tuesday’s vote that it was time to move on. “This policy is so innocuous. It just says that teachers can’t display political symbols at work while they’re on school time,’ Shannon said. “I don’t want to spend five, six more minutes on this issue, let alone six more weeks.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state is mailing 375,000 holders of commercial driver’s licenses in a recruitment campaign meant to address a shortage of school bus drivers. The state has a little more than 42,000 school bus drivers, the smallest complement in five years and about 2,000 fewer than in 2017. The Department of Transportation will mail all current CDL holders about the need for bus drivers and inform them how they can get the right endorsement to operate a school bus, said Kurt Myers, PennDOT’s deputy secretary for driver and vehicle services. The state is hoping to address the shortage by appealing to drivers looking for work or seeking to supplement their income. “We want to do everything we possibly can to expand the number of individuals with school bus endorsements to be able to get our children to school. That’s the critical part of all of this,” Myers said. Schools across the nation are facing driver shortages, and many Pennsylvania districts are impacted, Myers said. PennDOT will also temporarily offer another day of CDL skills testing per week. The additional testing days will be held on Mondays for four consecutive weeks beginning Oct. 18.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport:Gustave White Sotheby's International Realty announced the sale of the 30,982-square-foot Miramar mansion at 646 Bellevue Ave., but did not include a sale price. The buyer was unrepresented by an agent, the release said. The property last sold in 2006 for $17.5 million, which at the time was the highest price paid for a single-family home in the city and perhaps in the state, according to a report in The Daily News. According to records in the Newport assessor's office, the estate consists of three properties – the mansion, a carriage house and a separate, vacant 1-acre oceanfront lot – on 7.2 acres of land. Streetcar magnate George Dunton Widener of Philadelphia commissioned noted architect Horace Trumbauer in the early 1900s to build his family a summer home in Newport. During the planning, Widener and his wife, Eleanor, and their son, Harry Elkins Widener, traveled to Europe. On the return trip, in 1912, the father and son went down with the Titanic, but Eleanor Widener survived. She later married Alexander Hamilton Jr., a Harvard professor and grandson of a Massachusetts governor, and completed Miramar in 1913-14. Miramar is the latest in Newport mansions to be sold. Clarendon Court, the former home of Claus and Sunny von Bulow at 626 Bellevue Ave., went earlier this month for $30 million, and Seaward estate at 339 Ocean Avenue was subdivided before being sold for $16 million.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A man in a standoff with police shot and injured a police dog who bit him as officers tried to take him into custody, investigators said. The standoff at a Greenville home continued for a few more hours before Anthony Shay Hawthorne was arrested, Greenville County Sheriff Hobart Lewis said in a statement Thursday. The dog, named Nikos, was shot in a paw and the head, but should recover. Lewis said. Hawthorne, 44, was taken to a hospital to be treated for the dog bite and is charged with attempted murder, cruelty to a police dog and possession of a weapon during a violent crime, investigators said. The standoff started about 7 p.m. Wednesday when Hawthorne shot at his mother, then barricaded himself in his home, officials said. The police dog was shot when its handler sent it in to try and take Hawthorne into custody, Lewis said. A SWAT team entered the house about 8 hours after the standoff started and took Hawthorne into custody without any further problems, the sheriff said. Lewis praised the work of emergency veterinarians in treating the police dog. “The resiliency of Nikos in these early stages of this incident has been incredible and we are certainly pulling for him as he begins the process for recovery,” the sheriff said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem is again applying to hold a fireworks display over Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day. The Department of Tourism submitted its application for a special use permit to the National Parks Service on Wednesday on behalf of Noem for fireworks next year. The Parks Service in March denied the state’s application for a fireworks display this year, citing safety concerns. South Dakota had been dealing with drought and wildfires that burned within the monument’s boundaries earlier this year, forcing the park to close for several days. Noem argued that if the fireworks were allowed, conditions would be monitored and organizers could cancel the show if the fire risk was too great. Local Native American tribes also opposed holding the celebration on land they hold as sacred and were concerned about the spread of COVID-19. Noem is in litigation with the U.S. Department of Interior over that rejection. “Despite their arbitrary decision to cancel the 2021 Fireworks Celebration, the Biden Administration has an opportunity to work with us to celebrate next year and for the years to come,” the Republican governor said in a statement. Noem successfully pushed for a return of the event in 2019 after a decadelong hiatus. It gave former President Donald Trump an opportunity to be featured in a patriotic display attended by thousands of people during the pandemic.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville:A Knoxville special education teacher died from COVID-19, a medical examiner’s report has confirmed. Kelle Grady died Sept. 8 at the age of 48, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported. She was a teacher at A.L. Lotts Elementary School. Her obituary called her a “devoted teacher.” Grady died the same day as Knox County Schools bus driver Tammy Murphy, who was ill with COVID-19 for weeks and had been put on a ventilator. The Knox County Board of Education had declined to approve a mask mandate, but on Sept. 24, a federal judge ruled that Knox County Schools must implement masking to help protect children with health problems amid the pandemic. The same ruling also blocked an August executive order by Gov. Bill Lee allowing families to opt out of school mask mandates. It was one of three rulings blocking implementation of Lee’s executive order. The other two affect Williamson and Shelby counties.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Three firefighters remained in critical condition after an explosion at an apartment complex in Dallas, authorities said. The blast happened Wednesday morning at the apartment complex where the firefighters were responding to a reported natural gas leak. A two-story building partially collapsed, and four firefighters and four civilians were injured. Dallas-Fire Rescue said late Wednesday that all four civilians were released from a hospital along with one of the firefighters. The building where the explosion occurred had 10 units and all of the residents were accounted for, authorities said. The structure was torn down later Wednesday because of safety issues and an investigation into the cause of the blast was ongoing. Dallas-Fire Rescue said natural gas was shut off for the entire complex because of the investigation and that displaced about 300 people. All buildings will be inspected in the complex before the residents return.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Because of a cold front, a lot of the smoke from a wildfire in the Sequoia National Park is moving to Utah and becoming trapped in the atmosphere above the state's southwestern corner, said National Weather Service meteorologist, Mike Wessler. The forecast suggested winds on Tuesday night could help move some of that smoke toward Colorado, Wessler said, although at least some would stick around longer into the week. Western wildfires sent smoke into Utah throughout the summer, with the local air quality approaching dangerous levels in some places. The latest large set of fires is the KNP Complex, which is threatening Sequoia National Park, home to a forest of giant sequoias, the largest trees in the world, according to the National Park Service website. The giant sequoias, which grow along the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, can be as old as 3,400 years.\n\nVermont\n\nMarlboro: A Vermont music venue, Marlboro Music, has bought the college campus where it resides after 70 years without claim to the property. The president and chair of Marlboro Music, Christopher Serkin, said Tuesday that the purchase of the former Marlboro College was in its last stages. According to documents submitted to the town, Marlboro Music subsidiary Potash Hill paid $2.7 million to the college’s owner, Democracy Builders Fund 1, The Brattleboro Reformer reported. Serkin said Marlboro Music will continue its use of the campus for three months in the summer. It will also develop a process to determine the use of the now-empty college campus for the rest of the year. Before its closure, Marlboro College struggled to keep its doors open as enrollment dwindled and revenue dropped, the newspaper reported. In 2019, Marlboro College merged with Emerson College and closed its main campus.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An enormous statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was cut into pieces and hauled away from Richmond’s Monument Avenue three weeks ago, but plaintiffs who failed to block the removal want Virginia’s Supreme Court to reconsider its decision allowing it. Four property owners filed a request Wednesday with the high court for a rehearing, alleging the justices made “several fundamental errors” in their Sept. 2 decision, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. The unanimous ruling observed that “values change and public policy changes too” in a democracy. The court cited testimony from historians who said the enormous statue was erected in 1890 to honor the southern white citizenry’s defense of a pre-Civil War life that depended on slavery and the subjugation of Black people. Restoring the monument would be ideal for the plaintiffs, but attorney Patrick M. McSweeney said his clients “don’t think the state owns and controls the monument.” The state wants to keep the monument and land while disavowing promises made to obtain them. “Such a result allows the Commonwealth to take property without compensation,” the petition states.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton:A 24-year-old North Kitsap man was charged with assault after biting off another man’s thumb during a fight that started as a group of friends were heading to a bar. The victim, 27, wrote in a statement included in Kitsap County Superior Court charging documents that he and the suspect were not getting along in the lead-up to the fight the night of Sept. 2, the Kitsap Sun reported. The victim said the suspect attacked him after he criticized him for being lazy before going into the bar. While on the ground, the victim said he tried to push the man’s face away but his left thumb went into the suspect’s mouth and he bite down. The suspect “continued to bite my thumb until he bit off the end,” the victim wrote. Medics collected the thumb from the roadway and they went to a hospital. The suspect told deputies that the victim turned the verbal argument into a fight by kicking him in the chest and that he “did not bite down very hard,” a deputy wrote. The victim had surgery but lost function from the first knuckle and permanently lost the tip of his thumb. The suspect was charged Tuesday with second-degree assault.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia’s largest outdoor festival on the third-highest U.S. bridge next month was canceled Wednesday, a week after a group representing parachutists bailed out. The Bridge Day Commission voted unanimously to cancel the Oct. 16 event on the New River Gorge Bridge. Marcus Ellison, an organizer for a group of BASE jumpers, cited concerns about available health care in case of an emergency because of the coronavirus pandemic in announcing last week that the group would not participate. Some hospitals in southern West Virginia have been inundated in recent weeks with COVID-19 patients, with a few saying their intensive care units were at capacity. Ellison also was concerned there could be an insufficient number of bus drivers to transport BASE jumpers from the bottom to the top of the New River Gorge Bridge in Fayetteville on Oct. 16. BASE stands for building, antenna, span and Earth, the fixed objects from which jumpers leap.\n\nWisconsin\n\nFond Du Lac: Hundreds of people packed a Fond du Lac church to pay respects to police officer Joseph Kurer, 26, who died of coronavirus complications. Kurer died Sept. 22, just a day after his wife gave birth to their second child. At Holy Family Catholic Church, Kurer was remembered Wednesday as a servant and champion of justice. “We’re hurting. It’s not easy, we’re hurting. But we’ll make it through it. We’ll lean on each other and come through,” said Fond du Lac Police Lt. Erik Foster. Kurer also served in the Wisconsin National Guard and because of that, he received full military honors. A pair of Black Hawk helicopters flew over the crowd of mourners outside of the church following the funeral, WBAY-TV reported A long line of squad cars from law enforcement agencies across the state joined the procession as Kurer was taken past the police department one last time. Citizens lined the street to pay their respects to the officer and his family. The police department said Kurer contracted COVID-19 while working, so his death is classified as in the line of duty.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The vaccine hesitancy in Gillette is emblematic of the live-free, mind-your-own-business mentality toward the pandemic that is dominant across conservative America at a time when the delta variant of the coronavirus is tearing through unvaccinated communities. For every 100 people spotted around town in Gillette, the number wearing masks can be counted on one hand. Among a group of six people on a smoke break downtown, all said they had too many concerns about the vaccine to mess with it. Down the street, a black shirt displayed in a storefront warned, “ATTENTION SNOWFLAKES: THIS IS NOT A SAFE PLACE.” Wyoming is the second-least vaccinated state as of Tuesday, behind only West Virginia. Only 23% of residents in Campbell County, where Gillette is, have been vaccinated, putting it among the bottom handful of places in the U.S.that have not cracked 25% with their COVID-19 immunization rates. People bristle at the workplace vaccine mandate being pushed by President Joe Biden.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/24/hemingway-champ-tribal-powwow-baby-box-salvation-news-around-states/50522975/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Alabama’s unemployment rate dropped to 2.6% in June, marking the third straight month with a record low for the state. The rate, which dropped one-tenth of a percentage point from May, represented 60,388 people without jobs statewide, a record low, according to a statement by Gov. Kay Ivey. More than 2.2 million people were working in the state, an increase of about 5,300 from a month earlier.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy is expected this week to sign legislation to formally recognize tribes in the state. The Alaska Federation of Natives announced the bill signing would take place Thursday. Shannon Mason, a Dunleavy spokesperson, confirmed the timing. The measure, from state Rep. Tiffany Zulkosky, D-Bethel, passed the Legislature in May. Supporters of the bill have called it an overdue step that would create opportunities for the state and tribes to work together. The Alaska Federation of Natives said the measure “does not impact the existing legal status of Alaska Tribes, nor does it change the state’s responsibility or authority. However, it does recognize Alaska’s Indigenous people. This recognition will help unify our tribal governments with the state government.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A judge has dismissed Gov. Doug Ducey’s lawsuit challenging the Biden administration’s demands the state stop sending millions in federal COVID-19 relief money to schools that don’t have mask requirements or that close because of COVID-19 outbreaks. The state filed the lawsuit earlier this year after the U.S. Treasury Department demanded Ducey either restructure the $163 million program to eliminate restrictions it said undermine public health recommendations or face a repayment demand. The Treasury Department also wanted changes to a $10 million program Ducey created that gives private school tuition money to parents if their children’s schools have mask mandates.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lawmakers took back the authority they gave for the state to distribute about $460 million in remaining federal COVID-19 relief funds to school districts, saying they want schools to use the money for teacher and staff bonuses. The move faced opposition from Democrats who said it was an effort to avoid considering raising teacher salaries while the state sits on a $1.6 billion surplus. It was also criticized by Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who said lawmakers didn’t have authority to take such a step. The Legislative Council voted to rescind the appropriation for the federal funds, and recommended schools use the money for bonuses. The council said the districts’ plans for spending the money will now have to go before a legislative panel. The council recommended districts use the funds to provide $5,000 one-time bonuses to teachers and $2,500 to staff.\n\nCalifornia\n\nJerseydale: A destructive wildfire near Yosemite National Park burned out of control through tinder-dry forest on Sunday and had grown into one of California’s largest blazes of the year, forcing thousands of residents to flee remote mountain communities. About 2,000 firefighters battled the fire, along with aircraft and bulldozers, facing tough conditions that includes steep terrain, sweltering temperatures and low humidity, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. Crews on the ground protected homes as air tankers dropped retardant on 50-foot flames racing along ridgetops east of the small community of Jerseydale. Light winds blew embers ahead into tree branches “and because it’s so dry, it’s easy for the spot fires to get established and that’s what fuels the growth,” Fouts said. The fire erupted Friday southwest of the park near the town of Midpines in Mariposa County. Officials described “explosive fire behavior” on Saturday as flames made runs through bone-dry vegetation caused by the worst drought in decades. By Sunday the blaze had consumed more than 22 square miles of forest land, with no containment, Cal Fire said. The cause was under investigation. Evacuations were in place for more than 6,000 people living across a several-mile span of the sparsely populated area in the Sierra Nevada foothills, though a handful of residents defied the orders and stayed behind, said Adrienne Freeman with the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The West Nile virus was detected in trapped mosquitoes in the southeast and southwest parts of the city, the Larimer County health department said in a news release. As of Tuesday, there are no human cases of West Nile virus, the health department. In humans, West Nile symptoms can range from none to severe (fever, nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, aches, rash and headaches) and appear three to 14 days after infection, the health department said. One percent of people might develop a serious, neuroinvasive form of the disease, said Dr. Paul Mayer, medical officer with the Larimer County Department of Health and Environment. Larimer County began monitoring for West Nile virus in early June. Monitoring is done through a partnership with the cities in Larimer County, Vector Disease Control International and Colorado State University. The peak West Nile season is generally in July and August.

The legislation, which increases funding for the initiative, raises the MSRP cap for eligible purchased and leased battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles to $50,000. In turn, state residents who meet certain income requirements can qualify for up to $9,500 in incentives, depending on the type of vehicle. The new law will also usher in the state’s first electric bike voucher program. Dykes said the first public meeting was held this week to gather input on how to design the initiative. Additionally, the state agency has begun crafting a plan for distributing $20 million for electric school buses – spending that’s expected to trigger federal funding, as well. Meanwhile, the state is making up to $4 million available to public and private entities to purchase and install light-duty charting stations. The funding came from a 2018 settlement between the federal Environmental Protection Agency and Volkswagen for violations of the Clean Air Act.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Members of the local Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape tribe gathered with other Indigenous peoples from the region to hold a powwow in the atrium of the Delaware Art Museum. Non-native people were invited to attend and, in some cases, participate in the cultural celebration. They were also encouraged to support local Indigenous artists who came to sell jewelry, shawls, bags and even bows and arrows. “This is not something to exploit,” said Iz Balleto, community engagement specialist at the museum. “We just wanted to build that bridge with the tribes that have been forgotten here in Delaware.” Social powwows are important to Indigenous peoples, Nanticoke Chief Natosha Carmine said. They’re an opportunity to see family and friends, as well as to provide education on their tribe’s history and customs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:DC Health said appointments have been made available to 5,500 people on a waiting list for the monkeypox vaccine, WUSA-TV reported. Before that announcement, DC Health said it received 8,300 doses of the JYENNOS vaccine and administered approximately 2,600. “Individuals will have 48 hours to claim their appointment,” DC Health tweeted at 10:14 a.m. Saturday. “Residents who did not receive an appointment invitation (last) week will stay in the system until an appointment becomes available.” According to CDC data last updated on Friday, there are 110 monkeypox cases in D.C., the highest number per capita in the U.S. D.C. makes up about 6% of the monkeypox cases across the United States, averaging about eight new cases a day.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: Jon Auvil defeated 124 other contestants Saturday night to win the annual Ernest Hemingway Look-Alike Contest at Sloppy Joe’s Bar, the Key West establishment where the author was a regular patron during his decadelong residence on the island in the 1930s. The look-a-like contest is a highlight of Key West’s annual Hemingway Days celebration, which ended Sunday. Auvil said he shares Hemingway’s passion for fishing, has written some fiction and would like to do more writing. “Every man wants to write like Hemingway,” said Auvil, who lives in Dade City, Florida, northeast of Tampa. While living in Key West, Hemingway wrote classics, including “For Whom the Bell Tolls” and “To Have and Have Not.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Police are investigating a late-night vehicle accident at Ellis Square that injured five people Saturday. A few minutes before 8 p.m., an elderly man accidentally drove his four-door Ford F-150 truck onto the square, police said. About 9 p.m., police arrived at the scene and found five people injured – two adult pedestrians with serious injuries and two juveniles with nonlife-threatening injuries. One person refused emergency services care. The four injured people were transported to Memorial University Medical Center, according to Chatham Emergency Services. Ellis Square is a popular spot for both tourists and residents visiting the restaurants, bars and clubs along City Market and Congress Street.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An active-duty U.S. Marine accused in the stabbing death of his wife is in custody and facing a second-degree murder charge. The Honolulu Police Department said Saturday that Bryant Tejeda-Castillo was being held on $1 million bail. Police said he was captured shortly after the Wednesday killing of 27-year-old Dana Alotaibi along a freeway. Police said he was taken to the Queen’s Medical Center in Honolulu with what one witness said were several self-inflicted wounds. Alotaibi’s friends said she was pregnant, but police said they are awaiting autopsy results. A police spokesman on Saturday said he didn’t know if Tejeda-Castillo remained at the hospital or had been transferred elsewhere. Tejeda-Castillo was arrested on a warrant of second-degree murder.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will spend $1 million to fight illegal fentanyl use and resulting overdose deaths, Gov. Brad Little said. The Republican governor said he will likely recommend additional money in his budget that will be considered by lawmakers early next year. But he said urgent action is needed now for the fentanyl problem that law enforcement officials said can spur property crimes, as well as crimes against individuals. The money will be used for testing equipment to increase the ability of police to find fentanyl. It will also be used for a media campaign to alert Idaho residents to the dangers of fentanyl, a cheap but potent synthetic opioid that has been behind a major increase in overdose deaths in the U.S. It has been increasingly cut into other drugs, often without the buyers’ knowledge, leading to overdose deaths. As little as 2 milligrams of fentanyl can be lethal. The drug is 100 times more potent than morphine.\n\nIllinois\n\nNaperville: The National Weather Service confirmed a small tornado touched down in suburban Chicago. Snapped trees and minor damage to roofs in Naperville were reported Saturday, meteorologist Todd Kluber said. The tornado touched down about 5:40 a.m. and was part of thunderstorms that rolled through the Chicago area overnight. Wind gusts reached 58 mph at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, Kluber said. Multiple gas leaks in a Naperville commercial building also were reported and about 250 utility customers temporarily lost power, the city said in a release. About a dozen roads were blocked by fallen trees or branches. No injuries were reported.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to be in Indianapolis on Monday for the start of the General Assembly’s special session to debate a near-total ban on abortion. Harris’s office confirmed to the Indianapolis Star on Friday the vice president would “meet with state legislators and leaders to discuss the fight to protect reproductive rights” on the first day of the special session in a roundtable discussion. Senate Republicans have proposed banning abortions in the state, except in cases of rape or incest, when the mother’s life is in danger or when the fetus has a fatal anomaly. Should it pass, it would make Indiana home to one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. Seven other states ban abortion at zero weeks.\n\nIowa\n\nUrbandale: Hallie Koenigs, a 4-year-old cancer patient from Riceville, was gifted a pink boat in front of the Make-A-Wish Iowa office in Urbandale. Koenigs loves fishing, and goes on a fishing trip every August with her siblings and parents, Allen and Kacie. The project came together with the help of many community members, including a volunteer who traveled to the upper peninsula of Michigan to pick up the boat, Vision Signs, which provided the custom pink vinyl, and Scheels, which provided Hallie with all the fishing gear she would need.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:The Shawnee County Commission accepted RailWorks Track Services’ $129,000 bid to make repairs and improvements to the Gage Park mini-train tracks, ties and culverts damaged by severe thunderstorms. The money will come from the building maintenance fund. Repairs include railroad ties, spikes, rails, ballasts and soil work.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear will miss next month’s Fancy Farm picnic for the second straight year. Beshear said in a social media post Friday that he and his wife, first lady Britainy Beshear, will visit Israel in August. The governor said the trip will conflict with the annual political picnic in western Kentucky, which this year falls on Aug. 6. Democrats are expected to be scarce at this year’s picnic, with Republicans dominating most state and federal offices. U.S. Senate candidate Charles Booker is the only Democrat who has committed to attend. Kentucky’s two Republican U.S. senators, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, have not yet committed to attending the picnic. Paul is seeking a third term in the U.S. Senate and will face Booker in the fall. The picnic – also known for its barbecue – draws large crowds and is a rite of passage for statewide candidates in Kentucky.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Teachers of English, math, science and social studies are eligible for a $7,500 hiring bonus in the East Baton Rouge Parish school district. The move came as the system continues to struggle to staff schools for the upcoming year. On Thursday, the district reported 233 vacant positions, 110 of which were in the core subject areas, The Advocate reported. “This proposal will give us a competitive edge against neighboring parishes offering similar sign-on bonuses,” Nichola Hall, chief human resources officer, wrote in a memo. Hall said the bonus will go only to teachers hired between May 24 and Aug. 5. To be eligible, in addition to teaching in a core subject, the teachers must have a current teaching license and commit in writing to stay with the school system for three years. The parish School Board on Thursday voted 7-1 in favor of the new hiring bonus. The school system is proposing spending almost $1.1 million for the bonuses, which will cover more than 100 teachers. The funding will come from federal COVID-19 relief money.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A Maine-based sporting goods chain that once had more than 200 stores on the East Coast is shuttering its remaining 35 stores. Olympia Sports confirmed the stores would close by the end of September and that liquidation sales had begun at all locations. Olympia Sports was founded in 1975 by Edward Manganello, who opened his first store at the Maine Mall in South Portland. By 2013, it had 226 locations from Maine to Virginia, the Portland Press Herald reported. Denver-based running and active lifestyle brand JackRabbit bought the company in 2019. JackRabbit, owned by a private equity firm, was sold in December to North Carolina-based Fleet Feet. An email to Fleet Feet on Saturday was not immediately returned.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said he won’t support the GOP gubernatorial nominee, Dan Cox, whom he once again described as a “Q-Anon” whack job.” Hogan blamed the Democratic Governors Association and former President Donald Trump for Cox’s victory in Tuesday’s primary over Kelly Schulz, who was a cabinet secretary in Hogan’s administration. The DGA spent large amounts of money on ads that described Cox as “too conservative for Maryland” and highlighted his connections to Trump – ads that might well have bolstered Cox’s appeal to GOP primary voters. Hogan, who appeared Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” and CNN’s “State of the Union,” said Cox’s victory is “a win for the Democrats” because Cox has no chance of defeating Democratic nominee Wes Moore in November in a state where Democrats have a huge natural advantage. Although Hogan said he won’t vote for Cox, he said he’s unsure if he will vote for Moore.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Massachusetts Democratic U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton is calling for changes in the way the Boston-area public transit system operates after a fire on a train prompted one passenger to jump into a river and others to scramble out of windows. No one was injured Thursday morning when the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s inbound Orange Line train caught fire while on a bridge crossing the Mystic River just north of Boston on approach to the Assembly station in Somerville. The fire appears to have been caused by a metal panel on the train’s base that came loose and touched the electrified third rail, the system’s general manager said. Moulton told WCVB-TV on Friday that “it’s a total embarrassment and “we’ve got to change it.” Moulton, a member of the House transportation committee, said he doesn’t want the federal government to have to take over. The 43-year-old train car that caught fire had been inspected less than a month ago, which included an inspection of the panel that came loose, according to the MBTA. After the fire, the same panel on every other in-service Orange Line car was inspected, and no issues were found, the agency said. The investigation is ongoing.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: The practice of fingerprinting people without probable cause or a warrant is unconstitutional, the Michigan Supreme Court said Friday. The court unanimously said Grand Rapids police violated the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure. “The fingerprinting of each of the plaintiffs in these cases constituted a physical trespass onto a person’s body, a constitutionally protected area,” Justice Richard Bernstein wrote. The incidents involved two Black teenagers in 2011 and 2012, though the American Civil Liberties Union said photos and fingerprints were taken from thousands of people in Grand Rapids. The city has dropped the practice, but defended fingerprinting as a way to determine someone’s identity when they had no identification. Police also took photos.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Xcel Energy has started gathering public input on its plan to build one of the state’s largest transmission line projects in recent years. The utility company has proposed building a 140-mile power line that would run from Becker in the north to Lyon County to the south. The $500 million line would connect several new renewable energy projects. “The purpose of this line is to unlock renewable energy from a very renewable rich jurisdiction – wind and solar both,” said Michael Lamb, Xcel’s senior vice president for transmission. If the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approves the project, Lamb estimated it would be completed by 2027 to 2028. The regulatory, engineering and construction process for a large new power line is lengthy. This week, Xcel started contacting landowners, local governments, environmental groups and others impacted by the power line to get their input before determining the line’s final route.\n\nMississippi\n\nBrandon: A park by a central Mississippi reservoir will be named for Bobby Cleveland, a longtime outdoors writer who promoted events there after he retired from journalism. The governing board for the Ross Barnett Reservoir has voted unanimously that Lakeshore Park will become the Bobby Cleveland Park at Lakeshore, the Clarion Ledger reported. “He was a very devoted champion of the reservoir,” general manager John Sigman said of Cleveland. The park is in Rankin County, a few miles northwest of Jackson. Cleveland, 67, died after a traffic accident April 28 as he was leaving the park. His memorial service was held there days later. The Hattiesburg native was well-known in Mississippi for his decades as the outdoors writer for the Clarion Ledger. Cleveland lived near the reservoir and fished in it often. After he left the newspaper in 2012, be became the spokesman for the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District, the state agency that manages the reservoir. Sigman said the request to rename the park was presented by the Barnett Reservoir Foundation, an organization for which Cleveland had been secretary.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Community members again are urging the City Council to take action on getting the city to use 100% renewable resources for energy production by 2030. The appeal was made last week during a City Council meeting at which the 2022 Columbia Water and Light Renewable Energy Plan report was accepted following a public hearing. A petition with nearly 3,000 signatures was delivered in May to the council requesting it ramp up renewable energy efforts. Among speakers Monday was Carolyn Amparan of the CoMO 100% by 2030 Coalition and the Sierra Club, who helped deliver the petitions in May. “We keep missing the targets,” Amparan said about renewable energy capacity goals by the city. “We shouldn’t just plan to make exactly 15% or 25%.” Other speakers urged the city to negotiate more renewable energy contracts and get out from its coal-powered plant contracts.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A federal lawsuit has been filed against the Interior Department and its Bureau of Indian Affairs, saying the U.S. is not complying with its treaty obligation to provide adequate law enforcement services on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. The lawsuit filed Tuesday in Billings argued the federal government does not provide enough federal law enforcement officers, drug investigators, missing persons investigators or jail space, even though violent crime has increased on the reservation, The Billings Gazette reported. “Public safety on-reservation is severely compromised due to the lack of meaningful BIA law enforcement presence in our communities,” Northern Cheyenne Tribe President Serena Wetherelt said in a statement. The officers also lack of understanding of tribal and federal law, which leads to suspects not being charged or prosecuted, the lawsuit said. Reports of violent crime on the reservation increased 50% from 2019 to 2020 and does not include crimes that went unreported, the lawsuit said. The Interior Department declined Friday to comment about the lawsuit, spokesperson Tyler Cherry said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State Attorney General Doug Peterson said he will not file criminal charges against fellow Republican and former state lawmaker Mike Groene over photos the ex-lawmaker surreptitiously took of an aide. There is not enough information from the results of a State Patrol investigation to warrant criminal charges against Groene, a spokeswoman for Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson said Thursday. Groene, of North Platte, resigned from office earlier this year after acknowledging he photographed his legislative aide in his office without her knowledge. The former staffer, Kristina Konecko, said in a complaint to the Legislature’s Executive Board she discovered the photos on Groene’s laptop, which he had given her to update. She said some of the photos included close-ups of body parts. Groene, a blunt-spoken, often abrasive Republican who clashed with Democratic colleagues, also ended his candidacy to become a University of Nebraska Regent after the scandal came to light.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state posted record job numbers last month that showed several key industries have risen above their pre-pandemic employment levels. The record of 1,452,600 jobs was 3,000 more than the previous peak in February 2020. Nevada added 7,600 jobs last month. The employment numbers were announced Friday by Gov. Steve Sisolak, who said in a statement the state had recovered “all of the jobs that were lost during the COVID pandemic, and doing so in a way that has more Nevadans working in better-paying jobs than before the pandemic.” The Las Vegas Review Journal reported the state’s leisure and hospitality sector, which includes casinos, is still lagging behind at 90.7% of its pre-pandemic peak. But other industries have risen above their previous peaks to pull the rest of the state up. Nevada’s unemployment rate fell to 4.7% but remains one of the worst in the country.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Republican Gov. Chris Sununu signed seven bills into law last week, including a Senate bill designed to require health care facilities to implement and maintain workplace violence prevention programs and establish a health care workplace safety commission, according to his office. Lawmakers began working to create the new requirements after the death of a hospital security guard who was assaulted at work in December 2020. Richard Semo, 64, of Farmington died from injuries sustained in an attack in the parking lot of Frisbie Memorial Hospital in Rochester. The man who attacked him pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in 2021. Sununu held a bill signing Friday outside the hospital. Tim Jones, chief executive officer of Frisbie Memorial Hospital, spoke about Semo. Jones also told the governor that health care workers deal with abuse far too often, and there has been an increase in verbal and physical assaults nationwide during the pandemic, according to the Fosters Daily Democrat. Health facilities that are considered urgent care centers must comply with the new state requirement by July 1, 2024.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gas prices are continuing their summertime slide with double-digit reductions in New Jersey amid a decline in demand and a drop in oil prices. AAA Mid-Atlantic said the average price of a gallon of regular gas in New Jersey on Friday was $4.51, down 12 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $3.17 a gallon on average a year ago at this time. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $4.41, down 16 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $3.15 a gallon on average a year ago at this time. Analysts said “global economic headwinds” are pushing oil prices down and U.S. drivers “are fueling up less despite this being the height of the traditional summer driving season.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nHobbs: City commissioners took a step toward saving the lives of unwanted newborns at a recent meeting by voting to install a baby box. The vote was spurred by the case of Alexis Avila, who was caught on surveillance camera in early January throwing her infant – who was tied in a plastic bag – into a dumpster behind a retail shopping mall in near-freezing weather. Dumpster divers found the newborn – six hours later, and still alive. Because of that incident, commissioners approved a resolution in support of installing a surrender safety device at Hobbs Fire Station 1, otherwise known as the “Safe Haven Site,” and authorizing the city to seek funding for the installation and maintenance of the device from the state. Commissioners in February had made amendments to the Hobbs Safe Haven for Infants Act, the Hobbs News-Sun reported. Those changes allowed for the surrendering of infants, 90 days or less in age, to be surrendered via a “safety device” or “baby box” without parental fear of criminal prosecution. According to Hobbs Fire Chief Barry Young, the Safe Haven baby box is a much needed asset for Hobbs and surrounding areas.\n\nNew York\n\nRochester:A man accused of attacking GOP gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin during a recent campaign rally told investigators he had been drinking that day and didn’t know who the congressman was, authorities said as the man was arrested on a federal assault charge Saturday. David Jakubonis, 43, made an initial court appearance Saturday before a federal magistrate judge in Rochester on a single count of assaulting a member of Congress with a dangerous weapon. The charge carries a potential maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. He was ordered held until a bail hearing in federal court Wednesday. Prosecutors said he should remain detained as a flight risk and is dangerous, according to a court filing. Assistant federal public defender Steven Slawinski, representing Jakubonis, said in an email to The Associated Press he planned to ask the judge to release Jakubonis from custody. Jakubonis was arraigned Friday on a separate state charge of attempted assault in the second degree and was released by a local judge. That prompted criticism from Zeldin and other Republicans who held it up as an example of the need to reform New York’s bail laws, something Zeldin has called upon Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul to toughen.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nKenly: The city’s police force has resigned over what it called a hostile work environment. Police Chief Josh Gibson said he and four other officers turned in their two-week notices late Wednesday afternoon, news outlets reported. Gibson said utilities clerk Christy Jones and assistant town manager Sharon Evans also resigned. WRAL reported the police force usually has eight officers, but only had five on the force when the resignations occurred. Gibson, who had been with the department for 21 years, said officers couldn’t perform their duties because of the environment that was created by town manager Justine Jones, who took the job at the beginning of June. In their resignation letters, the employees cited a “hostile,” “toxic” and stressful work environment. Jones declined comment on the resignations. Kenly, with a population of approximately 2,400, is about 45 miles southeast of Raleigh.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state has renewed its request to throw out a federal lawsuit brought by two Native American tribes that alleged the state’s new legislative map dilutes tribal members’ voting strength. The state said in court papers filed Thursday it denies allegations by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and the Spirit Lake Tribe. U.S. District Judge Peter Welte dismissed the state’s argument earlier this month that the tribes lacked the standing to sue. The Republican-controlled Legislature during its special session last fall approved a new map of legislative districts, based on updated census data. The map includes new House subdistricts for the Fort Berthold and Turtle Mountain Indian reservations. Turtle Mountain argued the split House district “packs” tribal members into a single subdistrict on its reservation, while diluting their vote in the nonreservation subdistrict. Spirit Lake alleged the new redistricting map dilutes American Indian voters on and near its reservation. The case could go to trial next year if no resolution is reached, according to court filings.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:A project to improve electric power capacity is underway on the city’s south side, near the future site of a Google data center. Known as the Parsons Avenue Transmission Project, the endeavor is aimed at improving electrical service for area residents and upcoming development, according to an American Electric Power Outreach Specialist Brian Recker, who added the project will benefit residents and a “future AEP customer” coming to the area, but he would not name the customer. Two substations, one of them new, will be located just north of a $300 million Google data center being built on a portion of the former Hartman Farm, located on the east of South High Street, south of Rathmell Road, west of Parsons Avenue and north of nearby Scioto Downs. It is expected to be completed by the end of 2025 and employ 20 people.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Oklahoma County’s $260 million bond package is supposed to help fund a new sheriff’s office in addition to a new jail facility, according to the ballot language and information from county officials, but the sale of the current office is on hold because of contract issues. Financing for the new sheriff’s office came through proceeds from the sale of the current building paired with a portion of the recently passed bond package. District 2 Commissioner Brian Maughan said the project won’t affect the ability to finance the new jail because the county will still be able to shift funds around from its general budget once it is able to apply federal COVID-19 relief funds to other projects.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Portland State University announced a tuition discount for any student from a federally recognized Native American tribe. Starting this fall, students who are members of the country’s nearly 600 federally recognized tribes across the country will receive in-state tuition, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. PSU noted in its announcement that it already offers support for students from Indigenous backgrounds including scholarships, programs and student groups through its Native American Student and Community Center. The discounted tuition will be offered starting this fall term to students who can provide their official tribal residency documentation to PSU. The university does not require any other information to be considered for the discount. The difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition is roughly $420 per credit hour or about $19,000 per academic year for students enrolled in 15 credits, according to PSU.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A state trooper has been charged with felony animal cruelty after hitting a loose horse with a patrol vehicle multiple times and pinning it to the pavement, where it was then euthanized, authorities said Friday. Cpl. Michael Perillo was suspended without pay after the charges were filed by the state police internal affairs division, officials announced. His bail was set at $50,000 during his arraignment Friday on two felony counts of aggravated animal cruelty and one count of animal cruelty, a misdemeanor. It is not known whether he has an attorney who can speak on his behalf. A message left Friday for the union that represents troopers, the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association, was not immediately returned. Perillo responded to a call to police Dec. 28 involving a horse on a highway in Chester County, west of Philadelphia. The horse was on the road’s shoulder in Lower Oxford Township and had been struck by a motorist before troopers were sent, authorities said. Perillo drove a vehicle into the horse multiple times, causing it to fall, and then pinned the horse to the road, authorities said. Another trooper then euthanized it. Perillo, who enlisted in the state police in September 2006, is assigned to Troop J in Avondale.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Longtime Democratic U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin is naming two politicians who will be leaders on issues affecting Americans with disabilities as he prepares to retire from Congress. Langevin is holding an event Tuesday in Washington to mark the 32nd anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, speak about the need for accessible transportation and name two new co-chairs of the House Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus. Langevin led the caucus with Republican co-chair and longtime Alaska congressman Don Young, who died in March. Langevin isn’t seeking a 12th term. Langevin, the first quadriplegic to serve in Congress, worked to create the caucus shortly after he got to Congress in 2001. Caucus members educate their colleagues and staff on issues affecting Americans with disabilities and their families, and work to ensure access to health care, housing, transportation, employment opportunities and disability benefits. Langevin said he is waiting until the event to announce the names.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The U.S. Senate confirmed Adair Ford Boroughs, a former congressional candidate and Columbia lawyer, to become the top federal prosecutor for South Carolina. The Senate approved the nomination by a voice vote of Ford Boroughs on Thursday as the state’s U.S. attorney. After the vote, Ford Boroughs tweeted, “I’m very excited to return to (the) DOJ and to work with an incredible team at the U.S. Attorney’s office.” President Joe Biden nominated Ford Boroughs, 42, for the position in June. Ford Boroughs’ nomination was quickly advanced by a Senate panel on July 14 with just two members – Missouri Republican Josh Hawley and Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn – opposed.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The sister of a St. Louis man who died while hiking in the Badlands of South Dakota said he was camping as part of a trip to celebrate graduating from college and got lost trying to find his way back to his car. The Pennington County Sheriff’s Office tweeted that 22-year-old Maxwell Right collapsed on an unmarked trail in Badlands National Park on Wednesday. He and a friend who was traveling with him had run out of water, according to the tweet. Temperatures in the Badlands had been approaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit during the first half of the week. Right’s sister, Lucille, said the National Park Service told the family that her brother died surrounded by rangers. Authorities have not identified his friend, who the sheriff’s office said was flown to a Rapid City hospital and placed under observation for exposure and dehydration. The sheriff’s office initially said in its tweet that the unmarked trail has been featured in a social media challenge, but later said the men were simply following a trail on a hiking app. Lucille Right said her brother and his friend weren’t taking part in any social media challenge, saying they were on a larger trip to celebrate Maxwell graduating from Missouri S&T and had planned to visit Mt. Rushmore on Wednesday night.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: Four inmates who escaped from the Silverdale Detention Center have been captured, the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office said. Officers discovered the inmates were missing during a headcount early Saturday in a minimum security housing unit, media outlets reported. The facility was placed on lockdown and officials determined the missing inmates had breached an exterior door and scaled the perimeter barbed wire fence. Two of the inmates, Johnny Bryant and William Atkins, were captured within a few hours at a motel, the sheriff’s office said. Hours after authorities requested the public’s help to locate Justin Lynn Conner and Trevor Lynn Hall, both inmates were taken into custody. Conner was found in Soddy Daisy, Tennessee, and Hall was found in Jackson County, Tennessee. Among the charges that Bryant and Atkins face include resisting arrest and felony escape. Conner faces charges that include possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of methamphetamine for resale/manufacturing, use of stolen plates, theft of property, criminal impersonation, theft of property over $2,500 and misdemeanor evading. Hall faces the following charges: contraband in a penal institution, evading arrest, theft of property and felony escape.\n\nTexas\n\nBig Bend National Park: Authorities said a 75-year-old Houston man died while hiking alone last week at Big Bend National Park. The body of the man was found Thursday about a half-mile from the start of a trail, according to Park Deputy Superintendent David Elkowitz. The man’s name was not immediately released by authorities. Officials were still trying to determine a cause of death but summer heat at the park can be extreme. On Thursday afternoon, temperatures along the trail where the man’s body was found exceeded 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Officials at the national park in west Texas said hikers need to be mindful of the dangers from the extreme heat and they should be prepared to carry and drink one gallon of water per day and should be off desert trails by noon.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:A wildfire sparked by lightning near the Utah-Nevada border late Thursday grew to nearly 6,000 acres on Friday, driven by winds and dry conditions into Washington County and sending a plume of smoke over much of the surrounding area. The fire was first reported just before 3 p.m. Thursday, about 25 miles southeast of Caliente, Nev. It burned quickly toward the north and the east on Friday, moving into heavier vegetation in the Docs Pass wilderness area, according to the Eastern Nevada Interagency Fire group. No structures or private property were threatened as of late Friday. More than 150 Firefighters were assigned, along with several fire engines, bulldozers and other equipment, with aerial support from multiple heavy air tankers and a helicopter. The fire was 5% contained as of late Friday afternoon.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A 42-year-old Nevada man pleaded guilty Friday in U.S. District Court in Burlington for his role in helping arrange the kidnapping and murder of a Vermont man stemming from a financial dispute. Aron Lee Ethridge is one of four men who have been charged in the kidnapping of Gregory Davis from his Danville home Jan. 6, 2018. Davis was found shot to death in a snowbank the next day. As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors and Ethridge’s defense attorney agreed to recommend a prison sentence of 27 years or less. The actual sentence, scheduled for December, will be up to the judge. Ethridge could be sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors said Ethridge arranged for Jerry Banks, 34, of Fort Garland, Colorado, to kidnap and then kill Davis. Banks allegedly called Ethridge the day after the kidnapping to inform him that Davis had been successfully kidnapped and killed. Banks has only been charged with kidnapping, but prosecutors alleged he killed Davis. He has pleaded not guilty and is being held pending trial.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Bodycam videos, police reports and other materials connected to the city’s aggressive response to protesters in June 2020 have been made public through the Library of Virginia. The database that went live recently is part of a legal settlement between the city and plaintiffs who said police used excessive force against protesters who gathered at the Robert E. Lee statue two years ago in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowd ahead of an 8 p.m. curfew. The department later apologized and said the use of tear gas was unwarranted. A few days later, the city’s police chief resigned. Thomas H. Roberts, an attorney for some of the plaintiffs, said the archive will allow the public to judge for themselves how police responded. Members of the public will be able to contribute their own footage of what occurred to the archive.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Authorities on Sunday issued an excessive heat watch for the Pacific Northwest region for coming days as potential record-breaking temperatures were forecast to settle in and linger until next weekend. Temperatures could break daily records in Seattle and other areas by Tuesday, potentially reaching their highest levels since last year’s heat wave that killed hundreds of people across the Pacific Northwest. Highs ranging from 95 to 110 were forecast for inland areas. An excessive heat watch was issued for central and eastern Washington state and the central Idaho Panhandle from Tuesday morning through Friday night.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s Vital Registration Office will be closed for sanitation Monday through Wednesday after staff tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said Friday. The Vital Registration Office is the state’s official repository of birth, death, marriage and divorce records. The state plans to reopen the Charleston office on Thursday, a West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources spokesperson said in a news release. Meanwhile, residents can go to their county clerk’s office to access certified copies of birth, death and marriage certificates, state officials said. Records can also be requested by mail or online.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State Rep. Janel Brandtjen, R-Menomonee Falls, the leader of the Assembly elections committee, is calling for her colleagues to decertify President Joe Biden’s election victory in 2020, a move that prompted her counterpart in the Senate to call for her removal. Brandtjen, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump earlier this year, said Friday she was joining Republican candidate for governor Tim Ramthun’s push to overturn the last presidential election because “tyranny is at Wisconsin’s door.” Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Burlington has rejected such calls to do so. A spokeswoman for Vos did not answer whether Brandtjen, whom he appointed as chair of the Assembly’s elections committee, should continue to lead the panel. Sen. Kathy Bernier, R-Chippewa Falls, the chair of the Senate’s elections committee, said Brandtjen should be removed or step down from the committee. Bernier said the continued focus on 2020 through such claims hurts voter confidence needlessly.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Most abortions will become illegal in Wyoming on Wednesday after Gov. Mark Gordon gave the go-ahead Friday under a new state law. The law bans abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to protect the mother’s life or health, not including psychological conditions. The Wyoming Legislature approved the ban and Gordon signed it into law in March in anticipation that the U.S. Supreme Court could overturn Roe v. Wade. That happened June 24, kicking off a review by Attorney General Bridget Hill to make sure Wyoming’s law conforms to the Supreme Court ruling. Gordon certified the law to the Secretary of State’s Office after Hill completed her almost four-week review Thursday. “I believe that the decision to regulate abortion is properly left to the states,” Gordon said in a statement. “As a pro-life governor, my focus will continue to be on ensuring we are doing all we can to support Wyoming mothers, children and families.” Wyoming currently allows abortions until a fetus can survive outside its mother’s body, generally around 23 weeks. Wyoming has no abortion clinics but the procedure still occurs in other medical settings, with 98 in the state reported to the Wyoming Department of Health in 2021, up from 91 in 2020. The abortion ban will have an “immediate and devastating” effect on those in Wyoming who can become pregnant, the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement. Organizers of a planned women’s health and abortion clinic in Casper have said they might contest the state abortion ban in court. An arson attack in May delayed the clinic’s expected mid-June opening.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/05/25/covid-vaccines-variants-mask-fda-cdc/7424341002/", "title": "COVID: Puerto Rico opens up to vaccinated visitors; cash incentives ...", "text": "One more encouraging sign about the pandemic for Americans: Puerto Rico, a popular travel destination that was the first U.S. state or territory to go into lockdown, has lifted its nightly curfew.\n\nThe island has seen a 58% decline in new infections over the last two weeks after enduring a dramatic spike in April.

Lotteries, cash payments or other incentive programs are allowed as long as they are “reasonably expected” to increase vaccinations and the costs are “reasonably proportional” to the expected public health benefit.\n\n“We encourage states to use their creativity to draw attention to vaccines and get their states and the country back to normal as quickly as possible,” said Andy Slavitt, the White House senior advisor on COVID-19 response.\n\nOhio Gov.

The infection of those nose and sensory structures that support smelling, which also affects people's sense of taste, is what causes the loss or change in smell and taste.\n\n\"Some people come in and say their taste or smell is not as sensitive and robust as it once was, all the way down to patients saying they don't get anything,\" Loehrl said. \"It affects people differently.\"\n\n– Jordyn Noennig, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nBaby bust in California: 'The pandemic is freaking people out'\n\nThe pandemic, affordable IUDs and increasing costs of living have more California adults opting for contraceptives over starting a new family. As a result, California is expected to see 50,000 fewer births in 2021, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIUDs – intrauterine devices – continue to grow as a popular form of contraception, especially after the Affordable Care Act made the option free for most patients. The long-lasting contraceptive that prevents pregnancy for up to 12 years appeals to women because it's a one-time procedure that is more accessible than some birth controls that are restricted by regulations and some insurances. Job losses and other issues related to the pandemic made many people rethink family plans.\n\n\"The pandemic freaked people out,” Ponta Abadi, a reproductive health expert, told the newspaper. “It caused a lot of people to lose their jobs and affected whether they wanted to have kids.”\n\nCanceling Tokyo Olympics would cost $1.7B.

The Japanese government, the International Olympic Committee and athletes around the world are hoping the games can take place. The U.S. consistently fields one of the largest and most successful teams. But the U.S. on Monday advised its citizens not to visit Japan because of the COVID-19 crisis, raising its travel alert to the highest level of 4.\n\nTokyo is one of several areas of the country under a state of emergency because of a surge in infections. The status is due to expire Monday, but officials are considering an extension of at least two weeks. Nearly 60% of respondents in a Kyodo News survey in mid-May said the games should be canceled.\n\nTakahide Kiuchi, executive economist at the Nomura Research Institute, told Kyodo that a post-games spike in cases and hospitalizations could bring more economic hardship to the region.\n\n\"Even if the games are canceled, the economic loss will be smaller than (another) a state of emergency,\" Kiuchi said.\n\nHalf of adult Americans fully vaccinated\n\nThe vaccination rate for U.S. adults will surpass 50% Tuesday, according to the White House.

The firm plans to apply in the coming weeks for emergency use authorization for its vaccine from the Food and Drug Administration to allow children as young as 12 to receive it.\n\nCurrently, the only COVID vaccine authorized for kids as young as 12 is the one made by Pfizer and BioNTech, which got the OK in early May. Moderna previously faced issues enrolling enough teens into the trial. But depending on when the FDA application is made and how quickly it is processed, the vaccine could offer families more choices for immunizing children over the summer vacation and before the 2021-22 school year.\n\n– Elizabeth Weise and Karen Weintraub\n\nSuicides dropped at height of pandemic\n\nDeaths by suicide fell 9% at the height of the pandemic shutdown compared with previous years, a surprise given increases in reported levels of stress, anxiety and depression. There were more than 2,400 fewer deaths by suicide from March to August 2020 than normally would have been expected, said Dr. Jeremy Samuel Faust, an emergency physician in the Division of Health Policy and Public Health at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and an instructor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nThomas Joiner, a professor of psychology at Florida State University and an expert on suicide, said the expanded availability of mental health services via telehealth, such as counseling calls by phone or computer, may have been part of the reason for the decline.\n\n\"Access went up and telehealth was a better platform than many of us anticipated,\" he said.\n\n– Elizabeth Weise\n\n70% of Brits have had at least one vaccine dose\n\nAs the United Kingdom reopens its economy, including lifting restrictions on travel and hospitality, experts are warning of a surging variant even as inoculations remain relatively high. The variant, first discovered in India and surging there in the past few months, is present in at least 49 countries, including the U.K. Scientists, who are sequencing half of coronavirus cases, say it is \"highly likely\" to be more transmissible than Britain's variant.\n\nBut inoculations in the U.K. remain some of the highest in the world, because of a nationalized vaccine campaign. According to the BBC, 70% of adults in the country have had a first vaccine dose. British health officials said Sunday that the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines offer effective protection against the India variant.\n\n\"If vaccination reduces the likelihood of transmission for this variant, increasing regional vaccination in areas where it is prevalent could dampen growth in infections, although it takes several weeks for vaccines to provide protection,\" the study says.\n\nTravel bans put staffing crunch on summer camps\n\nAmerican summer camps are up against the same staffing crunch plaguing other employers seeking lower-wage workers, but with a lingering pandemic twist. Many camps rely on foreign workers who come on temporary, cultural-exchange visas. Because of processing holdups and a COVID-19-related travel ban on certain countries, those workers aren't coming. The staffing woes are complicating what would otherwise be a booming year for summer camps. With the pandemic on the wane in the U.S., families are eager for their children to have in-person opportunities again – and many have the money to do it, after a year of saving on activities.\n\n\"We’re going to see more camps that can’t open or have to cut capacity,\" said Scott Brody, the director of two summer camps in New Hampshire.

The spike in pollution, experts say, is likely the result of climate change, including an increase in wildfires. More than 131 million Americans live in areas that showed unhealthy levels of air pollution, the report showed.\n\n“We're seeing the most days and the ‘very unhealthy’ or ‘hazardous’ air quality level due to spikes in particle pollution,” Paul Billings, ALA’s senior vice president of public policy, told USA TODAY. “Despite a lot of progress on air pollution cleanup, we're seeing the impacts of climate change, particularly wildfires, overwhelming a lot of cleanup, particularly with respect to these daily spikes of particle pollution.”\n\nPollution levels:New EPA rule says over 200 US chemical plants must reduce toxic emissions linked to cancer\n\nThe report looked at fine particulate matter, with daily and annual averages, and ozone pollution regulated under the Clean Air Act. The report found nearly 2 in 5 Americans live in areas that received a failing grade for at least one air pollution measure. Nearly 44 million people live in areas with failing grades for all air quality measures. The populations living amid the worst air quality are largely people of color, who also tend to have higher rates of chronic health problems such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease, which makes them especially vulnerable to air pollution.\n\nTogether, short-term and constant particle pollution contribute to tens of thousands of deaths a year, the report found. Respiratory ailments, such as asthma attacks, can be triggered by high levels of short-term pollution, but longer-term exposure can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nThe communities with the best air quality included Bangor, Maine; Wilmington, North Carolina; and Honolulu. Except for Honolulu, most of the cities with the best air quality were majority white.\n\nThe report uses new Environmental Protection Agency rules finalized in February for annual fine particulate matter pollution that limits levels from 12 micrograms per cubic meter to 9. Experts said that better reflects health problems associated with this type of pollution.\n\n“There is no safe level to particle pollution,” Dr. Kari Nadeau, the John Rock professor of climate and population studies at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told USA TODAY. “We were not meant to breathe this in as humans.”\n\nStill, she said, the lower level of allowable particulate matter in the air, even though the limit was reduced by just 3 micrograms, will save lives and health costs. By 2032, it will amount to $46 billion in cost savings and help the U.S. avoid 4,500 premature deaths, 800,000 cases of asthma and 290,000 lost workdays, an EPA analysis found.\n\nMeanwhile, the level of ozone, also known as smog, generally improved across the U.S., the report noted. Ozone is a pollutant driven by warmer temperatures, which climate change has exacerbated. Once in the air, it’s hard to remove. Exposure to ozone creates what the ALA describes as \"sunburn\" of the lungs. It triggers shortness of breath, coughing and asthma attacks and can shorten the life span of people who are exposed to it.\n\nThe western U.S. experienced the bulk of the pollution because of pollution from roadways, agriculture, oil and gas industries and seemingly endless wildfires.\n\nCommunities like California’s San Joaquin Valley, long the nation’s agricultural heartland, continue to be overrepresented for taking in the worst pollution in the ALA report. The cities of Bakersfield, Fresno and Visalia – hubs for agricultural production, shipping and warehouses where the population is predominantly Latino – make up the top five cities in each of the report’s measures for 24-hour particle pollution, year-round particle pollution, and ground-level ozone pollution.\n\nGustavo Aguirre Jr., a Bakersfield resident and associate director of climate and environmental justice at the nonprofit Central California Asthma Collaborative, said the numbers are not new to the community. He likened the air quality findings to reports of the region's record numbers on drunken driving.\n\n“We would not have a sober day,” he said, adding the area hasn't seen clean days in decades. “For us, this is just a continuation of bad news.”\n\nDangerous smoke:Where is wildfire smoke and air quality at its worst? Here's a map of the entire US.\n\nThe collaborative, founded to help educate residents with asthma about health risks, has moved to provide updated air filtration systems to homes, as well as community air monitoring networks to give people a better sense of local air quality levels. The organization also has looked at shifting public policy to regulate burn days, when old orchards are set afire, and electrify big rigs that rely on diesel fuel, a key polluter on the main highways that bring agriculture from the valley to cities in the north and south.\n\nThe region also faces unique challenges because of its inland location: Pollution from the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles travels to the valley, where it becomes trapped. Wildfires throughout California contribute to the problem. Efforts to reduce pollution levels over many years in the region appear not to have saved people in the San Joaquin Valley from particulate matter.\n\n“A lot of people feel at this point that there’s not much that they can do to address it or change it,” said Sarah Sharpe, a Fresno resident and the collaborative’s deputy executive director. “It's just kind of a state of where we either have to live, or we choose to live.”\n\nDr. John Balmes, a professor emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine who provided an academic review on the report’s health section, acknowledged there have been improvements in air quality. Ozone levels have declined in some places. But much of the progress has been wiped out by wildfire smoke and related effects of climate change.\n\n“The same pollutants that affect our health also contribute to climate change,” he said.\n\nThe pollutants increase the risk of cardiovascular problems such as heart failure and arrhythmia, as well as respiratory ailments such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Breathing in high levels of particulate matter in the long term has been linked to brain damage that puts people at higher risk of Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and other related dementias.\n\nThe report used only data from 2020 to 2022. It did not include the impact of the historic wildfires across Canada in 2023 that choked many eastern U.S. cities, turning skies orange. These circumstances were thought to be unique to the West Coast fire seasons.\n\nThe wildfires in Canada awakened New Yorkers to toxic air quality levels Black and Latino residents in the South Bronx already knew well. Apartments in the South Bronx sit near several intersecting freeways, power plants and waste management facilities that create some of the worst air quality in the region. Before the wildfires, the South Bronx had some of the highest asthma rates in the U.S. And now things are worse.\n\n“Our community is suffocating on a daily basis,” said Leslie Vasquez, clean air project organizer for the environmental justice nonprofit South Bronx Unite. “When they go home, that air is also breathed in on a daily basis.”\n\nThe group has installed dozens of air monitors across the South Bronx to record pollution levels and the wind, heat and humidity that contribute to people getting sick from pollutants. Combined heat and humidity, especially during the summer, can trigger additional deaths as temperatures and severe weather increase amid climate change.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/04/21/air-pollution-report-nearly-half-all-americans-breath-unhealthy-air/2997587001/", "title": "Pollution report: Nearly half of all Americans breathe unhealthy air", "text": "The report said that climate change continues to make air pollution worse.\n\nAbout nine million more people are breathing dirty air than in last year's report.\n\nCalifornia once again had the nation's most polluted cities.\n\nNearly half of the nation’s population – about 150 million people – live with and breathe polluted air, \"placing their health and lives at risk,\" according to a new report released Tuesday by the American Lung Association, a public health group.\n\nThe association's 21st annual “State of the Air” report said climate change continues to make air pollution worse, with many Western cities again seeing record-breaking spikes in particle pollution from wildfires.\n\n“The report finds the air quality in some communities has improved, but the ‘State of the Air’ finds that far too many people are still breathing unhealthy air,” said American Lung Association president and CEO Harold Wimmer.\n\nIn fact, about 9 million more people are breathing dirty air than in last year's report.\n\nThe 2020 report covers the years 2016-18, so any pollution decreases this year due to the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown were not included.\n\nAccording to the lung association, those are the three years with the most recent quality-assured air pollution data. In addition, those three years – 2016, 2017 and 2018 – were among the five hottest recorded in global history. When it comes to air quality, changing climate patterns fuel wildfires and their dangerous smoke, and lead to worsened particle and ozone pollution, the report said.\n\nAccording to the report, unhealthy levels of air pollution places people at risk for premature death and other serious health effects such as lung cancer, asthma attacks, cardiovascular damage and developmental and reproductive harm.\n\n\"Air pollution is linked to greater risk of lung infection,” Wimmer said. “Protecting everyone from COVID-19 and other lung infections is an urgent reminder of the importance of clean air.\"\n\nThe report deals with the two main types of air pollution that plague the USA: smog (also known as ground-level ozone) and soot (technically known as \"particulate matter\").\n\nSmog forms on warm, sunny days and is made worse by chemicals that exit vehicle tailpipes and power plant and industrial smokestacks. Warmer temperatures make ozone more likely to form.\n\nSoot pollution is deadlier and more of a health hazard than smog, causing more premature deaths and lung cancer, the lung association said.\n\nMegadrought emerging in the West:Might be worse than any in 1,200 years\n\nGlobal warming:2020 expected to be Earth's warmest year on record, scientists say\n\nPrimarily because of its geography and weather, California once again had the nation's most polluted cities. Los Angeles and Visalia topped the list for smog; Bakersfield and Fresno led the way for soot pollution.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, the federal group tasked with overseeing air quality in the U.S., said the lung association's report \"paints a pessimistic picture based upon a problematic methodology.\"\n\nIn a statement obtained by USA TODAY, the EPA said that the agency's \"methods for determining air quality, which are based on the Clean Air Act and the latest science, show continued improvements in measures of U.S. air quality in recent years and into the future.\"\n\nThe nation's cleanest cities, according to the report, were Bangor, Maine; Burlington, Vermont; Honolulu, Hawaii; and Wilmington, North Carolina. To make the list of cleanest cities, \"a city must experience no high ozone or high particle pollution days and must rank among the 25 cities with the lowest year-round particle pollution levels,\" the report said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/health/cnn-kff-mental-health-poll-wellness/index.html", "title": "90% of US adults say mental health is a crisis in the United States ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAn overwhelming majority of people in the United States think the country is experiencing a mental health crisis, according to a new survey from CNN in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nNine out of 10 adults said ​they believed that there’s a mental health crisis in the US today. Asked to rate the severity of six specific mental health concerns, Americans put the opioid epidemic near the top, with more than two-thirds of people identifying it as a crisis rather than merely a problem. More than half identified mental health issues among children and teenagers as a crisis, as well as severe mental illness in adults.\n\nThe survey captured the perceptions of a nationally representative sample of about 2,000 adults over the summer – 2½ years into the Covid-19 pandemic and amid ongoing public health threats including racism and gun violence.\n\nThe broad concern is well-founded, rooted in both personal experience and national trends.\n\n“The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated numerous social stressors that we know can increase the risk of both substance use and mental illness,” said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nData from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that drug overdose deaths reached record levels in 2021 and suicide rates were back near a record high after two years of decline. And in 2020, mental health-related visits to emergency rooms jumped 31% among adolescents ages 12 to 17.\n\nAccording to the CNN and KFF poll, about half of adults say they have had a severe mental health crisis in their family, including in-person treatment for family members who were a threat to themselves or others, or family members who engaged in self-harming behaviors.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 adults describe their own mental health as only “fair” or “poor,” including extra-large shares of adults under the age of 30, adults who identify as LGBT and those with an annual income of less than $40,000. A third of all adults said they felt anxious always or often over the course of the past year, including more than half of LGBT adults and those under 30. About 1 in 5 adults said they were often or always depressed or lonely over the past year, too.\n\nMajor sources of stress for a third or more of adults include personal finances and current and political events. About 1 in 4 adults also identified personal relationships and work, respectively, as major sources of stress.\n\nAccording to the new survey, about 1 in 5 adults received mental health services in the past year. Earlier data published by the CDC supports that finding and shows that mental health treatment became more common over the course of the pandemic: Nearly 22% of adults got mental health treatment in 2021, up from about 19% in 2019.\n\n“Perhaps one of the only benefits of the pandemic and the shift that our country has been going through is the increase in our willingness to acknowledge and talk about when we might be struggling or in need of support,” said Sarah Brummett, director of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention’s executive committee.\n\n“People are more willing to roll up their sleeves and talk about it and support folks. And I think that’s progress.”\n\nDespite increased willingness and commonly shared stressors among the public, most adults who have only fair or poor mental health said they don’t feel comfortable talking to loved ones about it – some to maintain privacy and some to avoid the shame and stigma attached to mental health issues.\n\nBut the vast majority – more than 4 out of 5 – of those surveyed say individuals and families should play a major role in addressing mental health problems in the US, equal to the share who say the same of health care providers.\n\nExperts say there is an opportunity to broaden perceptions about how mental health is part of overall physical health and how to respond to mental health crises.\n\n“Not everyone’s a cardiologist, but a lot of people are trained in CPR,” said Justin Baker, a psychologist and assistant professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. “If we only rely on the mental health force, we’re going to keep going around in circles and never actually get anywhere. I think we see this as all of our problems.”\n\nNonetheless, the groups most likely to say they need mental health care in the US are also less likely to say they can get it.\n\nNearly 6 out of 10 adults who say their mental health is only fair or poor say they have not been able to get needed care, as well as about half of adults younger than 30 and LGBT adults.\n\nFor those who have gone without help, the most common reasons cited were being too busy or unable to take time off work, being unable to afford the cost, and being afraid or embarrassed to seek care, according to the CNN and KFF survey.\n\nIn his first State of the Union address, President Joe Biden outlined a multipronged strategy to address the country’s mental health crisis, including goals to integrate mental health into primary care, investing in the work force and new approaches to programs that provide care.\n\n“Let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need, more people they can turn to for help and full parity between physical and mental health care,” he said in his address in March.\n\nAccording to the poll, most Americans see those issues as significant problems. A majority, 55%, say it’s a big problem that there aren’t enough mental health care providers, about three-quarters say that insurers not covering mental health the way they do physical health is a significant concern, and 80% say the same about the cost of mental health care.\n\nThrough the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration has invested $5 billion in mental health and substance use programs through the US Department of Health and Human Services, with billions more proposed in future budgets.\n\nOne significant shift came this summer, with the transition of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to a three-digit dialing code: 988. Early data suggests success, with calls jumping 45% in the first month compared with the same time a year before.\n\nBut according to the new survey, there is still work to be done.\n\nThe vast majority of adults (85%) say they would be at least somewhat likely to call the hotline if they or a loved one were experiencing a mental health crisis – and it’s a good alternative to 911, which about a quarter of adults, especially Black and LGBT adults, say would do more harm than good in a mental health crisis situation.\n\nIt also has potential to help Hispanic people and those who are uninsured, who are more likely than average to say they don’t know who to call if there is a mental health crisis and would not know where to find services.\n\nYet more than half of adults in the new poll say they have heard “nothing at all” about the new 988 hotline.\n\n“This can be a preventable public health issue, and we all have a role to play,” Brummett said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe fieldwork for the CNN/KFF Mental Health Survey was conducted by SSRS on July 28 through August 9 among a random national sample of 2,004 adults.

They were 61% more likely than White people to live in a county with a failing grade for at least one form of pollution and 3.6 times more likely to live in a county that fails for all three forms measured: year-round particle pollution, short-term particle pollution and ozone.\n\n“That’s certainly a disturbing trend and one of the challenges that we have to address to promote health equity and environmental justice,” said Paul Billings, a senior vice president with the American Lung Association. “We see the impacts of systemic racism on those who bear the greater burden of pollution.”\n\nThe report also found that 1.5 million pregnant people lived in counties with a failing grade for at least one pollutant. Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy can cause problems including higher infant mortality, lower birth weight, impaired lung development and early changes in immune development, studies show.\n\nSome experts predicted that with the Covid-19 pandemic and fewer people driving during lockdown, pollution levels would drop. There were indeed some marked improvements in air quality, Billings said, but the progress didn’t hold up nationwide throughout 2020.\n\nPeople weren’t driving to work as much, but online shopping went up significantly. All those deliveries may have had a negative effect on pollution levels, Billings said.\n\nFine particulate matter pollution, also known as particle pollution or PM 2.5 pollution, can come from things like fossil fuel plants, cars and agriculture. It is one of the tiniest yet most dangerous pollutants. When inhaled, the pollution travels deep into the lung tissue, where it can enter the bloodstream. Exposure is linked to several health problems, including asthma, heart disease, chronic bronchitis and other respiratory illnesses.\n\nParticle pollution is also thought to make people more susceptible to Covid-19, even after short-term exposure, studies show. Long-term exposure is linked to more severe Covid-19 outcomes.\n\nFor healthy people, exposure to this kind of pollution means more coughing, wheezing, asthma attacks and shortness of breath, Billings said. For people with asthma and other chronic disease, exposure means higher rates of premature death.\n\nThe cities that were most polluted by year-round particle pollution were all in California, with Bakersfield topping the list, followed by the Fresno-Madera-Hanford area, Visalia, the San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland area and Los Angeles. About 20.3 million people live in these areas.\n\nThe worst five areas for short-term particle pollution were also largely concentrated in California. The worst were the Fresno-Madera-Hanford area and Bakersfield. Fairbanks, Alaska, came in third, followed by two other California areas: San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland and Redding-Red Bluff. More than 63.2 million people live in these areas.\n\nFor ozone pollution, the five worst cities were Los Angeles-Long Beach, Bakersfield, Visalia and the Fresno-Madera-Hanford regions in California. Rounding out the worst five was Phoenix-Mesa, Arizona. More than 122.3 million people live in a county with a failing grade for ozone, but this is an improvement from last year’s report.\n\nThere have been advances in reducing pollution, but one phenomenon that’s driving the overall increase – in the West in particular – is the endless wildfire season. Other studies have shown that this smoke can drift as far as New York. In July 2021, a year not captured by the latest State of the Air report, Western wildfire smoke contributed to New York City’s worst air quality day in 15 years.\n\nWith moderate to extreme drought conditions in California and above-normal temperatures predicted through spring, the state says it could see even more wildfires this year.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe climate crisis has extended the country’s wildfire season so it now lasts all year.\n\n“We’ve seen some really bad air pollution events really driven by wildfire events in the West, and I think that’s a real change,” Billings said. “We’re really seeing the impact of climate change on our air quality, leading to really significant adverse health outcomes for the American people.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2021/10/16/phoenix-residents-breathing-bad-air-nearly-half-year/8424313002/", "title": "Phoenix residents are breathing bad air nearly half the year", "text": "Phoenix has ranked as one of the worst cities for air quality in the country and a new report shows that not even the pandemic lockdown could change that.\n\nThe report found that air pollution remains a serious problem across the metro area, with 2020 pollution levels not so different from those in previous years.\n\nThe region experienced 149 days of elevated air pollution in 2020, according to Environment America, a research and policy group that used data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe report looked at air pollution in the most highly populated areas of the country, and out of those, Phoenix was the fourth-worst, behind three California metro areas: San Diego, Los Angeles and Riverside. Payson, east of Phoenix, also reported high levels of pollution with 100 days of elevated ozone.\n\n\"The main takeaway is that air pollution definitely remains a threat in Arizona and across the country,” said Eve Lukens-Day, a global warming solutions campaign associate with Environment America. “Even one day of polluted air is too many. 149 is absolutely too many.”\n\nA pre-pandemic report from the American Lung Association placed Phoenix among the nation’s 10 worst cities for two common and dangerous air pollutants, ozone and particle pollution, which are shown to have negative health effects.\n\nMany people watched for signs of better air quality during the pandemic. Shutdowns and other restrictions forced people across the world to stay at home, decreasing fossil fuel emissions and improving air quality at an unprecedented rate in some parts of the world, according to the United Nations.\n\nSome Phoenix residents noticed cleaner air and an improvement in their asthma. But in Phoenix, ozone stubbornly persisted, despite a reduction in emissions. Unusually high temperatures, local weather and international ozone transport patterns contributed to high ozone concentrations in Maricopa County in April and May of 2020.\n\nPollution:As Arizonans battle pandemic, Phoenix air quality earns poor marks\n\nThe new report found that Phoenix area residents breathed in 103 days of air with elevated ozone, the main ingredient in smog. Residents experienced 62 days of air with particulate matter under 2.5 microns in diameter.\n\nThese small particles are especially dangerous because they can settle deep in people’s lungs. In total, there were 149 days in 2020 with either elevated ozone, elevated particulate matter or both.\n\nTom Cahill, an associate professor at Arizona State University who researches air quality, said he's not surprised by the levels of air pollution. Ozone needs three ingredients to form: volatile hydrocarbons, sunlight and heat.\n\nVolatile hydrocarbons start the chemical reaction to create ozone. They come from human-made pollutants like vehicle emissions and natural sources like wildfires. With plenty of heat and sun, Phoenix creates a friendly environment for volatile hydrocarbons to react.\n\n“We have heat and sunlight in spades,\" Cahill said. \"We are a great factory for making ozone, just by our climate.” Research shows that air pollution can cause premature death, damage internal organs like hearts and lungs, increase cancer risk, worsen mental health and decrease fertility.\n\nIn 2018, Phoenix had 153 days of elevated air pollution, according to the Environment America report. There were only 110 days of elevated air pollution in 2016.\n\n\"If anything, the numbers that we have are actually an undercount of bad air days, just because there aren't air quality monitors for both ozone and particulate matter all across the state or all across the country,\" Lukens-Day said. \"If we had even more air quality monitors, we might find the number of bad days are even higher.\"\n\nAir quality:Winter air really is worse in south, west Phoenix. Here's why\n\nTransportation is the main cause of nitrogen oxide emissions in Arizona, accounting for 75% of the total, according to 2017 EPA data. Nitrogen oxide reacts with other chemicals in the air to form ozone and particulate matter.\n\nWildfires and planned fires account for the largest source of volatile organic compounds in Arizona, making up 47% of emissions. Such compounds react with nitrogen oxides to produce ozone. Both large, unexpected fires, like the Museum Fire in Flagstaff, and planned fires, which are increasingly seen as a key forest management tool to help prevent massive wildfires, contribute to emissions.\n\n\"It’s true that intentional burns as a fire management tool can help prevent more severe wildfires,” said Morgan Folger, the Destination: Zero Carbon Campaign Director for Environment America. “Unfortunately, climate change will only continue to make the wildfire season last longer with more severe drought and hotter temperatures. As climate change worsens, it can add more fuel to potential wildfires and it will get harder to prevent. Our best long term solution is to stop burning fossil fuels so we can lessen the impact of climate change on wildfire season.\"\n\nThe authors of the report called for electrification of buildings, equipment and transportation.\n\n\"Using fossil fuels in our homes, businesses, industry and transportation necessitates emitting air pollution — including greenhouse gases — at every step of the process, from pumping the fuel out of the ground to piping it around the country and then to burning it where we live and work,\" the report said.\n\nEnvironment America supports President Joe Biden's Build Back Better Act, which is stalled in Congress, although the report didn't mention the legislation specifically.

Aleksej/Adobe Stock\n\nThe finding held true even after adjusting the analysis for over 30 other confounding factors, including other illicit drug use, alcohol use and tobacco smoking.\n\n“Physical bodily injury was the leading cause of emergency department visits and hospitalizations among the cannabis users, with respiratory reasons coming in a close second,” Vozoris said.\n\nMarijuana smokers had higher blood and urine levels of several smoke-related toxins such as naphthalene, acrylamide and acrylonitrile than nonsmokers, a 2021 study found. Naphthalene is associated with anemia, liver and neurological damage, while acrylamide and acrylonitrile have been associated with cancer and other health issues.\n\nAnother study done last year found teenagers were about twice as likely to report “wheezing or whistling” in the chest after vaping marijuana than after smoking cigarettes or using e-cigarettes.\n\nGrowing body of research\n\nA number of studies have shown an association between marijuana use and injury, both physical and mental.\n\nHeavy use of marijuana by teens and young adults with mood disorders – such as depression and bipolar disorder – has been linked to an increased risk of self-harm, suicide attempts and death, according to a 2021 study.\n\nAnother 2021 study found habitual users of cannabis, including teenagers, are increasingly showing up in emergency rooms complaining of severe intestinal distress that’s known as “cannabis hyperemesis syndrome,” or CHS.\n\nThe condition causes nausea, severe abdominal pain and prolonged vomiting “which can go on for hours,” Dr. Sam Wang, a pediatric emergency medicine specialist and toxicologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado, told CNN in a prior interview.\n\nA review published earlier this year looked at studies on over 43,000 people and found a negative impact of tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the main psychoactive compound in cannabis, on the brain’s higher levels of thinking.\n\nFor youth, this impact may “consequently lead to reduced educational attainment, and, in adults, to poor work performance and dangerous driving.

Phil Murphy approved legislation authorizing electric vehicle rebates of up to $5,000 per vehicle over the next 10 years. Creating one of the nation’s largest rebate packages, the legislation also includes money for new electric vehicle charging stations in urban areas and near highways. Just this week, Murphy signed another bill requiring charging stations in housing developments with 25 or more units.\n\nElectric vehicles charged on a low-carbon grid are responsible for less than a third of the 13 pounds of carbon dioxide an average gas-powered vehicle produces per day, U.S. Department of Energy records show. While emissions from individual vehicles are relatively low, the millions of cars, buses, trains, boats and planes that pass through New Jersey each year make those sources the largest contributors to air pollution in the state, according to Department of Environmental Protection records.\n\nThose emissions create greenhouse gases, ozone pollution and lung-damaging particles, the report shows. The particles' ability to cause lung damage has become even more feared amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent study from Harvard University found that fine airborne particles found in unclean air are associated with higher death rates from COVID-19.\n\n“The study results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce existing air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 crisis,” the researchers wrote.\n\nEnvironment:Wildfire smoke from West spreads all the way to New Jersey\n\nNews:New Jersey’s first parasitic ‘bat tick’ found in Sussex County\n\nRelated:NJ Transit's Wayne bus garage to receive $14.6M federal grant\n\nThe association’s annual “State of the Air” report estimates that nearly half of Americans live with unhealthy air quality, which has an outsized impact on low-income areas and communities of color.

More than 100 other hospitals said they anticipate a shortage within the next week.\n\nThe US health care system is Jha’s greatest concern, he said, noting the Omicron surge could hamper its capacity to care for patients suffering from conditions other than Covid-19.\n\n“The health care system is not just designed to take care of people with Covid … it’s designed to take care of kids with appendicitis and people who have heart attacks and get into car accidents,” he said.\n\n“And all of that is going to be much, much more difficult because we have a large proportion of the population that is not vaccinated, plenty of high risk people who are not boosted,” he said. “That combination sets up a large pool of people who as they get infected will end up really straining the resources we have in the hospitals today.”\n\nThese staff shortages are growing as frontline health care workers are either infected or forced to quarantine due to exposure to Covid-19 just as the demand for treatment skyrockets: More than 138,000 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals as of Saturday, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. That’s not far from the all-time peak (about 142,200 in mid-January 2021) and an increase from around 45,000 in early November.\n\nTo safeguard hospital capacity, some facilities are forced to cut elective surgeries. In New York, for example, 40 hospitals – mainly in the Mohawk Valley, Finger Lakes and central regions – have been told to stop nonessential elective operations for at least two weeks because of low patient bed capacity, the state health department said Saturday.\n\nThe University of Kansas Health System is also close to implementing crisis standards of care, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Steven Stites said Saturday, telling CNN, “At some point … we’re too overwhelmed to do any of our normal daily work.”\n\n“At that point we have to turn on a switch that says we got to triage the people we can help the most,” he said, “and that means we’ve have to let some people die who we might have been able to help but we weren’t sure about – they were too far gone or had too much of an injury, or maybe we can’t get to that trauma that just came in.”\n\nStites said two waves were hitting Kansas simultaneously – with Delta accelerating post-Thanksgiving, to be met by Omicron – describing it as “almost a double pandemic.” The vast majority of those being hospitalized are unvaccinated, Stites said.\n\nDr. Jonathan Reiner, professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University, told CNN on Saturday the next several weeks will “look bad in many American cities.”\n\n“Forty hospitals in New York just canceled elective procedures. The DC Hospital Association, where I work, has asked the DC government for permission for hospitals to enact crisis standards of care,” he said. “And that’s coming to every city in the United States.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CDC director explains new Covid isolation period rules 02:38 - Source: CNN\n\nLos Angeles County sees record weekly case numbers\n\nAbout 62.5% of the total US population – 208 million people – is fully vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 75.4 million people have received a booster dose, meaning 23% of the total US population is fully vaccinated and boosted.\n\nBut still about 21% of the eligible population, or 65.5 million people 5 and older, have not received a single dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, the CDC data show.\n\nNationwide, 39 states are reporting a 50% or greater increase in cases during the past week compared to the previous week, according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. As of Saturday, the seven-day average of new daily cases in the US was 701,199, per JHU data.\n\nTwo healthcare providers told CNN they’d been forced to prioritize Covid-19 testing for certain people due to a spike in demand.\n\nLast week, multiple UW Medicine locations in Washington started prioritizing testing solely for people “who have symptoms of respiratory illness or who have a known exposure to COVID-19,” spokesperson Susan Gregg told CNN. People without symptoms are not being tested, Gregg said, “due to the high volume of omicron cases that are being processed in our laboratory.”\n\nThe University of North Carolina Medical Center in Chapel Hill is also restricting Covid-19 tests to those exhibiting Covid-19 symptoms, as well as university employees and those requiring a test prior to a surgery, according to UNC Health Director of News Alan M. Wolf.\n\nSome localities are now seeing the most new cases they’ve seen the whole pandemic, including Los Angeles County.\n\nOn Saturday, the county reported more than 200,000 confirmed cases over the previous seven days – the highest number of cases in one week since the start of the pandemic, according to a news release from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. Hospitalizations doubled over the week to 3,200 and there were 135 Covid-related deaths, the department said.\n\nThe rise in infections is also hitting Los Angeles’ children hard.\n\nAt Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, the positivity rate for children tested for Covid-19 has increased from 17.5% in December to 45% to date in January, according to CHLA Medical Director Dr. Michael Smit.\n\nCHLA currently has 41 patients in-house who have tested positive for Covid-19, and roughly one quarter of the children admitted to the facility with Covid-19 require admission to the pediatric ICU, with some requiring intubation, Smit told CNN on Saturday.\n\nThe rise in cases comes just as Los Angeles students are preparing to return to in-person classes Tuesday.\n\nLos Angeles Unified School District, the second-largest school district in the country, is requiring all students and employees to show a negative Covid-19 test result before returning to the classroom.\n\nThe baseline test requirement was implemented at the beginning of the school year in August, and the district announced a week ago both the baseline test, along with required weekly testing for employees and students would continue through January, given the current surge.\n\nOn Sunday, LAUSD Board of Education President Kelly Gonez said about 50,000 positive Covid-19 cases had been identified as a result of the required testing, stopping those students and employees from enter school buildings Tuesday.\n\nDisputes over in-person learning\n\nIn response to rising pediatric infections, disputes over whether in-person learning is ideal during the Omicron surge and how students can safely attend school are playing out in various school districts this week.\n\nFor the week ending December 30, children accounted for 17.7% of new reported cases in the US, the American Academy of Pediatrics said, noting a record 325,00 new cases among children – a 64% increase from the week prior.\n\nThe Chicago Public Schools (CPS) system has canceled classes since Wednesday due to a dispute between city officials and the teachers union over returning to the classroom. The Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) voted Tuesday to teach remotely due to the Covid-19 surge, but the school district canceled classes, saying schools were safe and it wanted in-person learning.\n\nCTU have said conditions are unsafe, citing in part inadequate staffing and testing. They say they want more testing, along with additional mitigation protocols.\n\nThe CTU presented a new proposal to Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Saturday which included a resumption of virtual learning for CPS students beginning Wednesday and in-person instruction on January 18 unless health officials determine it’s not safe. City officials rejected the proposal – though it accepted some requests, like providing KN95 masks for all staff and students – saying it looked forward “to continued negotiations to reach an agreement.”\n\nDr. Julie Morita, the former Chicago health commissioner and executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said children and teachers can safely be in the classroom with certain measures, like requiring vaccinations and masks, ensuring good ventilation and testing capacity.\n\n“When those systems are in place, children and teachers can be safely in the school environment,” she said, “but those systems have to be in place.”\n\nMembers of the Chicago Teachers Union and supporters stage a car caravan protest outside City Hall in the Loop, Wednesday evening, January 5, 2022. Ashlee Rezin /Chicago Sun-Times via AP\n\nDr. Richina Bicette-McCain, medical director at the Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN schools could be safe but she believes they are currently “high-risk.”\n\n“Not because of the nature of schools in and of themselves,” she said, “but because although we know what tools are available to us and we have the tools to mitigate those risks, they are not being employed adequately.”\n\n“Students need proper access to testing, we need to give students and staff high quality masks,” she said. “Let’s employ HEPA filters in schools to increase ventilation and increase air circulation.\n\nIn Georgia, public school teachers who test positive for Covid-19 no longer have to isolate before returning to school if they are asymptomatic and wear a mask, and contact tracing in schools is no longer required, according to a letter to school leaders released Thursday from Gov. Brian Kemp and public health commissioner Kathleen Toomey.\n\nBut Lisa Morgan, president of the Georgia Association of Educators, believes the changes are the “absolute wrong thing to do at the absolute worst time.” Educators want to be in classrooms with their students, she said, “but that should be achieved by keeping people healthy.\n\n“We know that there are increasing cases in our children, there’s increasing hospitalizations in our children,” she told CNN Saturday, “and this action shows a lack of regard for the health and safety of educators, students and our families.”", "authors": ["Dakin Andone Susannah Cullinane", "Dakin Andone", "Susannah Cullinane"], "publish_date": "2022/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/06/30/air-quality-index-live-updates-friday/70372034007/", "title": "Air quality live updates: Smoke brings 'unhealthy' index for many", "text": "Smoke from Canadian wildfires that’s been blanketing large portions of the East Coast for days is starting to moderate.\n\nForecasts show the smoke, which has hung heavy over New York, Chicago, Detroit and Washington, D.C., will ease Friday afternoon and through the weekend.

Detroit and Cleveland will likely remain in the orange or \"unhealthy for sensitive groups,\" according to the forecast.\n\nThursday, Detroit had the worst air quality in the world, according to AQI rankings and Friday was remained in the red or \"unhealthy\" category.\n\nThere are nearly 500 active wildfires in Canada, and fires there this summer have burned an area about the size of West Virginia. In some areas, authorities discouraged people from exercising outside over concerns the pollution could damage their breathing, especially if they have asthma.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., and Chicago, conditions Friday improved, generating a lower risk for most people but reflecting continued concern for people with sensitivities.

However, air quality is expected to slowly improve due to a combination of thunderstorm activity and dispersion of the smoke as we head into the weekend,\" the weather service said in a Friday morning short-term forecast.\n\nAir quality concerns at PGA Tour stop in Detroit\n\nIn Detroit, officials at the Rocket Mortgage Classic were monitoring conditions. When the AQI reaches 300 for a sustained period, the PGA tour considers suspending play. As of Friday morning, the AQI was 158 in Detroit, well below that threshold.\n\nTwo years ago, PGA officials adopted the policy after smoke from California wildfires made it hard to see balls in flight at the Barracuda Championship near Tahoe.\n\n“It’s not an absolute stop,” Wade Stettner, the tour’s on-site meteorologist, said Thursday. “But it's kind of up to his discretion, more of a recommendation, depending on kind of the situation.”\n\nSummer camps moving indoors as smoke lingers\n\nSummer camps in several states moved many activities indoors as smoke lingered, seeking to protect kids from unhealthy air. Conditions were ranked as red or \"unhealthy\" in Pennsylvania on Friday morning but were forecast to improve to orange or \"unhealthy for sensitive groups\" later in the day and then yellow by Saturday.\n\n“There’s certainly a concern, considering that we take children from the cities,” Mark Zides, chairman of the Pennsylvania Camp Association, said Thursday. “Coming up to the mountains for the summer is what summer camp is all about.”\n\nMaggie Groce, one of the directors of the summer camp program at Tanglewood Nature Center in Elmira, New York, said kids were staying inside as the air quality level hit 183 — in the dangerous red zone.\n\n“Ideally, we would love for them to be outside in nature, on the trails, so this has thrown a wrench on our plans,” Groce said.\n\nNew York officials issue smoke alert over particulates\n\nThe New York State Department of Environmental Conservation extended an air quality health advisory for fine particulates through at least midnight Friday. The alert comes as air quality levels in the Rochester region are expected to remain at the \"red\" level for fine particulates. The alert covers Monroe, Wayne, Ontario, Livingston, northern Cayuga and Oswego counties.\n\nWith the pollution levels elevated, the New York State Department of Health advises people to consider reducing strenuous outdoor physical activities to minimize the risk of adverse health effects.\n\nWill the Canadian wildfire smoke ever end this summer?\n\nThanks to the ongoing wildfires in Canada, which show no sign of ending, smoky air is likely to be a regular occurrence in the U.S. throughout the rest of the summer, experts said. The Canadian wildfire season usually lasts until October, and the wildfires through June have already set a record for area burned, with the hottest part of the summer yet to come.\n\n\"As long as those fires keep burning up there, that’s going to be a problem for us,\" Weather Prediction Center forecast operations chief Greg Carbin said. \"As long as there’s something to burn, there will be smoke we have to deal with.\"\n\nThe unusual jet stream pattern, which continues to periodically funnel the foul, smoke-filled air over U.S. cities, shows no sign of changing or letting up.\n\n\"While the fires are ongoing, you can expect to see these periodic bad air days,\" University of Chicago atmospheric scientist Liz Moyer said. \"And the only relief is either when the fires go out or when the weather pattern dies.\"\n\nWhat are the Air Quality Index levels?\n\nGovernments around the world track and rank their air quality daily, in some cases in realtime, using a color-coded scale of \"good\" to \"hazardous.\" The AQI measures pollution from wildfire smoke to dust, ozone, pollen and several chemicals, including sulfur dioxide, which comes from burning coal or oil.\n\nThe levels are:\n\nGreen/Good: 0 to 50, air quality is satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk.\n\nYellow/Moderate: 51 to 100, air quality is acceptable.

Most of the products and services driving those deaths, however, were bought or used in the United States and Western Europe. Researchers traced 11% of Chinese air-pollution deaths to goods and services used in the United States and western Europe, the biggest importers of Chinese products.\n\n“We may be benefitting from lower prices, but they may be coming at the expense of someone else’s health,” says study co-author Michael Brauer of Canada’s University of British Columbia. “There is no free lunch.”\n\nThe study’s authors focused on lives lost to an especially hazardous form of contaminant called fine particulates. These microscopic bits of pollution, which can travel deep into the lungs, have been linked to lung cancer, stroke and other diseases. Fine particulates from power plants and factories are a main component of China’s notorious air pollution. They’re also far more deadly than ozone, another principal ingredient in dirty air.\n\nResearchers began with pollution tallies from a wide variety of sources, such as trucks and manufacture of plastics. They worked out each country's share of air pollution from each source and predicted where that pollution travels. That information, combined with formulas that forecast deaths linked to particulate levels, allowed them to calculate the deaths from individual sources.\n\nThe results showed fine particulates killed some 3 ½ million people worldwide in 2007. The study links nearly a quarter of those deaths to goods and services enjoyed somewhere else. China, for example, suffered 238,000 deaths of this type. The rest came from pollution that wafted into China from the manufacture of goods made and used somewhere else, such as India. By comparison, nearly 1.2 million Chinese overall died from air pollution-related diseases in 2015.\n\nConsumption in the United States led to roughly 100,000 deaths outside U.S. borders, about half of them in China, the researchers estimate. That makes Americans second to Western Europeans, whose habits led to 170,000 deaths.\n\nResearchers long suspected trade as a culprit for air-pollution deaths. But the effect turns out to be “pretty remarkable,” says Jason West of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who was not involved with the study. Adding in the health effects of ozone would drive the numbers higher, West says.\n\nNations could crack down on pollution within their own borders, but restrictions could just drive factories elsewhere. “Another country would step up and say, hey, we’re willing to have our people die to have that business,” says study co-author Steven Davis of the University of California, Irvine.\n\nIt takes global cooperation to prevent such a “race to the bottom,” the study’s authors say. They also called on shoppers to switch from cheap, throwaway goods to more durable items. “We need to make sustainable consumerism the fashion,” says study co-author Dabo Guan of China’s Tsinghua University and Britain’s University of East Anglia.\n\nPresident Trump has proposed tariffs on imports to protect American jobs, and those tariffs could also help reduce deaths from trade-related air pollution. But the study highlights a hidden cost of that form of relief.\n\n“Now you can see what sort of jobs have been moving from the USA and Europe to China and India and Asia,” says Jos Lelieveld of Germany’s Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, who was not involved with the study. “They’re associated with pollution.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/29"}]}

Bill Haslam said Monday he is allowing a controversial guns-on-campus bill to become law without his signature.\n\nThe bill allows full-time faculty, staff and other employees of Tennessee's public colleges and universities who have handgun-carry permits to carry their guns on campus -- but they must notify the local law enforcement agency with primary responsibility for security on their campus -- the campus police, for example.\n\nThe governor said in a letter to the House and Senate speaker that he prefers to let campuses make their own decision.\n\n“I am letting SB 2376 become law without my signature. I have long stated a preference for systems and institutions to be able to make their own decisions regarding security issues on campus, and I again expressed this concern throughout the legislative process this year,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"Although SB 2376 does not go as far as I would like in retaining campus control, the final version of the bill included input from higher education and was shaped to accommodate some of their concerns.\"\n\nAny employee interested in carrying a weapon on campus would be required to notify the law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the property and would face some limitations as to where they can carry a gun, which would have to be concealed. Valid permit holders could not bring a weapon into a stadium or gymnasium during school-sponsored events or in meetings regarding discipline or tenure.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe legislation was also amended to place liability on the permit holder rather than the university in the event of an accidental discharge.\n\nDiscussing those provisions, Haslam said, “Ultimately, this legislation was tailored to apply to certain employees in specific situations, it provides protection from liability for the institutions, and it requires notification of law enforcement before carrying on campus. I hope that as a state we will monitor the impact of this new law and listen to the feedback of higher education leaders responsible for operationalizing it.”\n\nPrior to Monday's announcement, the legislation was considered one of a handful of bills Haslam was considering vetoing since the legislature adjourned on April 22.\n\nProponents of the measure argued it is necessary in order to provide additional safety on college campuses. Opponents, including police chiefs, students and a significant number of faculty members at the University of Tennessee, said the legislation would not actually make the campus safer and would complicate how law enforcement handle active shooter incidents.\n\nBill to allow guns on Tennessee college campuses heads to Haslam\n\nAllowing guns on campus only diminishes safety\n\nThe bill does not allow students, including those with permits, to go armed on campus, as some states, such as Texas, have allowed. However, a separate bill approved earlier this year and signed by the governor prohibits state colleges and universities from taking \"adverse action\" against students and employees with permits for transporting or storing a gun or ammunition in their parked vehicles on campus.\n\nThe campus carry law requires campus employees with permits to carry their guns concealed, even though Tennessee's handgun-carry permit law allows open and concealed carry.\n\nAccording to estimates university officials provided The Tennessean in January, the legislation means all 11,527 full-time employees at the University of Tennessee and 15,985 employees in the Tennessee Board of Regents system, which oversees 46 institutions across the state, could carry a weapon on college property, including inside classrooms and lecture halls.\n\nThe bill, which won Senate approval 28-5 on April 19 and House approval the following day on a 69-24 vote, goes into effect July 1.\n\nThe measure gives law enforcement agencies with jurisdictions over each campus authority to develop and implement policies and procedures regarding the law's requirement that employees notify law enforcement of their intent to go armed, and to offer voluntary courses or supplemental firearm training to employees who elect to go armed.\n\nUniversity of Tennessee President Joe DiPietro said UT's \"position has been and continues to be that we do not support, as a general premise, any measure that would increase the number of guns on college campuses other than already are allowed by law. To us, the governor’s position of allowing the two higher education boards to decide for themselves gun policy for their campuses would have been ideal.\n\n\"But we recognized early in the process that the bill had a great likelihood of passing. We went to work with the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police and our colleagues at the Tennessee Board of Regents on attempts to try to craft some sort of amendment to maximize campus safety in the event of passage. That measure is that university employees who intend to go armed must notify their campus police departments,” DiPietro said.\n\nDavid Gregory, the chancellor for the Tennessee Board of Regents, said the focus will now turn ensuring the guidelines of the law are followed. \"We pray that anyone who chooses to carry a gun on a college campus intently complies with all safety practices, legal guidelines and defined restrictions to help avoid accidents,\" he said.\n\nThe two legislative sponsors of the bill said Monday they appreciated the governor's action, even if he didn't sign it, and said they believe it will make public colleges safer.\n\nSen. Mike Bell, R-Riceville, the Senate sponsor, said, \"I appreciate the governor recognizing that myself and the House sponsor did work with the UT and TBR (Tennessee Board of Regents) systems and accepted some of their amendments, which I think made it a better bill.\"\n\nThe House sponsor, Rep. Andy Holt, R-Dresden, said he is pleased that Haslam \"is allowing this bill to become law and fulfilling the wishes of the 109th General Assembly and Tennesseans in general.\"\n\n\"The purpose of running the bill is campus safety. It's not an effort to create an armed battalion on campus but to allow individuals to protect and defend themselves,\" Holt said.\n\nHolt also said he believes the \"important next step\" is to allow students to go armed on campus as well. \"It's not my intention to do so immediately. But if someone else did, I’d support it. These are adults. We need to stop talking about college students as children. They have the same constitutional rights as others. I think that’s an important next step.\n\n\"My intention is to eliminate all gun-free zones, whether it’s the legislature or a college campus,\" Holt said.\n\nBell said he expects a student-carry bill to be filed next year but that he won't sponsor it.\n\nTennessee Democratic Party chair Mary Mancini criticized Haslam's decision, saying allowing guns on college campuses defies common sense.\n\n\"Campus police chiefs have also opposed this legislation vehemently so the only conclusion to be made is that the Governor and the Republican supermajority who passed this horrific piece of legislation only care about the gun lobby and their wealthy donors,\" she said.\n\nSen. Lee Harris, D-Memphis, who surveyed 1,700 university faculty members, many of who criticized the measure, before the legislation was approved in the Senate, expressed his frustration on social media.\n\n\"Make no mistake, special interest groups and the opinions of a very small minority of Tennesseans drive decisions like this one,\" Harris said on Twitter.\n\nBeth Joslin Roth, policy director of Safe Tennessee Project and who monitored the bill through the legislative process, said lawmakers should have listened to campus police chiefs who spoke against the bill in committees.\n\n\"According to campus police chiefs, not only will this new law make campuses less safe, it will also require them to scrap their FBI training protocol when it comes to responding to an active shooter situation. Additionally, numerous faculty members have indicated they will resign over this. But, in our state, the gun lobby is more influential than law enforcement and the wishes of the NRA trump the concerns of our public colleges and universities,\" Roth said.\n\nAdam Tamburin contributed to this report.\n\nRichard Locker of The Commercial Appeal in Memphis and Knoxville News Sentinel contributed to this report.\n\nReach Joel Ebert at 615-772-1681 and on Twitter @joelebert29.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/23/tennessee-special-session-updates-lawmakers-press-ahead/70653782007/", "title": "TN special session updates: Controversial guns in schools bill fails", "text": "Tennessee lawmakers are back today for the third day of their special legislative session on public safety, mental health and guns.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House and Senate slowly got to work. But by afternoon, lawmakers are tabling dozens of bills and narrowing the legislation they advanced. On Wednesday, Senators continued to table bills and took up just four at their afternoon floor session.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions began rising as activists pushing for gun reform were removed from a committee hearing. The ACLU filed a lawsuit in the morning and won a temporary injunction on the House rules.\n\nFollow for the latest updates.\n\nControversial guns in schools bill fails to advance in House\n\nA controversial bill to relax restrictions on who could bring guns on public school campuses died on a tie vote after a dramatic, four-hour committee meeting in the Tennessee House on Wednesday.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe bill was nearly voted on without debate due to a parliamentary move to shut down debate, an action that riled Democrats on the committee and members of the audience, which included parents from the Covenant School waiting to testify. The committee temporarily shut down to cool tempers.\n\nCovenant parents vehemently opposed HB 7064, sponsored by Rep. Chris Todd, R-Madison County, who argued more guns at schools will make children safer.\n\nSeveral Covenant parents temporarily left the committee room in disgust after Todd suggested that the guns used by the Covenant shooter weren't the issue in the tragedy, and the shooter probably would have \"driven over\" the kids at recess if a gun wasn't available.\n\nAbby Mclean, a Covenant mom, questioned how she should tell her kids that lawmakers want to allow more guns into school, when her children are still scared of firearms.\n\n“How do I explain to these children that that’s your solution? I want an answer,” McLean said.\n\n— Melissa Brown, The Tennessean\n\nCovenant victim's mom pleads for alarm standards\n\nThrough a statement read by a friend, the mother of Covenant victim William Kinney urged lawmakers to support a proposed bill that would establish standard rules for school protocol in the event of a fire alarm outside of a scheduled fire drill.\n\nErin Kinney said many at Covenant initially believed the active shooter situation was a fire due to a blaring fire alarm, masking the initial sounds of gunfire. William, as line leader of his class, followed protocol to lead his classmates out of the classroom ahead of the teacher, who is trained to stay behind and sweep the classroom in the event of a fire emergency.\n\n\"Fire alarms can be deadly, forcing kids toward a shooter and not away from one,\" Kinney, who was not at Wednesday's hearing, said in the statement. \"At Covenant, for example, the thick haze of smoke released by a rapidly fired rifle automatically triggered a fire alarm.\"\n\n\"He was fulfilling his duty to lead his class to safety from a possible fire. Within seconds of the building being breached, his class encountered the shooter and he and two of his classmates were lying dead.\"\n\nHB 7002 was sponsored by House Majority Leader William Lamberth, R-Portland. Lamberth said there are different ways schools can differentiate between alarms through alerts and technologies, and his bill is simply requiring each school board to have procedures in place that make sense for their schools.\n\nThe Education Administration Committee advanced the bill.\n\n— Melissa Brown, The Tennessean\n\nLawmakers debate controversial bill allowing minors to be tried as adults in certain offenses\n\nAs the Senate wrapped for the day, House committees remained in session to consider a number of bills related to crime and school safety.\n\nThe House Criminal Justice Committee passed a controversial bill that would that allow minors to be tried as adults for certain offenses, despite opposition from Democrats and some juvenile court judges. The bill, introduced by House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville.\n\nThe Senate has not advanced the bill.\n\nJuvenile justice advocates testified that the law would increase recidivism for young people pushing into the adult system and it doesn’t include exceptions for youth with disabilities.\n\nLawmakers who supported the bill said it would be a strong deterrent for young people committing crimes. House Majority Leader William Lamberth, R-Portland, said the bill is a “good balance” because it gives judges the discretion to keep youth in juvenile court longer.\n\nBut Rep. G.A. Hardaway, D-Memphis, said the bill doesn’t focus on rehabilitation.\n\n“There’s an art and science to juvenile justice reform. This bill fails on both,” he said. “We can lock folks up until the cows come home, but if we haven’t given them the proper a rehabilitation program, they will come out worse then they went in.”\n\nThe bill didn't sit well with those in the audience.\n\n“Shame on you!” demonstrators shouted as they left the room after the vote.\n\n— Kelly Puente, The Tennessean\n\n'You've done nothing': Demonstrators slam Senate as it concludes initial work\n\nAfter passing four bills, including one to fund the special session, the Senate adjourned until Thursday morning at 9 a.m. CT.\n\nAs the chamber adjourned, demonstrators in the gallery broke out in chants of “you’ve done nothing! You’ve done nothing!” and unfurled a banner that read “no gun reform, no peace!” They were escorted from the chamber.\n\nAn appropriations bill, including $16.3 million in bonus funding for mental health workers, $3 million for mental health scholarships, and $10 million for a stop-gap measure to allow for more security officers in schools, passed 26 to 0, with several members voting present.\n\nThe Senate also overwhelmingly passed bills to codify Lee's executive order requiring swift updates to the state's background check database, tax incentives for safe gun storage, and to require the TBI to make a new report on the state of human trafficking in Tennessee.\n\n— Vivian Jones, The Tennessean\n\nBill to exempt gun safes from sales tax passes; PSA campaign on safe gun storage expanding\n\nSenate members passed a bill backed by Gov. Bill Lee to provide gun locks, exempt gun safes and similar tools from sales tax, and expand a PSA campaign on safe gun storage.\n\nSenators adopted the bill in a vote of 28 to 1. Sen. Todd Gardenhire, R-Chattanooga, cast the lone opposing vote. Sens. Bowling and Lundberg abstained from the vote.\n\n\"It's a step in the right direction. It's not the last step that we will take, but it is an important step forward,\" said Republican Caucus Chairman Ken Yager, R-Kingston.\n\nAhead of the start of the Senate session, members of the Senate Republicans caucus sought to assuage the concerns of hesitant caucus members by arguing the bills proposed would do very little.\n\n“This just eliminates very low-hanging barriers,” Lowe explained to caucus colleagues ahead of the meeting.\n\nLowe explained that the free gun locks program is already in place at the Department of Safety, and the agency already has a surplus of locks left over from previous years that have not yet been distributed.\n\n“There is no mandate in this bill, there is no requirement or anything,” said Majority Leader Jack Johnson, R-Franklin, prior to the session. “This is to encourage you to safely store your weapon, and provide you with the means to do so should you choose to use them.”\n\n“I got the impression that this is something we’re already doing,” said Sen. Bo Watson, R-Hixson. “It doesn’t require anybody to do anything.”\n\n— Vivian Jones, The Tennessean\n\nSenate leadership to discuss plans for adjournment\n\nAfter reviewing the four bills that will be on the Senate floor this afternoon, Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge, announced that the chamber’s leadership plans to meet with House leaders to figure out a path to adjourn the special session.\n\n“As you know, we’re in a sort of Mexican stand-off with the House,” McNally told caucus members, during a bill review meeting in his conference room.\n\n“I brought my shovel,” joked Sen. Janice Bowling, R-Manchester, who noted that this is the second wedding anniversary she has had interrupted by a special session.\n\n“We’ve learned that they would like to discuss some things with us,” McNally said.\n\n“Hopefully it will provide a path to adjourn. It takes both houses to agree on adjournment resolutions, otherwise you just keep going and going and going.”\n\nMcNally said members should make plans to be at the Capitol in the morning, and could not say whether adjournment would happen before Friday.\n\n“If they’re reasonable, I think it behooves us to come to an agreement,” said Sen. Becky Duncan Massey, R-Knoxville.\n\n“Just tell them they’re lucky to get the three bills we gave them,” said Sen. Rusty Crowe, R-Johnson City.\n\n“I didn’t really want to be here in the first place,” added Sen. Mark Pody, R-Lebanon, “I don’t want to go much more on giving to the house.”\n\n— Vivian Jones, The Tennessean\n\nSenate finance committee adjourns after passing 2 bills\n\nThe final Senate committee closed less than 48 hours after the session gaveled in, having passed only two funding bills.\n\nSenators unanimously passed a bill backed by Gov. Bill Lee to permanently suspend sales tax on gun safes and storage items, and expand a two-year-old program to provide free gun locks and public service announcement campaigns to encourage safe storage of guns.\n\nNo part of the bill requires the Department of Safety to measure or report success of the gun locks or PSA efforts to the legislature.\n\n“If this program has been in place for two years, and we still have gun locks left over, what are we going to do to make sure that the gun locks are actually distributed across the state?” asked Sen. London Lamar, D-Memphis. “What are we going to do different to make sure this program is going to work differently?”\n\nIncluded in the appropriations bill funding the session is a stop-gap measure to allow school districts to place school safety officers and use other safety measures in schools, building on a funding allocation this spring designated specifically for POST-certified sworn School Resource Officers.\n\n“The intent is to allow the School Resource Officer program to build capacity,” Senate Finance Chairman Bo Watson, R-Hixson said.\n\n— Vivian Jones, The Tennessean\n\n'A terrible thing': Protesters get heated as bill allowing more guns in schools passes committee vote\n\nSobs echoed through a Tennessee House committee room Wednesday morning as Becky Hansen described how her 5-year-old son's Covenant School teacher told her class they had to race to see who was fastest when she realized someone had opened fire inside the school on March 27.\n\nThe teacher wanted to get her pre-K class into their safe space as fast as possible without scaring the children.\n\nHansen and fellow Covenant mom Melissa Alexander testified in opposition of HB 7064, which would allow any active or retired law enforcement, military and enhanced handgun permit holders to carry handguns on public school grounds. The gun-carriers would not have to identify themselves to school authorities, who would have no authority to block carriers.\n\nHansen and Alexander said they do not want more guns on school campuses, describing how Covenant teachers' hands shook so severely during the March shooting that they struggled to lock the doors.\n\nRep. Chris Todd, R-Madison County, is sponsoring the bill and argued more guns in schools and their grounds would make children safer, alleging shooters seek out \"gun-free\" zones.\"\n\nA retired teacher and Vanderbilt University student planning to be a teacher also testified against the bill.\n\n\"We had armed representatives in the Covenant School. That was not a deterrent for the shooter,\" Hansen said. \"Expecting a handgun to go up against a semi-assault rifle that can expend multiple rounds is going to add another death. It's unreasonable to expect a small gun to go against that powerful of a weapon.\"\n\nDespite the emotional testimony, Republicans on the committee voted to advance the bill, though the measure will likely stall without similar movement in the Senate.\n\nThe vote sparked widespread condemnation from the audience. As protesters stood to leave, several yelled \"y'all are disgusting\" and \"you're sick\" to lawmakers seated at the dias.\n\nJim Polk, a 74-year-old former Davidson County educator, stood after the vote, pointing his finger toward lawmakers as he clutched his hat in his right hand. Polk called it \"ridiculous and absurd\" to pass legislation that would override school administration's authority to control activity on their campuses.\n\n\"This should never happen in America. You are wrong, fellas,\" Polk said, jabbing his finger toward lawmakers. \"You are wrong to have made this decision.\"\n\nSecurity asked Polk to leave, which he agreed to do.\n\n\"I'll leave, but I'll be back,\" Polk said. \"You are wrong, you have done a terrible thing today, a terrible thing.\"\n\n— Melissa Brown, The Tennessean\n\nCommittee: State's revenue slowing, $330 million needed to make expected gap\n\nThe final Senate Finance, Ways and Means Committee kicked off with an update on the state’s financial outlook from Finance and Administration Commissioner Jim Bryson.\n\nBryson asserted that the state’s revenue growth is slowing, and noted the ongoing three-month sales tax holiday, which is impacting state revenues. Finance officials said that the state would need $330 million more in revenue next year to make up for a projected gap.\n\nNo mention was made of the $3.2 billion rainy day fund, or a $153.5 million revenue surplus reported last month, but the presentation seemed to impact members on the committee.\n\n“We are probably moving into a period of more disciplined spending control and more sensitivity to spending than we have been in the last 10 years,” said Finance Committee Chair Bo Watson, R-Hixson.\n\nTwo of the four bills on the committee's calendar were scuttled, while the two remaining bills – an appropriations bill to cover the costs of the special session, and a proposal backed by the governor to do a public service announcement on safe storage, provide firearm locks and exempt gun safes from sales tax – sparked the longest discussion of any bill taken up in the Senate so far this week.\n\nElizabeth Stroeker, legislative director for the Tennessee Department of Safety, told members that the agency has already done similar PSAs on safe storage in the past, and already has a program to distribute free gun locks. They’ve already distributed 44,000 locks.\n\n“What we’re going to do is kind-of robust that program,” Stroeker said, adding that it would be advertised on the agency’s website.\n\nCommittee recessed briefly to reconcile a fiscal discrepancy.\n\n— Vivian Jones, The Tennessean\n\nGun-control group calls lawmakers 'petulant'\n\nWith frustration brewing, members of the Tennessee chapter of Moms Demand Action held a news conference Wednesday calling Republican lawmakers “petulant” children for their inability pass any meaningful gun legislation.\n\nSenate members have so far passed just three bills, while scuttling dozens more in meetings that have lasted less than two minutes. Many of those bills, though, did not deal directly with firearms.\n\nMoms Demand Action member Jason Sparks, whose brother was killed in a road rage incident, said the lawmakers are still bitter over becoming a national embarrassment last spring when they expelled two House members.\n\n“This is like a petulant child,” he said. “They carry animosity and it just shows how little importance they have for their job. It’s a waist for taxpayers and it’s a slap in the face to these poor victims.”\n\nThe Senate is set to meet for a final floor session at 2 p.m.\n\n— Kelly Puente, The Tennessean\n\nBill limiting autopsy records tabled by Senate committee\n\nA bill that would have blocked public release of the autopsies and medical examiner reports for child victims of violent crimes is effectively over in the Senate.\n\nIn the third seconds-long Senate committee meeting of the day, the State and Local Committee tabled Senate Bill 7090, which would have made those changes, when the bill sponsor, Majority Leader Jack Johnson, did not appear to present the bill.\n\nThe committee scuttled two other bills on its consent calendar during the whirlwind meeting.\n\nAhead of the Senate Finance, Ways and Means Committee only three bills remain alive in the upper chamber.\n\n— Vivian Jones, The Tennessean\n\nJudge issues temporary restraining order against new sign rule\n\nA Davidson County judge issued a temporary restraining order Wednesday against the Tennessee House of Representatives, blocking the chamber's new rule barring signs in the galleries.\n\nThe order, signed by Chancellor Anne Martin, comes as part of a lawsuit filed earlier in the morning by the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee.\n\n\"Defendants are not harmed by issuance of this motion as they have no legitimate government interest in violating First Amendment rights or enforcing patently unreasonable rules—and Plaintiffs’ conduct of silently holding small signs cannot be said to have disrupted the proceedings of the House of Representatives,\" the attorneys wrote in the motion for a temporary restraining order. \"The public interest is extremely great: nothing less than the constitutional rights of Tennesseans to participate in their government is at stake.\"\n\nThe lawsuit stems the removal of three activists from a House committee hearing for holding paper signs supporting gun reform. The residents were removed by state troopers on Tuesday after being told to lower paper signs and not clap during the House Civil Justice Subcommittee hearing.\n\nA temporary injunction hearing for the matter is now scheduled for Sept. 5 at 10 a.m.\n\n— Angele Latham, The Tennessean\n\nSenate Health and Welfare Committee tables all bills\n\nThe Senate Health and Welfare Committee tabled all 20 bills on its calendar, and adjourned in a matter of seconds after the roll was taken.\n\nTabled bills included proposals to expand physicians’ “duty to warn” of specific threats of harm shared by patients, and increased coverage for mental health and psychiatric services.\n\nSen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville – who is the only democrat on the committee – objected to the tabling motion, but the Republicans on the committee all supported tabling the bills.\n\n— Vivan Jones, The Tennessean\n\n'It was not funny': Ostrich egg stunt riles up legislators\n\nSenatorial obstinance over taking up bills has roiled House GOP leadership.\n\nHouse Republican Caucus Chair Jeremy Faison, R-Cosby, presented Senate Republicans with an ostrich egg late Tuesday, posting a photo of the token on the speaker’s dais in the Senate chamber.\n\n“It must be egghausting sending so many bills to Gen Sub instead of doing the work people sent us here to do,” the House Republican Caucus wrote in a social media post late Tuesday.\n\nSenators didn’t find the stunt funny.\n\n“This would be a lot more compelling if these guys didn’t think ‘the work people sent us here to do’ was arming teachers, locking up juveniles, and bullying moms w/the temerity to hold up paper signs,” said Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville. “But sure enough, we should be doing more real work around here.”\n\nWednesday morning, Faison wrote an email apologizing to members of the Senate GOP, obtained by The Tennessean.\n\n“Members, I have offended you with my actions yesterday and I want to offer you my sincerest apologies,” he wrote. “My only intention was to provide some levity while we are dealing with some very serious matters. It was not funny at all.”\n\n“You should be apologizing to the moms that were unjustly removed!” responded Sen.

The body is set to return for a floor session at 2 p.m., and Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, R-Franklin, has filed resolutions to adjourn as early as today.\n\nWithout passage of a companion bill in the Senate, any legislation passed in the House is also essentially barred from moving forward.

The other would allow more than 27,000 full-time employees at Tennessee's colleges the ability to bring their guns on campus. Both bills are just the latest pieces of gun legislation expected in Tennessee's ongoing legislative session, which began last week.\n\nOn Friday, Rep. David Byrd, R-Waynesboro, introduced a bill that would allow public and private school boards to decide whether to allow someone with a valid gun permit in Tennessee to carry a handgun while on school property or while traveling with students.\n\nBill allows suits over gun-free zone incidents\n\nByrd's bill would allow someone to carry a handgun on school property or in school vehicles while being used \"for educational, recreational, athletic or other purposes.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe legislation requires a handgun owner, who must have a valid permit, to first notify a school official of the person's desire to carry a weapon. The school board could allow open carry, concealed carry or both. The school board would also have to create a list of those approved to carry a handgun and provide it to law enforcement.\n\nIn addition to Byrd's legislation, a new bill introduced by Rep. Andy Holt, R-Dresden, would allow all full-time employees of Tennessee colleges and universities to carry a handgun on campus.\n\nIf approved, that would mean all 11,527 full-time employees at the University of Tennessee and 15,985 employees in the Tennessee Board of Regents system, which oversees 46 institutions across the state, to carry a weapon on college property, if they have a valid permit.\n\nHolt said the legislation is a preventative measure.\n\n“I could name off four or five shootings that have happened on college campuses,” he said Friday. “I’m sick and tired of the trend.”\n\nHolt said because criminals — like mass shooters — don’t follow the law, it is necessary to allow people on college campuses the ability to exercise their Second Amendment rights.\n\nHe said mass shooters “recognize these gun-free zones are a place where they can run rampant and roughshod.”\n\nSen. Mike Bell, R-Riceville, who plans on introducing the Senate version of Holt’s bill, said his main reason for backing the legislation is different.\n\n“It is for personal protection,” said Bell, who has also introduced a bill to allow private K-12 schools and higher education institutions in Tennessee to set their own policy on carrying handguns on campus and in their buildings.\n\nBill would allow private schools to allow guns on campus\n\nBell said he began receiving emails from employees who expressed a desire to carry a weapon on campus after he listened to a state Senate Education Subcommittee hearing on campus safety issues in October .\n\n“One female professor said she feared for her own safety when she was walking to and from her car at night,” he said.\n\nBut Bell agreed with Holt that allowing university employees to carry weapons could also prevent campus shootings.\n\n“The knowledge that there could be a weapon in that building could be a deterrent to somebody that could do that,” he said.\n\nCollege security officials have previously criticized calls for arming faculty and staff on the state’s college campuses. In December, chiefs of police from the University of Memphis and Roane State Community College spoke against the potential of allowing civilians to carry guns on campus.\n\nRoane State Police Chief Tom Stufano said it could “potentially create catastrophic issues” that could hinder reaction time for officers responding to a shooting on campus.\n\nCampus police speak out against guns on campus\n\nBell said he fully expects law enforcement to oppose the bill.\n\n“The fears of chiefs of police and law enforcement officials are unfounded,” he said, noting that officials have frequently opposed previous efforts expanding gun owners' ability to bring weapons in areas such as bars.\n\nBill Persinger, executive director of public relations and marketing at Austin Peay State University, said the school is also opposed to the guns on campus legislation.\n\n\"The administration at Austin Peay State University is of the opinion that firearms do not enhance the freedom of thought or learning at a university campus,\" he said. \"Austin Peay’s professionally trained police are trained by the state and provide a robust security to campus.

Ron DeSantis, who previously promised that \"before I am done as governor, we will have a signature on\" permitless carry or what supporters call a \"constitutional carry\" bill.\"\n\nBut how, exactly, would permitless carry change Florida's existing gun laws?\n\nPermitless carry:Florida lawmakers move to let gun owners carry without permit in 'Constitutional Carry' bill\n\nConcealed carry, immigration, bathrooms:8 controversial Florida laws go into effect July 1\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nWhat does permitless carry or 'constitutional carry' mean?\n\nUnder permitless carry legislation, a person who legally owns a firearm may carry it in public, visibly or concealed, at almost any time or place, without training, registration or government licensing. Simple as that.\n\nPermitless carry debate:A look at gun law changes being considered across the U.S.\n\nThe fight for and against guns:Many states were already advancing new gun rules this year, even before recent mass shootings\n\nUnder 'constitutional carry' laws, can anyone carry a gun wherever they want to?\n\nNot quite. And the laws vary from state to state.\n\nFirst and foremost, you must be legally allowed to carry a firearm under state law. Age, criminal history, location, residency and other restrictions may still apply.\n\nSome states may keep restrictions on carrying firearms or other weapons other than handguns and may ban firearms at locations such as polling places while voting is taking place, government meetings open to the public, county courthouses, etc. Private property owners still may choose to ban firearms on their property.\n\nThere are federal laws against carrying firearms, even with a permit, in federal courthouses, buildings, the sterile area of an airport, national cemeteries, military bases unless you are on-duty military police or have exemptions, post offices, Native American reservations or tribal colonies, and other federally controlled locations.\n\nSome states with permitless carry laws also may allow businesses, healthcare facilities or educational institutions to limit firearms on the premises, although supporters have pushed for limiting public universities from restricting firearms on campuses on the grounds that public possession of firearms could help stop a mass shooting.\n\nPermitless carry laws, called \"constitutional carry\" laws by supporters, also have been called \"unrestricted carry.\"\n\nIs permitless carry, what supporters call 'constitutional carry,' the same as 'open carry'?\n\nNo, although there is overlap. A quick primer:\n\n\"Open carry\" means you can publicly carry a legally owned firearm that is kept in plain sight or partially concealed, usually holstered. Some states require a separate permit or license for this, most do not. Three states — California, Illinois and Florida — currently ban open carry.\n\n\"Concealed carry\" means you can publicly carry a legally owned firearm that is hidden from view. Concealed carry is currently legal in all 50 states but some states, such as Florida, require special training and a license before it is allowed.\n\n\"Permitless carry\" allows both, without permits, licensing or training.\n\nU.S. Concealed Carry:Concealed carry states\n\nIs 'constitutional carry' the same as 'Right-to-Carry'?\n\nRight-to-Carry (RTC) laws refer to the entire class of legislation allowing legal firearm owners to carry concealed weapons, either without a permit or with one in states with requirements for them. Permitless carry laws would be the same idea taken a step further. \"Constitutional carry\" has become the favored term of supporters for permitless carry in discussions of concealed carry laws, possibly because it's catchier and adds an emotional, patriotic impact.\n\nPermitless carry has been a prime priority for the National Rifle Association, said group spokesperson Lars Dalseide.\n\n“NRA believes this is an important piece of legislation as Americans should not have to pay fees and taxes and get a license to exercise their right to self-defense and to defend their loved ones outside their home,” Dalseide told USA Today.\n\nWhat are Florida's gun laws now?\n\nFlorida does not require a permit or license to buy a gun and does not require registration — you must be a resident 21 or older unless you are a law enforcement or corrections officer or are in military service — but you do need a license to carry a concealed weapon. There are restrictions on gun ownership for people convicted of a felony, dishonorably discharged, adjudicated mentally defective or involuntarily committed to treatment, convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor or other conditions recognized by the state.\n\nThere is no limit on the number of firearms you can own or buy in a single transaction. Background checks are required and there is a three-day waiting period, although individual counties and cities may extend them up to five days.\n\nFlorida firearms:What you need to know about buying a gun in Florida\n\nFishing while packing:Florida allows openly carrying guns when fishing, camping, hunting\n\nOpenly carrying a gun is illegal in Florida. It's a second-degree misdemeanor with a $500 fine or a maximum of 60 days in jail, with exemptions for law enforcement, corrections officer, game wardens, forest officials, military, guards, members of firearms clubs while at gatherings or traveling to and from them, people on firing ranges, people who manufacture firearms while they're on the job, and anyone \"engaged in fishing, camping, or lawful hunting or going to or returning from a fishing, camping, or lawful hunting expedition,\" according to Florida Statute 790.25, which has led to some Second Amendment supporters organizing gatherings of armed fishermen in highly public places.\n\nApart from that, Florida is one of only five states that do not allow guns to be carried visibly, even for those holding licenses, according to U.S. Concealed Carry. (State law provides exceptions for legal hunters.)\n\nYou may not currently carry a concealed weapon in Florida without a state license.\n\nHow would gun laws change in Florida if a 'constitutional carry' bill passes?\n\nA bill filed Jan. 30, \"Concealed Carry of Weapons and Firearms Without a License\" (HB 543), would allow concealed loaded guns anywhere without permits. The proposal makes no change to current laws limiting display of sidearms or long guns, so-called \"open carry,\" or requirements to purchase a gun.\n\n“Florida led the nation in allowing for concealed carry and that extends today as we remove the government permission slip... to exercise a constitutional right,” said Renner\n\nFlorida’s concealed weapons permitting, no longer required her under the proposed bill, would continue for residents who may want permits to allow them to carry their concealed weapons to other states under reciprocity agreements.\n\nUnder current law, residents applying for a concealed weapons permit must undergo firearms training and clear a background check to show they are not convicted felons or fall under a host of other restrictions. That also would no longer be required in Florida.\n\nThe proposal is set to go before lawmakers during the session that begins in March.\n\nA previous bill, 2021's \"Carrying of Firearms Without Licenses,\" bill (HB 103) sponsored by Rep. Anthony Sabatini, R-Howey-in-the-Hills, attempted to make all open and concealed carry legal with no restrictions. The bill did not progress but that may have been because of the involvement of Sabatini, who has criticized DeSantis in the past and whose other bills have stalled.\n\nPro-2A legislation:Florida gun rights advocates hopping mad about seemingly stalled 'constitutional carry' bill\n\nMomentum is building for permit-free gun carry in Florida:Does that mean open carry, too?\n\nWhy do people support permitless 'constitutional carry' laws?\n\nSupporters believe that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution does not allow for any restrictions on gun rights, including the right to carry or bear arms. They believe that criminals would not abide by regulations in any event, and such restrictions only hinder a citizen's ability to defend themselves. Open and concealed carry, they argue, would result in less gun violence as criminals would avoid areas where people were armed.\n\n\"Half the country now rightfully recognizes the fundamental right to carry a firearm for self-defense as enshrined in our Constitution — as opposed to a government privilege that citizens must ask permission to exercise,” said Jason Ouimet, the executive director of the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, in a recent statement.\n\n'Armed Floridians are safe Floridians':Gun rights advocates rally at Capitol to push for 'constitutional carry' in Florida\n\nBattle in the courts:Gun rights groups' wave of lawsuits could change America's relationship with firearms\n\nWhy do people oppose permitless 'constitutional carry' laws?\n\nOpponents believe that reduced restrictions on firearms will lead to even more gun violence in a country marked with regular mass shootings and high suicide rates, and fear that fewer regulations will result in more firearms getting to people who would not otherwise be legally allowed to own them. They generally believe that the U.S. Constitution clearly specifies \"a well-regulated militia\" in the Second Amendment and not completely unrestricted gun ownership, and some believe that the Founders did not anticipate the much deadlier weaponry available now.\n\n“This is absurd political pandering from the Governor of a state that has experienced some of the worst mass shootings in our country’s history and in a nation where we have the highest rates of gun violence in the world,” said Democratic Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, who is running for her party’s gubernatorial primary nomination to run against DeSantis in November. “It’s an insult to the memories and families of every victim of gun violence. We should be passing laws to prevent gun violence and working to fix our state’s affordable housing crisis, not creating chaos to score political points.”\n\nEven some Second Amendment supporters are wary of vague or wide-open permitless carry legislation. Florida GOP Chair and State Sen. Joe Gruters said he might support permitless carry, but thought the image of assault weapons openly carried on the beach might \"adversely affect Florida's tourism economy.\"\n\nWhat does the general public think of gun restriction laws?\n\nRecent polls show support for tougher gun laws remains high: More than two-thirds of Americans support stricter gun laws, according to a 2021 poll by USA TODAY/Ipsos. While 9 out of 10 Democrats support tougher restrictions, only a third of Republicans share that view.\n\n\"There may be a sense among gun rights supporters that now is the time to go on the offensive,\" said Eric Ruben, an assistant professor at Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law and co-author of a Second Amendment lawsuit study. \"Now, there are more (judicial) opinions getting written ... that are conveying a broader view of gun rights.\"\n\nDemocrats call for limits on guns:As Democrats press for national gun control, GOP states move to expand firearm access\n\nWhich states allow permitless carry?\n\nAs of this writing, 25 states either allow legal firearm owners to carry a loaded, concealed firearm without a permit or have just passed legislation to allow it that will soon go into effect: Alabama (effective January 1, 2023), Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana (effective July 1, 2022), Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota (residents only; concealed carry only), Ohio (effective June 13, 2022), Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee (handguns only), Texas, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\n\nThe rest, including Florida, require some form of permit to possess a weapon in public places.\n\nTexas permitless carry:Gov.

Chris Todd, R-Madison County, questioned the authority of a Department of Safety legislative director and a uniformed THP colonel who both testified to safety concerns with the bill.\n\nThough Rep. Rusty Grills, R-Newbern, is sponsoring HB 1005, Todd presented it in the House Civil Justice Subcommittee on Tuesday. Todd and supporters on the committee argued Tuesday its a constitutional right to bear any arms, and language in the current Tennessee code is too limiting.\n\nThe bill seeks to change references to \"handgun\" to \"firearm,\" which opponents argued is too broad.\n\nTodd briefly berated Elizabeth Stroecker, legislative director for the Department of Safety, and THP Col. Matt Perry, after Stroecker confirmed they were testifying with the express permission of Gov. Bill Lee's office.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"It's appalling to me to have you guys come here to represent the governor of this great state opposing legislation, it really is beyond the pale,\" Todd said.\n\nStroecker confirmed to lawmakers the proposed bill would allow anyone to carry a firearm such as a semi-automatic assault-style rifle down Broadway or outside the Capitol building. The proposed bill would also delete significant portions of the code, Stroecker said, that do things such as allow employers to ban handguns from company vehicles.\n\nThe week in politics:Two testy exchanges with lawmakers got our attention. Here's why.\n\nRelated:What happened when the Vanderbilt student trolled the gun show in Las Vegas\n\n\"Simply changing everything in the code from handgun to firearm is a safety concern,\" Stroecker said.\n\nPerry expressed concerns about the \"worst case\" scenarios for law enforcement interacting with people openly carrying \"high-capacity\" weapons.\n\n\"Because of constitutional carry, we can't ask them who they are, what they're doing, why they have it, we just have to let it happen, Perry said. \"It makes us extremely reactionary.\"\n\nTodd's back-and-forth with Stroeker led House Majority Leader Rep. William Lamberth, R-Portland, to come to the witnesses' defense.\n\n\"These folks are here doing their job. They're doing what they've been asked to come here to do,\" Lamberth said. \"If we have a specific issue with the message, we're welcome to take it up with the commissioner who has 40-plus years of law enforcement experience.\"\n\nThe concealed carry bill in among several gun bills making the rounds this session, including:\n\nLowering enhanced or concealed carry age requirements\n\nTodd is spearheading another effort to allow 18- and 19-year-old residents to carry handguns without a permit in HB 1158.\n\nTodd's bill may be a moot point following recent developments in a federal lawsuit.\n\nLee in 2021 signed a \"constitutional carry\" bill into law, which allows people 21 and older to carry handguns openly or concealed without a permit, along with members of the military ages 18 to 20. The law was immediately challenged in court by gun rights advocates.\n\nAt the time, neither Lee nor Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge, signaled they wanted to lower the age limit.\n\nBut under a deal struck last month by Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, the state agreed to lower the age limit to 18. The settlement is still pending a judge's signature.\n\nNew gun law:Gov. Bill visits gun factory to tout new Tennessee constitutional carry bill\n\nGuns on college campuses\n\nA proposed bill, SB 827, would allow enhanced permit carriers to bring their handgun on college campuses. Sen. Joey Hensley, R-Hohenwald, is sponsoring the measure.\n\n“Currently, college students can carry a weapon up until they step foot on campus,” said Hensley. “But this bill would ensure that eligible college students can carry a firearm to defend themselves on campus. All people have a right to defend themselves. Students on college campuses should be no different.”\n\nHensley took criticism this week for language initially filed with the bill, which would have allowed law enforcement to carry their service weapons while intoxicated. But that was simply Hensley's caption bill, a legislative quirk that allows lawmakers to file placeholder bills before amending them with full legislation.\n\nGuns on school grounds\n\nHB 1202 would allow a school faculty or staff member to carry a concealed handgun on school grounds. Rep. Ryan Williams, R-Cookeville, is sponsoring the measure.\n\nOnly staff with law enforcement experience would be eligible, and they must complete 40 hours of school policing training. The bill would require prior authorization from school administrators and notification to local law enforcement.\n\nReach Melissa Brown at mabrown@tennessean.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/05/06/tide-begins-shift-gun-safety-debate/83850814/", "title": "Tide begins to shift in gun safety debate", "text": "Kathleen Chandler Wright\n\nThis session, a measure involving background checks became law with overwhelming, bipartisan support.\n\nA new bill would force Tennessee colleges and universities to allow full-time employees to carry guns on campus.\n\nThe proposal is overwhelmingly opposed by the people who live and work in college communities.\n\nOn April 16, 12-year-old Jajuan Latham was shot and killed in Knoxville after attending a basketball game held in honor of his slain cousin, Zaevion Dobson. Zaevion’s death made national headlines after he died shielding three friends from gunshots. And now gun violence has hit his family again, in yet another senseless shooting.\n\nIn the aftermath of any shooting, shock and anger can give way to cynicism. We are told that nothing can stop gun violence. But a different picture is emerging in Tennessee and across the country. The tide is shifting.\n\nA few weeks ago, members of the Tennessee chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, part of Everytown for Gun Safety, visited our Capitol to discuss legislation that could reduce gun violence in Tennessee. The volunteers talked about how we could prioritize the safety of Tennesseans while respecting the Second Amendment. These conversations never would have happened just two years ago. It’s clear that the norms surrounding gun violence prevention and public safety are shifting.\n\nThis legislative session, a common-sense measure supported by Moms Demand Action volunteers in Tennessee became law with overwhelming, bipartisan support. The new policy, which passed with support from law enforcement, requires state law enforcement to inform local authorities when a domestic abuser subject to a final order of protection illegally tries to buy a gun and fails a background check. This legislation is great news for our state, as 83 percent of Tennesseans know that strengthening background checks can prevent gun violence.\n\nLawmakers passed that common-sense legislation — and they didn’t stop there. They continued to work across party lines to stop a bill that would have dismantled the state’s concealed carry permitting system and another that would have allowed some violent felons to possess firearms almost immediately after serving their sentences.\n\nI’m hopeful that Gov. Bill Haslam will continue the momentum by vetoing another dangerous bill that would force Tennessee colleges and universities to allow full-time employees to carry guns on campus. Proponents of the bill claim it’s a way to keep schools safe, but there’s strong evidence that guns on campus do not make campuses safer, and the proposal is overwhelmingly opposed by the people who live and work in college communities, including the law enforcement officials charged with keeping our campuses safe. We have to trust those who know our schools and campuses best to determine the most effective ways to keep colleges safe. We need the governor to veto HB 1736 / SB 2376.\n\nTennessee lawmakers have proven that they listen to the concerns of citizens, community leaders and law enforcement when it comes to preventing gun violence. They have to keep hearing us. For Jajuan and Zaevion, it’s too late. But we must keep working together to reduce gun violence. There is so much more we can do.\n\nKathleen Chandler Wright is a volunteer with the Tennessee chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, part of Everytown for Gun Safety.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/10/tennessee-special-session-on-public-safety-guns-see-the-bills-legislation-so-far/70558637007/", "title": "Tennessee special session on public safety, guns: See the bills so far", "text": "Lawmakers have filed more than 100 bills for consideration during a special legislative session beginning Aug. 21.\n\nThroughout the summer, Gov.

If they choose not to get a permit, they must pass a background check when buying a gun from a federally licensed dealer.\n\nSupporters say many Iowans will still apply for permits so they can carry their weapons out of state.\n\nThe new law only applies to handguns. Under current Iowa law, purchasing and carrying a long gun — like a shotgun or rifle — does not require a permit.\n\nPermits to acquire a handgun cost $25. Permits to carry cost $50 and can be renewed for $25. The permits are valid for five years.\n\nCurrently, Iowans must be 21 years or older to obtain a nonprofessional permit to carry or acquire a handgun. Iowans 18 and older can obtain a professional permit if they need one for their job.\n\nIowans will be able to open carry or concealed carry without a permit\n\nUnder current law, Iowans can carry handguns openly or concealed if they have a permit. The new law means that someone in legal possession of a firearm will be able to carry it openly or concealed without a permit.\n\nOpponents: Eliminating permits creates background check loophole for private sales\n\nIowans will no longer have to obtain a permit before acquiring a handgun through sales between private citizens.\n\nCurrently, under Iowa and federal law, there are no background checks for private handgun sales at the point of sale. But Iowa's current law requires handgun buyers to first obtain a permit to acquire or a permit to carry, which requires them to pass a background check.\n\nOpponents of the new law say the permitting process ensures people purchasing handguns in private sales have undergone a background check in the past, when they got their permit. The new law eliminates that safeguard by making permits optional, they argue.\n\nWhen buying a gun from a federally licensed dealer, Iowans will either have to pass a background check or present a permit to carry or acquire.\n\nFor subscribers:From abortion to 'defunding' police, here are the bills that are alive and dead in the Iowa Legislature so far\n\nStronger penalties for selling handguns to people barred from owning them\n\nIt will become a Class D felony to sell, rent or loan a gun to a person that the seller \"knows or reasonably should know\" is prohibited from owning firearms. That crime is punishable by up to five years in prison upon conviction.\n\nRepublicans have said the increased penalty will be a deterrent to illegal or questionable sales. Democrats say it will be difficult to prosecute anyone unless there was clear proof the seller knew they were selling a handgun to someone who was legally barred from owning one.\n\n'Constitutional carry' states that allow concealed carry without a permit\n\nIn addition to Iowa, at least 15 states already allow concealed carry of handguns without a permit, according to the U.S. Concealed Carry Association and Everytown for Gun Safety. Two of those, North Dakota and Wyoming, allow permitless carry only for their own residents.\n\nWhich states recognize Iowa's carry permits?\n\nOn top of states that do not require permits, several states and territories recognize permits issued by Iowa, allowing Iowans to legally carry their handguns when traveling to those states.\n\nIn all, 36 states and territories, including Iowa, either recognize Iowa permits to carry or do not require permits to carry firearms.\n\nTennessee is expected to join that list soon. The Tennessee Legislature has passed a bill that would allow adults 21 or older to carry handguns without obtaining a permit. Gov. Bill Lee's spokesperson has said he will sign it.\n\nHow many federal background checks were conducted in Iowa last year?\n\nIn 2020, there were 270,614 background checks conducted in Iowa through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which is operated by the FBI. That's the most of any year dating to 1999, according to NICS data.\n\nFederal background checks in Iowa are on pace to break that record in 2021, with 34,313 checks conducted in January, 30,572 in February and 32,870 in March.\n\nHow many gun permits were issued in 2020?\n\nUnder current Iowa law, sheriffs are required to issue permits to Iowans who request them unless the applicants are barred by law. Before issuing those permits, sheriffs run background checks.\n\nIn 2020, Iowa law enforcement issued 85,986 nonprofessional permits to carry weapons and 14,960 permits to acquire pistols and revolvers, according to data provided by the Iowa Department of Public Safety. Those numbers were higher than in the previous three years.\n\nIn 2021, as of March 23, law enforcement had already issued 41,568 permits to carry and 2,638 permits to acquire.\n\nThe Polk County Sheriff's Office issued 9,145 carry permits in 2020, an 80% increase over the prior year.

Currently, only on-duty officers are allowed to do so.\n\nEmergency medical care providers who work with law enforcement tactical teams will be allowed to obtain professional permits to carry firearms if they complete training.\n\nLandlords who receive federal rental assistance funds will be prohibited from banning lawful gun ownership or possession by tenants.\n\nPeople who are barred from owning a gun under current law will remain banned, and the law states that a person does not have the right to carry a firearm if they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol, in possession of drugs or if they are committing a crime.\n\nThe law requires courts to report to a state law enforcement database when someone is determined to be ineligible to possess a firearm for mental health reasons, in addition to reporting that information to the federal background check system. And it expands what Iowa reports to the federal background check system about people who are ineligible to possess firearms under state law.\n\nStephen Gruber-Miller covers the Iowa Statehouse and politics for the Register.

Bill Haslam's views on a topic align more with the Democratic gubernatorial nominee than the Republican running to succeed him.\n\nBut that is the case when it comes to how Bill Lee and Karl Dean, the nominees for the GOP and Democratic Party, respectively, approach some gun policy issues.\n\nHaslam last week doubled down on previous remarks in which he called for \"sensible\" changes in Tennessee.\n\n\"It's beyond the next governor. Anything you're going to do, you obviously have to get the legislature to come along with you,\" he told reporters after an event in Nashville.\n\n\"I've always said I think there's some sensible first steps you can do, from looking at the age on assault weapons to ... having a more thorough background check.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTENNESSEE ELECTIONS: Complete coverage\n\nLee thinks there's no need for bolstering background checks. He also thinks teachers should be armed and would support reducing or eliminating fees to get a gun permit.\n\nDean favors banning bump stocks — devices that drastically increase a weapon's rate of fire. He supports changing the age to buy assault-style rifles from 18 to 21 and opposes arming teachers.\n\nBackground checks\n\nIn an interview last week, Lee didn't answer a question about raising the age to buy a gun.\n\n\"I don’t think that we should look at more restrictions and more regulations on gun ownership,\" Lee said when asked about strengthening background checks.\n\nLee did stress the need to regulate gun ownership by people who have a mental illness.\n\n\"I think we can find a way to address gun ownership of the mentally ill and yet protect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens at the same time,\" he said.\n\nDean said in an interview last week that banning bump stocks, increasing the purchasing age for assault-style weapons to 21 and bolstering the state's background check system were \"reasonable proposals.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that our goal — we could all agree that we want to keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous people,\" he said.\n\n\"And that if we can somehow succeed in terms of our background information to remove firearms from those who have criminal records, may have a mental illness issue, may have a history of domestic violence or have had court orders against them for a variety of things, that would make the state a safer place.\"\n\nArming teachers\n\nDean and Lee differ on teachers carrying guns.\n\nLee said the proposal was an important way to protect children.\n\n\"We need to do whatever it is that we can to protect children, whether that is school resource officers, retired military or arming a teacher that is willing to be part of the solution,\" he said.\n\nDean said he thought teachers didn't want to have guns in classrooms and doing so would raise additional issues.\n\n\"Having a whole bunch of weapons around a school, how they are stored, how they are used, creates lots of questions, lots of fears,\" he said.\n\nPermit fees and constitutional carry\n\nThe candidates disagree on allowing Tennesseans to carry a weapon without having to first obtain a permit, commonly known as constitutional carry.\n\nTennessee law requires most residents to take a safety class before they can obtain a permit. The law should not change, Dean said.\n\n\"I think you’ve got to have a permitting process, and I would not be in favor of constitutional carry,\" Dean said.\n\nLee said he would sign legislation allowing gun owners to carry guns without needing a permit.\n\nThat is different than his position in October when asked a similar question from WPLN, Nashville's public radio station.\n\nWhen asked if he thought Tennesseans should be able to carry a handgun without getting a permit, Lee said, \"I don't. Primarily because I'm a guy who's listening to law enforcement and what they believe, and law enforcement is very much against that.\"\n\nBoth candidates agreed that they would be open to reducing gun permit fees.\n\nGuns at colleges\n\nAllowing students on college campuses to carry guns is another point of contention.\n\nLee's website says the state's current law allows a 21-year-old employee at a university to carry a weapon but not a 28-year-old student who is a veteran.\n\n\"Picking and choosing who gets to have rights based on their status as a student is not the way the Constitution is supposed to work,\" he says on the website.\n\nDean says his opposition ultimately comes down to students' safety.\n\n\"I think that detracts from public safety, that would be my concern, and I would believe that the vast majority of people who actually run universities and run colleges would agree with me on that,\" he said.\n\nIn 2016, Haslam allowed a measure to become law that lets full-time faculty, staff and other employees at public colleges and universities with valid permits to carry guns on campus.\n\nLegislation to allow students to carry guns on college campuses in Tennessee has failed in recent years.\n\nReach Joel Ebert at jebert@tennessean.com or 615-772-1681 and on Twitter @joelebert29.\n\nWHERE DO THEY STAND:Karl Dean and Bill Lee's stance on key issues\n\nSUPPORT LOCAL JOURNALISM: Nobody covers state politics like the Tennessean.

The governor's proclamation only mentions firearms briefly.\n\nLee will not push for an extreme risk order in his administrative bill package, despite his insistence over the summer that he would pursue the legislation. The session's parameters would allow a lawmaker to pitch a similar proposal, though it would face an uphill battle to passage.\n\nThe official proclamation sets the legal parameters for what lawmakers can consider in the session, which is expected to last around a week but could go longer.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nMental health major theme of Lee's legislative package\n\nLee pledged to specifically support mental health reforms, a mental health coverage waiver and promoting safe storage of firearms, though he is blocking any legislation that would implement penalties related to safe storage laws.\n\n“As our nation faces evolving public safety threats, Tennessee remains vigilant and is taking continued action to protect communities while preserving the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens,” Lee said in a statement.\n\n“In the months leading up to the public safety special session, we have listened to Tennesseans and worked with members of the General Assembly to identify thoughtful, practical measures to strengthen public safety across our state, including steps to support law enforcement, address mental health, prevent violent crime and stop human trafficking. I thank the General Assembly for its continued partnership and look forward to achieving meaningful results for Tennesseans.”\n\nLee's administrative package includes:\n\nCodifying his executive order dealing with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and background checks.

She said she was hoping for a \"serious discussion about gun reform in Tennessee.\"\n\n\"The number of firearms in our state is staggering and has been since we passed the open carry and guns in trunks laws. But simply focusing on safe storage alone does not truly solve the problems we face in this state and that our constituents were begging us to debate after the Covenant school shooting in Nashville and the Prive restaurant shooting in Memphis this past March,\" she said.\n\n\"The dangers that our families and schoolchildren face today frighten me, as they do most Tennesseans.\"\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus Chair John Ray Clemmons, D-Nashville, said the governor \"wilted in the face of the legislative supermajority.\"\n\n\"The winners here are special interests and extremist legislators holding our state hostage,\" he said in a statement. \"The clear losers are Tennessee families and school children. The ire of Tennessee families who want and deserve substantive action and policies to better protect our children and neighborhoods from the looming threat of gun violence should be squarely aimed at the GOP supermajority and its leadership in both houses. They have utterly failed our families. Our children deserve better.\"\n\nOverall call broad, includes host of topics\n\nThe overall call for the special session includes only two items directly address firearms, with Lee specifically blocking any legislation that creates penalties for \"failing to safely store firearms.\" Lawmakers can also consider temporary orders of protection, known as extreme risk proposals or red flag laws, a legal procedure to block dangerous persons from accessing firearms in emergency situations.\n\nThe 18 topics lawmakers can consider:\n\nMental health resources, providers, commitments, or services;\n\nSchool safety plans or policies;\n\nHealth care providers' duty to warn about potential violent offenses;\n\nOffenses of committing acts of mass violence or threatening to commit acts of mass violence;\n\nReports from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation regarding human trafficking;\n\nIdentification of individuals arrested for felonies;\n\nLaw enforcement's access to criminal and juvenile records;\n\nLaw enforcement's access to information about individuals who are subject to mental health commitment;\n\nInformation about victims of violent offenses;\n\nStalking offenses;\n\nMeasures encouraging the safe storage of firearms, which do not include the creation of penalties for failing to to safely store firearms;\n\nTemporary mental health orders of protection, \"which must be initiated by law enforcement,\" include a due process hearing and cannot permit ex parte orders, a proposal Lee previously pitched in April;\n\nTransfer of defendants 16 and older to courts with criminal jurisdiction;\n\nLimiting the circumstances in which juvenile records may be expunged;\n\nBlended sentencing juveniles;\n\nOffenses related to inducing or coercing a minor to commit an offense;\n\nThe structure or operations of state or local courts;\n\nAppropriation authority to fund any special session legislation.\n\nA group of lawmakers have met this summer behind closed doors to hash out potential legislation for the upcoming session and share feedback with Lee's leadership team, The Tennessean confirmed last month. Lee's office also solicited public feedback on gun reform and safety issues and has been meeting with lawmakers at the Executive Residence.\n\nAmong the thousands of submissions, the majority supported some form of additional gun safety legislation, mirroring polling trends that indicate bipartisan support for reforms.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have been vocally opposed to Lee's spring proposal for an extreme risk protection order. It's unclear if Lee will attempt to bring a similar proposal later this month amid continued pushback among his party and firearm-rights groups that encourage Lee to call off the special session altogether.\n\nLee first pitched his proposal in April, just a few weeks after the Covenant shooting as a direct response to the tragedy, saying \"Tennesseans deserve a vote\" on the policy, which would allow the courts to remove firearms from those considered a danger to themselves or others.\n\nThe governor committed repeatedly throughout the summer to push forward with the proposal, despite very little public support from members of his own party. Only seven lawmakers had publicly shared support for the bill.\n\nAs recently as late July, Lee expressed hope that the bill would pass.\n\n“You know, whenever you bring a piece of legislation, you certainly hope that it does,” Lee said. “But that’s up to the General Assembly.”\n\nRepublicans resistant to the measure say ERPOs, sometimes referred to as \"red flag\" laws, don't afford individuals due process, despite Lee's proposal outlining a full court hearing where an individual could get free legal representation.\n\nRepublicans have so far suggested proposals ranging from tax incentives for safe gun storage to the involuntary commitment of those facing mental health issues. Democrats, who will have no power under the GOP supermajority to pass contentious bills without bipartisan backing, have urged the governor to specifically focus the session on firearm issues.\n\nCovenant families and connected advocates have also been lobbying lawmakers over the summer, with a number of grassroot community groups backing a combination of extreme risk, safe gun storage and additional background check laws.\n\nReach Melissa Brown at mabrown@tennessean.com and Vivian Jones at vjones@tennessean.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/08"}]}

Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nLondon CNN Business —\n\nShares of Netflix (NFLX) are imploding after the company reported its first quarterly loss of subscribers in more than a decade, far underperforming expectations and worrying investors that had been betting that a handful of big tech companies would continue to grow at a rapid clip.\n\nWhat’s happening: Netflix’s stock dropped 30% when the market opened on Wednesday, instantly wiping more than $45 billion off the value of the company.\n\nNetflix said it shed 200,000 subscribers in the first three months of the year, when it had been expecting to add 2.5 million.\n\nThe streaming giant, whose stock had already dropped more than 40% year-to-date, blamed the attrition on increased competition for viewers and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNetflix said its decision to pull out of Russia cost the company 700,000 subscribers. But the economy isn’t helping, either.\n\nInflation is forcing households to reevaluate their budgets. People in Great Britain canceled about 1.5 million streaming subscriptions in the first three months of 2022. More than a third did so to save money, according to a new report by media consultancy Kantar.\n\n“Food and energy are people’s priorities right now, not watching ‘Stranger Things,’” CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson told me.\n\nNetflix signaled it could make big changes to its business as it tries to stem the bleeding. It’s taking another look at how to address password sharing. CEO Reed Hastings also told analysts that the company will consider a lower-price subscription option with advertising.\n\n“I’ve been against the complexity of advertising and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,” Hastings said Tuesday. “But as much as I’m a fan of that, I’m a bigger fan of consumer choice.”\n\nBig picture: Hewson said the stock plunge shows that Netflix was extremely overvalued, as investors — flush with cash during the pandemic recovery — fed a huge rally. Shares of Netflix rose 86% from the end of 2019 through 2021, while the S&P 500 climbed 48%.\n\n“They were assuming people were going to be locked down forever,” Hewson said, adding that unlike Apple and Amazon, Netflix doesn’t have many alternative sources of revenue.\n\nClearly, the market mood has changed. The strong reaction could set the stage for another turbulent earnings season, with investors already on edge after disappointing results from the big banks.\n\nWhen companies reported fourth quarter results earlier this year, Netflix and Facebook experienced huge stock losses as investors signaled growing sensitivity to downbeat predictions for the future. That was because the Federal Reserve was set to start raising interest rates, a move that would weigh on high-growth companies. Facebook’s disastrous results triggered the biggest loss in market value for an S&P 500 company on record.\n\nNow, rates are officially on the rise, and there’s daily debate about whether the Fed could be even more aggressive than expected. The war in Ukraine is also dragging down sentiment. That could tee up big swings for top stocks as they disclose results.\n\nAttention turns to Tesla earnings\n\nInvestors have been spending a lot of time following CEO Elon Musk’s ploy to buy Twitter. But come Wednesday evening, attention will turn back to a company he already controls.\n\nTesla (TSLA) reports first quarter results after markets close. Analysts have strong expectations, my CNN Business colleague Chris Isidore reports.\n\nThe electric carmaker’s earnings are forecast to jump 142% from a year ago. Other traditional automakers, such as General Motors, Ford, Toyota and Volkswagen are all expected to report a drop in earnings due to supply chain problems and production issues.\n\nWatch this space: Musk joined the call with analysts last quarter. Will he be on this time around?\n\nIf he isn’t, that could feed Wall Street’s worries that he’s too busy trying to take Twitter private to deal with his management responsibilities. If Musk does dial in, there could still be risks, given his tendency to speak off the cuff.\n\nAnother point of focus will be lockdowns in China, which have affected Tesla’s production in Shanghai. Credit Suisse analysts estimate that the recent shutdown there prevented the manufacture of 90,000 vehicles.\n\nShareholders will want to know if the plant can stay open given restrictions, and how suppliers of critical parts such as batteries are faring.\n\nInvestor insight: A lot is riding on Tesla’s performance. Disappointing results could further disrupt a stock market that’s already unsteady.\n\nGas prices are creeping higher again\n\nPrices at the pump have stopped falling from their recent highs — and some forecasters are warning of another uptick as the summer driving season looms and the war in Ukraine drags on, my CNN Business colleague Matt Egan reports.\n\nAfter a slow-but-steady decline, the national average price for regular gasoline bottomed out at $4.07 a gallon last week, according to AAA. Since then the national average has increased five days in a row, climbing to $4.11 a gallon on Wednesday.\n\nIt’s the first increase in gas prices since early March, when turmoil in energy markets hit a crescendo following the invasion of Ukraine. And it dashes hopes that the national average would drop to $4 a gallon, taking pressure off inflation that’s running at the fastest pace in 40 years.\n\n“It isn’t going down anymore,” said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil. “This is terrible news for inflation.”\n\nPreviously, Lipow had been forecasting a return to $4 gas. But he abandoned that call because of renewed concerns about Russia’s oil supplies and a pop in gasoline futures, a major driver of wholesale and retail prices.\n\nUp next\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) reports results before US markets open. SL Green Realty (SLG), Tesla (TSLA), Alcoa (AA) and United Airlines (UAL) follow after the close.\n\nAlso today: US existing home sales for March arrive at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nComing tomorrow: Earnings from American Airlines (AAL), AT&T (T) and Snap (SNAP).", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/04/20"}]}

The week prior, sick dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas tested positive for bird flu. Bird flu was later reported in a Michigan dairy herd that included cows transported from Texas. Cattle in New Mexico and Idaho are also presumed to be positive for the disease, officials said.\n\nThe only symptom reported by the Texas patient was pink eye, or conjunctivitis, according to an update April 1 from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOfficials say the risk to public health remains low. They note that there are steps people can take to curb the spread of the potentially dangerous virus. The events in Texas, they say, raise future concerns about how the bird flu virus evolves.\n\n\"This is definitely an evolving situation,\" Dr. Diego Diel, director of Cornell University's virology laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which worked to sequence the virus, told USA TODAY. \"Right now, I think the viruses that have been detected in cattle and in other animals in these farms don't contain any mutations that would indicate increased transmissibility or pathogenesis to humans.\"\n\nBut if the virus is being transmitted from cow to cow, Diel stressed, it's important to continue monitoring the virus in the long term to see whether there are potential mutations that could cause spillover into other species, including humans.\n\nCDC says cases rising:What to know about meningococcal disease\n\nHow does bird flu spread?\n\nBird flu primarily spreads through contact with infected birds. Most cases in humans have occurred after a person had unprotected exposure to sick or dead infected animals.\n\nAvian flu viruses infect birds’ respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, which causes them to shed the virus via their saliva, mucous and feces, the CDC said. Humans and other mammals can get it when they get enough virus in their eyes, nose, or mouth or inhale it into their lungs.\n\nPeople who have close contact or unprotected contact for long periods are at greater risk of infection. The disease can cause mild upper respiratory issues or severe illness, including pneumonia and multiple organ failure that leads to death.\n\nIn the U.S., the disease tends to spread from wild birds. However, outbreaks in commercial poultry or backyard flocks that led to deaths have been reported in 48 states since February 2022.\n\nCan cats get bird flu?\n\nOfficials identified the latest bird flu cases in unpasteurized milk from sick cattle at dairy farms in Kansas and Texas, in addition to a positive throat swab of a cow at another Texas dairy farm. This spread to cows is believed to be the first for the species. The other species caught the virus directly from wild birds: cats.\n\nCornell researchers believe the virus was transmitted to Texas dairy cows through contaminated water and other food sources from infected birds migrating through the area. The virus then likely spread among cows who were near each other or the birds, however, there isn't yet definitive proof of this, said Diel, who is an associate professor of virology.\n\nIn early March, Dr. Elisha Frye, an assistant professor of practice at Cornell's Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, received a call about an outbreak among Texas dairy herds of a disease of unknown origin. Samples of milk and manure and nasal swabs from the cattle showed bird flu was present. Researchers also found evidence of bird flu in the testing of dead birds and one of three cats found dead at the dairy facilities around the same time.\n\n\"It was kind of the same timeline as when we found it in the cattle samples, but it did kind of link it together,\" Frye told USA TODAY. \"The birds, the cat and milk from the cows all having the same pathogen in them made sense at the time for that being the main cause of illness.\"\n\nHow do humans get bird flu?\n\nIt's rare for humans to be infected with bird flu. The only other human case in the U.S. occurred in 2022, in a person incarcerated in a Colorado prison who was exposed to poultry infected with avian flu.\n\nOn Tuesday, the CDC said the current public health risk is low, and there is no person-to-person spread of bird flu so far. That is a vital measurement that would prompt concern for the spread of the disease.\n\nThere remains an increased risk for poultry, livestock and farmers and workers in these sectors, as well as veterinarians, veterinary staff and first responders who respond to cases, officials said.\n\nOzempic and Wegovy:Weight-loss drugs cost $1,000 a month but less than $25 to make. Why do we pay so much?\n\nDo eggs carry bird flu? What about dairy products?\n\nFood production officials have been taking steps to prevent the distribution of milk or eggs from infected animals. Cooked eggs and pasteurized milk, in general, should be safe for consumers.\n\nLast week, the largest U.S. chicken egg supplier reported positive tests for bird flu at its facility in the Texas Panhandle. In a news release, Cal-Maine Foods said production at the Panhandle facility stopped temporarily, following protocols to prevent bird flu set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Personnel at the company killed about 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 young hens to curb the spread of the virus.\n\nThere isn't as simple of a solution to reduce the risk of bird flu since the eggs can carry the virus, so the traditional method has been to destroy products and kill the poultry, said Diel, of Cornell.\n\nAmong dairy cows, milk from animals suspected or confirmed to have the virus is being removed from human food supplies. However, even if milk from infected cows makes it to the commercial milk supply, pasteurization effectively inactivates bacteria and viruses, including influenza, according to a March 29 joint news release from the CDC, USDA and the Food and Drug Administration. In addition to protecting against bird flu, pasteurization is central to other health efforts. The FDA says that unpasteurized raw milk can have microorganisms dangerous to human health.\n\nDr. Meghan Davis, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former dairy veterinarian, said it’s important to note differences among industries in poultry and cattle, and how the virus gets treated: Chicken culling, or killing, has been a steadfast way to curb disease spread, whereas this is a first for cattle, and it appears cows aren’t getting as sick.\n\nShe said people are at risk if they consume raw milk and cheese or live near an area with intensive dairy production.\n\nThe spread among cows is a red flag for public health officials and veterinary care professionals. But Davis said she was encouraged by the fact that the person with bird flu only had mild eye problems and the cows had mild symptoms.\n\n“If that’s the worst we see, then that’s good,” she said. “But we don’t yet know.\"\n\nHow can bird flu be stopped?\n\nThe latest developments are reminders for Americans to take standard precautions when storing, cooking and consuming food, said Darin Detwiler, a professor of food policy at Northeastern University, who has advised the USDA and FDA on food safety. The recommendations include frequent hand-washing when preparing food, properly cooking eggs and meat and reducing consumption of unpasteurized dairy products.\n\nDetwiler believes consumers should be proactive if they have concerns about outbreaks.\n\n\"That's our power as consumers that are stakeholders in this,\" he told USA TODAY. \"We don't have to wait until we're harmed to voice our support or concern over some of these issues.\"\n\nOther ways to avoid contracting bird flu include eliminating unprotected exposure to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry or domesticated birds, or other sick or dead wild or domesticated animals. This includes contact with animal feces, waste, or materials contaminated by animals suspected or confirmed with bird flu.\n\nPeople working directly with animals who could be infected should wear personal protective equipment such as face masks – ideally approved particulate respirators such as N95 masks, as well as goggles, gloves, boots and boot covers. Additionally, they should use fluid-resistant coveralls and disposable head covers or hair covers.\n\nPeople who have spent time near animals confirmed or suspected of being sick should be monitored for signs and symptoms for 10 days after the exposure. This includes those who were wearing PPE.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/04/24/bird-flu-pasteurized-milk-fda/73436237007/", "title": "Bird flu virus found in pasteurized milk, FDA says its safe to drink", "text": "Fragments of the virus that causes bird flu have been found in samples of pasteurized milk, the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday, but officials aren't concerned about danger to humans from drinking store-bought milk at this time.\n\nOfficials told reporters on Wednesday that the milk tested positive for presence of the virus, but the results do not indicate that the virus is currently infectious, as the pasteurization process works to inactivate viruses.\n\nThe initial positive samples came from a limited number of tests done by researchers on milk at grocery stores. Federal agencies are now doing their own, more robust tests. The FDA said it is conducting further analysis on the positive samples, and is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state partners to investigate.\n\n\"To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" Donald Prater, the acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the FDA, told reporters.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials announced a new federal order that will require all dairy cattle to be tested for bird flu before being transported across state lines. Any cows that test positive will have to wait 30 days and retest before being moved, said administrator for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Michael Watson.\n\nThe avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has recently infected herds of dairy cows in several states, including Texas, Kansas and Michigan. Herds in New Mexico and Idaho are presumed infected, officials said.\n\nBoth the FDA and the USDA said the current commercial milk supply is safe because of the pasteurization process and the \"diversion or destruction of milk from sick cows.\"\n\nThe agency pledged to take the situation seriously and release results from multiple studies in the coming days or weeks.\n\nCan cats get bird flu?How to protect them and what else to know amid the outbreak\n\nWhat is bird flu?\n\nAvian influenza, or bird flu, is a disease that's caused by an avian influenza Type A virus infection, according to the CDC.\n\nThe disease primarily spreads through contact with infected birds, which can infect their respiratory tract and intestines, according to the CDC. Infected birds can shed viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions and feces. Bird flu is very contagious among birds, and some of the viruses can sicken or kill certain domesticated species, including chickens, ducks and turkeys.\n\nIs anyone at risk from drinking milk?\n\nPasteurized milk — which makes up 99% of milk produced on dairy farms and sold in stores — is treated to make sure any viruses in the milk are dead. Experts say drinking this kind of milk is safe, even if fragments of bird flu have been found in some samples.\n\nHowever, raw milk does not receive this treatment.\n\nIs raw milk safe to drink?\n\nThe FDA says people should not drink raw milk. The agency also says the dairy industry shouldn't manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products, including cheese made with raw milk, from any cows showing symptoms of illness or exposed to other cows that have bird flu.\n\nHow did virus fragments get into milk?\n\nWhile the pasteurization process is designed to make milk safe by inactivating viruses, it doesn't destroy the virus fragments.\n\n\"It's important to understand that fragments, such as genetic material, of those pathogens can still be found in pasteurized milk,\" Prater said. Still, \"pasteurization is very likely to effectively inactivate heat-sensitive viruses, like H5N1 in milk from cows and other species.\"\n\nOfficials said Wednesday that current studies on how effectively pasteurization kills off bird flu virus are underway, but the process has proven effective in similarly acting viruses for decades, and thermal inactivation has been successful at inactivating bird flu in eggs, which occurs at a lower temperature than in milk.\n\nThe FDA and its partners are testing samples of milk from store shelves and conducting further analysis on any that show they have bird flu virus to ensure that the virus fragments are inactive, Prater said. Those results will be available in the coming days, he said.\n\nWhat is pasteurization?\n\nNamed after the scientist Louis Pasteur, pasteurization is a treatment process that applies heat to liquids for short amounts of time, according to the Virginia Department of Health. The process destroys pathogenic microorganisms in some foods and beverages that can cause spoilage and prolongs storage time.\n\nPasteurization was adopted by the FDA as a public health measure to kill dangerous bacteria and viruses, and largely eliminates the risk of getting sick from milk. In 1987, the FDA prohibited the interstate sale of raw, or unpasteurized milk.\n\nCan humans get bird flu?\n\nThere have been a few cases of humans being infected with various strains of bird flu, usually through close contact with sick or dead animals. But experts say the risk to humans is currently low because the disease has not mutated to spread person-to-person.\n\nThere have been two human cases in the U.S. tied to this strain of bird flu. Among them: On April 1, Texas health officials said a person became infected with bird flu after close contact with infected cows. The CDC said the only symptom reported by the patient was pink eye, or conjunctivitis.\n\nPublic health officials told reporters that 23 people have been tested for bird flu during the current outbreak among cattle and 44 people are being actively monitored after suspected exposure.\n\nOfficials say risk to public health remains low. The CDC says most cases in humans have occurred after a person had unprotected exposure to sick or dead infected animals. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said \"we have not observed changes to the virus' genetic makeup that would suggest an enhanced the ability to spread to humans or among humans.\"\n\n\"This is definitely an evolving situation,\" Dr. Diego Diel, director of Cornell University's virology laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which worked to sequence the virus, previously told USA TODAY. \"Right now, I think the viruses that have been detected in cattle and in other animals in these farms don't contain any mutations that would indicate increased transmissibility or pathogenesis to humans.\"\n\nContributing: Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/04/08/can-cats-get-bird-flu-what-to-know/73250075007/", "title": "Can cats get bird flu?

The CDC still has the current health risk of bird flu listed as \"low.\"\n\nResearchers investigating the dairy farm infections in Texas did discover, however, that cows and one human were not the only mammalian victims of the recent outbreak: three cats found dead at the facilities prompted some further investigation into the spread.\n\nCan cats contract bird flu and is your beloved pet at risk? Here's what to know.\n\nVirus spreading:Bird flu outbreak is an 'evolving situation.' Here's what to know about symptoms, spread.\n\nCan cats get bird flu?\n\nThe short answer? Yes, cats can contract bird flu if they interact with infected birds.\n\nBird flu is primarily considered a transmission risk between wild birds and domestic birds; the recent presence of bird flu in dairy cows in Kansas and Texas is believed to be a first for the species.\n\nResearchers at Cornell University believe the affected Texas dairy cows were infected via water and food sources contaminated by wild birds migrating through the area. It was then likely spread between cows in close quarters, though that's not yet a definitive conclusion.\n\nDr. Elisha Frye, an assistant professor of practice at Cornell's Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, was called to the affected dairy farm in March to investigate the deaths of cows, birds and cats at the facility. Frye determined the presence of the illness in the cows using milk samples, manure and nasal swabs.\n\nTesting was also done on dead birds found on the farm, as well as one of three cats found dead at the facilities around the same time. All the tests turned up evidence of the presence of bird flu.\n\n\"It was kind of the same timeline as when we found it in the cattle samples, but it did kind of link it together,\" Frye previously told USA TODAY. \"The birds, the cat and milk from the cows all having the same pathogen in them made sense at the time for that being the main cause of illness.\"\n\nHave cats been affected by bird flu in the past?\n\nThe CDC has records of sporadic mammalian outbreaks of the bird flu in the past, impacting both wild animals like foxes and bears, as well as pets like dogs and cats. Officials believe these cases are caused by the animals consuming infected birds and poultry.\n\nIn 2004, an outbreak in domestic animals including cats and dogs was reported in Thailand, and another outbreak impacting pets occurred in Germany and North America in 2006. The organization says humans contracting the virus from their pets is very rare and unlikely but has happened as a result of prolonged, unprotected exposure.\n\nIn 2016, a veterinarian in New York City contracted bird flu from repeated exposure to sick cats without protective gear. The vet suffered mild flu symptoms.\n\nSigns your pet may be sick\n\nThe likelihood of your cat contracting bird flu is minimal. However, it can happen if your cat is often outside and ends up eating or getting too cozy with an infected bird, or hangs out in a contaminated environment.\n\nIf you suspect people or animals in your home have been around a sick or dead bird, you should monitor them closely for these signs:\n\nFever or feeling feverish/chills\n\nCough\n\nSore throat\n\nDifficulty breathing/shortness of breath\n\nConjunctivitis (eye tearing, redness, irritation, or discharge from eye)\n\nHeadaches\n\nRunny or stuffy nose\n\nMuscle or body aches\n\nDiarrhea\n\nHow to prevent the spread of bird flu\n\nAvoiding exposure in the first place is the most effective way to stop the spread, says the CDC.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/04/19/world-health-organization-bird-flu-vaccine-concern/73382389007/", "title": "Bird flu, lack of vaccine prompt 'great concern' for top WHO official", "text": "World Health Organization’s top scientist said this week the recent bird flu outbreak is of “great concern” to public health, and vaccine development to halt the virus is “not where we need to be.”\n\nThe virus, known as Type A H5N1, which typically circulates among poultry and wild birds, has spread to mammals, including cows, cats and at least two people in the U.S. in recent years. The new development experts are eyeing is that the virus is now passing from mammal to mammal.\n\nBird flu has a high mortality rate in the hundreds of people who've contracted it, Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist at WHO, the United Nations health agency, told reporters on Thursday.\n\nDairy cows, worker:Bird flu outbreak is an 'evolving situation.' Here's what to know about symptoms, spread.\n\nU.S. health officials say the country is ready to ramp up vaccine production if the risk of bird flu rises. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current risk to public health remains low.\n\n\"It's too early to press the panic button,\" Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University and a leading expert in global health, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe nightmare scenario, he explained, is if the virus makes a genetic leap and begins human-to-human transmission. This would be worse than the COVID-19 pandemic given how infectious and deadly the virus is, he said.\n\nWhile no human-to-human transmission has occurred, Farrar, of WHO, expressed concern about recent U.S. cases showing bird flu cases among cattle in several states and a Texas dairy worker. The infection has started to become a pandemic among animal species, he said at a news conference.\n\n“The great concern, of course, is that in doing so – and infecting ducks and chickens, but now increasingly mammals – that that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans,” he said. “And then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission.”\n\nFarrar also flagged his concern that vaccine development is not “where we need to be” and public health officials don’t currently have the capability to diagnose H5N1.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response said its National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS) program is equipped to respond rapidly to influenza strains as they evolve.\n\n“NPIVS works closely with industry partners to make and test updated vaccines that match new strains of influenza viruses with pandemic potential as they emerge, while at the same time, supporting manufacturing capacity to allow for large-scale vaccine production if needed,” the statement said.\n\nThere are two antigens that are “well-matched” to the circulating strain of H5N1, the federal agency said. The agency said hundreds of thousands of doses of vaccine could be deployed within weeks, pending regulatory action by the Food and Drug Administration. Within months, federal officials could deploy more than 100 million doses.\n\nBut Gostin, of Georgetown, said he doubts that's realistic. While the U.S. is comparatively better, the world lacks the capacity to ramp up hundreds of millions or billions of vaccines for a pandemic with bird flu. And even if the vaccine initially matches virus strains, the virus mutates quickly. He also noted that public health systems lack the ability for early detection and testing of bird flu.\n\n\"For many, many decades, these avian and swine influenzas have stayed within the animal kingdom,\" Gostin said. \"The hope and the expectation is that it will continue to do that. But one day, that virus will mutate and go to a human, and then spread to a global pandemic very, very quickly. And we have to be ready for that day.\"\n\nBird flu in dairy cows in eight states, recent human case\n\nEight states experienced recent bird flu outbreaks in dairy cows beginning in late March in Texas. The U.S. Department of Agriculture believes migratory birds were the source of the infection in cows. The virus then spread from herd to herd, experts believe, suggesting there has been transmission among mammals. Genomic sequencing of the viruses taken from infected cattle indicates this virus is not more transmissible to humans, the USDA said.\n\nOn April 1, Texas health officials said a dairy worker was infected with bird flu after close contact with sick cows. The worker – the second person in the U.S. to get bird flu since 2022 – had symptoms of conjunctivitis or eye redness.\n\nBird flu spreads primarily through contact with infected birds, including sick or dead animals. Human cases are rare. Most occur in people who've had unprotected exposure to sick animals. The risk is heightened for people who work with infected poultry or livestock, and for veterinarians who treat infected animals.\n\nOn Thursday, the WHO said it also updated its terms on airborne diseases for the next expected pandemic. Consulting with health agencies in the U.S., Africa, China and Europe, health officials are opting for “infectious respiratory particles” instead of “aerosols” or “droplets” to avoid confusion about particle sizes, the U.N. said. This can better coordinate responses to respiratory pathogens, Farrar, of WHO, said.\n\nKaren Weintraub contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/state/2024/04/03/cal-maine-eggs-bird-flu-texas-panhandle-parmer-county-chickens-avian-flu/73194218007/", "title": "Bird flu reported at Cal-Maine Foods, largest egg producer in US, in ...", "text": "Nearly 2 million chickens were culled at a Cal-Maines Food plant, which is the largest producer of eggs in the nation, in the Texas Panhandle, after reports confirming a case of highly pathogenic avian flu in a chicken.\n\nThe killing of the chickens comes after recent reports of the first-known case of bird flu in cattle about two weeks ago and the first human infection in Texas of this strain of bird flu, reported earlier this week.\n\nHere's what we know about the ongoing outbreak:\n\nConfirmed bird flu case at Cal-Maines Food in Parmer County\n\nTexas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller confirmed a positive test for avian flu at the Cal-Main Foods, Inc. poultry facility in Farwell.\n\nConsequently, the company was obligated to cull 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets, which make up approximately 3.6% of the company's total flock as of its most recent report on March 2.\n\nThe facility has temporarily halted production as the company implements protocols prescribed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, according to a release.\n\n\"This is absolutely devastating news for Cal-Maine and the entire Panhandle region which has already suffered so much already,\" Miller said in a release. “Given this latest development, all producers must practice heightened biosecurity measures. The rapid spread of this virus means we must act quickly.\"\n\nWhat is bird flu, or avian flu?\n\nThe most recent outbreak of avian flu, also known as bird flu, was first identified in Europe in late 2020. Although the strain has existed for several decades — first identified in waterfowl in Southern China in 1996, according to the CDC — it has escalated in recent years. Symptoms of bird flu include:\n\nLoss of appetite, lethargy\n\nDeath without prior symptoms\n\nEyelid swelling\n\nTwisting of the head and neck\n\nPurple discoloration to body parts, including legs\n\nHow many animals has the bird flu affected in Texas this year?\n\nThe current virus has caused the deaths of more than 82 million animals globally, making it the poultry industry's most significant blow since a previous major outbreak resulted in the deaths of over 50 million birds between 2014 and 2015.\n\nThe flu has affected 82.04 million poultry and nearly 10,000 wild birds, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, sporadic cases have been reported in mammals, including livestock such as cattle and goats, as well as skunks.\n\nIn 2024, Texas has seen outbreaks that have affected:\n\n1,894,101 commercial poultry in Parmer County, reported Tuesday\n\n15 noncommercial backyard poultry in Deaf Smith County, reported March 21\n\n246 noncommercial backyard poultry in Moore County, reported March 11\n\nWild birds might have infected Texas cows\n\nAs of Wednesday, there were reportedly seven dairy herds in Texas with cases of the virus. Officials from the Agriculture Department suspect that migrating wild birds infected the cattle, because farms have reported finding dead wild birds on their properties.\n\nThere are also cases in two dairy facilities in Kansas, one facility in Michigan and one in New Mexico.\n\nClose contact with infected cattle is likely cause for human case in Texas\n\nThe recent case marks the first human case of the highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in Texas and the second in the U.S since the onset of this particular strain, H5N1, in 2020. Authorities at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories said last week that there is no risk of transmissibility to humans, but the Texas-based individual was reportedly in close contact with the dairy cows that tested positive for bird flu in late March.\n\nFederal and state health authorities are currently investigating the infection. However, according to a news release, the risk to the general public remains relatively low, and human-to-human transmission is rare.\n\nWill the bird flu outbreak affect milk or egg supply?\n\nCurrently, there is no concern regarding the safety of the commercial milk supply or the potential risk the outbreak might pose to consumer health. The USDA mandates that dairies must send only milk from healthy animals for human consumption processing. Milk from affected animals is being diverted or destroyed and does not enter the supply for human consumption.\n\nFurthermore, pasteurization, which is a requirement for commercial milk, has a historical track record of effectively deactivating bacteria and viruses, such as Influenza.\n\nAs for egg products, it's possible that the mass culling of poultry will affect the egg supply. As is the case with dairy, there is no risk for human consumption.\n\n\"The current risk to the public remains minimal,” Miller stated in the release. \"It is important for us as an industry to maintain a high level of vigilance.

According to the CDC, LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, and HPAI cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds.\n\nBird flu has cost the government roughly $660 million and in recent times raised the price of eggs and poultry. At least 58 million birds were slaughtered last year to limit the spread of the virus.\n\nBird flu spread to humans is low risk, USDA says\n\nThe first case of avian influenza in a person in the United States was reported in Colorado in April 2022.\n\nFederal and state health authorities are investigating the outbreaks, and the USDA said the risk to the general public contracting is low as the viruses have only rarely been transmitted from person to person.\n\n\"However, people with close contact with affected animals suspected of having avian influenza A have a higher risk of infection,\" Texas health officials wrote in a news alert earlier this week.\n\nBird flu symptoms in humans\n\nHuman infection with the bird flu can happen during close contact with infected birds or when people touch sick birds or their saliva, mucus and feces, the CDC said. People contract the virus when it gets into a their eyes, nose or mouth, or when it is inhaled.\n\nThose who contract the virus often experience mild illnesses including an eye infection and upper respiratory symptoms or no symptoms at all, while others can develop a severe sometimes fatal disease like pneumonia.\n\nEscape on horseback goes south:Video shows suspect trying to outrun police on horseback before being caught\n\nWhat are signs of bird flu?\n\nIndications a bird may be infected with avian influenza include:\n\nLoss of appetite, lethargy\n\nSudden death without prior symptoms\n\nEyelid swelling\n\nTwisting of the head and neck\n\nPurple discoloration to body parts including waddle and legs\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

Another 20 commercial operations are under surveillance, she said.\n\nThe facilities being tested are a mixture of turkey and egg-laying operations, Carson said.\n\nMore:Nearly 1 million egg-laying hens will be destroyed in Iowa's third outbreak of bird flu\n\nState and federal agencies said none of the birds nor any poultry products from flocks where avian influenza is detected will reach U.S. food supplies. No human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been detected in the United States.\n\nThe first infections in Buena Vista County were reported March 6 at a commercial facility with nearly 50,000 turkeys.\n\nIn addition to the Buena Vista County facilities, Iowa has experienced two other outbreaks. Officials confirmed the first one March 1, when a backyard flock of 42 chickens and ducks tested positive, and another about a week ago at a facility with about 920,000 laying hens in Taylor County in southwestern Iowa.\n\nState officials have quarantined a six-mile-wide circle around the infected Buena Vista County egg-laying operation and is restricting movement in and out of as well as within it.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster declaration for Buena Vista County after the first outbreak, enabling the state agriculture department and other agencies to help track, monitor and contain the disease.\n\nCarson said the state sees no link between the latest outbreak and the others in the state.\n\nThe virus can wipe out a flock within 48 hours.\n\nIowa officials have said they believe wild birds, in which highly pathogenic avian influenza is widely prevalent, are the likely source of the disease. Iowa is part of the Mississippi flyway, a migration route for millions of birds each year.\n\nIowa agriculture leaders urge flock owners to prevent contact between their birds and wild ones and to report sick birds or unusual deaths to state or federal officials.\n\nDonnelle Eller covers agriculture, the environment and energy for the Register.

The individual was reportedly in close contact with the dairy cows that tested positive for bird flu about a week ago, according to USA TODAY.\n\nIn a news release Monday, the Texas Department of State Health Services said that the patient became \"ill following contact with dairy cows presumed to be infected with avian influenza\" and that their primary symptom was conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye.\n\nIs bird flu contagious in humans?\n\nThis is the first human case of the highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in Texas, and the second in the U.S. Last week, authorities with the National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed there was no risk of transmissibility to humans.\n\nWhile federal and state health authorities are investigating the infection, the release stated that the risk to the general public is still relatively low and that human-to-human transmission is rare.\n\n\"Avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses have only rarely been transmitted from person to person,\" authorities said in the release. \"As such, the risk to the general public is believed to be low; however, people with close contact with affected animals suspected of having avian influenza A(H5N1) have a higher risk of infection.\"\n\nMore:First cases of bird flu in cattle found at Texas and Kansas dairy farms, officials say\n\nWhat is bird flu, or avian flu?\n\nThe most recent outbreak of avian flu, also known as bird flu, was first identified in Europe in late 2020. Although the strain has existed for several decades — first identified in waterfowl in Southern China in 1996, according to the CDC — it has escalated in recent years.\n\nThe virus has led to the deaths of approximately 57 million animals, marking the poultry industry's largest hit since another major outbreak claimed the lives of more than 50 million birds in 2014-2015.\n\nSymptoms of bird flu include:\n\nLoss of appetite, lethargy.\n\nDeath without prior symptoms.\n\nEyelid swelling.\n\nTwisting of the head and neck.\n\nPurple discoloration to body parts, including legs.\n\nWild birds may have infected Texas cows\n\nAccording to a recent report from USA TODAY, the highly contagious pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) was discovered in unpasteurized clinical milk samples from one cow and in a swab from another dairy cow in Texas last week. The virus was also found among cows at two dairy farms in Kansas.\n\nOfficials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture suspect that wild birds infected the cows, as farms have reported finding dead wild birds on their properties. Earlier this month, the Texas Animal Health Commission declared an outbreak in two backyard, non-commercial flocks in Moore and Deaf Smith counties, both situated in the Panhandle, totaling over 260 birds.\n\nWill the bird flu outbreak impact milk supply?\n\nCurrently, there is no concern regarding the safety of the commercial milk supply or the potential risk the outbreak might pose to consumer health. The USDA mandates that dairies must send only milk from healthy animals for human consumption processing. Milk from affected animals is being diverted or destroyed and does not enter the supply for human consumption.\n\nFurthermore, pasteurization, which is a requirement for commercial milk, has a historical track record of effectively deactivating bacteria and viruses, such as Influenza.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/02"}]}

It was removed twice in 2016 but quickly put back into circulation, the indictment says.\n\n\"The ride was never properly or fully designed to prevent rafts from going airborne,\" the indictment said.\n\nThe water park and Tyler Austin Miles, 29, a former operations director at the park, were indicted Friday on involuntary manslaughter and several other charges in Caleb's death. The indictment alleges that a company co-owner and the designer of the Verruckt rushed it into use and had no technical or engineering expertise related to amusement park rides.\n\nThe charges come after a 19-month investigation into the death of Schwab, the son of Kansas Rep. Scott Schwab. The raft he was in went airborne, hitting a pole and netting designed to keep riders from being thrown from the ride.\n\nThe indictment says a video shows Caleb was following all rider instructions when he died.\n\nThe death seemed like an isolated accident until whistleblowers from Schlitterbahn revealed that experts who examined the slide found evidence indicating other rafts had gone airborne and collided with the overhead hoops and netting before the fatality, according to the indictment.\n\nThe ride complied with \"few, if any\" longstanding safety standards established by the American Society for Testing and Materials, and corporate correspondence found that \"the child's death and the rapidly growing list of injuries were foreseeable and expected outcomes,\" according to the indictment.\n\nInvestigators found 13 injuries to others during the 182 days the ride operated, including two concussions and one case where a 15-year-old girl went temporarily blind.\n\nA spokeswoman for Schlitterbahn did not immediately return a request for comment after the indictment against the company was unsealed.\n\nThe other charges in the indictment include aggravated battery and aggravated endangering a child. Miles was indicted on two counts of interference with law enforcement and Schlitterbahn was indicted on one count of interference with law enforcement.\n\nThe ride was created after Schlitterbahn co-owner Jeffrey Wayne Henry made a \"spur of the moment\" decision in 2012 to build the world's largest water slide to impress the producers of a Travel Channel show. The indictment says Henry's desire to \"rush the project\" and his and his designer's lack of expertise caused them to \"skip fundamental steps in the design process.\"\n\nThe indictment also said not a single engineer was directly involved in Verruckt's engineering or slide path design.\n\nMiles pleaded not guilty Friday during a brief court appearance. His attorneys asked that his bond be reduced to $15,000 from $50,000 but that request was denied. A trial was scheduled for Sept. 10.\n\nMiles allegedly avoided or delayed repairs that would take Verruckt out of commission during the active park season and the ride's brake system failed 10 days before Caleb's death, investigators said. He also is accused of telling a police detective that he was unaware of any complaints about the ride and of withholding \"thousands\" of incriminating daily reports from lead lifeguards and supervisors.\n\nSchlitterbahn, which is based in Texas, said in a statement after charges against Miles were announced that it was \"deeply disappointed to learn any individual is being personally charged for the terrible accident on Verruckt.\n\n\"Our review of the facts and circumstances of the accident has never shown any evidence of criminal conduct on the part of anyone,\" spokeswoman Winter Prosapio said.\n\nScott Schwab and his attorney, Mike Rader, didn't immediately respond Friday to a request for comment.\n\nThe waterslide has been closed since Caleb's death. Schlitterbahn has said it will dismantle the ride when the investigation into the boy's death is complete.\n\nCaleb Schwab's family reached settlements of nearly $20 million with Schlitterbahn and various companies associated with the design and construction of the waterslide. The two women who rode with Caleb suffered serious injuries and settled claims with Schlitterbahn for an undisclosed amount.\n\nBefore the boy's death, Kansas law allowed parks to conduct their own annual inspections of rides. Lawmakers last year nearly unanimously approved stricter, annual inspection requirements for amusement park rides that set qualifications for the inspectors and required parks to report injuries and deaths to the state.\n\nBut only weeks later, lawmakers passed a follow-up bill delaying the enforcement of criminal penalties for operating a ride without a state permit until this year. And this year, the Senate and a House committee have approved legislation to lessen regulation for \"limited use\" rides at events like county fairs and exempt some amusements, such as hayrides, from regulation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/06/30/adventureland-iowa-death-accident-lawsuit-michael-jaramillo/7774220001/", "title": "What to know about the deadly 2021 Adventureland accident", "text": "Nearly a year after an 11-year-old Iowa boy died in an accident at Adventureland in Altoona, his family has filed a lawsuit against the amusement park.\n\nMichael Jaramillo died early July 4, 2021, the day after a raft carrying him and his family on the park's Raging River ride capsized.

Yet the clinics billed insurance for treatments that supposedly lasted much longer.\n\nLower your auto insurance costs: Find the best car insurance of 2023\n\nCharow works as a private investigator with Commerce Township-based Jane Doe Investigations. It is one of more than a dozen investigation firms across Michigan that insurance companies hire to catch suspected no-fault fraudsters in the act.\n\n“We’re out there to just get the truth,\" said Jane Doe's CEO Jane Boudreau. \"People do get hurt in accidents. But people take advantage of it, and that’s the unfortunate part.”\n\nFraudulent claims contribute to the high price of auto insurance in Michigan because insurance companies pass along the cost of these claims to consumers in the form of higher premiums.\n\nIt is estimated that one out of 10 no-fault insurance claims in Michigan is fraudulent, said Dyck Van Koevering, general counsel for the Insurance Alliance of Michigan, an insurance industry group.\n\nThere have been no recent studies concerning the total amount of auto insurance-related fraud in the state. However, the Insurance Alliance has said that no-fault fraud and abuse are likely costing the average Michigan family hundreds of dollars a year in additional insurance premiums.\n\n\"We think fraud is a serious problem in Michigan,\" Van Koevering said. \"Rates are a function of losses, and to the extent that fraud increases losses, it inflates the premium that is paid by the next guy.”\n\nMichigan is considered a lucrative environment for auto insurance fraud as the only state in the nation requiring motorists to buy potentially unlimited medical benefits as part of their insurance.\n\nMichigan also has lacked a dedicated, statewide auto insurance watchdog. Even though critics, as well as defenders, of no-fault have voiced support for a fraud authority, past proposals to establish one were often tucked into controversial legislation for overhauling the entire insurance system.\n\nIn September, Gov. Rick Snyder signed an executive order to set up an Anti-Fraud Unit within the Department of Insurance and Financial Services. The four-person unit is tasked with investigating insurance and financial-sector fraud.\n\n“Fraud in the system drives up the cost of insurance for all Michiganders, and we need to do everything we can to eradicate it,” the governor said at the time.\n\nHire a PI\n\nNo-fault fraud typically takes the form of unnecessary medical expenses and dishonest claims for the system's unique benefits, such as lost wages and the opportunity for relatives or friends of accident victims to earn $14 an hour or more providing in-home \"attendant care.\" An extra $20 per day is also available for doing the injured person's household chores.\n\nPrivate investigators sometimes covertly trail these caregivers if an insurance company suspects that not all of the attendant care and chores that are billed are actually being done.\n\nRead more:\n\nFree Press report: Why does auto insurance in Detroit cost so much?\n\nDetroit car insurance: Why Cleveland has it way cheaper\n\nOhio drivers pay less, get less for auto insurance than in Michigan\n\nAlthough many insurers operate their own in-house special investigation units, they also contract with private firms such as Jane Doe Investigations, Sherlock Investigations in Clinton Township and Superior Investigative Services in Milford for specialized work that can include daylong stakeouts or following someone with hidden cameras.\n\nInvestigation firms generally cost between $60 and $100 an hour, although smaller operations may charge less.\n\nWhen a person is caught in a potential no-fault fraud, insurance companies may attempt to cut off his or her benefits or compel them into a settlement. Insurers can also refer cases to local prosecutors as insurance fraud is a felony in Michigan punishable by up to four years in prison and $50,000 in fines.\n\nBut insurance companies seldom pursue individual-level fraud because the cases are generally viewed as too small and not worth the time or money to pursue, according to attorneys who represent insurers.\n\nInsurers prefer to instead go after medical clinics that they suspect are operating large-scale no-fault patient mills.\n\nNevertheless, no-fault fraud at the individual level can result in bills to insurance totaling tens of thousands of dollars per claim.\n\nCaught at the amusement park\n\nThe Free Press, in a review of auto accident-related lawsuits in Wayne County Circuit Court, found numerous no-fault claims that were upended by private investigators and undercover surveillance.\n\nIn one case, a 34-year-old Sterling Heights woman claimed that she needed eight hours a day of insurance-paid attendant care, provided by her out-of-work brother-in-law, for devastating injuries from her car accident. The brother-in-law supposedly helped her get dressed, get in and out of the shower and even with the toilet, according to court documents.\n\nThe woman claimed that she couldn't walk more than 20 or 25 minutes without pain, and for enjoyment could only sit in her backyard and drink coffee or stay inside and watch TV.\n\nYet only weeks before her August 2015 deposition, an undercover investigator with Lexington-based Quest Research Group caught the woman traveling with a group to the Michigan's Adventure theme park in Muskegon.\n\nShe was photographed walking around the park for nine hours without any assistance and at times pushed a stroller. The investigator took video of her on the park's log ride, waving a hand in the air and bracing for the final plunge, court documents say.\n\nShe also went on the Sea Dragon ride and the Corkscrew roller coaster, infamous for its \"dizzying speeds and endless loops that will turn you inside out,\" according to description on the park's website.\n\nThe undercover video was devastating to the woman's lawsuit, which had sought more than $25,000 in no-fault benefits from Safeco Insurance Co.\n\n“It is impossible to believe that (she) was able to walk about an amusement park and ride roller coasters for nine hours, but just days later she was so injured that she needed help getting in and out of the shower and with toileting and getting dressed,” Michael Martinico, an attorney representing Safeco, wrote in court documents.\n\nThe woman later signed an affidavit saying that she never lied and that the surveillance video couldn't show whether or not she was in pain.\n\nHer lawsuit against the insurance company was ultimately settled for $6,709, with Safeco paying some medical bills but not the brother-in-law's attendant care services, court records show.\n\n'People take advantage'\n\nBoudreau, the founder of Jane Doe Investigations, is a former Oakland County Sheriff's sergeant and many of her investigators also have law enforcement backgrounds.\n\nInsurance companies generally don't call her firm until they suspect something fishy with a claim. About 95 percent of all the claims that Boudreau's firm investigates turn out to be fraudulent or highly questionable, she said.\n\n“We may find someone who maybe did break their leg, but now they’re healed, and now they are exaggerating it,\" Boudreau said. \"When you’re better, you are not supposed to be taking free money.”\n\nThe firm also investigates suspected workers' compensation fraud or abuse of the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n\n\"We had a case with a police officer — not in Oakland County — who was in an accident and was not transported to a hospital, but broke his foot and went on his own\" to the hospital, she said.\n\n\"We followed that person out of state on vacation, even had to partner with another investigative firm, and the person is supposed to be in a brace all the time and allegedly can't dress himself ... and we (caught) him at a Michigan State game, on his leg, standing, partying for hours before the game — no brace, he was fine,\" she said.\n\nIn a particularly egregious case, the firm investigated a mixed-martial arts fighter who claimed that he needed attendant care and suffered lasting injuries from an auto accident.\n\nHowever, the MMA fighter started posting on social media about his training regimen and urged his friends to attend his upcoming cage fight in Traverse City. A Jane Doe investigator drove up to the fight and recorded the man's dramatic first-round loss.\n\nThe fight video ultimately doomed the man's insurance claims, according to Boudreau.\n\n\"I know he was asking for over $1 million,\" she said. \"He ended up with an under $5,000 settlement; think about the money that that saved.\"\n\nGoing undercover\n\nCharow, 47, has been a private investigator since the 1990s. He has staked out countless houses, apartment buildings and businesses in all sorts of neighborhoods across metro Detroit.\n\n\"In the past 20 years, I've stared down the barrel of a gun six times and been almost carjacked once,\" he said.\n\nHe learned the basics of investigations from a long-retired Detroit Police narcotics officer.\n\n\"He showed me how to do it old-school,\" he said. \"These were guys that had a notepad and a Polaroid camera.\"\n\nThe subjects of Charow's investigations almost never realize that they are being watched or followed. When someone does notice his presence, it's usually nosy neighbors or people who wrongly assume he is there to snoop on them.\n\nHe arrives at surveillance sites with a high-zoom video camera and a readiness for anything, from 12-hour marathon stakeouts to high-speed car chases. Most car chases happen not because Charow gets spotted by the person he is watching — what PIs call getting \"burned\" — but because subjects of investigations can sometimes be crazy drivers.\n\nThe worst driver he ever encountered was a woman with three children in her car who darted in and out of highway traffic going 95 mph.\n\n\"I did end up having to let her go because I wasn't going to kill somebody that day,\" he said. \"And our clients understand that, too.\"\n\nCharow said his job isn't about \"shredding people apart\" or putting any negative spin on real injuries. Investigators like himself are paid the same regardless of what they uncover or don't uncover, he said.\n\n\"Our job is not to catch them. It is to document the truth,\" Charow said.\n\nCaught driving\n\nIn another no-fault case, undercover surveillance caught a 37-year-old Madison Heights woman driving an SUV on the same day that she was a passenger in a Troy-based medical transportation company's vehicle that drove her to and from a physical therapy appointment, according to court documents.\n\nNo-fault insurance only pays for medical transportation if a patient is too injured or disabled to drive on their own.\n\nFor each round-trip, the transportation firm billed $85 to the woman's insurer, Great Lakes Casualty Insurance Co, court documents show. The total billings between January and August 2015 came to $7,560.\n\nBut after the surveillance video emerged in court, the transportation company did not get its bills paid. The court documents don't say whether the surveillance was done by an in-house insurance company investigator or a hired firm.\n\nUnmanned cameras\n\nSuperior Investigative Services in Milford used private investigators as well as unmanned 24-hour cameras to show that a 61-year-old woman who claimed to provide in-home attendant care for a Detroit car crash victim never showed up to the home on some days when no-fault insurance was billed.\n\nSuperior's investigator staked out the crash victim's address in November 2016 and didn't spot the caregiver coming or going over two days, according to court documents filed on behalf of Farmers Insurance.\n\nHowever, the caregiver — who said she was paid $20 per hour — signed paperwork claiming to have worked both days in the home.\n\nLater, Superior set up the unmanned pedestal cameras for three days in late January and early February 2017 outside the crash victim's house and the caregiver's house, both in Detroit. The cameras never found the caregiver visiting the patient, court documents say.\n\nThe pedestal cameras were brought out again at the end of February. That happened after the crash victim's attorney allegedly emailed Farmers Insurance's attorney on Feb. 27 with attendant care paperwork for the full month — even showing services supposedly provided in the future on Feb. 28.\n\nThe investigators put up the 24-hour cameras at both residences that day to see what would happen. Once again, the caregiver never showed, according to Farmers Insurance.\n\n\"The pedestal camera systems run 24 hours per day for each day uninterrupted so that an individual cannot later claim they showed up somewhere 'after' the surveillance man (or woman) left the area — or had arrived before,\" wrote attorney Kristen Kosciolek, representing Farmers Insurance. \"The system is a foolproof way of finding out if someone is telling the truth or not.\"\n\nSurveillance fails\n\nBut surveillance efforts sometimes do fail.\n\nThat is what appears to have happened when Great Lakes Casualty brought in an undercover investigator two years ago to see whether a 33-year-old woman in Sterling Heights was still injured from an accident that occurred 17 months earlier.\n\nThe investigator — whose identity isn't disclosed in court filings — recorded footage of a person whom he or she thought was the accident victim outside an apartment complex carrying a young child while talking on a cellphone. At one point the person in the video runs across the complex's parking lot.\n\nMonths later, the insurance claimant testified that she was still too injured to do household chores and couldn't pick up her young daughter.\n\nThe insurance company's lawyers then presented the surveillance video and accused the woman of fraud.\n\nBut the woman's attorney pointed out a problem. The video actually showed the woman's neighbor in the parking lot with a child — not her.\n\nThe judge denied the insurance company's motion to end the lawsuit. The final insurance settlement last year wasn't disclosed.\n\n\"Insurance companies are attempting to engage in surveillance of claimants to avoid having to pay benefits,\" said Ali Ajrouch, a senior attorney with the Law Offices of Joumana Kayrouz, which represented the woman. \"On occasion, their investigators end up with footage of persons who are not the actual claimant. This is not the first time and probably not the last time that we will encounter such a situation.\"\n\nA Great Lakes Casualty representative did not return a message seeking comment.\n\nTime to get aggressive?\n\nCharow, the private investigator, said he believes that more aggressive prosecution of insurance fraudsters could have a strong deterrent effect.\n\nRight now, many individuals who are caught in schemes go unpunished. The worst that generally happens to them is their insurance benefits get cut off and they have to take settlements, he said.\n\n\"What happens when you catch somebody? They get a big settlement check and there are no criminal charges filed,\" Charow said. \"Start putting some penalties on this and the fraud will slow down. That's how we're going to get it to be an affordable, honest system.\"\n\nContact JC Reindl: 313-222-6631 or jcreindl@freepress.com.

Titled \"Up in Smoke: Northern New Jersey’s Worst Man-Made Disasters,\" the exhibit will be on display through April 26, 2020, at Acorn Hall on Morris Avenue in Morristown.\n\nWith the exhibit open, we combed through old newspapers to look back at six significant 20th-century disasters across Bergen, Passaic and Morris counties.\n\nMeadowlands explosion: 1917\n\nThe Kingsland explosion took place during World War I at the munitions factory in Lyndhurst on Jan. 11, 1917. The fire at the sprawling munitions plant in the Meadowlands sent hundreds fleeing from their homes under a rain of 3-inch shells.\n\nThe disaster started with an electrical fire in a shell cleaning department at the Canadian Car and Foundry munitions plant, The Record reported. It ended after about four hours and the destruction of 500,000 high explosive shells, according to Lyndhurst Historical Society records.\n\nStarting at about 3:45 p.m., the fire launched shells half a mile into Kingsland and neighboring towns in southern Bergen County. Shells tore through roofs and cars, narrowly missing civilians.\n\n“The first word to reach Hackensack was that the extensive plant had been blown up and hundreds had been killed,” The Record reported on Jan. 12, 1917.\n\nThe building was leveled. However, none of the roughly 1,700 men working on a $133 million munitions order for the Russians during World War I was killed, The Record reported.\n\nSwitchboard operator Theresa McNamara stayed during the fire, plugged into dozens of buildings and succinctly told workers to “get out or go up,” according to records kept by the Lyndhurst Historical Society, which dedicated a small park on Clay Avenue in her honor.\n\n“Not until a shell crashed through the building and barely missed her did she realize her danger,” The Record reported.\n\nThe fire and explosions caused an estimated $10 million in damage, the paper said.\n\nSome fleeing workers were hospitalized after trudging through the marshes to Jersey City on a night when temperatures hit zero. Others attempted to swim up Berry’s Creek and the Hackensack River and were hospitalized with hypothermia.\n\nMorningstar-Paisley explosion:Hawthorne remembers deadly plant explosion 50 years later\n\nModern-day disaster:Cold, wind, ice, lack of water among hurdles for firefighters who knocked down Marcal fire\n\nOfficials determined early on that the fire was the result of a snapped electrical wire in a room filled with flammable solvents and soaked rags, The Record reported.\n\nFederal officials nonetheless blamed German sabotage for the explosion and a similar 1916 incident in Jersey City called the Black Tom explosion. In 1930, a joint commission found evidence for their claims insufficient.\n\nThe New York Times later reported that a former German spy admitted planning the Black Tom incident but took no credit for the Kingsland fire. The commission reopened the case and ordered the German government to pay $50 to compensate the Kingsland and Black Tom victims.\n\nPaterson fireworks blaze: 1901\n\nA fireworks explosion in downtown Paterson on June 21, 1901, sparked one of the state’s most devastating fires. Starting in a candy store in the bottom of a five-story tenement at 440 Main St., the fire killed 17 people and cremated an entire city block.\n\n“A volcano in action could not have wrought more ruin and desolation,” The (Paterson) News reported.\n\nThe fire started around noon in Abraham Rittenberg’s candy store, when his son was handling a package of large firecrackers. One exploded, setting off a chain reaction. The boy escaped, and several other boxes of fireworks were moved across the street, The News reported. The devastation nonetheless flowed through the series of flats owned by William Walker.\n\n“Every occupant of the entire block lost everything they had in this world except the clothes they had on their backs,” The News reported.\n\nOne resident was saved when she jumped from a window into a net held tight below, The News reported that day. Another died attempting to save her bedridden husband. The south end of the adjacent tenement collapsed, pinning down a man, who was pulled out by the gathering crowd.\n\nRittenberg was criticized for bringing dynamite torpedoes to the neighborhood. But while some were found in a nearby basement, fire officials confirmed that all Rittenberg had in his shop were roman candles, firecrackers and other small works, according to newspaper reports.\n\nRittenberg’s two children and mother-in-law both died in the fire. He was found not criminally liable for the 17 deaths but was later sued by Isaiah Bamber, who lost his wife and 6-month-old baby, Bertram, in the fire, and was ordered to pay $2,000 in damages.\n\nEight months later, on Feb. 9, 1902, the city was struck by an even more massive fire. Though no one died in the blaze, it destroyed more than 450 buildings across 26 blocks of the city’s business center, causing an estimated $10 million in damage.\n\nPalisades Amusement Park fire: 1944\n\nA roller coaster ride gone wrong at Palisades Amusement Park on Aug. 13, 1944, sparked a fire that consumed dozens of attractions, ended the park’s season and injured 150 people.\n\nThe fire started at about 2 p.m. that Sunday when a wooden car on the then-ubiquitous Virginia Reel spinning roller coaster allegedly caught fire.\n\n“Witnesses said that within 10 seconds the slanting ride was a mass of flames,\" The Record reported.\n\nExhibit:Visit Palisades Amusement Park once again — in miniature — at Mahwah Museum\n\nAmong the eight critically injured in the blaze were four children. Their wooden car caught fire just as it began its first 50-foot descent before disappearing into a tunnel. Five soldiers and a girl who helped rescue the four children and two women from the car were badly burned, The Record reported.\n\nThe fire spread to the fun house, the merry-go-round and some concessions in the park, which once sprawled across the border between Cliffside Park and Fort Lee.\n\nAt the time, the park’s famed pool, as big as three city blocks and filled with 500,000 gallons of salt water pumped from the Hudson River, was populated with 4,000 people. Despite the chaos, they evacuated in an orderly way, The Record reported. There was no panic.\n\nMeanwhile, 89 cars were destroyed in the parking lot across the street. Fifty more were badly burned. Their tires were scorched off.\n\nLocal officials determined the fire was likely caused by a short circuit near a collection of greasy rags used to clean the Virginia Reel’s tracks. In total, 14 fire departments responded to quell the blaze, which caused $1 million in damage.\n\nThe amusement park fire was one of the most devastating in tri-state history, but it wasn’t the only one that weekend. The previous day, most of Luna Park on Coney Island was consumed by fire. Unlike Palisades Amusement Park, which reopened the following year and operated through the 1971 season, Luna Park never opened again.\n\nHercules powder blasts: 1940\n\nA munitions plant owned by DuPont spinoff Hercules Company in Roxbury was the site of one of the state’s most far-reaching disasters.\n\nOn Sept. 12, 1940, a series of explosions at the fenced 1,200-acre site, now off Route 80, destroyed more than 20 buildings, killed 51 people and injured more than 200 others. Fueled by nearly 297,000 pounds of smokeless gunpowder, the blasts registered on a Fordham University seismograph 45 miles away, according an Associated Press report.\n\n“The only thing in the plant which appeared intact was a large boiler,” the AP reported a commercial transport pilot as saying.\n\nThe Hercules facility first opened in 1871 to make dynamite for the area’s once-thriving iron industry. Two explosions in 1934 killed six workers, but the 1940 incident was the most severe to hit the massive complex.\n\nThe hospital had to stage triage on its front lawn and deliver patients to Morristown and even as far as Newark for medical care, according to newspaper reports.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the blasts broke windows in homes as far away as the shores of Lake Hopatcong. Pictures were knocked off walls in Poughkeepsie, New York, and damage was reported in Middletown, New York, 52 miles away, The Record reported.\n\nThe explosions started with a fire in the plant’s solvent-recovery building. Company officials did not suspect sabotage, but that did not stop some local politicians from showing up the next day to comb for evidence, The Record reported.\n\nThe plant reopened in April 1941 and continued to operate through 1996. At least a half-dozen other explosions occurred in the duration, killing more than 15 people. The last, in 1994, involved 500 pounds of nitroglycerin and injured four workers.\n\nRoxbury Township has a plaque in the Memorial Garden at Horseshoe Lake Park with the names of the blasts’ 51 victims and many others who died at the plant.\n\nLake Denmark lightning strike: 1926\n\nTwo days after a thunderstorm rolled through Rockaway Township on July 10, 1926, the booms continued at the Lake Denmark ammunition depot\n\nA lightning strike during the storm set fire to the naval depot, triggering 600,000 tons of explosives. Steel fragments rained as 12- and 14-inch shells burst within reach of the Army’s also-impressive Picatinny Arsenal.\n\nThe debris was launched more than 20 miles away. Homes in Mountain Lakes, Butler and Morristown were damaged.\n\nIn the immediate vicinity, holes 30 feet deep and 100 feet wide were left in the dense rock where two storehouses once stood.\n\n“Great trees lie stripped of bark and foliage in the 500-acre naval reservation, some uprooted, some cut down by shell fragments, but all with their tops pointing away from the blasts,” The Associated Press reported.\n\nFour towns suffered massive damage from the blasts. In Mount Hope, more than 100 miners’ cottages were either completely or partially destroyed, according to The Associated Press. Nearly 200 structures were leveled, leaving 800 homeless.\n\nThe disaster killed 21 people, injured about 300 more and created $47 million in damage, according to newspaper accounts. Nearly everything within a half-mile was leveled, and the epicenter smoldered for days.\n\n“The scene was reminiscent of a battlefield the day after the shock troops of any enemy had wrought their bloody will and withdrawn to other sectors,” The Associated Press reported on July 12.\n\nGovernment officials chalked up the disaster to natural causes. A copper ground wire had been erected to protect the single-story brick building from a direct lightning hit, according to newspaper reports. A bolt nonetheless ripped through the tar and gravel roof, the precaution having apparently been insufficient.\n\nMidvale train crash: 1904\n\nA series of failed opportunities to signal the danger posed by a stopped train in Wanaque on July 11, 1904, led to one of North Jersey’s deadliest train crashes.\n\nThe crash occurred shortly after a 12-car, chartered train stopped for water at a tower just north of the Midvale Station, near the Wanaque Reservoir. As the train sat, a flagman was supposed to stand behind the train to warn the approaching regular train of the obstruction.\n\nErie Railroad officials said the flagman did not go back far enough, and when the second train came around a curve, there was no stopping it. The chartered train on its way to Greenwood Lake was hit from behind by the second northbound train.\n\n“As the trains crashed, part of the floor of the rear car of the special gave way, and as it telescoped into the rear car in front of it, heads were mowed down as if by a scythe,” The Record reported that day.\n\nMore than 40 people were severely injured. Seventeen died.\n\nAll were members of Hoboken’s First Plattdeutscher Club, a north German heritage club, which chartered a train for 800.\n\n“Most of the dead also lived within five blocks of one another in Hoboken,” The Record reported.\n\nThe flagman, the operator, who Erie officials said also failed to put up a danger signal, the conductor and other staff from both trains were suspended and later fired.\n\nThe Record reported that a railroad expert said the accident may have come down to an overwhelmed steward of the Midvale Station, however.\n\n“That unfortunate fellow had the responsibility of at least half a dozen branches of railroading on his shoulders. Is it any wonder he made a fatal mistake?” the expert was quoted as asking.\n\nEmail: zimmer@northjersey.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/07/06/altoona-adventureland-raging-river-accident-2021-death-michael-jaramillo/7869152002/", "title": "What we know about the Adventureland accident that killed an 11 ...", "text": "Michael Jaramillo, 11, died Sunday after he and three others were injured on the Raging River water ride at Adventureland Park in Altoona. One child remains in critical condition, and two others suffered minor injuries.\n\nWhat happened on Raging River ride?\n\nThe Jaramillo family, of Marion, went to Adventureland to celebrate David Jaramillo's upcoming 16th birthday.\n\nDavid, his younger brothers Gus, 14, and Michael, 11; their parents, Sabrina and David Jaramillo; and their 18-year-old cousin Nyla Pettie boarded a boat for the ride around 7:30 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThe family’s boat flipped over within 20 seconds of the ride beginning, according to pastor Christian Shields, of Christian Life Church in Cedar Rapids, causing all six to hit their heads on the surface below and trapping them in their seatbelts underneath the water.\n\nEmergency responders and witnesses helped to free the riders. Four were taken to the hospital, and park officials said Sunday that they were \"saddened\" to learn that one had died.\n\nThe ride is closed and park officials said they are working with state and local authorities to investigate the cause of the accident.\n\nMore:Parents recount Raging River accident that killed 11-year-old son\n\n16-year-old on life support\n\nDavid Jaramillo, Michael's brother who turned 16 on Wednesday, has been in a medically induced coma at Blank Children’s Hospital since the accident, Shields said.\n\nDavid has some brain function and has woken up a couple times at the Des Moines hospital, opening his eyes and asking what happened, he said. He remains hooked up to breathing machines, but doctors are hoping to wean him off life support, Shields said.\n\nSupport for the Jaramillo family\n\nChristian Life Church in Cedar Rapids is sponsoring a GoFundMe page that has raised more than $40,000 for the family as of Thursday morning. The church is also held a prayer vigil from 7-8 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nThe few dozen at Christian Life Church in Cedar Rapids on Wednesday evening extended their hands out to the southwest corner of the room, toward Des Moines, and prayed for a full recovery for David Jaramillo.\n\n\"As a community and as a church, I know we've all been rocked by this tragedy,\" the Rev. Christian Shields, a pastor at the church, said at Wednesday's service dedicated to the family.\n\nBut nothing compares to what the Jaramillo family is going through — \"all of the hurt, all of the pain, all of the anger,\" Shields said.\n\nAnd David, \"he's going to wake up to this and realize — 'I don't have my brother anymore,' \" Shields said.\n\nWhat is the family saying?\n\nIn an interview broadcast Tuesday on ABC's “Good Morning America,” David Jaramillo, Michael Jaramillo's father, recounted what happened when the boat capsized.\n\n“When it flipped over, all of us were trapped in the safety seat belts,\" he said. \"I see the silhouettes of my sons trying to grab each other, grab us. They want us to help them. We couldn't do it.”\n\nDavid Jaramillo, 43, referred questions to his attorney, Ryan Best of Spokane, Washington, when reached by phone Tuesday.\n\n\"I feel like Adventureland robbed me of my baby,” said Sabrina Jaramillo, Michael’s mother, said on “Good Morning America.\" \"I will never get a chance to see him grow up.\"\n\nWhat are officials saying?\n\nAltoona police spokeswoman Alyssa Wilson told the Associated Press on Sunday that detectives were working with park staff and state inspectors \"to understand this tragic accident.\"\n\nAfter being closed because of the pandemic last year, the ride last underwent an inspection on Friday. Attorney Guy Cook, who represents Adventureland in personal injury cases and is assisting with the park’s response, told the AP the ride was found to be in working order and passed its inspection before reopening to the public.\n\nWhat do we know about the ride?\n\nThe Raging River ride first opened in 1983 and was manufactured by a Swiss company, Intamin Amusement Rides. It has been a staple of the park since its opening in June 1983 when then-Gov. Terry Branstad was even on one of the inaugural rides.\n\nAdventureland advertises the ride as a \"great way to cool off with the whole family,\" warning it might leave participants soaked. Riders are sent through rapids on large circular rafts using a conveyor belt.\n\nThe ride closed in 2020 due to the pandemic and reopened on July 3, the day of the accident.\n\nAlthough under different circumstances, this is the second accident connected to the ride. In 2016, Steve Booher died while helping riders get off the ride's raft.\n\nIt was Intamin’s Maryland office that handled the Raging River design and build project. Heading the team of 15 people involved in designing the ride was Peter Schnabel, a native of Munich, Germany.\n\n\"The idea for the Raging River ride came from the 1976 Olympic Games in Munich,\" Schnabel told the Des Moines Register in 1983. Intamin, which got its start designing and building ski tows and cable cars, was involved in designing the man-made kayak course for those games.\n\nA mandatory “major breakdown\" report Adventureland filed with the state after the accident and released under a public records request said at least one of the raft's eight air bladders was deflated.\n\nAdventureland attorney Guy Cook told the Associated Press the bladder could have deflated upon overturning, arguing it's premature to draw any conclusions. He said it was the first time one of the rafts had flipped out of tens of thousands of launches in the ride's 38-year history.\n\nThe failure came just one day after an annual state inspection of the ride. The inspector rated the ride as satisfactory in 19 categories — including emergency procedures, seat belts and safety restraints, records show.\n\nThe ride had passed inspections for at least the past five years, according to the records.\n\nIowa Labor Commissioner Rod Roberts, whose agency conducted the inspections, declined to be interviewed Wednesday and did not immediately respond to written questions.\n\nInspectors have reviewed at least 15 other accidents at Adventureland in the past decade and 38 since 2006, records show.\n\nThose accidents include the 2016 death of an employee who fell into the water when he was helping people off the Raging River ride. Records show the Iowa Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined Adventureland $4,500 in connection with his death.\n\nInspectors described three other accidents on the ride as minor. Several on other Adventureland rides have led to severe trauma.\n\nThose included a rider whose foot was trapped between the platform and a train, two workers who suffered severed fingers and a child who was hospitalized after being hit by a loose board while riding a roller coaster.\n\nWho was Steve Booher?\n\nBooher, 68, died while working on the ride after only six days on his summer job at Adventureland. He was helping riders get out of the ride's rafts when he fell on the conveyor belt, fracturing his skull and suffering a major brain injury. He died four days later. Last December, the park settled a wrongful death lawsuit brought by Booher's wife of 47 years and their adult children for an undisclosed sum.\n\nIowa Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the park $4,500 after Booher's death, the maximum the agency could assess for that type of violation.\n\nCook said there was no commonality between the two accidents, but that he could not comment on Saturday's accident until the investigation is complete.\n\nMore on Booher's death:\n\nOther Adventureland accidents\n\nCourt records show Adventureland has been sued in recent years by people who were seriously injured on other rides, including waterslides.\n\nIowa OSHA records show the agency most recently fined Adventureland in 2018, after an employee working on a roller coaster was knocked off a transformer and fell to the ground when he was struck by a test ride. The employee was hospitalized with a broken arm. Adventureland settled safety violations by agreeing to pay $14,500 in 2019.\n\nMore:Adventureland fined $37,000 after Dragon roller coaster car hits worker\n\nHistory of the park\n\nJack Krantz was a well-known home builder in the Des Moines area when he set his sights on opening an amusement park.\n\n\"He owned a company called Custom Built Homes for a number of years, then he decided he was going to build something bigger,\" Molly Vincent, Jack's daughter and the park's marketing director, said.\n\nMore: Adventureland Amusement Park forever changed entertainment in central Iowa\n\nOther sites were considered, but Krantz eventually settled on Altoona, a town of about 3,000 at the time.\n\nThat first season, Adventureland was a far cry from the acres of towering roller coasters and water rides found there today.\n\n\"It was a Sky Ride in the middle of a cornfield is what it seemed like,\" John Krantz said.\n\nBut the people came. Attendance topped 300,000.\n\nThe park's Main Town area — an idea borrowed from Disney World — was free to guests who could cross a bridge for admission to the park itself, which included an assortment of smaller rides like the Jaunty Jeeps, Silly Silo, River Rapids and Bavarian Scrambler.\n\nFrom 2015: Last ride for Adventureland's Log Ride\n\nThe next year brought the Lady Luck and the Flitzer, a small mountain-scene roller coaster. Three years later another Tornado arrived with the opening of the park's iconic wooden roller coaster.\n\n\"It started with Petunia Pig, the fiberglass sculpture in the middle of the park, and it just got kind of out of hand from there,\" Vincent said.\n\nSince then the 183-acre park has continued to add rides at a rate of about one every two years.\n\n\"Sometimes we get a little excited and put two in, or sometimes we build an entire water park in two years,\" Vincent said.\n\nCompleted in 2012, the water park — with its assortment of pools, water and tube slides, and lazy river — was the single largest addition in the park's history.\n\n\"It blew up beyond any of our expectations,\" Vincent said.\n\nOther recent additions include:\n\nThe Storm Chaser (2014), which spins riders around the top of a 260-foot tower, offering those brave enough a scenic glimpse of downtown Des Moines.\n\nThe Monster (2016), which is 2,500 feet long and reaches a top speed of 65 mph. It includes a 133-foot vertical lift hill followed by a 101-degree drop — steeper than any ride in Iowa. It replaced the Log Ride, which gave its last rides in 215.\n\nThe Phoenix (2018), a four-seat car that spins 360 degrees as it goes up and down hills.

The name “Action Point” is an homage to its North Jersey inspiration, Knoxville has told several media outlets.\n\nAs the park's 1980s advertising tag line boasted: “There’s nothing in the world like Action Park.”\n\nThere was the short-lived and dangerous Cannonball Loop, an enclosed water slide featuring a complete vertical loop that required participants to be freshly hosed down lest they became stuck.\n\nThere was the Tidal Wave Pool, nicknamed the Grave Pool, which could generate waves more than 3 feet high and was the site of three drownings.\n\nThere was also the Alpine Slide, a luge-track of fiberglass and concrete set on a ski hill that would fling occasionally brake-less carts into slower ones and leave lasting skid marks on riders unable to abide by the “keep your arms and legs in at all times” rule.\n\nThe ride registered the park’s first death in July 1980, when an employee's cart jumped the track. The 19-year-old struck his head on a rock.\n\n“It was the Wild West before 1996,” said Joe Hession, Mountain Creek president. “As much as the stories are interesting, I almost see them as stories of 'let’s make sure that never happens again.' ”\n\nAction Park deaths, injuries piled up\n\nHundreds of injuries and six deaths were recorded in the 18 years after the grand opening of Action Park in 1978.\n\nDeaths and injuries • A 19-year-old Action Park worker died after his cart jumped the track and he hit his head on a rock. • A 20-year-old Brooklyn man drowned on Aug. 25, 1987, in the Tidal Wave Pool. An 18-year-old from Queens drowned in the same pool on July 19, 1987. • Hundreds of injuries and six deaths were recorded in the 18 years after the grand opening in 1978.\n\nThe regular injuries and attitude surrounding them led to the creation of park nicknames: Traction Park, Class Action Park, Accident Park.\n\nUnderage drinking, missing signage and lax safety cemented the park’s reputation as a utopia for rambunctious teens.\n\n“It’s fun to tell the stories,” Hession said. “But, yeah, we’re glorifying criminals. We’re glorifying people who conducted a business that really, as much as it might be funny, hurt people. I mean, people died there.”\n\nAs a Vernon native and a former general manager of the resort, Hession said he is familiar with the park’s various iterations. Before he joined the Intrawest Resorts Holdings management team, his first job was parking cars at the resort.\n\nDuring the Action Park days, the ethos was to choose your own adventure and danger level, Hession said. Rides were tested until perfected.\n\nThe story continues below the video.\n\nAction Park became Mountain Creek\n\nIntrawest Resorts Holdings, a developer and operator of destination resorts, arrived in 1996 after a string of lawsuits against Action Park. The company changed the park's name to Mountain Creek and embarked on a mission to revive the park by installing new, safer rides and removing old ones.\n\nHession said he quickly accepted that rides with recurring incidents had to close. Fans of the old Action Park, however, were resentful, he said.\n\nThe story continues below gallery.\n\n“It was really quite a process to make it a safe park,” he said. “We removed a lot of things, and in the '90s I remember people saying, ‘You’re getting rid of this, but it’s the best thing.’ It was a commitment to safety. It was a commitment to being good stewards of recreation overall.”\n\nAfter a six-year absence, Hession returned to Mountain Creek’s staff roughly six months ago with his management team from SNOW Operating, which works with ski resorts such as Aspen Snowmass and Whistler Blackcomb on a consulting basis with its Terrain Based Learning Program.\n\nThe resort’s ownership group recently shed the Mulvihill family, which opened Action Park in 1978 and returned after the Intrawest era in 2010.\n\nThe family revived the name Action Park and its trademark technicolor signage in 2014 to capitalize on nostalgic feelings from now-adult teenagers. “I survived Action Park” T-shirts and bumper stickers further glamorized the danger for two years until the name Mountain Creek returned.\n\n“It could be the subject of a business school course about what not to do,” Hession said.\n\nThe park’s dangerous reputation made a brief return in 2012, when it racked up more injuries in one year than it did from 2005 through 2009.\n\nTry this:Want to torture yourself? Try Mountain Creek's aerial ropes course\n\nRecreation:16 places for cooling down this summer\n\nTheme Parks:Jungle Habitat in West Milford needs a new name — any ideas?\n\nCannonball Falls, Colorado River: Injuries continue\n\nAn enclosed ride that launched riders from a twisting tube into a pool 10-feet below called Cannonball Falls was the most dangerous ride in the state in 2012, with 12 injuries, state records show. The Colorado River ride was a close second, with 11 injuries in 2012.\n\nCannonball Falls has since been closed. The Colorado River ride now requires helmets after multiple reports of passengers bumping heads. The Tarzan Swing was shut down last year to examine safer operation, Hession said. The Alpine Slide was replaced with the Alpine Coaster.\n\n“You can’t do what used to be done,” said Chris Haggerty, the director of resort operations, who started working at the resort as a teenage lifeguard. “You wouldn’t want to, either. You’d go out of business.”\n\nToday, the park’s focus is on safely providing thrills, rather than using danger to boost adrenaline for its 250,000 customers each year, Hession said. In the past four years, the park has tallied between 26 and 33 injuries each summer, state records show.\n\nThe last severe injury, on Thunder Falls in August 2015, was credited to inadvertent rider misbehavior, records show.\n\nIn addition to a renewed focus on safety, the water park in 2018 and beyond will attempt to become more well-rounded for full family outings, Hession said. Many popular rides, including the 99-foot-tall H2-Oh-No! and the horizontal-looping Zero-G, are high thrill, he said.\n\nThe future of Mountain Creek\n\nThis year, the park is set to introduce its first 4D water slide, Hession said. A relatively new phenomenon, the ride includes a light and sound experience. This specific one features a snow theme to reflect the park’s winter sport connection, he said.\n\nOther technological advancements have been installed to facilitate entry into the park using online purchasing options, Hession said.\n\nThe park is open only on weekends through June 17. Then, the summer weekday schedule runs until closing day on Sept. 3. Daily tickets cost about $30. A season pass is now available for $64.99.\n\n'Action Point':Is Johnny Knoxville's movie based on Action Park?

Now, she's about to be inducted for her solo work as well, making her the first and only female artist inducted twice.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Nicks said, \"My biggest hope is that I have opened the door due to the fact that there’s 22 men who have gone in twice and zero women. I think that’s really a little off balance. That’s what I’m hoping.\"\n\nIn the meantime, here's a look at the other artists with two or more inductions since the first class was enshrined in 1986.\n\nClyde McPhatter\n\nThe Hall of Fame was in its third year of inducted artists when this legendary soul sensation got his second nod. He was inducted as a solo artist first, in 1987, and then re-inducted one year later as a member of the Drifters. The Rock Hall website credits McPhatter with having \"possessed a unique vocal instrument, a lively high tenor that captured the promise and fervor of the teenage Fifties\" and being among the first singers \"to cross over from the church to the pop and R&B charts.\"\n\nEric Clapton\n\nThe man has been inducted three times, first as a member of the Yardbirds (1992), then one year later for his work with Cream and finally, in recognition of his solo work in the year 2000. As it says on the Rock Hall website: \"THREE INDUCTIONS, THREE WORDS: 'CLAPTON IS GOD.'\" That expression – the ultimate fan note – was famously spray-painted on a wall in 1967 and has followed the guitarist around through the succeeding decades. Clapton is said to have found the phrased embarrassing.\n\nJohn Lennon\n\nJohn Lennon was inducted as a member of the Beatles in 1988. He was inducted as a solo artist six years later by his former writing partner, Paul McCartney, who recalled some of his favorite memories of their life together in a touching speech. The Hall website praises \"a solo career marked by experimentation, political activism, embrace of the counterculture and more enduring songs: 'Imagine,' 'Working Class Hero,' 'Instant Karma!' and '#9 Dream,'\" saying he proved that musicians could reinvent themselves.\n\nJimmy Page\n\nOf course he's in there as a member of Led Zeppelin. As the Rock Hall sums it up, \"Hard rock and heavy metal as we know it wouldn't exist without Led Zeppelin, one of the most popular and innovate rock bands ever.\" By the time they took their rightful place in 1995, though, the guitarist had already been been inducted three years earlier with psychedelic pioneers the Yardbirds. Led Zeppelin's first tour, as it happens, was billed as the New Yardbirds, having been initially assembled to honor a touring commitment.\n\nDavid Crosby\n\nHe was inducted with the Byrds in 1991 and then again in 1997 for his work with Crosby, Stills & Nash. The Byrds, of course, were folk-rock pioneers, for which they would have been inducted either way. But as the Hall notes, they were also \"the ever-evolving pioneers of rock and roll's expansion into new, psychedelic sounds.\" As for CSN, the Hall praises the trio's \"impeccable harmonies\" and their \"thoughtful, song-centric approach to music, penning folk hits with messages of change, hope and forward motion.\"\n\nStephen Stills\n\nI'll tell you, 1997 was a banner year for Stephen Stills, the only Hall of Famer to have been inducted twice in the same ceremony – as a member of Buffalo Springfield and the final word in Crosby, Stills & Nash. As the Rock Hall website puts it, \"During their short tenure as a band, Buffalo Springfield brought together brilliant songwriters and musical powerhouses that set the tone for Seventies folk- and country-rock.\" Stills wrote and sang their most iconic song, \"For What it's Worth.\"\n\nNeil Young\n\nAlthough his tenure in Buffalo Springfield actually predates his solo career, Young was inducted as a solo artist first, in 1995. And that seems about right. As the first line of his Rock Hall bio puts it, he is \"one of rock and roll’s greatest songwriters and performers.\" He's also praised as \"a musical nomad who follows his muse wherever it leads, from folk to rock and roll to rockabilly to blues and back again.\" Has that restlessness at times confounded fans? Of course it has. But there are those who swear by \"Trans.\" And truthfully, he should be in as part of Crosby, Stills & Nash as well. He makes them better.\n\nPaul McCartney\n\n\"Did you know Paul McCartney was in a band before Wings?\" was an inexplicably popular joke in the '70s. His first induction was in 1988 for that band before Wings, the act you've known for all these years. Wings never made it to the Rock Hall. But they surely factored into his induction as a solo act in 1999. As the Hall website sums up the case for his solo induction, his \"commitment to progress has not only kept McCartney relevant— it's ensured he's had one of the most intriguing, varied music careers ever.\"\n\nCurtis Mayfield\n\nHe was inducted for his work with the Impressions first, in 1991, and re-inducted for his solo work in 1999. The Rock Hall writes that his solo career, which began in 1970, is \"significant for the forthright way in which he addressed issues of black identity and self-awareness,\" going on to cite his influence on artists such as Lenny Kravitz, Ice-T, Public Enemy and Arrested Development. \"Mayfield’s ability to voice hard truths through funky, uplifting music,\" the Hall notes, \"has rendered him one of the great soul icons.\"\n\nPaul Simon\n\nInducted with Simon & Garfunkel in 1990, he was re-inducted for his solo career in 2001. The Rock Hall website praised him as a \"master wordsmith... whose lyrics are as keen as his melodies are tuneful,\" going on to enthuse that he \"seems to absorb influences from every corner of the world and then give them back in the form of beautiful, textured songs. While his eclectic tastes are ever-evolving, he can always be counted on for affecting, poetic lyrics.\"\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nJackson was inducted with the other members of the Jackson 5 in 1997 on the strength of Motown classics like \"I Want You Back.\" He was inducted as a solo artist in 2001. (\"Thriller\" is still the biggest-selling album in the world.) The Rock Hall says, \"The future King of Pop carried soul and R&B into the mainstream in the '70s with the Jackson 5, and then leveraged music videos and smart collaborations to become a beloved global superstar in the '80s.\" Reports indicate that Jackson's two inductions will not be revoked following the release of \"Leaving Neverland,\" an HBO documentary in which two men allege that Jackson sexually abused them as children.\n\nGeorge Harrison\n\nIn 2004, he became the third Beatle to be twice-inducted, enshrined for a solo career that was launched with the masterful \"All Things Must Pass,\" a triple album that opened the floodgates for an artist often overshadowed by his more prolific bandmates. As the Rock Hall summed it up, \"The 'Quiet Beatle' took his inner conflict between fame and privacy, secular and sacred, and turned it into a huge body of work\" that \"introduced the Western world to Eastern musical and spiritual influences.\"\n\nJohn E. Carter\n\nHe may not be a household name, but Carter was inducted with two legendary vocal groups – the Flamingos (2001) and the Dells (2004). The Flamingos' biggest hit was \"I Only Have Eyes for You.\" The Rock Hall says, \"Today they stand as one of the most sophisticated doo wop groups and most influential vocal groups.\" At the time of their induction, the Dells, who topped the R&B charts with \"Stay in My Corner\" and \"Oh, What a Night,\" were one of very few groups to have a hit in every decade since the '50s.\n\nJeff Beck\n\nThe guitarist was inducted with the Yardbirds first in 1992 and again for his solo career in 2009. As the Rock Hall raved, \"Double-inductee Jeff Beck is a visionary, an innovator and a true virtuoso. He built his first guitar at age 15 and learned the instrument inside and out before mastering everything from heavy metal to jazz.\" The website also noted that his \"urgent, in-your-face guitar was so expressive that he din't need a singer.\" That is true, but we're still glad he did those records with the Yardbirds and Rod Stewart.\n\nSammy Strain\n\nStrain was inducted with the O'Jays in 2005 and with Little Anthony & the Imperials in 2009. The Rock Hall calls the O'Jays \"the pinnacle of '70s soul music... instrumental in popularizing Philly soul and the work of songwriting team Gamble and Huff. Their velvety, lush, yet funk-tinged sound establishes them as some of soul music’s finest.\" Strain came to that group from the Imperials, \"one of the finest vocal groups to emerge from the talent-rich New York scene\" in the Rock Hall's estimation.\n\nGraham Nash\n\nIt's kind of crazy that the Hollies went in after Crosby, Stills & Nash. But they finally made it in in 2010. That's a long time to wait for a band the Rock Hall website credits with being \"one of the most commercially successful bands of the British Invasion\" whose \"rich, multi-part harmonies — sung over consistently sharp beat-group arrangements — made them one of the most musically appealing and popular bands\" of that Invasion. But then, the Hall has always been a bit weighted in favor of American success.\n\nRonnie Wood\n\nThe guitarist was inducted with the Rolling Stones in 1989 and his previous group, the Small Faces/Faces, in 2012. He's been a Rolling Stone since replacing Mick Taylor in 1975. And that makes him the longest-running Stones guitarist not named Keith. But for all his contributions to the Stones' career since signing on, they would've been inducted if he'd never joined at all, whereas his contributions the Faces' legacy is undeniable, including a co-writing credit on \"Stay With Me,\" their most successful U.S. hit.\n\nRod Stewart\n\nStewart was inducted for his solo work in 1994 and The Small Faces/Faces in 2012. He's one of rock and roll's most soulful vocalists, from those early recordings with Python Lee Jackson through the Faces and the Jeff Beck Group to \"Maggie May\" and \"Every Picture Tells a Story.\" As the Rock Hall puts it, \"There is no mistaking the warm, grizzly rasp of Rod Stewart's voice,\" pronouncing the star \"irresistibly charming and undeniably talented\" blessed with \"one of the finest voices of his generation.\"\n\nPeter Gabriel\n\nInducted with Genesis in 2010, he was honored again in 2014 for a solo career whose highlights range from \"Games Without Frontiers\" to the five-times-platinum, mainstream-courting triumph, \"So.\" He steered Genesis through their most eccentric work on progressive-rock landmarks as iconic as \"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.\" Of his solo years, the Rock all writes, \"Peter Gabriel has taken on as many different roles post-Genesis as the theatrical roles he assumed as the band’s frontman.\"\n\nLou Reed\n\nIn making the case for the Velvet Underground's long-overdue induction (1995), the Hall cited conventional music-nerd wisdom: \"Not everyone bought their album, but everyone who did started a band.\" Reed was their streetwise visionary, penning Velvet gems as timeless as \"I'm Waiting for the Man\" and \"Heroin.\" Add in his solo years for what the Hall calls \"a body of work that ranks with Dylan and Lennon-McCartney as among the most significant and influential songwriting catalogues of the 20th century.\"\n\nRingo Starr\n\nThis one needs an asterisk. He's in there twice, both as a Beatle (1988) and on his own. But his induction in 2015 was an Award for Musical Excellence, which \"honors those musicians, producers and others who have spent their careers out of the spotlight working with major artists on various parts of their recording and live careers.\" In other words, that honor lets us factor in his drumming with the Beatles, which was never less than stellar. As the Hall sums what makes him shine: \"He is a song-serving drummer.\"\n\nGregg Rolie\n\nThe final pre-Nicks member of the twice-inducted club joined as a member of Santana (1998) and Journey (2017). Rolie sang on several of Santana's greatest early hits, including \"Black Magic Woman\" \"Oye Como Va\" and \"Evil Ways,\" taking part in their show-stopping set at the Woodstock Music and Art Festival in 1969. In 1973, he joined fellow Santana expatriate Neal Schon in Journey, playing keyboards on their first six albums and singing lead of many of those pre-Steve Perry records.\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.

Their omission is somewhat surprising: Artists named to the ballot in their first year of eligibility, as The White Stripes were, typically win induction that same year.\n\nThe Spinners are part of an inductees list that includes Willie Nelson, George Michael, Missy Elliott, Sheryl Crow, Rage Against the Machine and Kate Bush.\n\nThey were selected by a body of 1,000-plus artists, historians and other music professionals, combined with a public vote. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony will be held Nov. 3 at the Barclays Center in New York.\n\n\"I am in shock and tears and feeling so grateful,\" said Claudreen Jackson, widow of late Spinners bass singer Pervis Jackson. \"Pervis would have been humbled and amazed. The thing about the Spinners was that however high their career went, they were still humble and thankful. They were first class onstage and offstage. I’m just so happy this has happened for them.\"\n\nThe Spinners, who formed in Ferndale in the 1950s and did a stint with Motown before bigger success with Atlantic Records in the ‘70s, were triumphant Wednesday after three previous RRHOF nominations. With rich harmonies and an ear for catchy material, the group piled up pop and R&B hits such as “Could It Be I’m Falling in Love,” “One of a Kind (Love Affair),” “Then Came You,” “Games People Play,\" “The Rubberband Man” and \"Working My Way Back to You.\"\n\nWorking with producer Thom Bell, the Spinners became closely associated with the Philly sound that prevailed in ‘70s R&B.

Released in 1978, \"Stardust\" was certified quadruple platinum in 1990.\n\nNoting that he and Johnny Cash, half of his band of outlaws, the Highwaymen, are now in the hall, he made a case for \"Waylon (Jennings), who played with Buddy Holly, and Kris (Kristofferson), who sang so many hits,\" to be inducted, too.

Since 2000, there have been 21 such Hall of Famers. Eminem is the only 2022 artist with that status.\n\nArtists qualify for induction 25 years after their first commercial release. Eminem’s debut album, “Infinite,” landed in November 1996, when he was a little-known figure on the Detroit hip-hop scene. That indie release — recorded at an obscure 8 Mile Road studio and issued on 500 copies, half cassettes and half LPs — came three years before Eminem broke globally with “The Slim Shady LP” on Interscope Records.\n\nRelated: Eminem's 'Slim Shady LP': An oral history of the album that created a superstar\n\n“Infinite” was an early taste of Eminem’s tongue-twisting, internal-rhyming rap skills and confrontational but soul-baring approach. It was followed by hit albums such as “The Slim Shady LP,” “The Marshall Mathers LP” and “The Eminem Show,” which helped him become the best-selling U.S. recording artist in the first decade of the 2000s.\n\nEminem is the seventh hip-hop act inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, following the late Notorious B.I.G. and groups such as Run-DMC and N.W.A.\n\nThe Hall of Fame has incorporated fan voting in recent years, though like many of the institution’s tightly guarded procedures, its weight in the final tally is murky. Duran Duran led this year’s fan ballot with about 935,000 votes, followed by Eminem (684,000), Pat Benatar (631,000), Eurythmics (442,000) and Dolly Parton (334,000).\n\nWill Eminem show up for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame festivities this autumn? That remains to be seen. The show typically features a tribute speech and performance segment for each inductee, followed by a show-ending group jam.\n\nIt’s worth noting Eminem is an artist who isn’t exactly keen on public appearances. He even skipped his own Oscars triumph in 2003, when “Lose Yourself” (from “8 Mile”) took the Academy Award for best original song.\n\nStill, Eminem has a history with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2009, he presented the induction of Run-DMC, and last year he performed with LL Cool J as the veteran rapper was honored with the Award for Musical Excellence.\n\nContact Detroit Free Press music writer Brian McCollum: 313-223-4450 or bmccollum@freepress.com.\n\nDetroit artists in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame\n\nAretha Franklin — 1987\n\nMarvin Gaye —1987\n\nSmokey Robinson — 1987\n\nJackie Wilson — 1987\n\nThe Supremes — 1988\n\nThe Temptations — 1989\n\nStevie Wonder — 1989\n\nHank Ballard — 1990\n\nFour Tops — 1990\n\nJohn Lee Hooker — 1991\n\nMartha and the Vandellas — 1995\n\nGladys Knight & the Pips — 1996\n\nLittle Willie John — 1996\n\nParliament-Funkadelic — 1997\n\nBob Seger — 2004\n\nMadonna — 2008\n\nThe Stooges — 2010\n\nAlice Cooper — 2011\n\nThe Miracles — 2012\n\nEminem — 2022", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/brian-mccollum/2022/11/06/eminem-inducted-into-rock-roll-hall-of-fame/69623273007/", "title": "Eminem inducted into Rock & Roll Hall of Fame", "text": "LOS ANGELES — Eminem’s musical journey started in hungry desperation at an obscure studio on 8 Mile Road. Saturday night, it led him into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Detroit rapper, in one the most triumphant moments of his much-decorated career, was enshrined in the rock hall during a long, star-filled ceremony at the Microsoft Theater. Eminem, inducted by Dr. Dre and joined by Ed Sheeran and Steven Tyler during his musical performance, became the 20th Detroit inductee in the institution’s 36-year history.\n\n“I realize what an honor it is right now for me to be up here tonight, and what a privilege it is to do the music that I love — the music that basically saved my life,” Eminem said, clad in a black leather hoodie and donning a pair of glasses to read his handwritten acceptance speech.\n\nEminem has long been uneasy with the celebrity spotlight, and he reaffirmed it Saturday, declining to walk the red carpet and rarely looking up as he delivered his speech. “This part I’m not crazy about,” he said, gesturing down at his notes.\n\nRather than devoting his big moment to indulge in his career accomplishments, he spent nearly half his time at the podium saluting the “groundbreaking artists” in hip-hop who inspired his work. For 3½ minutes, he read an alphabetical list of more than 100 names, famous and obscure — fittingly slipping into a rhythmic flow as he rattled them off.\n\n“I would not be me without them,” he concluded. “I’m a high-school dropout with a hip-hop education, and these are my teachers. It’s their night just as much as it is mine.”\n\nEminem’s segment came late in a nearly six-hour show that included the inductions of Duran Duran, Pat Benatar, Carly Simon, Lionel Richie, the Eurythmics and Dolly Parton.\n\nIt was a news-making affair that included Duran Duran’s shock revelation that guitarist Andy Taylor, absent Saturday night, is suffering from terminal prostate cancer.\n\nParton, dependably humble and still seeming a bit mystified by her inclusion in the rock hall, debuted a new song with a vintage rock ‘n’ roll feel.\n\nJohn Mellencamp, inducting his attorney Allen Grubman for a non-performer honor, seemed to have Kanye West’s recent dustup in mind when he called out antisemitism during a hard-edged speech, saying, “(screw) anybody who says anything in that manner.”\n\nThe hall of fame ceremony will air at 8 p.m. Nov. 19 on HBO, when it will also become available for streaming on HBO Max.\n\nEminem, the rock hall’s seventh hip-hop honoree, was inducted by his longtime collaborator Dr. Dre in front of an audience that included daughter Hailie, manager Paul Rosenberg, producers Jeff and Mark Bass and other Michiganders crucial to his career.\n\nDre’s eight-minute introduction lauded Eminem as an against-the-odds white rapper who went on to become the best-selling artist in hip-hop history and one of the top-selling acts in the annals of popular music.\n\nDre recounted his first encounter with Eminem's music in the late ‘90s.\n\n“I guess it was my ignorance at the time, thinking that, ‘OK, if you’re a good rapper, you must be black,’” Dre said, going on to add: “While everyone else around me had their doubts, I knew his gifts were undeniable.”\n\nDre noted that Eminem has never concerned himself with sales figures and other industry benchmarks.\n\n“What’s most important to him is that he’s earned the respect of his peers as one of the best to ever do it,” Dre said. “Turns out, this unassuming white guy with blue eyes from Detroit (turned) everything we thought we knew about hip-hop on its head by forcing us to confront our own biases, pulling not only the genre but all of us right along with him.”\n\nFor his live performance Saturday, backed by the event’s house band, Eminem stalked the stage with friend and longtime hype man Denaun Porter near his side, while DJ Alchemist manned the decks behind them.\n\nHis medley of hits launched with the song that had ignited it all, 1999’s “My Name Is,” followed by the rapid-fire marvel of “Rap God” and its tongue-twisting broadside of syllables, which had the Microsoft Theater energized and at its feet, nearly five hours into the hall of fame show.\n\nAerosmith’s Steven Tyler was a surprise guest, hitting the stage with his trademark scarf-draped mic to lend his “Dream On” vocals to Eminem’s “Sing for the Moment.” Ed Sheeran had the next unannounced cameo, manning an acoustic guitar as he served up the Dido vocal parts for “Stan.”\n\n“Forever” and “Not Afraid” rounded out a set that found Eminem looking vital and compelling in his musical element. He hasn’t played a full-scale concert in more than three years — in part because of the pandemic — but Saturday showed he can rise to the occasion as needed.\n\nHis Rock & Roll Hall of Fame honor, which will give him a permanent spot in the institution’s Cleveland museum, was a testament from the wider music establishment of his artistic and commercial clout.\n\nEminem joined an elite roll call of RRHOF artists inducted during their first year of eligibility, or 25 years after their first commercial release, and he was alone among Saturday’s inductees with that status.\n\nIn his case, the operative album was 1996’s “Infinite,” recorded at an 8 Mile Road home studio and pressed on 500 records and 500 cassettes he could hardly give away at the time. “Infinite” came three years before Eminem broke onto the global stage and went to become the best-selling music act in the first decade of the 2000s.\n\nHis ear for hip-hop authenticity was matched by an individual flair, including a percussive flow as noted by Jay-Z in a video tribute Saturday night. Armed with the alter ego Slim Shady, his music was at turns comedic, dark, vicious and vulnerable, culminating with the signature hit “Lose Yourself” — backdrop to his starring role in the film “8 Mile,” which hit theaters 20 years ago this week.\n\nEminem turned 50 last month, a life milestone that lends an air of gravitas against the brash-and-mouthy persona of his early years. Still, he was by far the youngest of Saturday’s seven inductees.\n\nBorn Marshall Mathers in Kansas City and raised in troubled family circumstances in and around Detroit, his music came from a distinct Motor City music tradition that was aggressive, colorful and designed to shock.\n\nBackstage Saturday, fellow Detroit-bred star Alice Cooper commended the versatility of Eminem’s work.\n\n“He was by far the funniest,” Cooper said. “I don’t think he ever got the right credit for the humor involved.”\n\nThe hall of fame’s glitzy festivities seemed far removed from Eminem’s rough-and-tumble life in the ‘90s, when he was a young father and aspiring rapper often scrambling for gas money and diapers. But he kept things real and straightforward during Saturday’s ceremony, seemingly conscious that where he came from is vital to who he is.\n\nMore:'The BMF Documentary: Blowing Money Fast' delves into lives of Detroit brothers\n\nMore:Mary J.

Raised in poverty by two former Black Panthers, Tupac pioneered hip hop’s celebration of rags-to-riches success, its poetic lyricism and its political undercurrents, selling more than 75 million albums worldwide in the process.\n\nTwenty years after his death following a drive-by shooting, Tupac's influence is nearly as great as it was in life. Hundreds of posthumous recordings have been released, and he's shaped a generation of rappers who came after him.\n\nThe rapper is joined by an accomplished group of other inductees, many of whom deserve their place in the Rock Hall, such as Pearl Jam, the group responsible for grunge’s post-Nirvana longevity. Also nominated (but not elected into the 2017 class) were hardcore legends Bad Brains, who gave punk a more diverse face. For many of these artists, their inclusion feels historically accurate -- due diligence to the genres they’ve helped shape. For Tupac, a Rock Hall nomination feels essential.\n\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees include Tupac Shakur, Pearl Jam, Journey\n\nTupac isn’t the first rapper to be nominated for the Rock Hall, but his name on the list feels like a first. Rock Hall inductees Public Enemy, the Beastie Boys and N.W.A. were among rap’s founding fathers, with Dr. Dre’s Death Row Records giving rise to Pac’s revolutionary career.\n\nTupac is the first member of a new generation of rappers to get a Rock Hall nod, the first to become famous in the '90s, the key figure in the decade’s East Coast/West Coast rivalry. He belongs to a more modern era of hip hop, a time marked by excess and contradictions in which young artists rose from nothing to become superstars, making music with stunning lyricism and socio-political messages while embracing all the cash, furs and trappings of fame that American capitalism offered them. (Couldn’t that describe any number of eras of rock ‘n’ roll?)\n\nIf social media grumblings are any indication, some rock listeners are confused as to how Tupac fits into the genre's narrative. Which it’s why it’s even more revolutionary for the Rock Hall to induct the rapper — and irresponsible not to.\n\nCritics can point to many aspects of Pac’s career as evidence he doesn’t deserve Rock Hall recognition: the drug use, the sex and violence in his lyrics that occasionally found their way into his real-life dealings. But Tupac, as is the case with most hip hop pioneers, didn’t always subscribe to white America’s preferred standards of decency.\n\nTo turn Pac away from the Rock Hall because he’s a man of contradictions ignores his enormous influence on contemporary hip hop. Plus, the Rock Hall is already full of drug users and suspected domestic abusers, whose names have been inducted into music's history books despite their misdeeds.\n\nThen, there's the Gene Simmons school of thought. The KISS frontman protested NWA’s inclusion on the ballot last year, telling Radio.com that if \"you don’t play guitar and you don’t write your own songs, you don’t belong there,\" and that he'd approve of rappers in the Rock Hall when Led Zeppelin gets into the (fictional) \"Rap Hall of Fame.\"\n\nWhether it’s his rock-star privilege or selective memory, Simmons doesn't just ignore the Rock Hall's long history of inducting a wide range of music greats, but also rock’s origins in soul, funk and jazz music. After all, the Rock Hall’s inaugural class in 1986 included rock’s true founding fathers — Chuck Berry, James Brown, Ray Charles, Sam Cooke and Fats Domino — whose music is about as different from Simmons’ hair-metal licks as any Tupac song.\n\nThere’s a reason why we pay attention to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. An induction is an acknowledgement of mainstream success, an indication that an artist’s name is important enough for rock’s history books. And when Simmons and other critics try to turn away rappers at the door for not sounding \"rock\" enough, they’re taking part in rock’s long history of white artists appropriating black culture -- erasing its creators while profiting off their sound.\n\nTupac’s name deserves to be in the Rock Hall, and it deserves to happen this cycle, in a year where the Black Lives Matter movement is marching against the police brutality he often rhymed about, as politicians paint a dystopian picture of the “inner cities\" that he illustrated in humanizing color in his music. The rapper’s nomination suggests what his fans have known for decades — Pac is a prophet, a uniquely American kind of poet laureate and, if nothing else, a rock star.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/04/entertainment/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-class-of-2022/index.html", "title": "Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2022 includes Dolly Parton ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWell, hello Dolly.\n\nThe Rock & Roll Hall of Fame 2022 inductees were announced Wednesday, and despite initially opting to “respectfully bow out” of the nomination process, Dolly Parton is part of this year’s diverse class.\n\nSome of the other inductees include Pat Benatar, Lionel Richie, Eminem, Carly Simon, Harry Belafonte, Duran Duran, Eurythmics and Judas Priest.\n\nThe following is the full list of this year’s inductees.\n\nPerformer Category\n\nPat Benatar\n\nDuran Duran\n\nEminem\n\nEurythmics\n\nDolly Parton\n\nLionel Richie\n\nCarly Simon\n\nMusical Excellence Award\n\nJudas Priest\n\nJimmy Jam & Terry Lewis\n\nEarly Influence Award\n\nHarry Belafonte\n\nElizabeth Cotten\n\nAhmet Ertegun Award\n\nAllen Grubman\n\nJimmy Iovine\n\nSylvia Robinson\n\n“This diverse group of inductees each had a profound impact on the sound of youth culture and helped change the course of rock & roll,” John Sykes, chairman of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, said in a statement. “Their music moved generations and influenced so many artists that followed.”\n\nParton brought more attention to this year’s process in March after she released a statement on social media saying “I really do not want votes to be split because of me, so I must respectfully bow out.”\n\nThe country legend later said she’d be willing to accept if selected for induction, noting that she had initially thought the honor “was for the people in rock music.” (The hall of fame has inducted numerous artists from non-rock genres over the years.)\n\nOn Wednesday Parton tweeted “I am honored and humbled by the fact that I have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.”\n\n“Of course I will accept it gracefully,” the tweet read. “Thanks to everyone that voted for me and to everyone at the @rockhall.

The suspect was driving a dark colored 4-door vehicle.\n\nStudents were encouraged to remain inside.\n\nThe victims from the earlier shooting were taken to Kent General Hospital in Dover and were reported in stable condition late Saturday, Williams said.\n\nThe names of the victims were not being released late Saturday. University spokesman Carlos Holmes said he didn't know if they are Delaware State students.\n\nThe shooting was on the school's main campus during Field Day, a large annual cookout that began at 4 p.m. and was scheduled to end at 9 p.m. Photos posted on social media indicate thousands of people were in attendance at the picnic-like event.\n\n\"It looks like this happened in the middle of it,\" Holmes said. \"We've directed our students to get into their dormitories and stay there, and we've directed outsiders to get off of our campus at this point.\"\n\nHolmes declined to say whether any suspects have been identified, stating only that the Delaware State University Police Department is leading the investigation with assistance from the Dover Police Department, Delaware State Police and other law enforcement agencies.\n\nDSU students took to Twitter just after 8 p.m. to report hearing shots fired on campus. Campus officials sent out a text alert about the shooting just 9 p.m., advising that people \"remain inside until further notice.\"\n\nPolice, some carrying assault rifles, from the Dover, Milford, Smyrna and Wyoming departments responded to the scene. A helicopter shined a spotlight onto the ground as part of the search.\n\nTwo police cars slowly patrolled up and down the concrete paths in the main area, blaring sirens to get crowds to disperse.

No injuries were reported in that incident.\n\n\"They're still hospitalized and they're still being monitored by doctors and the police because they are part of the investigation,\" Holmes said.

Police remained on \"full alert,\" Williams said, but normal operations and classes will resume on Monday.\n\n\"Along with our great team of public safety professionals, we believe that the campus and its residents are safe,\" Williams said.\n\nStudents contacted on Sunday expressed frustration over the incident and the resulting negative attention to the university. Some said many students from other schools, and even non-students, attended.\n\n\"Last Field Day it got crazy, but nothing like this. There was never anything to this level,\" said Allison Holder, a sophomore biology major from Brooklyn, New York, who said she was within about 25 yards of the shooting. She said she believed one young man suffered a leg wound in the incident.\n\n\"This Field Day everybody decided to come. It's never really a security issue on campus\" during other events, Holder said. \"I just feel like everybody came from their own school just to release their anger.\"\n\nHolder, who lives in an on-campus dormitory, said the crowd scrambled away instantly after the shooting, with police ordering all to stay inside. She said she waited until Sunday morning to call her family and tell them about the shooting.\n\n\"You know how events like that are. You get guests, people from the surrounding community see people having a good time, they find out about it, they show up,\" Holmes said. \"We had a lot of guests that came here from the surrounding areas and other schools, people connected with similar fraternities and sororities or the same fraternities and sororities at other schools.\"\n\nUniversity administrators are likely to discuss what happened and possible moves to prevent a recurrence, Holmes said. Details on admissions controls used for the cookout were not immediately available, although Holmes said that people from other schools and the surrounding community had made their way in.\n\n\"There will be discussions, no doubt,\" Holmes said. \"There already are discussions going on.\"\n\nCampus security was tighter than usual Sunday morning, with virtually all vehicle access-points gated off and visitors being checked closely at the university's main entrance off U.S. 13. Small groups of students could be seen moving along the campus's main mall and between the campus and University Courtyard apartment complex, where the second incident of shots fired was reported.\n\nHolmes said he had no additional information related to the alert sent out to students about shots at the University Courtyard complex.\n\nIn the second shooting, police were looking for a black man with short dreadlocks, 5 feet 9 inches to 5 feet 11 inches. He was wearing a tan and blue long sleeve T-shirt and white sneakers, according to the alert. The suspect was driving a dark-colored, four-door vehicle.\n\nSierra Butcher, a second-ysear integrated studies student from Wilmington, echoed Holder's comments.\n\n\"Our Field Day kind of went wrong,\" said Butcher, who said she canceled her plans to go to the event after school officials reported the emergency. \"It really is a peaceful campus, but I think the commotion happened because of people who don't even go to Del State,\" Butcher said. \"They came last year. People from other schools came and kind of ruined it for us.\n\n\"It makes us look like a bad school,\" Butcher said. \"It makes us look like we're rowdy and obnoxious, when it's really people from other schools coming here and messing up our campus.\"\n\nThe campus cookout began at 4 p.m. and was scheduled to end at 9 p.m. Students said a large crowd turned out, with photos posted on social media suggesting that thousands might have been on hand.\n\nDover mayor Robin Christiansen said the shootings on and off campus were an awful incident. He said the city was notified Saturday night and police continue to work with the university.\n\n\"It's unfortunate something like this would happen, but you can't always control people's behavior,\" he said.\n\nNashaya Hampton, 22, said she was at the event Saturday night and heard a series of gunshots ring out. People then began to run, she said.\n\nHampton, a senior public relations and advertising major, said this year's Field Day was the busiest she's ever seen. The chaos caused on campus was not by students, but by others who didn't go to the school.\n\n\"This was a good event that got out of control because of one or two people who came in from the outside,\" Hampton said.\n\nButcher said events like Saturday's too often eclipse positive aspects of student life at Delaware State.\n\n\"The only thing that gets televised is the bad stuff,\" Butcher said. \"But nobody is out here taping when we're out doing community service, giving to the youth, going to visit the jails, having motivational speakers here.\"\n\nJeff Montgomery can be reached at 463-3344 or jmontgomery@delawareonline.com.

And across the state, there have been more shootings so far this year — 234 — than all of 2019 (186) and 2018 (146).\n\nOfficials and experts have given several explanations for the uptick, including the coronavirus pandemic, more guns on the street and social unrest over the summer.\n\nTHE UPTICK:Add gun violence spike to growing list of issues plaguing Delawareans during pandemic\n\nDover police said officers were called to Schutte Park at 9:39 p.m. Sunday after receiving a 911 call about shots fired.

Another man, a 22-year-old, was shot in the shoulder and hand and also treated at Bayhealth.\n\nWright was a student at Delaware State University, police said. The other victim was not, and though many of the attendees at the party were students, the event was not sanctioned by the university, police said.\n\nIn a statement, Delaware State University spokesman Carlos Holmes said the \"university community is profoundly saddened and troubled by tragic death of Devin Wright and the event surrounding his death.\"\n\nOfficers said Wright and the other victim were injured when a shootout occurred between \"multiple suspects.\" They did not elaborate on what led to the shootout, but this is not the first party with Delaware State University students that has ended in violence.\n\nEarlier this month, a person was shot several times at a party in Dover Park that involved university students. And in 2015, a school-sanctioned fraternity and sorority event that drew 3,000 people resulted in three people being shot.\n\nREAD:26-year-old man shot at Dover Park Sunday night\n\nAt the time, Holmes said the shooting \"was not in the absence of security.\"\n\n\"It was not in an absence of planning,\" he said in 2015. \"We were pleased with how the whole event was going until that very last hour.\"\n\nWhen asked about whether school officials were concerned about the size of the gathering, given the coronavirus pandemic, Holmes said the university \"is not ready yet to comment beyond\" the statement about Wright, given \"information is still being gathered in connection with the incident.\"\n\nGov.

The complaints included claims that many sexual assaults have gone unreported for fears they will not be taken seriously.\n\n\"We're just trying to bring awareness to student rights,\" said one freshman in attendance, Micaih Lloyd. \"Not all students feel safe on campus.\"\n\n\"We're supposed to be at a place where we feel loved, where we feel at home,\" Lloyd added. \"Administration needs to make a change.\"\n\nDirector of News Services Carlos Holmes stressed that all students have a right to free speech, and some university officials watched the afternoon demonstration themselves. This included Police Chief Bobby Cummings, who spoke to students gathered in front of his department.\n\n“Bottom line is, students have expressed serious concerns about this,” Holmes said. “And the university is listening.”\n\nHow DSU is responding\n\nPresident Tony Allen plans to meet formally with student organizers to gather more perspectives on these concerns, Holmes said. Every sexual assault reported to campus police is investigated, he added.\n\nFrom August 2022 to the day before this protest, Jan. 17, the university’s public crime log shows seven reports of rape on campus. Each case is marked as pending.\n\nChief Cummings told students even one assault report is too many.\n\n\"It’s never acceptable,\" Cummings said. \"But we investigate every incident.\"\n\nOne hurdle, he said, is trying to get information from witnesses. Cummings encouraged anyone with information on these cases to speak with campus police.\n\nHis comments were met with shouts from students, matching choruses of “Less conversation and more action.” Students also said campus police have been slow in responding to incidents, and when they arrive, nothing results from reports.\n\nPhotos:Angry DSU students speak out during anti-sexual assault protest\n\nCalls for action, answers\n\nDelyah Fleury said she often feels afraid walking across campus at night, and the sophomore hopes a protest will bring more accountability.\n\n“I hope to see some changes and better safety measures,” Fleury said. “They need to be truthful if the Police Department is understaffed. And if it is, they need to do something about it.”\n\nCommunication needs to be improved, too, she said, between students, police and administrators.\n\n“When something happens, you just get a text message. There’s no big announcement, no meetings. We need to know what we can do to protect ourselves,” Fleury said. “There’s nobody we can go to. Who do we call?”\n\nShe said resident advisers are helpful, “but they’re not MMA fighters. We need people who are trained to protect us.”\n\nSenior Morghan Walker of Baltimore said it was important for her to attend the protest to show solidarity against sexual assault because she's had friends who say they experienced it.\n\nWalker feels safe half of the time at DSU, she added. But recently, she said, she began carrying a stun gun because the claims of sexual assault have become more frequent lately.\n\nWhile she stands with sexual assault victims, Walker said she wishes victims would provide more context about their claims because the term \"sexual assault\" sometimes gets misconstrued.\n\n\"Sexual assault is not always rape. Sexual harassment is not always rape. It could've been a grope, a touch, or it could've been something that someone said,\" Walker explained.\n\nStudents also demanded action from administrators and student government leaders. Many asked for details about what the administration is going to do to respond to reports of sexual assault and to improve safety.\n\n“The university is ready to make any adjustments necessary,” Holmes told Delaware Online/The News Journal. “We just need to have more discussions.”\n\nWhat's been happening at DSU?\n\nThe protest comes as the Dover institution just celebrated enrollment milestones.\n\nDelaware State University marked a 40% expansion in the last decade by fall 2022, welcoming the largest class of 1,700 freshmen and more than 6,200 total students for the first time in its 131 years.\n\nDSU also shared a No. 2 ranking among public schools and No. 8 ranking among all Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the country that fall — vying among other institutions of higher education established before the Civil Rights Act aiming to foster African American students.\n\nMORE TO READ:Colleges are shrinking.

In addition to the shooting at the Cookout, which occurred around 8 p.m., shots also were reported to have been fired at about 1:15 a.m. Sunday in the area of the University Courtyard Apartments. No injuries were reported in that incident.\n\n\"There are going to be earnest discussions about safety and what we can do,\" DSU spokesman Carlos Holmes said. \"Safety is paramount.\"\n\nThere were disturbances at last year's Cookout, though nothing as serious as a shooting.

It was not in an absence of planning,\" Holmes said. \"We were pleased with how the whole event was going until that very last hour.\"\n\nHolmes said ample DSU police officers were on the scene and that local law enforcement was made aware that crowds would be on campus, which is why Delaware State Police and Dover Police Department officers were able to assist as quickly as they did. Holmes said the school was well-prepared to deal with the crowds.\n\n\"Delaware State University is a safe campus. We have a tremendous police department, a fully certified police department with fully certified officers,\" Holmes said. \"Just like other municipalities have police patrolling the city, incidents still happen. All it takes is one person to do one thing.\"\n\nCampus police have not reported any arrests in connection with the shootings and have not confirmed reports that the shooter was not a DSU student.\n\nThe school continued to withhold the identities of the victims, other than to say none were DSU students. All three remained hospitalized.\n\nDSU has funneled all comments from both its administration and police through Holmes. President Harry L. Williams, through Holmes, declined an interview Monday.\n\nSome students and media reports have confused the Cookout, which was held in the late afternoon and evening, with Field Day, an event held earlier in the day.\n\nDaron Smith, 21, a Delaware State University junior from Newark, said he is the first member of his family to go to college. On Saturday, he brought a cousin down from Philadelphia to the cookout in hopes of showing him what a great experience college can be.\n\nThat's why he was so upset by the shooting.\n\n\"We're trying to bring people here and show them what DSU is all about, and then somebody comes here and does something like that,\" Smith said. \"It's just so disappointing.\"\n\nLike many DSU students, Smith blamed the violence on \"outsiders\" who came onto DSU's campus.\n\nOn Monday morning, Smith sat on a picnic bench in the space dedicated to Iota Phi Theta, of which he is a member, in the lawn where sororities have \"plots\" that sport their colors and insignias. DSU fraternities and sororities don't have houses, but the plots provide a place where they can gather and hang out between classes.\n\nThroughout Saturday afternoon, Smith said that lawn was the epicenter of the party, full of students and their friends and delicious-smelling barbecue smoke.\n\n\"It was going really well,\" Smith said. \"We were all having a great time.\"\n\nThe event was supposed to be over around 9 p.m. Smith said he believes the gunshots came from behind the DJ booth, just off of the Greek lawn.\n\nSome members of the Dover community worry that incidents like this unfairly give the school a bad name.\n\n\"You hear about these outsiders, and it's very troubling,\" said C.V. Holmes, pastor at New Jerusalem Baptist Church in Dover, which is just down the road from DSU and counts school families and employees among its congregation. \"I think it's possible that the school gets a bad reputation that it doesn't deserve.\"\n\nPastor Holmes said he thinks the school ought to hand out passes for events like these, similar to the way graduation ceremonies are handled.\n\nHolmes, the DSU spokesman, said the university will consider security changes in the future, but would not likely want to stop the events like the Cookout from happening.\n\n\"We want our students to be proud of their university. We want our students to feel like they can call up a friend at UMES, or Howard, or Morgan State or UD and say, 'hey come to our campus,\" he said. \"While we are in discussions on how to improve safety, I don't think we're going to just shut the door.\"\n\nSmith, the DSU student, hopes the Cookout continues.\n\n\"It's just such a great way for us to sort of have some fun and take our minds off things,\" Smith said. \"It's a really positive thing, and I think it's such a shame that somebody did something like this and turned it into something negative.\"\n\nReporter Jennifer Rini contributed to this story.

News Journal\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. — A State Police trooper was gunned down in the parking lot of a Bear Wawa shortly after noon on Wednesday and a suspect in the officer's killing remained barricaded in a home north of Middletown, said Nathaniel McQueen Jr., superintendent of State Police.\n\nThe trooper's name was not released.\n\n\"This is a sad day for our state and Delaware State Police family,\" McQueen said. \"We ask that you keep the trooper's family and the members of the Delaware State Police family in your prayers.\"\n\nDozens of police converged on a home on the 500 block of St. Michaels Drive in the Brick Mill Farm development, north of Middletown, where a suspect was barricaded alone, said Master Cpl. Gary Fournier, a state police spokesman.\n\n\"The suspect has been firing shots at the police officers from the residence he lives in and is currently holed up in the house,\" Fournier said.\n\nRelated:\n\nFallen Pa. state trooper to be laid to rest with honors\n\nAriz. man who saved trooper says reaction was 'visceral'\n\nPolice maintained a perimeter around the home as they attempted to negotiate a \"peaceful end\" to the conflict, Fournier said.\n\nSources with knowledge of the investigation said the man barricaded inside was 26-year-old Burgon Sealy, Jr. In 2013 Sealy was charged northeast of Orlando for possession of a small amount of marijuana and possession of a concealed weapon, according to the Volusia County (Fla.) Corrections. He presented a Delaware driver's license when stopped.\n\nA Middletown neighbor who lives on the block identified for The News Journal the home where the shots were fired, and county records indicated the property is owned by Burgon Sealy Sr. Although state officials would not release the suspect's name, police confirmed the suspect holed up in the home lives there with his family.\n\n\"The suspect has been firing shots at the police officers from the residence he lives in, and is currently holed up in the house,\" Fournier said.\n\nMcQueen said the deceased trooper was responding to a \"suspicious\" vehicle at the Wawa on the 1600 block of Pulaski Highway, with two people inside.\n\n\"Shortly thereafter, trouble ensued,\" McQueen said.\n\nOne of the vehicle's occupants exited the car and shot multiple times, striking the trooper, McQueen said. The trooper died at Christiana Hospital.\n\nKevin Lerner, was eating when he witnessed the trooper approach a vehicle in the parking lot. He said the shooter pushed the trooper before running backward a short distance and opening fire.\n\n\"When he turned around he spun around and had his gun already ready and he started shooting,\" Lerner said. \"That officer didn't look like he was doing anything wrong but just asking him for his (identification) or whatever.\"\n\nPolice arrested one of the vehicle's occupants at the Wawa. Investigators on the scene were able to track the other man to the home north of Middletown.\n\nPolice maintained a perimeter around the home as they sought to negotiate a \"peaceful end\" to the conflict, Fournier said.\n\nOn the corner of Dove Run Boulevard and Brick Mill Road, four ambulances appeared to be on standby with emergency personnel out of their vehicles and staring toward a helicopter hovering in the distance. County police in body armor and four New Castle County cruisers were prepared to escort them.\n\nThe flurry of activity spread fear among local residents, and state police advised those who live nearby to stay inside.\n\nThe police action blocked Middletown resident Robert Dalton from his home, a five-minute drive away. He spent the time tracking news in his car near Brick Mill Elementary School and trying to contact his wife.\n\n\n\n\"I've been calling her to tell her to lock the doors, but she hasn't picked up,\" he said.\n\nMcQueen did not take questions in a 5 p.m. ET update. It was unclear whether the barricaded man was believed to be the gunman.\n\nBear resident Justin Little was walking into the Wawa when he heard about five gunshots.\n\n“When I went in the store, everyone was screaming, trying to hide and everything,” Little said. “When I went outside, people were trying to help him [the trooper].”\n\nLittle said he didn’t see the shooter and the officer was chest-down on the parking lot pavement. He said the officer appeared to have been shot multiple times.\n\n“When he was on the ground, I was looking at his face, and he did not look alive at all,” Little said. “People were pushing on his chest, and he began gasping for air.”\n\nClarence Travers said he was sitting at the red light along Pulaski Highway next to the Wawa when he heard gunfire. He looked over to see a police officer in a blue uniform fall to the ground.\n\nHe said a man then got out of his vehicle, came around the car and proceeded to shoot the officer on the ground multiple times.\n\nHe said the man then ran, and Travers pulled away from the intersection.\n\n\"I wanted to get away from that,\" he said in the parking lot where police convened.\n\nMonica Moore said she was driving by the Wawa when gunshots rang out. She looked over to see a state trooper on the ground face down, she said.\n\nImmediately, people rushed to his aid and began performing CPR, she said.\n\nMoore stopped because she wanted to help and said she called 911. Dispatchers told her police were already en route, she said.\n\n\"I saw him and just wanted to help,\" Moore said.\n\nState police, New Castle County and unmarked police vehicles with lights and sirens sped into the Christiana Hospital parking lot at 1:15 p.m. Security was heavy at the emergency room entrance, with numerous police, and hospital constables.\n\nTributes came in from local politicians and law enforcement agencies. Shortly before 1 p.m., University of Delaware Police asked Facebook followers to keep a wounded Delaware State Police officer in their prayers.\n\nFollow Brittany Horn, Esteban Parra and Xerxes Wilson on Twitter: @brittanyhorn, @eparra3 and @Ber_Xerxes", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/26"}]}

Patients of its Rehabilitation Services were permitted to continue to use the facility for a $30 per month fee. They notified the members in mid-July by letter saying they were making a “difficult business decision.”\n\nSeveral members, including myself, wrote to Dr. Janice Nevins, CEO of Christiana Care, and Mr. Kevin Bailey, director of Rehabilitation Services, asking them for clarification on their decision and to possibly reconsider. We were seeking to understand their rationale and, hopefully, to arrive at a solution that would allow us to maintain our participation in this program. I sent a petition with the signatures of 103 members to both Dr. Nevins and Mr. Bailey.\n\nMy letter and the petition have been met with silence. Nothing. No email. No phone calls. No letter. The members are not a financial burden, do not interfere with the operation of the facilities and are an asset in attracting patients and in providing encouragement to their patients. The therapists and staff recognize our contribution. Our absence would, in our opinion, be a net loss to Christiana Care.\n\nChristiana Care's mission statement says that they create “… innovative, effective, affordable systems of care that our neighbors value.” Eliminating this program is retrogressive and not innovative. Live up to the words of your mission statement; don’t eliminate this program; work with us to find a better answer.\n\n—Michael Piovoso, Wilmington\n\nIt's clear which auditor candidate is best qualified\n\nI strongly support Kathleen Davies for our next state auditor. I believe that anyone who researches the candidates for this important office will do the same.\n\nKathleen is the only candidate with a day of state government auditing experience. In fact, she has 25 years of it. The state auditor role cannot be learned as you go. It requires specialized knowledge, skills, and education, all of which Kathleen possesses.\n\nThe position also requires leadership and people management skills, which Kathleen has a long record of demonstrating.\n\nThe state auditor role requires independence, integrity and tenacity. Kathleen has those qualities in spades. She is serious about guarding taxpayers' hard-earned tax dollars from fraud, waste and abuse. Her audits and investigations have uncovered corruption and fiscal mismanagement leading to state and federal charges. And she does not allow political and personal considerations to affect her work.\n\nFinally, Kathleen has a vision for the State Auditor's Office, an office that has grown stagnant under the same leadership for the past 29 years. Kathleen repeatedly details the changes necessary to make the office really serve Delawareans again, and she has the proven ability to enact those changes as state auditor.\n\nKathleen is not a career politician. This is her first time running for office, and she has no political aspirations beyond this office. She is a public servant in the truest sense.\n\nI encourage readers to research the candidates for themselves and then join me in supporting Kathleen Davies for state auditor.\n\n—Eva Klaess Barnett, Newark", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/01/23/how-a-lack-of-snow-is-impacting-delaware-whats-in-the-forecast/69825246007/", "title": "How a lack of snow is impacting Delaware. What's in the forecast?", "text": "Without more snow this winter, the \"trace\" so far in Wilmington would tie a record from 1997-98.\n\nSome businesses that plow snow or sell shovels and salt have seen a drop in revenue.\n\nDelaware could save money on plowing and labor costs if the lack of snow persists.\n\nKevin Patterson has been in the landscaping and snowplowing business for 37 years, and he can remember only one other winter with less snow than this.\n\n\"I think it was about 15 years ago, maybe 2008. We barely had any snow, and it was so warm we started mowing grass in February,\" said Patterson, the owner of A-1 Kevin's Landscaping in Smyrna.\n\nWith just a flurry so far this winter in Delaware, there haven't been any plowing or shoveling jobs, which he estimates are about 10% of his business in a typical year.\n\n\"We don't count on snow. It's a bonus,\" Patterson said. \"But it's nice when we do have snow. It means we have money in the account before spring to get started ordering what we need for landscaping jobs.\"\n\nPlus, he's stuck with a lot of salt he has to store.\n\nHowever, there has been a bright spot. With the mild temperatures and no snow on the ground, he's been able to work on some landscaping projects.\n\n\"The calls have been trickling in. We've been busy about three days a week,\" he said.\n\nHis employees aren't getting as many hours, and some have had to file for unemployment.\n\nWhat to do during mild winter:Visit one of these ice-skating rinks open this season.\n\nAt Rommel’s Ace Home Center in Dover, assistant store manager Frank Horrigan said normally in the winter, the store sells a lot more salt, shovels, scrapers and products to clear ice off windshields.\n\n“We have a whole lot left over so far,” Horrigan said.\n\nA winter storm usually helps perk up business between the holidays and spring.\n\n“It’s just a slow time unless we get snow,” he said.\n\nDelaware may save some money with lack of snow\n\nThe Delaware Department of Transportation budgeted $10 million this fiscal year for all storm-related cleanups, which include snow, said C.R. McLeod, DelDOT director of community relations.\n\nBecause we’re not even halfway through winter, McLeod said, it’s difficult to estimate how much will be saved right now, but whatever isn’t spent carries over to next year’s storm budget.\n\n“If we do not have any snow events, we will save on overtime pay and the cost of purchasing more salt and equipment costs that occur,” McLeod said.\n\nWhen there's no snow to plow, the maintenance and operations employees have other duties including repairing potholes and guardrails, fixing drainage problems, cleaning litter and trimming trees, but they don't get the overtime hours as they do plowing during winter storms.\n\nWhere does this winter rank in the history books?\n\nFor Wilmington, the lowest snowfall in AccuWeather’s records is a “trace” in the winter of 1997-98, said James Piro, AccuWeather climatology supervisor.\n\nThe second lowest total is 0.9 inches in the winter of 2019-20.\n\nThe record snowfall for Wilmington for one season is 72.7 inches in the winter of 2009-10. The 46.9 inches in February 2010 is the record for one month in Wilmington, Piro said.\n\nThis year, the city has received only a trace.\n\nArchives from the Environmental Delaware Environmental Observing System for the Delaware Department of Transportation snow removal reimbursement program go back to 2009 on the DEOS website. In that time, the least number of measurable snowfalls in the state has been three, in the winter of 2019/2020.\n\nWhat's the forecast for the rest of the season?\n\nWhile long-range weather forecasting is challenging, this year’s winter prediction for Delaware from AccuWeather has been right on the money.\n\nIn October, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Paul Pastelok said the forecast called for a milder winter with less snow than normal in Delaware. AccuWeather snow predictions for nearby cities were 14 to 20 inches in Philadelphia, compared with the average of 23.1, and just 6 to 10 inches for Washington, D.C., compared with the average of 13.7.\n\nSee the prediction:How much snow will Delaware get this winter? It could depend on La Niña and a volcano\n\nOn Jan. 19, Pastelok gave an update about the causes of the mild winter so far and a possible twist in February and March.\n\n“It starts with La Niña,” he said.\n\nOne of the factors meteorologists check in making long-range forecasts for the United States is the temperature of the central and east-central Pacific Ocean near the equator, which influences the jet stream and the overall weather patterns in North America.\n\nThis year, the water temperature near the equator is cooler than normal, known as La Niña, which usually means moist and cold air coming together in the West, causing most of the snow and colder temperatures to stay west of the Appalachians, instead of hitting the Mid-Atlantic.\n\nHowever, water temperatures in the northern Pacific were warmer than normal, allowing the wind flow from Asia to be carried directly to the West Coast of the United States.\n\n“It’s flooded the nation with so much Pacific air,” said Pastelok. “We haven’t gotten a lot of Arctic air.”\n\nThe warmer-than-normal Atlantic Ocean is also contributing to the lack of snow in the Mid-Atlantic states.\n\n“We’ve had a lot of systems going up the Ohio Valley, keeping the Mid-Atlantic coast on the east side of the storms,” he said.\n\nThe La Niña effect is expected to weaken as spring approaches.\n\n“It looks like the Northeast, the New England area, has a better chance for colder weather and snow, but Wilmington could be on the edge,\" Pastelok said.\n\nIf the polar vortex weakens and Arctic air moves south, “all that cold weather we didn’t get so far, unfortunately, we may get at the end of February and closer to spring,” he said.\n\nReach reporter Ben Mace at rmace@gannett.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/12/05/delawareans-new-peta-tweet-ridiculous-and-useless/2214408002/", "title": "PETA tweets asking users to stop using 'anti-animal' sayings.

Brown say 'that's not a loss'? Eagles lose 2 more starters till playoffs\n\nNFL DRAFT HUB: Latest NFL Draft mock drafts, news, live picks, grades and analysis.\n\nThat's because an Eagles' win over New Orleans not only locks up the NFC East crown and the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs, but it also virtually guarantees that the Saints' first-round draft pick will be in the top 10 of the 2023 NFL draft − and not No. 19 or worse.\n\n\"I mean, obviously our motivation is to win the division and to get the first-round bye, which is all in our grasp now,\" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. \"Well, this game directly affects both of those things, and the draft status. ... It will be sweet if we can go out there and get this win, and then once we're making the draft pick (in April), we can say to ourselves, 'Well, that really did help us out.'\"\n\nIncredibly, that isn't even the top trade/transaction with the Saints dating back to 1995. At least not yet:\n\n8. April 2006\n\nTo the Eagles: fourth-round pick\n\nTo the Saints: DT Hollis Thomas and fourth-round pick\n\nWho won? The Saints, by a lot. Thomas, an icon during the Eagles' run of four straight NFC Championship games, had three fairly productive seasons with the Saints. But New Orleans walloped the Eagles in this deal when they turned the fourth-round pick (No. 108) into guard Jahri Evans. Evans played 11 seasons with the Saints and was selected to six Pro Bowls. The Eagles moved up to No. 99 and also took a guard in Max Jean-Gilles, passing on Evans. Jean-Gilles started 26 games in three seasons. The Eagles picked the wrong guard.\n\n7. April 2009\n\nTo the Eagles: seventh-round pick and 2010 fifth-round pick\n\nTo the Saints: fifth-round pick\n\nWho won? The Saints, by a lot. New Orleans used that draft pick punter Thomas Morstead, who spent 12 seasons with the Saints, was selected to the Pro Bowl and was a Super Bowl winner. The Eagles traded the seventh-round pick to Indianapolis, and the Colts used it on another Pro Bowl punter in Pat McAfee. They traded the fifth-round pick and WR Brandon Gibson for LB Will Witherspoon. Witherspoon, who played 12 seasons in the NFL, only played 11 games with the Eagles, with 58 tackles and one sack.\n\n6. August 2006\n\nTo the Eagles: WR Donte' Stallworth\n\nTo the Saints: LB Mark Simoneau and 2007 conditional fourth-round pick\n\nWho won? Draw. The Eagles had traded for Simoneau in 2003, and he had two productive years before losing his starting job in 2005. Simoneau had two productive years for the Saints. Stallworth had a solid season for the Eagles, with 38 catches for 725 yards. But he left after the season as a free agent. Stallworth played five more seasons in the NFL and also served a one-year suspension.\n\n5. August 2017\n\nTo the Eagles: seventh-round pick\n\nTo the Saints: LS Jon Dorenbos\n\nWho won? Dorenbos. The long snapper had played in 162 straight games, still the Eagles' record. But Dorenbos had lost his job that summer to Rick Lovato. Shortly after the trade, a routine physical showed that Dorenbos needed immediate heart surgery to correct an aortic aneurysm. Dorenbos never played again, but the trade saved his life because he wouldn't have had a physical otherwise. The Eagles returned the draft pick.\n\n4. August 2022\n\nTo the Eagles: S Chauncey Gardner-Johnson and a seventh-round pick\n\nTo the Saints: fifth-round pick in 2023, and the later of two picks in the sixth round in 2024\n\nWho won? Eagles, by a lot. Gardner-Johnson became an instant starter at safety and is still tied for the NFL lead in interceptions with six despite missing the last four games, and possibly at least one more, with a lacerated kidney. The reason why this isn't an all-time steal is that Gardner-Johnson can become a free agent after the season, and thus sign with another team. Still, Gardner-Johnson is a big reason why the Eagles are the best team in the NFL.\n\n3. March 2014\n\nTo the Eagles: Darren Sproles\n\nTo the Saints: fifth-round pick\n\nWho won? Eagles, by a lot. Sproles made the Pro Bowl in each of his first three seasons in Philly. There wasn't a more dangerous punt returner in the NFL as Sproles returned four punts for touchdowns. He also had at least 700 yards from scrimmage in each of those three seasons as a running back and receiver. Injuries hampered Sproles in the next three seasons. The Saints used the pick on LB Ronald Powell, who played just the one season in the NFL.\n\n2. April 2022\n\nTo the Eagles: first-round, third-round, seventh-round picks in 2022; first-round pick in 2023 and second-round pick in 2024\n\nTo the Saints: two first-round picks in 2022; sixth-round pick in 2022\n\nWho won? Eagles, by a lot, and possibly a lot more. The Eagles used the No. 18 pick from New Orleans to trade for WR A.J. Brown, who has 1,304 yards receiving this season. The Saints used the No. 16 pick from the Eagles to trade up to No. 11 for WR Chris Olave, who has 940 yards receiving. The Saints took T Trevor Penning with the other pick from the Eagles, at No. 19. Penning missed the first 10 games with an injury.\n\nAn Eagles win Sunday will make the trade even more lopsided because that will eliminate the Saints from the playoffs, meaning that the Saints' first-round pick to the Eagles won't be No. 19 or worse. In fact, another Saints loss should guarantee that first-round pick is in the top 10. In addition, the Eagles also have the Saints' second-round pick in 2024.\n\n1. March 2014\n\nThis isn't a trade, per se. But the Saints allowed S Malcolm Jenkins to become a free agent so they could sign a different free agent safety in Jairus Byrd. The Saints gave Byrd a six-year contract worth as much as $56 million, while the Eagles signed Jenkins to a three-year deal worth $16 million. Byrd lasted three seasons in New Orleans, playing in 33 games with three INTs and one sack. Jenkins, meanwhile, lasted six seasons, never missing a game and rarely missed a defensive snap. He had 11 interceptions, 406 tackles and 5½ sacks. He was also a tremendous leader.\n\nThe Saints signed Jenkins in the spring of 2020, and he played his final two seasons in New Orleans.\n\nUpdates on Hurts, Lane Johnson, more\n\nSirianni said quarterback Jalen Hurts is still recovering from his sprained shoulder and would not speculate on whether he'll play Sunday or even practice. The Eagles held a walkthrough on Wednesday and will have a full practice Thursday, which would be a true indication of Hurts' availability.\n\nAs for right tackle Lane Johnson, who has torn adductor muscle, the NFL Network reported that Johnson will forego surgery and try to return for the playoffs. Sirianni wouldn't confirm that, other than to commend Johnson's toughness. Johnson will sit out the final two games of the season. Sirianni would not say who would replace Johnson. It could be Jack Driscoll, Andre Dillard, or even possibly moving Jordan Mailata from left to right tackle while having Dillard play left tackle. \"I’m not going to give that answer because then I give the Saints that answer,\" Sirianni said. \"We have a lot of options.”\n\nThe Eagles have not yet opened the practice window for safety Chauncey Gardner-Johnson, making it unlikely that he'll return this Sunday against his former team.

That, and the other amenities were expected to be built and ready for use within two years of the first building permits being issued.\n\nNow, after years of controversy, and more than 12 years of waiting for those first residents who moved in in 2005, the clubhouse is complete and open for business.\n\nREAD MORE: Hockessin's Valley Road eyed for housing development\n\nThe $14.4 million bond that new developer Ocean Atlantic put up as an assurance the clubhouse would be built, was released last month, said Greg Tobias, a partner in Ocean Atlantic.\n\nThe company, which purchased the development in 2014 along with more than 600 unsold building lots, hosted an open house to show off the clubhouse for residents and prospective new ones on Saturday. They had an earlier event in December.\n\nThe development was approved by Sussex County Council in November 2002 as a residential planned community of 1,404 homes on 787.7 acres. The land, long known as The Bay Farm, has been owned by Townsends and was farmed to produce feed for their extensive poultry operation. Townsends initially tried to develop the site but ultimately sold the land to Riera-Odyssey Ventures LLC, the original developer.\n\nThe project commenced amid the building boom. When the economy crashed, sales slowed in the development and the bank that provided financing ultimately took over. That bank was purchased by Wells Fargo, which took ownership of the unsold lots at a sheriff’s sale in September 2013.\n\nResidents in the community pressed Sussex County officials to force construction of the clubhouse. Wells Fargo sought and received an extension to complete the clubhouse by December 2016. The county ordered The Peninsula to submit a $14.3 million letter of credit or bond for the clubhouse if it wanted to continue pulling building permits.\n\nThe new clubhouse is open only to residents in the community and their guests and all must purchase one of three membership types, Tobias said.\n\nThey have more than 700 members and the development is about 55 percent complete, he said.\n\nThe clubhouse was a long time coming and Saturday, Kim Thaler said she was pleased with the facility.\n\n\"Love it,\" she said. \"We wanted to be part of a country club\" community.\n\nThe building has views of the golf course and Indian River Bay.\n\nSTORY: Big bucks pour into Delaware Senate race\n\nSTORY: Police: Elk's head goes missing after party\n\nDesigner Matty Adler said Chris and Preston Schell, partners in Ocean Atlantic, initially wanted a typical, dark wood clubhouse design.\n\nBut Adler said it was hard to get beyond the idea that the location was on the water.\n\n\"I designed it twice,\" he said.\n\nThe first time was with the traditional clubby look, he said. And the second was like a club you might find in a resort like The Hamptons, he said.\n\nWhen the Schells saw the two designs, he said, \"they said you're right.\"\n\nThe interior is bright, with colors that reflect the nearby views like the blues of Indian River Bay, the tans of the beach and the wood tones from nearby forests.\n\nThe building includes a full service restaurant, a pro shop, a card room, a billiard room and a small dining area for private parties called \"The Wine Room.\" The dining room includes a pizza oven that is overlaid with a sailor's valentine of shells done by Lewes shell artist Constance Miller. Miller is Chris and Preston Schell's aunt.\n\nOn the lower floor are locker rooms and a golf simulator.\n\nOn Saturday, Ethan Jack and his son, Mason, played a simulator round at Pebble Beach.\n\n\"It's a life-sized video game,\" Ethan Jack said.\n\nKathi and Dave Martin already had a second home in Rehoboth Beach when they told friends they would help them find a second home at the beach.\n\nThey noticed the billboards along Del. 1 advertising The Peninsula so one day, they stopped by to visit.\n\nLong story short, they ended up buying a home there.\n\nKathi Martin said one of her biggest concerns was whether she would be able to meet people and make friends.\n\n\"It's a great place to socialize,\" Dave Martin said.\n\nTobias said the community has ended up being completely different than others in the area and is more similar to the golf-centered planned communities in the Carolinas.\n\nThe new clubhouse fit the lifestyle of people who settle in the development, he said. \"We're ecstatic and the members are ecstatic.\"\n\nContact Molly Murray at (302) 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.

Newport developer Greg Pettinaro has controlled the property for several years. The housing plan won approval in September.\n\nWegmans\n\nPettinaro is redeveloping Barley Mill Plaza at Lancaster Pike and Route 141.

I love her!” the 50-year-old rasped in a smoky voice as she snuggled the razor-toothed animal like it was a baby. Then Fran stretched her right arm out in front of her, and the opossum instinctively coiled its tail around it and hung upside down like her arm was a tree branch. “But I gotta give her a bath, ‘cause she’s got fleas on her a little bit.”\n\nFran lives in Detroit’s Delray neighborhood, on a short, dead-end street along the banks of the Rouge River. Her front yard is a wide, weedy field where a whole block of houses and stores once stood. Her backyard is Zug Island, whose blackened, steel mill smokestacks tower behind her home, belching smoke and fire at all hours, infusing the air with the smell of chemicals.\n\n“They let out some nasty stuff at night. You can see it,” Fran said. “My cat had cancer, and the doctor asked me where I live and I said, ‘Delray.’ He goes, ‘You live by any factories?’ And I said, ‘Yeah, duh, Zug Island.’ He said, ‘Oh my God, your cat’s full of cancer.’ Told me to move.”\n\nBut this is home. Her whole life has been lived in Delray, on a street so remote the police couldn’t find it when she called them this summer about someone trying to crawl through a window into the empty bedroom of her son, who died here unexpectedly at five days old from a birth defect. Her brother Tom lives next door in a house that’s identical to hers, except it’s got plastic sheeting on the windows, holes in the front porch and a furnace that doesn’t work. Their brother Kevin lives down the street in a ramshackle house their deceased parents owned, the home where these siblings grew up, in the neighborhood that’s all they’ve ever known.\n\n“My neighborhood is nice,” Fran said. “It’s just peaceful down here. You go across the tracks, that’s when it gets bad. Yeah, you don’t want to go across the tracks when it’s nighttime. You find bodies — girls — all the time. Like the other day, my brother was driving down the street and they found a girl dead.”\n\nIn a city with plenty of rough neighborhoods, Delray is regarded as one of the worst. It’s been called Detroit’s backwater, its underbelly, the bowels of the region — which it literally is, in a sense, since the city’s wastewater treatment plant is here, receiving and incinerating the contents of everyone’s toilets in Detroit and 77 surrounding communities and filling the air for miles with a God-awful stink. .\n\nThe neighborhood lies in southwest Detroit, a few square miles roughly between Fort Street and the Detroit River, and from South Leigh Street to Clark. It’s one of the most diverse parts of the city, split roughly into thirds of white, black and Hispanic. It’s among the poorest. And after losing 90% of its residents since its peak, it’s one of the most abandoned.\n\nThose left here say they feel under siege — by a city trying for years to get them to leave, by factories and industrial plants polluting their air, by criminals using their neighborhood to commit crimes in secret. But residents also speak of a bond in their shared isolation, a defiance toward those who look down on them as hayseeds, and a sense of anarchy and freedom that — for better or worse — can’t normally be found in a big city like Detroit.\n\nFran stood by her front gate next to her 62-year-old brother Tom, who was holding her cigarette while smoking his own. She asked him to hold her possum while she ran behind her house to feed her potbelly pig.\n\n“No way,” said Tom. “Every time I hold her she pees on me.”\n\nThe pig lives in a doghouse, sharing a muddy lawn with two chickens, three dogs and six cats. Fran, who is unemployed and gets by on disability checks, is known around Delray as an animal lover, because anytime someone comes by with a stray she takes it in, even if the animal is technically livestock. That’s not unusual around here — a guy just blocks away had a horse in his yard for a while. Many folks have chickens. And a lot of people own several guard dogs, because there’s a feeling if there’s trouble out here, in this rural part of town, they’re on their own.\n\n“It’s desolate,” said Tom, a retired trucker. “Ain’t nobody down here. You call the cops, it takes them three hours to get down here.”\n\nDelray was founded more than a century ago as a small village on the river. Before being swallowed by Detroit it was the area’s fastest-growing suburb. But after years of decline it’s gone back to being a small village, with a big difference — now it looks like a village the day after the end of the world.\n\nThe people are almost all gone. The houses are missing. The stores are boarded up or bulldozed. Whole blocks are empty and overgrown with weeds and grass. The air stinks like sulfur and sewage. Residents wake up some mornings to find a thin film of mysterious industrial powders coating their houses and cars. Studies have found higher rates here of all kinds of bad things, from asthma to cancer.\n\nDelray is Detroit’s ghost town, a landscape of empty streets that are eerily quiet except for the constant hammering sounds and banging noises of all the industries here.\n\nThe old village didn’t become this way by chance. Years ago, Delray was sentenced to die.\n\nBack in the 1960s, the city decided that this neighborhood, already polluted and crowded with industry, should become entirely industrial. City officials figured if they zoned out new housing and moved enough factories and plants here, people would eventually get the hint and move out. It made sense to concentrate industries in one part of the city, and it made sense to get residents away from the most polluted part of town.\n\nIt was assumed that people would be eager to get out of such an inhospitable, unhealthy place. Yet for all these years, a dwindling minority of die-hard residents has stubbornly refused to go. For them, Delray is home. A familiar, comforting, neighborly, stinky home.\n\nNow, the city is trying one more time to convince them to go. The long-planned new bridge to Canada is slated to land right in the middle of Delray, and the 170-acre customs plaza that will spread outward from the bridge’s footprint will wipe out much of the old neighborhood, splitting what’s left into two isolated pockets of semi-empty blocks. Those who choose to stay will be subject to a whole new level of noise and pollution. So the city is making an unprecedented offer to give residents another house someplace else in the city for free, plus a whole bunch of money to fix it up.\n\nThe city’s offer has generated interest among many residents, who’ve expressed eagerness to learn more. Some of them have said they can’t wait to get out. But despite the forthcoming offers, there are many longtime residents who say that no matter how bad it gets, they’re staying.\n\n“I don’t think I’d leave, I guess, because I’ve never left the block. Been down here all my life,\" Fran said. \"It’s home to me.”\n\nDelray was once a thriving village, a charming riverside community of beer gardens and houseboats populated mostly by Hungarians who immigrated to the region chasing the promise of jobs. They had their own stores, banks, bakeries, restaurants, auto dealerships and movie theaters, plus a hospital and a library along River Street, the town’s main drag, a glamorous strip which for years was simply called “The Avenue” and which buzzed day and night with activity.\n\nThe area got the name Delray from Augustus Burdeno, an early settler who’d served in the U.S.-Mexican War in the 1840s and thought the growing village he returned to on the Detroit River reminded him of a town called Molino del Rey that he’d seen in Mexico. The other settlers took a vote and in 1851 adopted an Americanized version of the name.\n\nDelray was incorporated as a village in 1897 with about 5,000 people. At one time, it had eight Hungarian churches within a mile of each other and several Hungarian language newspapers, earning it nicknames like “Little Hungary” and “Hunkytown.” It was also a party town — 33 of the 97 businesses in Delray at the beginning of the 1900s were saloons.\n\nThen, everything changed. Starting in 1889, the village held an annual event called the Detroit International Exposition to showcase the area and draw businesses and industries to it.\n\nIt worked. First came a glue plant, then a rendering plant. Village leaders reeled in the first big one when the Solvay Process Company came in 1894, attracted to the site by the natural salt deposits found there, which it used to make soda ash, its main product. The chemical company quickly modernized Delray, providing the village with paved streets, sewers, its first hospital and a horse-drawn, four-wheel fire truck operated by Solvay employees.\n\nIn 1905, Delray’s 7 square miles, along with neighboring villages Woodmere and Springwells, were annexed by the City of Detroit after a special vote in all three suburbs, whose residents thought the move would speed up modernization.\n\nThat worked, too. Early on the city decided that Delray’s riverfront was an ideal spot for industries to concentrate. In 1901, Detroit Iron Works built two blast furnaces for iron-making on Delray’s Zug Island, which was artificially carved from the mainland when a shipping canal was dug to allow ships to pass through more easily. In 1903, Detroit Edison opened a power plant in Delray, followed soon by Peerless Portland Cement Co, Allied Chemical and Fleetwood Metal Body. Dozens of smaller companies joined them.\n\nThe Ambassador Bridge opened in 1929 just outside the neighborhood’s east border, bringing thousands of commercial vehicles streaming through the area. By the late 1920s, the village had been transformed from a quiet suburb to an industrial zone, and thousands of simple, low-cost houses were quickly built around the factories to accommodate all the newcomers who came seeking jobs.\n\nFran’s and Tom’s houses were among them. They live in one-story, cookie-cutter homes built a century ago and rarely updated since. And now theirs are the only surviving houses on their block. Barely.\n\n“The roof leaks, the porch is falling in, I have no heat — my furnace crapped out on me so I have to use electric heaters in the winter to keep my pipes from freezing,” Tom said, leaning on his front-yard fence, smoking a cigarette, gazing past the empty field across the street where the only functioning business is a bar whose patrons, he said, like to come outside and drunkenly fire their handguns in the air on Saturday nights. Tractor-trailers and dump trucks bang along Jefferson Avenue — kicking up dust, shaking the houses and making a racket every time a tire hits a pothole.\n\n“Look at the windows, how I got all the windows hooked up,” he said, pointing to the plastic sheets that were covering them. “I mean, I keep it clean, I keep it clean inside, but I don’t have much to work with. You know, I have no money. I’m on Social Security. I only get a thousand dollars a month. What am I gonna do with that? Once I pay the bills I’m broke.”\n\nHe lost the house a few years back, when he stopped paying property taxes and the county auctioned off his home for a few hundred dollars. The buyer came by, took one look at this sagging old heap of wood and shingles, said forget it, and wrote off the loss. Now it’s Tom’s, again. And he’s behind on his taxes, again.\n\nA black Mercedes rounded the corner from Jefferson. Nobody around here owns a Mercedes. That meant that, once again, an outsider had come to remote Delray to do something they wouldn’t do where they live — to get high, get a prostitute or get rid of something — trash, tires, furniture, a body.\n\n“I think it’s suburbanites coming down here and dumping,” Tom said. If he sees someone doing something illegal, he bursts out of his house and confronts them with his camera phone. “You don’t do that shit in Sterling Heights, do you? Or Lincoln Park or where ever you’re from,” he yells at them.\n\nTom followed the car’s path with his eyes as it made its way to the alley behind his house, a choice spot around here for bad behavior.\n\n“Actually, I don’t care what they do as long as they don’t dump,” said Tom, who found a pile of soiled couches left behind his house just a few days before. “Right here behind this building, there’s a big cement pad back there. I come home from work one night and they were right out there on the hood having sex. Right on the hood! I pulled up there, I says, ‘Hey, when you’re done, don’t forget to clean up your condoms,’ 'cause they take them off and throw them all over the ground back there,” he said, laughing.\n\nThis time, as the driver of the Mercedes rolled to a stop he noticed Tom watching him. The visitor hit the gas and took off.\n\nNeighborhood life wasn’t always like this for the McCrackens. Their parents first came to Delray from the Niagara Falls area in the ‘60s, lured by all the factory jobs, and settled in what was a dense, family-friendly neighborhood.\n\n“When we first come to Delray you didn’t have to leave Delray for nothing,” Tom remembered. “We had everything — we had a drugstore, we had a five-and-dime, we had two meat markets, we had a laundromat, we had a bowling alley, we had a movie theater, furniture stores.\"\n\nBy then, though, the neighborhood had long been emptying out. The population dropped from almost 24,000 in 1930 to about 20,000 in 1940, and down to just more than 17,000 in 1950. There was another small influx of Hungarians fleeing the Soviet crackdown in Hungary in 1956, and the city’s Housing Commission placed a small number of families in the area in the late '60s, many of whom lost their homes in the 1967 riot. But despite the newcomers, the population of Delray continued to decline as the children and grandchildren of the original immigrants moved to Downriver suburbs like Taylor, Allen Park and Wyandotte. The mom-and-pop businesses soon followed them. By 1970, the population was under 13,000 and plummeting.\n\nThe expansion nearby of I-75 in the ‘70s required the demolition of hundreds of Delray homes, as did the steady growth of the wastewater treatment plant, which the city built in 1940 and expanded steadily thereafter until it became the largest of its kind in the country.\n\nIn the face of all this, a City of Detroit Master Plan issued in 1955 and a 1963 federal study of the city’s riverfront both recommended that Delray should eventually become solidly industrial. In 1965, the common council approved the plan.\n\nStubborn residents fought the change at each step of the process, as in 1969 when 1,200 Delray residents chartered buses, jammed the common council chambers to protest a planned incinerator at the riverfront site of the defunct Solvay Process Co., and convinced members to vote unanimously against it.\n\nBut small victories like that didn’t stop an unmistakable trend. The depopulation continued, the protests grew smaller, and the crack epidemic of the '80s and the crime wave that came with it further emptied the area out. Between 2000 and 2010, a third of the remaining residents left. The last census data from 2014 generously estimated the neighborhood’s population at about 2,100.\n\nThat small core represents the die-hard Delray residents who have stubbornly refused to go — those with deep roots here, with generations in the same homes, and with longtime neighbors that have become like family, or in the case of people like the McCrackens, actually are.\n\n“I’ve been down here for 49 years and it’s really sad to see all the houses go,” Fran said. “People set them on fire, they squat in the houses. But what can you do? It’s Delray.”\n\nA man came walking down the street, looking downward as he scrolled on his smartphone, so he didn’t notice Fran’s barking dogs running out of her yard’s open fence and charging at him.\n\nIt was A-Ray, said to be the local pot dealer, suddenly surrounded by three barking pit bulls. “Hey!” Tom shouted to the dogs as he ambled over and grabbed them by their collars to drag them away.\n\nBut one of the dogs, a pit bull named Lucy, broke away and merrily followed the guy as he walked, wagging her tail. It was Fran’s new dog, her third now. And the dog was familiar with A-Ray.\n\n“I knew her as a pup,” A-Ray explained to a surprised Tom. “When my brother had dogs, she was in the litter. That’s why she’s following me.”\n\nA-Ray’s brother is known around Delray as Peanut, and Peanut kept this pit bull as a guard dog, but Peanut was headed to jail, and that’s how Fran got yet another pet. “He has to get rid of his dogs and asked me if I could take her and I said, ‘Don’t do this to me, Peanut.’ ” Fran explained. “He said, ‘I know you’ll take care of her.’ He’s goin’ to jail for a long time.”\n\nThe cops arrested Peanut in May because he ran a blind pig out of a house on nearby Vanderbilt Street, and a 24-year-old Detroit woman named Asia Nash vanished from the party one night and was found lying dead the next day in a nearby field with two gunshot wounds to the back of her head.\n\n“They found that dead body on a Sunday morning,” said Harriet McPhail, who lives on Vanderbilt, a few doors down from Peanut’s now-empty home. “My mom was going to church, and they seen the body laid out there, all the people going to church that day.”\n\nThe victim had tried to rip off a drug dealer, Fran had heard. Her last hours were spent at this house, police had heard. So they raided the place.\n\nHarriet, 47, and her sister Pam, 52, sat on their front porch, drinking iced tea, smoking cigarettes, reading Cosmopolitan magazine. Wind chimes dangled above them. Iron bars protected the front door behind them. A wood sign by a window read, “The McPhail Family” in quaint lettering. A small American flag was affixed to it. Harriet had the day off work at a property management company downtown; Pam was unemployed and collecting disability after falling down the basement stairs and breaking her neck.\n\nThe McPhail sisters have spent most of their lives here, along with their mother, Gloria, 77, the house’s owner. Their brother Ken and his wife Kim own a house a few doors down. Their nephew Ken Jr. lives a few houses from that one. Like the McCrackens, the McPhails have remained in the neighborhood where they’ve been for years, largely because of family and familiarity.\n\nIt was lively for a while around here, they said, what with an after-hours club operating for two years in an old house a few doors down from theirs. “Loud music, fights, women dancing, stripping,” is how Harriet summed it up. Police put a stop to it in a hail of flashing lights a few days after the murder. The sisters had hoped the neighborhood would return to its former serenity after that. But they were wrong.\n\nThere once was a beautiful school at the end of their block, on West End Street, one of the main arteries crisscrossing Delray. Built in 1894, McMillan School had wide brick archways, decorative stone relief accents and a central tower featuring a large outdoor clock. It was an ornate capstone to Delray’s finest neighborhood. Generations of local children were educated there until their numbers dwindled. The school survived a threatened closure after protests by parents in 1993, but it was shut down for good in 2001. It spent years as an abandoned eyesore, stripped bare by looters and torched by arsonists until it was finally torn down in 2009.\n\nAnd on the empty lot left behind, a cement company had recently set up shop, providing materials for the rebuilding of the nearby freeway, which was getting new ramps to accommodate the new bridge that’s coming to the area.\n\nThat site embodies the history of Delray in miniature — from grand to grimy, from family oriented to industry dominated. The temporary cement plant brought a lot more noise and pollution to the McPhail family’s doorstep. And it sentenced the family matriarch to a life of confinement inside her house.\n\n“It’s causing a lot of disturbance in the neighborhood with all this traffic and dust,” Gloria complained in a soft voice. “That’s one of the reasons I can’t be outside.”\n\nShe sat in the family’s living room, sunk into a plush couch, hamstrung by lung disease, tethered to an oxygen tank, watching television with the windows closed and the curtains drawn. Still, she wasn’t fully protected from the Delray air.\n\n“Sometimes I can smell it in here,” she said. “It’s a terrible odor.”\n\nCity officials knew that life for Delray residents like the McPhails would become worse when the new bridge — and the related activity that comes along with it —became a reality. So in June, Mayor Mike Duggan announced that the city would offer Delray residents who live outside the state’s buyout zone — the land that will be physically occupied by the bridge's footprint — an empty, tax-foreclosed house somewhere else in Detroit, as well as up to $60,000 to improve their new home.\n\nThe money came from an agreement the city reached to sell 36 city-owned parcels of land, underground assets and about 5 miles of city-owned streets in the path of the new bridge to the state in exchange for $48 million. Of that money, $23.6 million is to be used to offer homeowners in Delray the chance to move to another neighborhood. For residents who choose to stay, another $9 million will go toward soundproofing their homes and monitoring the air quality around them.\n\nTo Harriet and Pam, this sounded like a great offer. They’ve had enough of the shrinking neighborhood. They were ready right away to take the money and run. But it wasn’t their decision to make.\n\n“I’ve been wanting to go,” Harriet said. “But it’s my mom. To her, this is her home. She purchased this home. It’s hers. Why should she leave it? That’s how she feel about it. It’s home to her.”\n\n“I love it here,” Gloria explained. “I’ve been here a long time. My church is over here. My family is over here.”\n\nForty years ago, Gloria and her late husband, Chester, moved here from Manhattan. They came to Delray to escape the burgeoning crime of New York, to live in a family oriented neighborhood, which Vanderbilt Street has always been. Even Peanut, the after-hours club owner, set up his blind pig just a few doors down from where his grandfather lived for years, where he used to play as a child.\n\nBut then Gloria’s neighbors left, their houses went away, Chester passed away from cancer, and the big trees that once gave shade to families in the summertime now loomed over empty lots, providing only a reminder of all that had been lost.\n\nAnd yet, she never left. “It’s nothing like it used to be,” Gloria admitted. “But it is home. This is home.”\n\nBut as the piles of gravel and sand grew at the cement plant, as the dump trucks and concrete mixers in the neighborhood increased in number and the air became choked with dust, Gloria finally broke. Maybe it was the emergency trips she had to take to the hospital, or the unexplained morning nosebleeds, or the blood she was spitting up, but she reluctantly began thinking of the flyer on her fridge that spoke of the city’s offer to get out.\n\n“All these factories and things, and all this dust, is not good for my breathing,” she said. She planned on attending a community meeting to hear what city officials had to say. “I’ve been over here a long time, so it’s going to be kind of bittersweet. But for my health I need to try to do better. I need to try to help myself.”\n\nNobody knows why 29-year-old Amanda Lynn Benton drove from her home in suburban Melvindale to a rough southwest Detroit neighborhood in the middle of the night in September last year. Nobody knows why two young men carjacked her, beat her viciously and threw her into the trunk of her own car. And nobody but those young men knows why they drove to Delray and chose a vacant house on Vanderbilt Street in which to toss her body and start a fire.\n\n“They dumped her in that house down there,” said Harriet, pointing down the street to the spot where yet another corpse was disposed of in Delray.\n\nAfter the woman’s charred remains were removed and the yellow police tape was taken down and the suspects were arrested and charged, the house sat wide open, an aura of grisly death still lingering, until the minister from a church around the corner got fed up and boarded it up himself.\n\n“That’s how our neighborhood is,” Harriet said. “We do stuff like that.”\n\n“Yes we do,” said Elder Charles Heath Jr., pastor of 2nd Chance Christian Ministries a block over, who had pulled up moments before in his burgundy church van. “The city never came out,” he said. “They did bring us the wood after we cried out. It was some people who was there putting up stuff, dolls, and we saw it and they told us what had happened. I didn’t know they found a lady dead in there. I said, ‘We need to board this thing up.’ It was five of us. Spent the whole day cutting down weeds just to get in there.”\n\nHeath had been at a west-side church until four years ago, when his bishop assigned him to this part of the city that he’d never heard of before. He moved into a former Hungarian church that was abandoned years ago.\n\n“It’s a tight community,” noted the pastor. “The people that are here are people that’ve been here for years, and they’re protective of one another. But you got all this stuff in the air, people are getting sick from that. That’s what’s hurting the people. Stuff like that has taken the zeal from them, from wanting to do something. You complain about stuff, it doesn’t get done.”\n\nHe was here to visit Iola Patterson, the McPhails’ elderly next-door neighbor, at a home where Smokey Robinson was singing from a boombox that someone had brought outside, and charcoal smoke was billowing from a grill set up on the sidewalk. Relatives were visiting from out of town, a barbecue party had broken out and a growing crowd of neighbors and family was gathering under the big tree next to the sidewalk.\n\nThey were all aware that a new, publicly owned bridge to Canada has been in the works since 2004, with the American end to be located squarely in Delray, and with the costs covered by the Canadian government, to be repaid by tolls. They’d all heard of Manuel (Matty) Moroun, the sole, private owner of the aging Ambassador Bridge, whose perennial but unsuccessful lawsuits aiming to stop the inevitable financial competition from the new bridge have delayed its completion until at least 2022. They’d all seen the flyers that said the city would offer to find them a home elsewhere before the new bridge makes Delray even more inhospitable than it already is. But they were undecided whether they’d go.\n\nThe woman hosting the barbecue was a good example of this reluctance. “Mother Patterson, she’s been here a long time,” the pastor said. “She can’t afford to go somewhere and move and start all over again.”\n\nAs the men of the family grilled outside, Mother Patterson — as she’s respectfully called around here — was inside her house, in the hot kitchen, making peach cobbler and baked beans. She lives here with her daughter Martha, 65, and son-in-law Jeffrey Robinson, 64, whose daughter Jennifer, 25, lives across the street with her husband Dilbert, 31, whose toddlers were playing at the grown-ups’ feet.\n\n“Everybody’s related,” Jeffrey said, sipping a beer, referencing everyone on the block with a sweep of his hand. “I take pride in that, man.”\n\nMother Patterson came out to the covered front porch to take a break from the heat of the kitchen. The 85-year-old moved very slowly, using a walker, and finally settled in an old chair that her guests patiently and carefully situated as she sat back. Her chihuahua stood by her feet and barked at everything it saw.\n\n“It's depending on what kind of money they offer me,” she said. “If it’s where I can have family and friends around, I wouldn’t mind it, but I would rather stay right here. Got a little garden right back there, a lot of vegetarian stuff, you know? I can plant some right here and eat off of it right there. I had tomatoes up here this tall as my mailbox, so I like that.”\n\nJoyce Moon, a family friend, sat next to her on the porch, dressed as if for church, holding a cane, watching over the woman she says is like a second mother.\n\n“Well, they’ve been trying to take over Delray for many, many years,” said Moon, 53. “It’s a nice area. I feel they shouldn’t have did that — take it over, all different kind of companies. A lot of my old friends are gone. It’s very quiet now. My sister says it looks like a desert out here. She doesn’t like coming back here anymore. But life goes on. Things change.”\n\nShe, too, grew up here, on nearby South Schroeder Street, where now there remains just a single house whose owner has spray-painted his frustration with the changing neighborhood in graffiti phrases like “No Bridge!!” and “Tyranny is now!!!” right on the vinyl siding. But Moon moved away long ago to another, faraway part of Detroit as her neighbors abandoned her street one by one. “You know, there’s not going to be a Delray,” she warned.\n\n“Well, I’ll just have to find another Delray,” said Mother Patterson, trying to think of a comparable place. “I don’t know. I’ll probably find somewhere out in the country.”\n\nBang! A dump truck hit a rut in the road and made a jarring noise that could be heard for blocks. So did the 18-wheeler behind it, and the cement truck that followed, and the bulldozer after that, as this daily parade of industrial activity drove down the busy Delray artery of Dearborn Street, past Vanderbilt Street where the family barbecue was being held, past the empty fields that stretch on for blocks now, past a shack of a gas station that’s the only place in town for the McCrackens and the McPhails to get their cigarettes, and past the corner of Cobalt Street, where, a few houses down, Mike Donovan could hear every one of those trucks banging by.\n\nThe noise doesn’t bother him. Nor does the smog drifting over from Zug Island, nor the train’s blasting horn as it passes through the neighborhood, nor the stench of the sewage that fouls the breeze that ripples the plastic that covers his windows.\n\n“This is an industrial area and I believe in industry,” he said firmly. “I ain’t against business. They run a little business out, all of our people’s out of work. Pollution — they holler about clean air, everybody wants to breathe clean air. But every time they close one of them companies down because of the Clean Air Act, where’s it go? Japan or China or something. They’re working, and we’re out of work.”\n\nThe retired 73-year-old was sitting outside on his front porch, shirtless in the sunshine, a wild bush of white hair atop his sunburned head. His daughter Mindy, 34, and unemployed, sat next to him, wearing a do-rag, smoking a cigarette. Their dozen or so chickens pecked at seeds in their backyard coop. Their two dogs barked whenever a stranger passed.\n\nTheir house is just off a dead-end street, up against a shipyard, surrounded by collapsing houses and junk-filled yards. It might look rough here, Mike said, but it’s always been safe. Unlike on the other side of the tracks, as everyone west of those tracks likes to say. “Go a little ways on this side of Livernois it’s pretty decent, but you go farther toward town, don’t walk there at night,\" he said. \"It’s just that simple. It’s completely different. It always has been.”\n\nForty years he has lived here. And in all that time, none of the ills that Delray residents complain about have bothered him. “We were always used to the industrial neighborhood, so the train and the trucks and stuff, I don’t even hear it,” he said dismissively. “You just go to sleep.”\n\nIt’s not so easy for his neighbors. Lisa Roland lives across the street with her husband, Marc, and their four kids in a rickety house whose paint is peeling, whose upstairs window is broken and whose cobbled fence barely holds back two snarling pit bulls that bark incessantly at visitors. A small American flag juts out from a homemade mailbox.\n\nDelray is full blast in her face. The Fisher Freeway soars high to the side of her yard, providing a soundtrack of constant traffic and the odor of exhaust. Bright lights set up to illuminate the freeway’s ongoing, bridge-related construction used to shine in her house all night, keeping her family awake. Underground blasts from the nearby salt mine would shake everything in the house. A billboard towering across the street blots out much of the sky. And the lush, overgrown field beneath it provides a home to critters like foxes and groundhogs and other animals not normally found in a big city. “I swear I seen a coyote over here about two years ago in the winter,” said Lisa, 41. “I stay as far away from there as possible.”\n\nYears ago, when the gas station on the corner was built, a sewer pipe got crushed, and now every time it rains hard or there’s a fast snowmelt, everyone’s basement on this block backs up with sewage. But nobody dares complain, Lisa said.\n\n“I would bet my life savings that none of these houses would pass a city inspection,” said Lisa, who’d seen Mike and Mindy Donovan sitting outside in the early afternoon and walked over to sit and smoke with them. “None of us would. So we don’t complain because we’re kind of stuck. We start complaining, they start wanting to get in.”\n\nThat’s one reason Mike won’t go to the community meetings where the city’s offering home improvements to those who choose to stay here. He doesn’t trust the city, hates politicians and thinks such offers of assistance are scams.\n\n“They’re gonna have people down there to offer you inspections for your houses, they’re gonna bring people in to fix up your stuff, low interest and all that,” he said. “Any of these old houses, ain’t none of them gonna pass inspection. They’re a hundred years old or better. They’ll bring them in, give you a big bill when they’re all done, and they’re still gonna move you out. So anybody who lets them inspectors in to start inspecting their stuff, as far as I’m concerned, is crazy. It’s just a way for them to suck them in.”\n\nHe has no intention of taking the city’s offer to leave, either. His house is crumbling, but it’s his. It’s paid off. His property taxes are only about $500 a year. There’s no place else where he can move and live this cheaply. This neighborhood is home, and his neighbors are family. His daughter stays here, and his son lives only blocks away.\n\n“The people in Delray right now is happy with Delray,” he said. “Everybody gets along. Nobody bothers us. We don’t have problems down here, we don’t have the crime like everybody thinks we got. A lot of people are scared to come down here. They are. I got friends, I tell them I’m in Delray — ‘Oh man, we can’t go down there.’ ”\n\nMindy agreed. “Even, like, the people that get lost down here because of the freeway construction, I kind of feel sorry for them, ‘cause they look so scared,” she said. “It’s not really that bad, but they get lost when they get off this exit.”\n\n“Here in Delray is probably as low as you’re going to go,” Lisa said. “We make the east side look good — that’s how people view us. They view Delray as the last stop in Detroit, the last step before homelessness. ‘You stay in Delray?’ I can’t tell you the looks that Mindy and I have gotten. ‘Yeah, I stay in Delray. I’m proud of where I’m from. That’s my home.’ ”\n\nHer family moved here from Chicago 34 years ago. Lisa’s mother, Vivian, owned the family house; when she died, Lisa moved in. Her stepbrother lived next door. Like the McCrackens and the McPhails and the Pattersons and the Donovans, hers is another Delray family that stayed in the neighborhood where they’ve lived for years because their relatives have stayed here too.\n\n“We’re family oriented,” Lisa said. “Your neighbors become your family. They watch out for you, they watch out for your kids, they watch out for your house, your cars. We take care of one another.\"\n\nPlus, there’s the freedom they can’t find anywhere else. Here, they don’t have city officials bothering them over pesky rules and laws and ordinances, like they do elsewhere.\n\nFor example, Mike noted cheerfully, when he owned a trucking company years back, he could bring home his 18-wheelers and leave them in the streets and empty fields near his house without ever getting a ticket from the city. “It was perfect,” he said. “I could park one in the middle of the street, leave it all winter, who cares? My buddies live in the suburbs, they couldn’t even take theirs home and wash it.”\n\nInside Mike and Mindy's house, the living room walls are covered in faded family photos — pictures of kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews, interspersed with portraits of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary. And high above everything, on a shelf atop the fireplace, alongside candles and crosses and garlands of rosaries, sits a portrait of Mike’s late wife, Theresa, next to an urn holding her ashes. She died two summers ago, at age 70. From cancer.\n\nLisa’s mom died not long before her, at age 66. From cancer.\n\n“A lady around the corner — the Garcias — her mother died of cancer,” Lisa noted. “She also grew up in Delray. She was in her 50s.”\n\nCome to think of it, they all noted, a lot of people in the neighborhood have died from cancer.\n\nSo many things could be causing this, they speculated, from now-gone companies like waste-oil processor Sybill, cited more than 100 times by the county for air quality violations before it went bankrupt in 2001; or the Wayne Soap Company, which boiled animal entrails from slaughterhouses and routinely caused nausea for a radius of miles around it before closing in the 1990s; to current businesses like the Marathon refinery in neighboring Oakwood Heights, which, for years, left wind-spreading piles of petroleum coke along the Delray riverfront and whose ZIP code has been named the most polluted in the state; to Peerless Metal Powders across the railroad tracks, which was the subject of neighbor complaints, state citations for emissions violations and a lawsuit in 2000 by residents who feared the effects of the strange red dust that fell on their Delray neighborhood and killed their plants and grass.\n\nNow add the emissions from thousands more commercial trucks streaming over a new bridge from Canada every day, and things will only get worse. Yet none of them gathered in the living room planned to leave.\n\n“It’s one of those trade-offs — move to the suburbs where everything is clean and fresh and you don’t have to deal with it but you can’t afford it, or stay here and live somewhat comfortable knowing what your money situation is,” Lisa said.\n\nShe’s making barely more than minimum wage at a sausage plant, her husband’s unemployed after an injury, they’re behind on their property taxes and they have no savings at all. Even if they wanted to leave, they can’t afford the taxes and upkeep of a new home. At least here in Delray, you can live on next to nothing.\n\n“I’m not going to find this somewhere else,” Lisa said. “I mean, I might find a house, but I’m not going to find a home, and that’s really the basis of it. They might give me a house, but they’re not going to give me a home. They’re not going to give me everything that’s associated with a home.\"\n\nBy contrast, over on the other side of Livernois, the part of town that lies across the railroad tracks where Mike said he wouldn’t walk at night, George Chene couldn’t wait to get out of his Delray home.\n\n“I ain’t gonna miss this house,” said the 39-year-old with disgust.\n\nHe was standing shirtless in front of a two-story shell of rotting wood, peeling siding and broken windows where he’d lived for several years with his 63-year-old girlfriend Linda Mynes and Linda’s unemployed 42-year-old daughter Marion. Like a lot of Delray homes, it was old and it was falling apart. And today was their last day here. It was moving day.\n\n“There’s so many memories I’ve had in it over the years. A lot,” he said. “Other than that, I can’t wait to get out of here.”\n\nThat’s because a lot of those memories were bad. George pointed to his stomach, on which he’d gotten tattoos listing the names of all the relatives and friends who’d died recently, along with their birth dates and death dates, in blue cursive script.\n\n“My dad had a stroke getting into the shower,” George said, his finger touching each name on the list as he spoke. “Leon died from the swine flu. Arnold died from a massive hernia; I mean, it was the size of a brick right here sticking out. And then Gary died of a heart attack. And Johnny also died of a heart attack.” The last one, Johnny, used to live in a broken-down motor home parked at the side of the family’s house after Linda had taken him under her wing like a forgotten stray, and Johnny’s name still needed to be added to the list on George’s belly. People around him were dying quicker than he could save up for a new tattoo.\n\nAll of these people had stayed in this house at some point, and nearly all of them died here. Johnny was found lying dead outside by the front door. Gary was found stiff in the yard by the dogs one morning. Arnold died upstairs in a dirty room, as his child slept in his arms, after the hospital sent him home and said there was nothing they could do for him after he’d neglected his health so long.\n\n“That’s why I hate this house,” George said. “It’s cursed.”\n\nLuckily for George, he and his family didn’t have to wait for the city to make him an offer. His house was on Dragoon Street, right where the new bridge’s customs plaza will be, and, as part of their process of assembling land, the Michigan Department of Transportation cut the family a check to leave this house and find another, better home somewhere else. Anywhere they wanted, they were told.\n\nFinally, they could get away from the smokestacks, the smells, the trains that would stall on the tracks and trap them on this street for hours at a time, the thieves bold enough to come to the door two days before Christmas and rob them at gunpoint of all their presents.\n\nGeorge lit a cigarette as he stood on the homemade plywood ramp he’d built for Linda, who's been confined to a wheelchair ever since she developed diabetes, then lost a leg, then lost her eye, then needed around-the-clock care. George had been a trucker, but his only job now was as a state-paid caregiver under the Home Help Medicare program, taking care of Linda.\n\nA borrowed tractor-trailer was backed up to the ramp, and it was already full of decades of belongings. Next to the house was a string of empty lots where their five dogs ran free, where the family had parked a half-dozen junk cars and where they’d left Johnny’s crummy old motor home, its nose still nudged against the house’s wall, like Johnny had been trying to snuggle right up to the house and be part of the family.\n\nTheir home was incredibly filthy. The walls were dirty. The floors were caked with mud. The windows that weren’t broken were covered in a smoky yellow film. The air stank of rot. And there were rat droppings everywhere — on the floors, inside the cupboards and streaming in trails out of the three fist-sized holes the rats had chewed into the baseboards of the kitchen walls. The infestation got so bad George bought poison, mashed it in Crisco grease and smeared it on the floors. That killed one wave of rodents. “But then the cockroaches came back that weekend,” he noted. And the rats died inside the walls, adding to the stink of the house. A new wave of rats came to replace them anyway.\n\nThat wasn’t half as bad as the bedbug infestation.\n\nAfter all that, it shouldn’t have been hard to convince the family to go. But Linda had been in the house for nearly four decades, and it wasn’t so easy to walk away. “It might have looked like garbage, but that was home,” she said. It was where she had her big shade tree out front, and the birds she’d watch every day, and the fold-out table by the sidewalk where everyone would go sit and talk and smoke cigarettes.\n\n“It was nothing less than five star to her,” said Linda’s stepson Brandon Mynes, 23. “She loved the house until the end.”\n\nPlus, there aren’t many rules in Delray, and Linda always liked that. “You can do what you want to do,” she said. “Like if I moved to River Rouge where my daughter is, your car would get ticketed every day if it’s parked wrong. And she’ll have a ticket if her grass isn’t cut. She’ll have a ticket if she don’t shovel her walk. We don’t worry about that. So that’s why I love it here.”\n\nThe family reluctantly hired a real estate agent. Combed through house listings. And after an extensive search, they found a new home they all agreed upon. Finally, they were leaving behind the rats, the bedbugs, the memories of death, the house crumbling around them. They were leaving behind Delray.\n\nAnd moving to Delray.\n\nThe family found a house barely a mile away from their old one — just outside the bridge’s footprint, across the railroad tracks, on the corner of West End. Now they’ll be twice as close to the wastewater treatment plant as they had been, half the distance to Zug Island, a half-mile from the Donovans’ block, a street over from the McPhails, down the road from Fran and her animals, a couple blocks from the coming entrance ramp to the bridge, and right next to the temporary cement plant that bangs with activity until late at night and keeps their new neighbor, Gloria, shuttered in her home.\n\nNone of that mattered to them, though. This house had new siding, a new roof, air conditioning and a fence around the yard for all the dogs. Most important of all, they got to stay in Delray. They could’ve moved anywhere they wanted. But they couldn’t say good-bye to this familiar, comforting, neighborly, stinky old place.\n\n“I got as close as I could to my old house,” said Linda, beaming. “I’ve lived in Delray all my life. I think it’s great here. It’s the best place to live. I wouldn’t live nowhere else. It’s my home. I love it here.”\n\nThe new house didn’t feel quite like theirs until a few weeks later, after they’d filled the clean rooms with all of their belongings, and deposited the empty tractor-trailer in the alley, and let the five barking dogs outside to run free around the property, and parked a bunch of old cars on the lawn, and brought Johnny’s sad, unused motor home and put it in the yard, its nose snug against the house, like it always had been. Now, it felt like home. As only in Delray a home can be.\n\n“Go walking in that new house, it’s just, man it makes you feel better to just be able to walk in there and just be able to say, ‘Hey, this is my home,’ ” George said. “It’s totally different, like wow, but at the same time it’s like the same, ‘cause I’m still in Delray.”\n\nJohn Carlisle writes about people and places in Michigan.

As those go down, gas prices are going up. Tap or click here for simple ways to find the best gas prices in your area.\n\nWhenever there's an event of mass impact, hackers, scammers and thieves take advantage of the situation.\n\nNote that scammers will contact you via calls, text, email or social media. If you have anyone older in your family, they are very susceptible to falling for these scams. Share this post with them on your social media or email this post with a link.\n\nHere's a list of scams we can expect to see as the Russia-Ukraine war heats up:\n\n1. Help, help, I’m stuck here\n\nHere’s an all-too-common trope: A scammer pretends to a family member or friend, claiming to be stuck somewhere and in need of money. One of the most common examples of this is the “grandparent scam,” in which a thief impersonates an older person’s grandchild and claims to be saddled with an expensive repair bill or even stuck in jail.\n\nIn this case, you may hear from a close contact who says they are stuck in Ukraine or Russia. Maybe they need money for a plane ticket out or claim to have lost their passport. They’ll raise the stakes, too, telling you they got robbed or all the banks are closed.\n\nThe scariest part is how easy it is to manipulate photos to back this up. A clever criminal can easily show your loved one in the Ukraine or Russia to make you believe it. Always check in with your loved one through another means of communication. For example, if they are texting, send an email or, better yet, give them a call.\n\nSPOT THE FAKES: How to tell if a photo has been manipulated\n\n2. We need your support now more than ever\n\nIn times of crisis, we turn to others for help or step up to assist. You need to be extra-vigilant about donating money to GoFundMe pages or other relief efforts right now. Scammers use our kindest instincts against us to steal money through fake aid campaigns.\n\nIf you are donating money through an organization like the American Red Cross, for example, be sure you’re on the actual Red Cross site and not a cleverly disguised phishing site. It’s easy to copy the look of a website and steal official logos. The real tipoff is the URL. Don’t rely on a link you received from someone or clicked on social media; navigate to the official website yourself.\n\n'IT WILL BE A LOT HARDER ON PEOPLE':How sanctions will impact ordinary Russians\n\nWANT TO SUPPORT THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE? These apps and websites can help you send money\n\n3. But it looks and sounds SO real\n\nToday's deepfake technology makes it easier than you'd believe in producing high-quality videos or audio clips of a public figure saying or doing something that never happened in real life.\n\nAs you encounter videos of Russian President Vladimir Putin and other political figures on social media or YouTube, keep your guard up. If the video is designed to make you angry or act in some way, it very well may be a disinformation campaign at work.\n\nRemember, disinformation videos are designed to look natural. It's not uncommon for these videos to use computer-generated image technology and paid actors.\n\nTap or click here to listen to my podcast on how the lies that spread on social media can change history.\n\n4. I have money, lots of money\n\nThis one is a twist on the old Nigerian Prince scams. Someone with a lot of money needs to move that money to leave the country – but they can’t do it without your help. Of course, you’ll need to pay transfer fees. If you receive such a message, report it as spam and delete it.\n\nScam texts aren’t just annoying. They’re one more way for tricky scammers to trick you into giving up your information or your money. Tap or click for tricks to spot scam texts and your best defense against them.\n\n5. I can show you how to time the market\n\nIn times of strife, there’s always someone looking to make a buck. The stock market and cryptocurrency are down, and that presents an opportunity – at least that’s what a crook wants you to believe. The same goes for pitches you get to invest in stocks from cybersecurity companies to ammunition.\n\nHere’s the truth: Anyone that who reaches out to you unsolicited with financial advice is in it to make money themselves.\n\n6. If I could just give my loved one a proper burial\n\nThe funeral scam surfaces during national tragedies, natural disasters and wartime: Pleas for money to bury deceased family members or money for plane tickets to attend a funeral. It’s easy to see why people fall for this ploy.\n\nEmotions take over, and you want to help. Treat emails or other communications with caution, and don’t send money directly to someone you don’t know through a payment app or website.\n\n7. I’m defending your freedom\n\nFraudsters won't just play on your emotions to help others. They will appeal to your sense of patriotism too. Think twice if you hear from someone claiming to be an American soldier stuck in Ukraine.\n\nThe American service personnel con may ask you for money, help get a message to their family, or supplies. Similarly, these requests can come from someone claiming to be a Ukrainian or Russian soldier too.\n\nRELATED: 5 silly mistakes putting your online privacy and security at huge risk\n\n8. Do as I say or else\n\nCybercriminals often use urgency to push us to make bad decisions. When you’re feeling flustered, you may do things you wouldn’t in a calmer state. That’s why phony calls threatening jail time from the IRS work so well.\n\nThat's also why fake emails or calls from your boss or a higher-up at your company work too. They almost always have an urgent tone, asking you to send money or information right now.\n\nIf you receive an unusual request, contact this person in another way to verify the request.\n\n9. It looks so legit\n\nGas prices are going up, and you can bet fake sites and apps that tell you where the lowest gas prices are in your area will be coming out of the woodwork. Don’t trust anything new that pops up.\n\nInstead, go with an established option you can trust. I like Waze and GasBuddy for this purpose. Tap or click here for a direct download link for GasBuddy and steps on how to use it.\n\n10. I will love you until the end of time\n\nRomance scams are incredibly effective. The FBI says victims of romance fraud lost $1 billion in 2021 – and that's just what was reported. Why do they work so well?\n\nWhen we’re falling in love or just attracted to someone, our defenses are down. We don’t want to believe that a beautiful woman or charming man isn’t who they say they are.\n\nBe on the watch for anyone who tells you they need to leave Ukraine or Russia immediately because of the war, and they want to build a new life with you. This scammer will send you photos, videos and even start sexting with you. Then, the money requests start for food, rent, and airline tickets to come to see you.

Or con artists hide behind a fake FedEx notice that says there's a delivery problem. We're not getting texts, yet, from celebrities.\n\nSo, who could imagine being tricked by a text from Drake?\n\nThe Drake in this scam, though, isn't the iconic rapper. Instead, it's a tax software company and scammers are impersonating Drake to typically target tax professionals and CPAs, not ordinary taxpayers.\n\nTax season, which kicked off Jan. 29 when the Internal Revenue Service started accepting and processing 2023 federal income tax returns, is prime time for scammers to hit us with phony emails and texts. The IRS expects more than 146 million individual tax returns to be filed this tax season, which has an April 15 deadline.\n\nWe're into a time of the year when a great deal of personal information is being moved around. Con artists want to gain access to Social Security numbers and other information that can be used, the IRS warns, \"to prepare authentic looking tax returns to collect a refund — or use it to commit other types of fraud.\"\n\nTax-related phishing scams and unsolicited texts even grabbed a top spot on the annual IRS \"Dirty Dozen\" list for scams in 2023. Some scammers, according to an IRS warning, will use the IRS logo in phishing attempts and claim something like \"Action Required: Your account has now been put on hold.\"\n\nBottom line: \"The IRS initiates most contacts through regular mail and will never initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text or social media regarding a bill or tax refund,\" the IRS reiterates.\n\nThe frightening part is that scammers are going after lots of data when they target a tax pro.\n\n\"Intricate email scams pose a real risk to tax professionals and the taxpayers they represent,\" according to an alert issued in early January by IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel.\n\nCybercriminals can be \"masquerading as real taxpayers looking for help,\" according to the IRS. Or they're impersonating the IRS, state tax agencies, software providers, and banks or credit unions.\n\nThe text relating to Drake asks the target to provide a copy of their electronic filing identification number account summary from IRS e-Services, with a status of completed, to Drake for verification. The identification number is used by tax professionals for the electronic filing of tax returns — and it's not something you'd want to hand over to scammers.\n\nIncreasingly, though, scammers are trying to steal a tax professional's e-Service account passwords and electronic filing identification number. Sometimes, the IRS notes in an alert, the scammers will pose as the IRS or e-Services.\n\nThe IRS said it continuously reviews electronic filing identification numbers and will inactivate numbers that are found to be compromised. But tax professionals are told to take steps, including using strong passwords and not opening links or attachments from suspicious emails. \"Most data thefts begin with a phishing email,\" the IRS states.\n\nMore:2023 brought booming CD rates for savers, but tax season realities are coming\n\nNow, even an email from a \"new client\" needs to be treated suspiciously.\n\nOne scam that is targeting tax professionals, the IRS warns, involves emails that pretend to be a \"potential new client\" who might say \"I am searching for another CPA to help handle my taxes.\"\n\nOne email noted: \"Is it safe to say that you are accepting new clients for the 2024 tax season? Do you additionally assist with IRS representation?\"\n\nThe IRS said the agency received hundreds of reports at phishing@irs.gov about these emails that pretended to be from new clients.\n\n\"The new client scam made up roughly two-thirds of the 400 reports of business email compromise or business email spoofing complaints that came in to phishing@irs.gov,\" the IRS stated.\n\nThe actual number of such scam attacks is far larger, of course, given the mass production of such messages.\n\nMore:IRS makes 'extraordinary transition' but delays remain involving ID theft, amended returns\n\nTax professionals say they're being inundated with such phishing scams.\n\n\"Scammers are always tweaking their scams. They're trying to come up with new ways for people to take the bait,\" said April Walker, lead manager for tax practice and ethics with the American Institute of CPAs.\n\nShe's received emails that pretend to be from potential new clients, which often include a link. Sometimes, the email will include an attachment of a W-2 or last year's tax return.\n\nWalker knows they are a scam; she doesn't even prepare taxes any longer as part of her job.\n\nWalker warned that it used to be fairly obvious that an out-of-the-blue email or a text was the initial step as part of a broader scam. But often scammers are trying very hard to make their emails seem more believable, such as trying to impersonate a friend.\n\nThe new phishing email might appear to be from a name you recognize, maybe a friend, colleague or recognized name in the community. That's often because your friend, colleague, or other well-known name had their email account credentials stolen.\n\nTax professionals, Walker said, must have an action plan in advance to respond to any data breach. Moving quickly is essential.\n\nFake emails present a great risk, especially if a tax professional downloads a potential client's tax information or accessing a site with the potential client's tax information.\n\nWhen that happens, the IRS said, cybercriminals could collect the preparer's email address, password and possibly other information — or load malware onto the tax pro's computer to gain access to the system.\n\nThe IRS recommends that tax professionals reach out to report data theft immediately to the local IRS stakeholder liaison. The liaison will notify IRS Criminal Investigation and others with the agency. \"If reported quickly, the IRS can take steps to block fraudulent returns in clients' names and take other steps to protect the tax professional their clients,\" the IRS stated in its alert.\n\nWe're also being warned about fake emails involving a request for an e-signature, which allow you to sign a document digitally. You might be asked to provide a password or other personal information. Or there might be a malicious attachment that could lead to download malware. You want to be extremely skeptical about such e-mails and be on alert for fake notifications if you aren’t expecting one.\n\nImpostors have been known to use forged documents, which you're asked to sign and then add some of your confidential information.\n\nAmber Gray-Fenner, an enrolled agent who regularly prepares tax returns for individuals and small businesses in Albuquerque, New Mexico, said she's received several phishing emails and some requesting e-signatures \"almost look legitimate.\"\n\nIn one case, she paused to step back and realize that she had given a different email to a contact regarding a conversation on e-signatures than the email address where she received the phishing email.\n\nOne email where the sender's name and email looked like a real person, she told me, had the subject line: \"Review 8879,\" which is an e-filing authorization form.\n\n\"Those forms do not go through e-mail in my office, and I don't accept e-mailed 8879s from clients,\" she said. \"They have to use my secure portal.\"\n\nGray-Fenner added that she has approved channels for \"accepting client information and e-mail is not one of them and my clients know it.\"\n\nBy not accepting information from clients via e-mail, she said, phishing attempts stand out from the legitimate e-mail that's hitting her inbox.\n\nSome red flags to consider, she said, include: any hand-drawn squiggles on the graphic; a notice that \"E-signature sent you a document.\" While that could happen when a user hasn't set up their e-signature account properly, she said, it's still a red flag. Any indication that the email was \"sent with high importance.\"\n\nGray-Fenner noted that most e-signature requests that she receives are from people she's working with directly, such as Realtors. And they don't come high importance.\n\nAlso pay attention to your own email account. If something is being sent to an email that you've given out often, it's more likely that you could be dealing with a scammer.\n\nIt's not an email from the IRS or a call from consumer watchdogs\n\nSome weeks, your head can spin with all the potential scams lurking around every phone call and text. Scammers are impersonating all sorts of government agencies, not just the IRS.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a warning in January about scammers who are using the names of employees at the federal consumer watchdog agency to try to sound more legitimate in their efforts to steal money.\n\n\"We’ve heard from people, specifically older adults, who received phone or video calls,\" the alert stated. Some scammers are claiming that the consumer could participate in a class-action lawsuit, or that they've won a lawsuit but must pay a fee or taxes upfront to collect some claims. Consumers can phone the CFPB call center at 855-411-2372 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday, if they want to confirm that a call is a scam. The CFPB doesn't make such calls.\n\nHackers also want more personally identifiable information about you so that they can open up credit cards, take out bank loans, and file a fake tax return to falsely claim an inflated tax refund.\n\nUnfortunately, all of this means we need to be more on guard — even when we're swamped with work or other challenges.\n\nVerify the identity of the sender by calling a phone number obtained elsewhere. You do not want to call the number provided in the email or text.\n\nDon't rush if you receive a request to update anything. Scammers impersonate everyone — health care insurers, 401(k) plan providers, your mortgage company and more.\n\nTax season is an extremely busy time for taxpayers and tax preparers, so scammers also try to strike when someone could be exhausted or under a great deal of stress.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

News Journal\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. — SevOne fell victim to a cybersecurity attack that has put current and former employees at risk for identity fraud.\n\nThe tech company has confirmed it released W-2 wage and tax data to an unauthorized recipient outside the company. That information is believed to include Social Security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth and other personal information criminals can use to file false tax returns and commit other forms of identity theft.\n\nThe \"unauthorized disclosure,\" which company officials said occurred Monday, was reported to current and former staff late Tuesday night in an email from SevOne’s chief legal officer Diane Pryon. A copy of the email was obtained by The News Journal.\n\n“We are actively working to understand the incident and at this time we have no reason to believe any other SevOne data was affected,” Pryon wrote. “We sincerely apologize to anyone who may have been affected and will send additional communications as further information is learned.”\n\nSevOne: Tech company strives for a 'culture of awesome'\n\nCompany officials declined to comment on the data breach, including details about how it occurred or how many people were affected, Wednesday.\n\nEarlier this month, SevOne laid off less than 10% of its global workforce, which numbered about 525 in late 2015.\n\nAbout 200 employees work out of the company’s Innovation and Technology Center at the University of Delaware’s Science Technology and Advance Research campus in Newark.\n\nThe company said it will be providing current and former employees with two years of free credit monitoring services to help them avoid being victimized by the “unauthorized disclosure.”\n\nCriminals behind the phishing scams use personal information gleaned from companies to make fraudulent tax filings to collect the returns. Pryon directed SevOne employees to file their taxes as soon as possible to pre-empt a possible false claim using the leaked data.\n\nSevOne’s data breach is believed to have been a cyberattack known as “spear phishing.” The scheme involves a “spoof” email that appears to come from a company executive requesting sensitive information from an unsuspecting employee.\n\nSevOne, a network infrastructure monitoring company with Fortune 500 clients, might be a high-tech business, but that does not mean its employees are any less susceptible to a phishing scam, said Greg Gurev, head of the Stanton IT security company MySherpa.\n\n\"This kind of thing has nothing to do with tech,\" he said. \"These scammers aren't attacking the tech by cracking your password. They're socially engineering their way in by exploiting a flaw in the human condition.\"\n\nSeveral companies across the country have fallen victim to spear phishing attacks in recent weeks, including the video messaging app Snapchat, California-based data storage company Seagate and Main Line Health in Pennsylvania.\n\nSmaller businesses ranging from concrete supply companies to landscaping businesses also reportedly have been suckered by the scam.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service issued a consumer alert about phishing and malware scams last month after recording a 400% surge in reports this tax season.\n\nThe IRS followed that alert with a March 1 warning to payroll and human resources professionals specifically regarding spear phishing schemes.\n\nNearly 800 criminals have been sentenced in the last year for IRS-related identity theft, but many email phishing scams originate overseas, making prosecution nearly impossible.\n\n“Some form of tax-related theft has always existed, but it’s something that has taken on new forms as our reliance on technology has increased,” said IRS spokesman Clay Sanford. “It’s unlikely these scams are ever something that can be completely eliminated.”\n\nSanford said similar email-based scams have been reported in which messages are sent purporting to be from the IRS, tax accountants and tax software companies. The messages typically seek information related to refunds, filing status, personal information or claim to require personal identification number verification.\n\n\"They often go so far as to use logos, fonts and false identifiers directly from our website,” he said. “Unfortunately, the best tool we have to prevent taxpayers from becoming victims to these types of attacks is raise public awareness.”\n\nThe IRS website includes several tips to avoid becoming a victim to scams. Those suggestions include learning how to recognize phishing emails, not opening email attachments from unfamiliar sources and using virus/malware protection software.\n\nGurev said companies also should routinely conduct a data security audit that maps out their sensitive data, where that information is stored and who can access it.\n\n\"You have to raise awareness in an organization and create a policy,\" he said. \"That way anyone who is asking you to transfer money or send information that's critical, your people know that data is not to be sent via email. At the very least, you walk over to your manager and get verification in person first.\"\n\nSanford also warned about lower-tech IRS telephone scams that have cost taxpayers an estimated $26.5 million over the last three years.\n\n“We don’t send unsolicited emails to taxpayers,” he said. “And we don’t call taxpayers requesting personal information without some written verification being sent in advance.”\n\nAnyone who receives an unsolicited email that appears to be from either the IRS or an organization closely linked to the IRS, such as the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS), can report it by forwarding the message to phishing@irs.gov.\n\nFollow Scott Goss on Twitter: @ScottGossDel", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/09/15/vevo-plays-despite-hack-accessing-3-12-terabytes-internal-data/669749001/", "title": "Vevo hacked via LinkedIn phishing scam", "text": "Music video site Vevo is the latest entertainment site victimized by hackers.\n\nHacking group OurMine early Friday posted more than 3 Terabytes of internal files accessed during a breach of Vevo, a music video platform majority-controlled by Universal Music and Sony Music.\n\nBy midmorning, most of the files had been removed from OurMine's site \"because of a request from Vevo,\" the site said. Still available to peruse were some promotional files about artists Katy Perry, The Weeknd and Demi Lovato.\n\nWhile most of the files posted initially \"seemed pretty mild,\" according to tech site Gizmodo, a few appeared \"sensitive.\" In addition to \"a wide variety of office documents, videos, and other promotional materials,\" other files included music charts, social media plans and \"various details about the artists under the record companies’ management,\" Gizmodo said. One document detailed how to turn off the alarm at Vevo's U.K. office, it said.\n\nAnother such “Artist Highlights” document dated June 2, 2017 for Katy Perry showed her videos had generated 12.2 billion video views and had a 54%-46% female-to-male fan ratio.\n\nOurMine leaked the materials because Vevo rebuffed its notice that the group had accessed Vevo's \"private documents,\" according to a statement on the anonymous group's site.\n\nVevo confirmed the incident in a statement sent to USA TODAY: \"Vevo experienced a data breach as a result of a phishing scam via Linkedin. We have addressed the issue and are investigating the extent of exposure.\"\n\nMusic videos remained playable on vevo.com; most viewers probably view Vevo's video content through separate artist channels on YouTube (example: KendrickLamarVevo). In addition to its majority investors, Alphabet, parent company of Google’s YouTube, and Abu Dhabi Media also own small stakes in Vevo, while Warner Music Group has a partnership with the site, founded in 2009.\n\nFor now, it appears the breach won't be as publicly troublesome for Vevo as other high-profile hacks in the past of entertainment companies such as Sony and HBO. In 2015, Wikileaks published more than 30,000 documents and 173,000 emails obtained the year before in a hack attributed to North Korea and tied to the Sony Pictures film The Interview. Among the embarrassing emails released at the time: where salary discrepancies between female stars such as Jennifer Lawrence with male co-stars, according to The Daily Beast.\n\nIn a pair of breaches this summer, hackers posted scripts and unaired episodes of HBO's Game of Thrones, other episodes of the network's series Ballers and Room 104, as well as internal emails.\n\nOurMine, which describes itself as a security assessment provider, has executed other prominent hacks including those of Dropbox, LinkedIn, MySpace and the WikiLeak's website, as well as Twitter accounts of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Uber's then-CEO Travis Kalanick.\n\nThe ability to infiltrate Vevo using a phishing attack — email or other benign-looking communications carrying malware — demonstrates \"social media is an effective vector for launching targeted attacks,\" said Phil Tully, a principal data scientist with ZeroFOX, a social media risk management company.\n\nOnce the hackers gained access to a Vevo employee's LinkedIn account, \"they were able to obtain and publicly release 3.12TB worth of the company’s sensitive internal data,\" he said.\n\nSome tips from Tully:\n\n►Limit interactions to users you’re sure you can trust, preferably having met them in person or have a credible mutual connection. Especially avoid someone contacting you for suspicious reasons.\n\n\n\n►Don't download attachments or click on suspicious links sent through social media. Run the link or attachment through an open source malware detector.\n\n\n\n►Use two-factor authentication on all of your social accounts. That way should a new device or browser connect to an account, you will be sent a code via email or smartphone.\n\nMore:How to avoid phishing attacks\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/10/27/fact-check-image-injured-dog-supposedly-found-road-hoax/10599289002/", "title": "Fact check: Image of injured dog supposedly found by road is a hoax", "text": "The claim: Image shows injured dog found on the side of the road\n\nSocial media users are sharing a picture of an injured dog covered in blood in Facebook groups across the world.

This is supported by figures from the FTC, which show that while 44% of younger people in their 20's reported losing money to fraud, only 20% of those in their 70's did the same.\n\nThe risks are wide-ranging, from fraudulent phone calls to phishing attempts via email, texts to social media messages, or shopping scams designed to dupe seniors out of their savings.\n\nRise in attacks, plus seniors pay out more\n\nThe pandemic played a role here, too, believes Michael Jabbara, Visa’s vice president and global head of fraud services.\n\n“It’s no surprise we’ve seen a massive shift over the years towards digital transactions, but with this shift there’s also an increase focus from fraudsters,” says Jabbara. “This is especially true for elder individuals who may be a target because of a lack of technical sophistication and because they don’t always report these crimes to authorities.”\n\nJabbara says “grandparent scams” are still a popular attack method.\n\n“This is where a fraudster spoofs a relative’s phone number and sends a message asking for money due to a medical emergency or text books, or whatever the case may be,” he said\n\nJabbara says Visa has invested more than $9 billion in anti-fraud measures over the over the last five years, including the use of artificial intelligence and advanced data analytics, “to ensure we’re keeping our network safe and secure across the globe.”\n\n“Fraudsters are able to glean those personal details the grandparent posted pictures on Facebook or Instagram, allowing them to craft a very believable message,” Jabbara said. “Or in other cases, a family member’s account is hacked and a fraudster gets access to their email, they’ll target an elder family member with a similar plea for money or help. They play on their emotions.”\n\nSeniors are a lucrative target\n\nSeniors also pay out more. Disturbing data published by cybersecurity company Comparitech shows that while the average loss from those in their 'was $324, it jumps to $426 for victims in their 60's, $635 among 70-somethings, and a staggering median loss of $1,300 among those in their 80's.\n\nDaniel Markuson, digital privacy expert with NordVPN, a leading Virtual Private Network (VPN) provider, see below, says its recent survey found that 84% of Americans have experienced a form of “social engineering,” where fraudsters attempt to fool you into divulging confidential or personal information.\n\n“Phishing scams are one of the most common tactics among cybercriminals, designed to trick people into clicking on links that download malicious files often containing a virus,” explains Markuson. “So, one of the main tips we have for seniors is to be cautious and question everything they receive from unknown senders.”\n\nMarkus says often there are grammar mistakes in the email you received, a sense of urgency to confirm your details, or a strange-looking email domain.\n\nWhat should we do about senior fraud?\n\nWhen it comes to protecting our loved ones, letting them know about these risk plays a big role.\n\nJabbara says one of the best practices to fight back is to have a “tech check-in” with aging relatives, to go over these assorted tips.\n\nShare with care: Limit how much personal information you share online. Set your social media profiles to private. If someone asks to connect with you on social media, only accept their request if you know them.\n\nBe wary of “emergencies”: Your family or friends can easily be hacked to send out emails or text messages claiming to be urgently in need of cash or gift cards, scamming you out of money or gift cards.\n\nWhen in doubt, just ask: If you really think it could be your daughter or grandson reaching out, don’t confirm by replying to the message you received. Instead, reach out in another fashion, such as calling them. Chances are, it’s fake. Block and report the fraudulent message.\n\nLock your devices: Use a passcode or fingerprint to lock your phone or tablet. If you have a computer, use a strong password that’s at least 12 characters long.\n\nShop safer: Always use a secure Internet connection when making a purchase. Reputable websites use technologies such as SSL (Secure Socket Layer) that encrypt data during transmission. You will see a little padlock icon in your browser(and usually “https” at the front of your address bar to confirm it’s a secure connection. Only shop on sites that take secure payment methods, such as credit cards.\n\nEnable multifactor authentication: When it comes to logging into your online accounts, add a second layer of defense by enabling multifactor authentication, sometimes referred to as “two-factor authentication.” This means you not only need a password or passcode (or biometrics logon, like a fingerprint of facial scan) to confirm it’s you, but also a one-time code you’ll receive on your mobile phone to type in.\n\nInstall good cybersecurity software: Just as you wouldn't leave the front door to your home unlocked, you shouldn't let your tech be vulnerable to attacks, whether it’s a virus or other malicious software, called “malware,” that sneaks onto your device or caused by being tricked into giving out sensitive information.\n\nMake sure you have the right cybersecurity tools to prevent fraud\n\nGood antimalware that’s updated often can identify, quarantine, delete and report any suspicious activity coming into your computer or flag sensitive info going out.\n\n“Seniors have more important things to do than worry about than being protected online,” says Gagan Singh, executive vice president and chief product an revenue officer for cybersecurity company McAfee.\n\nA just-announced tool called McAfee+, from $49.99/first year, then $139.99/year after that, was created to make it easy for everyone to confidently live life online no matter how much or little they know about technology and online threats including identity theft.\n\n“Our new product lineup includes tools that help people prevent identity theft and credit fraud, including credit monitoring, credit lock, removing their personal data online, identity monitoring, and website safety notifications,” says Singh.\n\nAvoid Wi-Fi hotspots\n\nResist free wireless Internet at, say, a coffee shop or in an airport. It’s best to wait until you’re on a secured Internet connection at home, or use your smartphone as a personal hotspot, which is safer than public Wi-Fi. If you must use a hotspot, never conduct any financial transactions – like online banking, trading or shopping – as you never know if your information is being tracked and logged.\n\nUse a VPN\n\nA VPN conceals your online identity by using encryption technology, therefore what you do and where you go online cannot be seen by your service provider, the government, search engine, browser company, social media sites, advertisers and malicious types.\n\n“VPN is an easy-to-use tool that helps users to make sure their network is secure at all times,” confirms Markuson. “For seniors, who sometimes find it hard to keep up with latest technology and cybersecurity trends, it is a perfect solution [as] VPN not only helps to stay safe while using public Wi-Fi, it also make sure user’s private data is safe from snooping.”\n\nNordVPN can be purchased starting at $3.69/month with a two-year subscription that includes three months for free.\n\nFollow Marc on Twitter for his “Tech Tip of the Day” posts: @marc_saltzman.

They're after your Social Security number, bank account information and social media accounts. With any of these, they can steal your money or trick your friends into giving up theirs.\n\nThe scary part is that anyone can be a hacker. For as little as $3,000, you can buy a complete and fully operational exploit kit. This kit does most of the illegal work for you automatically. You get to sit back and rake in the cash, until you get caught.\n\nBetween semi-amateurs with automated systems and serious hackers who are masters of technology and trickery, how can you possibly hope to stay safe?\n\nThe best way is to know how hackers do what they do. Once you know that, you can counter their malicious acts. Here are five popular hacker strategies.\n\n1. Phishing scams\n\nLucky you! A Nigerian prince has selected you to help smuggle millions out of his country. For a little bit of effort — a few simple wire transfers — you'll get a substantial cut. What could be easier?\n\nI bet you're asking yourself, \"Who would fall for that?\" Well, tens of thousands of people do every year. That's why Nigerian scams, known as 419 scams, are still very popular.\n\nOther versions might say you won a contest or have a job offer. Maybe someone wants to meet you, or you can make money for shipping some goods.\n\nThe catch is that you have to send in personal or banking information, or pay a fee. Of course, your information and money is going straight to hackers.\n\nUse common sense before reacting to any e-mail. Scams rely on making you act quickly. If you think about things long enough, you can usually see through them. Just remember the old saying, \"If it looks too good to be true … \"\n\n2. Trojan horse\n\nMany hackers want to slip a virus on your computer. Once installed, a virus can record everything you type and send it back to the hacker. It can send out spam e-mail or attack other computers.\n\nTo do this, the hackers disguise the virus as something harmless. This is called a Trojan horse, or just Trojan.\n\nOne of the most popular ways to deliver a Trojan is a variation of the phishing e-mail scams.\n\nFor example, the e-mail might say it's from a shipping service, bank or other reputable company. There's been a problem with a transaction! To learn more, you have to open an e-mail attachment.\n\nThe attachment might look like a normal file, but it really contains a Trojan. Clicking on the file installs it before you can do anything.\n\nSimilar scams appear on Facebook and Twitter. You think you're going to watch a funny video your friend posted. Instead, a popup tells you to update your video player. The \"update\" file it provides is really a Trojan.\n\nThe key to defeat this tactic, as with phishing e-mails, is common sense. However, up-to-date security software is essential as well. It should detect and stop most Trojans before they can install.\n\n3. Drive-by downloads\n\nSecurity software is good, but it isn't always enough. Programs on your computer might have weaknesses that hackers can use to bypass security software.\n\nTo take advantage of these weaknesses, hackers set up websites embedded with viruses. You might get there by clicking a malicious link in a phishing e-mail or on social media. You can even find these sites in a search for popular programs or topics.\n\nIt isn't just malicious sites, though. Hackers can sneak malicious code on to legitimate websites. The code scans your computers for security holes. If it finds one, a virus can download and install without you doing anything.\n\nTo stay safe, you have to keep your programs up-to-date. Every month, Microsoft releases updates for Windows and Internet Explorer. These updates close critical security holes that hackers exploit.\n\nOther critical programs to patch are Adobe's Flash and Reader, and Oracle's Java. Using old versions of these programs is like sending hackers an engraved invitation.\n\nYou should also be using the latest version of your programs. Anyone using Internet Explorer 6, 7 or 8 needs to update or switch browsers immediately.\n\n4. Bypassing passwords\n\nIn Hollywood movies, hackers are masters of guessing account passwords. In the real world, however, very few hackers bother.\n\nInstead, they go around passwords. They might get your password from a data breach at a company or website you use.\n\nIt's important that you use a different password for every account. That way, if a hacker discovers one, they can't get in to every account.\n\nPerhaps the hacker slipped a virus on to your system. It records your passwords and sends them to the hacker; no guessing needed.\n\nAs I mentioned above, you can stop viruses with up-to-date security software and programs.\n\nA hacker might tackle your account's security question. Most security questions can be answered with information people post publicly.\n\nYou should change how you answer security questions. Give a random answer that has nothing to do with the question.

Predictably, five fights broke out simultaneously the instant the puck was dropped.\n\nWhen the opening-faceoff mayhem was over on Saturday night, Tortorella climbed down to the front of his bench and screamed around the glass partition at Hartley. Then, after the first period, the former Rochester Americans coach attempted to barge his way through the entire Flames team to confront Hartley inside the Flames dressing room.\n\nHe was stopped in the hallway by half of the Flames team and support personnel, who had barely gotten off the ice.\n\nBut anyone who watched the Amerks in 1995-96 surely just smiled and said, \"Pfft, we've seen this before.\"\n\n\"That was a normal weekend for us,\" former Amerks winger Scott Metcalfe said, laughing about the chaos between the Flames and Canucks and the rage of his former Rochester coach.\n\nMetcalfe was there for the first Hartley-Tortorella verbal exchange, on Oct. 13, 1995. It was the home opener for the Amerks, and Tortorella's first home game as coach of the AHL franchise. The opponent: The Hartley-coached Cornwall Aces.\n\nBy the 18:40 mark of the second period, Tortorella and Hartley were at the front of their benches and right at the glass partition, screaming at each other.\n\nTortorella accused Hartley of goon tactics, something former coach John Van Boxmeer had done just one season earlier when the Amerks played the Aces.\n\nOn this particular October evening, Cornwall defenseman Aaron Miller blasted Amerks winger Dixon Ward to the ice with a fist and high stick. A brawl ensued, and Amerks defenseman Dean Melanson pounded a kneeling Miller before kneeing him.\n\nMiller was ejected because of a high-sticking major. Melanson was assessed a match penalty for attempt to injure.\n\n\"Tell Melanson that's a barbaric act, that the WWF was last night,\" Hartley told me after the game.\n\nOur conversation was, of course, after Hartley and Tortorella \"chatted\" during the game.\n\n\"He blew a fuse,\" Hartley said.\n\nTortorella claimed he was just defending his players. Coaches don't taunt or berate opposing players during a game, Torts has always maintained.\n\n\"He was yapping at guys on our bench; I don't think we (as coaches) should be doing that,\" Tortorella said after that game. \"If he wants to yap, let him yap at me.\"\n\nScott Nichol played on that Amerks team, which Tortorella guided from last place in January to the Calder Cup in June. (That is, by the way, the last time an Amerks team brought the Calder Cup to Rochester.)\n\nNichol is now director of player development for the Nashville Predators, having retired over the summer after a 17-year pro career. He saw the Tortorella/Hartley exchange.\n\n\"They know how to push each other's buttons pretty well,\" Nichol said this morning.\n\nIt has been 18 1/2 years since the first Tortorella/Hartley encounter and time surely hasn't made the hearts grow fonder. Tortorella does, however, remain steadfast in his commitment to his team.\n\nSo why didn't Tortorella defuse the situation against the Canucks by putting out a skill line? Why exacerbate the matter by choosing to deploy your set of nuclear weapons against the Hartley starters? Is someone really going to jump the Sedin twins?\n\n\"Is someone going to jump Phil Kessel?\" Nichol countered. \"John Scott did (in the Sabres-Maple Leafs preseason game).\"\n\n\"Players respect that he (Tortorella) has their back,\" Nichol said. \"As a player, you rally around that. It's been his M.O. for a long time: us against the world. The team is an inner circle and if anyone outside that inner circle tries to interfere, he erupts.\"\n\nThe Hartley M.O. hasn't changed much either: He loves his tough guys and wants his team to be nasty and abrasive.\n\n\"Hartley always, always, always, always wanted his team to be tougher than they really were,\" said Scott Metcalfe, the Amerks Hall of Famer who played a key role with Nichol and Dan Frawley on that 1996 Calder Cup team.\n\nTortorella never backs down from a challenge. He doesn't think his team ever should, either.\n\n\"Torts will take things into his own hands,\" Metcalfe said. \"He's a tough, fiery guy. If he thought something was adversely affecting his team, that's when he got mad.\"\n\nThe names and sweaters have changed; the coaches have not\n\nKevin Oklobzija writes for the Rochester (N.Y.)

And it's been that way for quite some time.\n\nHartley, the head coach of the National Hockey League's Calgary Flames, is currently putting on his annual youth hockey camp at the York City Ice Arena. Hartley, the former head coach of the Hershey Bears, estimated he's been holding the two-week camp in York for 12 or 13 years.\n\nHartley said this year's version features 498 kids, ranging from 6 to 17 years old.\n\nThe players have come from far and wide to attend — eight different states are represented at the camp, Hartley said, as well as five other countries: the Ukraine, Switzerland, Dubai, France and Canada.\n\nMike Cleveland, general manager and hockey director at the Ice Arena, estimated close to half the campers hail from Quebec.\n\nThere is also an impressive coaching staff. On Friday, standout Flames players Johnny Gaudreau and Mark Giordano worked with the kids during the camp's morning session. Giordano and Gaudreau participated in drills - Gaudreau even taking some shots on one goalie during lulls.\n\nThe camp isn't too far from home for Gaudreau. The 21-year-old New Jersey native already has an NCAA hockey national championship under his belt and was selected this year to play in the NHL All-Star Game.\n\nOn Friday, despite a recent stint battling pink eye, Gaudreau posed for photos and signed autographs. (In between signing campers' gloves and hats and posing for photos, Gaudreau said he had been taking eye drops so he wasn't contagious.)\n\nHe said he was excited to be back in the area - his dad still runs a hockey camp in New Jersey which he also helps out at.\n\n\"I know how exciting it is to be around your buddies,\" Gaudreau said.\n\nFor Giordano, the Flames' captain, the camp is about the kids building on-ice skills, but also learning how to be an athlete off the ice.\n\nGiordano said it was great that kids at such a young age could be around someone like Hartley.\n\n\"For Bob to run a camp to develop on-and-off ice skills ... I would have loved this as a kid,\" Giordano said.\n\nFormer Hershey Bears such as Paul Jerrard were also on hand during the camp's first week. And, while there are other coaches with professional backgrounds helping, Hartley added a handful of local teachers from York to assist.\n\n\"I think our reputation in this area is well known,\" Hartley said. \"We take care of the kids, we teach the kids, we make it fun.\"\n\nHartley said the camp began in Hershey during the 1996-97 hockey season, and participation grew significantly after the team won the Calder Cup that spring.\n\nAfter about six years, however, Hartley said ice and safety issues at Hersheypark Arena forced him to find another venue — on hot and humid days, Hartley said, fog would hover over the ice, creating limited visibility for camp participants.\n\n\"Hersheypark Arena was still a great rink, and that's obviously a rink that's very important to me. It was my last stop before the NHL,\" Hartley said. \"But still, I had to think about the safety of the kids. With all the fog The third year, I said, 'OK, one afternoon, drive me to York. Show me what you've got, and I'll make my decision.' And when I came here, I saw the rink, I saw what it took to run a good camp.\"\n\nAt first glance Hartley's local presence in York could be viewed as an oddity — a high-level coach who's won a Calder Cup with the Bears, a Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche and this year was the Jack Adams Award winner as the National Hockey League's most outstanding coach with the Flames.\n\n\"You wouldn't expect it — an NHL coach in a relatively small town, coaching youth hockey,\" said Beltsville, Md., resident Eli Mansour, whose 8-year-old son Essa is taking part in the camp. \"I think it's fantastic that a coach of his caliber would be in York, Pa. It's a tremendous opportunity for the kids.\"\n\nAdded Stephane Paradis, a parent from Quebec City, \"This one is special. The fact he teaches the kids and pushes them like pros.\"\n\n\"He's passionate,\" Mansour said. \"His main thing with the staff is, 'You need to love the kids, you need to love hockey.'\"\n\nEn route to his working space at the Ice Arena on Tuesday, he stopped in the corridor, engaging two young players for a French-speaking conversation. And as an assistant coach entered looking for birthday cake for a camp participant, Hartley handed him candles as well.\n\n\"Most NHL coaches would show up, wave and head off to the golf course,\" Cleveland said. \"He's here 24-7, gives the parents and kids his personal cell phone. He's unbelievable. Accessible beyond belief is hitting the nail right on the head.\"\n\nWhile the job of an NHL coach is an around-the-clock duty, Hartley looks forward to his annual visit to York — his only two-week youth hockey camp of the year.\n\n\"For me, that's my training camp,\" Hartley said, motioning to the ice and campers. \"In September, we're going to go to main training camp with the (Flames) players. Well, for me, these two weeks, I'm getting back in gear for my season. And those kids, they're at the roots of the game. It forces me to get in details. I love to teach.

It’s good to be together for two weeks and be around kids, and that’s what we love.\n\n“We love to share our passion of the game with them. It’s an outstanding two weeks.”\n\nSteve Hartley has plenty of passion for the game having grown up around it. He played high school hockey in the area while his dad coached the Bears and continued to play through college.\n\nEventually he picked up the itch to jump behind the bench during his days in college.\n\n“I started small and it became addictive for me,” Hartley said. “Coaching is addictive. It’s fun, it’s a passion, and that’s what really drove me to it.”\n\nThe annual hockey camp draws hockey players of varying ages from across the United States and Canada to York. Bob Hartley, who led the NHL’s Colorado Avalanche to a Stanley Cup in 2002, originally held the camp at Hersheypark Arena before moving it to York.\n\nSince then it has continued to thrive each year.\n\n“It’s an outstanding setting to run a hockey camp,” Steve Hartley said. “We’re glad to be back every summer.”\n\nBob Hartley was not on the ice on Friday, having returned to Montreal for a medical procedure. Hartley, winner of the Jack Adams Award in 2015, was let go as head coach of the Calgary Flames in May after four years with the organization.\n\nDespite that, there was still remnants of Hartley’s old club throughout the camp. Current Calgary players Sean Monahan and Johnny Gaudreau both made appearances at the camp earlier in the week. Hartley was still donning a Flames track suit when he was on the ice and his son Steve was wearing a shirt with the Flames log on it on Friday.\n\nThe former Flames head coach told Sports Illustrated earlier in the week that he was holding out for another NHL job.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/2017/01/18/bob-newhart-brings-laughs-chumash/96686532/", "title": "Bob Newhart brings laughs to Chumash", "text": "By Wendy Dager\n\nSpecial to The Star\n\nFor Bob Newhart, the magic is in having a live audience. Meaning he’ll feel right at home when he offers up his iconic brand of deadpan standup comedy Jan. 26 at the Chumash Casino Resort.\n\nHis longtime television fans fondly remember “The Bob Newhart Show,” the groundbreaking sitcom that’s comfortably entrenched between the former accountant’s 1960 Grammy-winning comedy album, “The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart,” and his 2013-2015 Emmy-winning guest stint as Arthur “Professor Proton” Jeffries on television’s \"The Big Bang Theory.\" In fact, Newhart had two long-running eponymous series — the first with him as Chicago-based psychologist Dr. Robert Hartley, and the second, “Newhart,” in which he portrayed Vermont innkeeper Dick Loudon.\n\nDuring “The Bob Newhart Show” he worked with actors Suzanne Pleshette, Marcia Wallace, Bill Daily, Tom Poston and many other big names in the entertainment business.\n\n“I had this formula that (you) just surround yourself with the best actors available and the best writing and then take all the credit yourself,” he joked. “And it worked. It worked several times.”\n\nNewhart shared a bit of trivia about his first television series — a glitch that was probably only noticed by native Chicagoans.\n\n“(In) the opening credits, I apparently missed my stop on Sheridan Road every day and get off at Evanston and walk back about 25 blocks,” he said.\n\nThe second series, “Newhart,” is probably as well known for its final episode as much as its oddball characters Larry, Daryl and his “other brother, Daryl.”\n\nNewhart credits his wife of 54 years, Ginny, for having the idea of making the ending of “Newhart” a long, weird dream of his prior sitcom character, Dr. Hartley.\n\n“Monday was not a hit time slot for CBS and we kind of built it into a hit time slot,” he said. “So in the sixth year, CBS and I were having a disagreement because of that. They would move us around … and I thought they weren’t being fair to the show and for what the show had done for CBS. I always called it ‘Try to Find Bob This Monday.’ So … my wife and I were at a Christmas party in L.A. and I said to Ginny, ‘I think this is going to be the last year of Newhart’ … and she said right away ‘You should end it in a dream sequence,’ because there was so much that was inexplicable on the show.”\n\nSuzanne Pleshette, who played his first TV wife, Emily, was at the party and enthusiastically agreed to be part of the surprise finale, but “Newhart” lasted two more years. After its eighth year, it ended just as Ginny Newhart had suggested, and became one of the most legendary moments in television history, with Bob the psychologist waking up from a \"dream\" and sharing it with Emily.\n\n“The funny thing was, we had the show in front of a live audience because that is always the way I’ve done television,” he said. “So we revealed a bit of the bedroom set and people started applauding the set. They recognized it from ‘The Bob Newhart Show’ and they started cheering and pounding on the floor and it was great to see it happen like that.”\n\nWhen it came to his role 23 years later on “The Big Bang Theory,” Newhart wanted to make sure it, too, was filmed in front live audience.\n\n“The way it happened with ‘Big Bang,’ (creator) Chuck Lorre had been after me for a while,\" said Newhart. \"We’d been trying to get together on one of his sitcoms, so he came to me one year (and) said, ‘Well, I’m ready for my annual turn-down.’ I said, ‘No, I really like The Big Bang Theory and I’d like to do just three shows.’ And I said, ‘I don’t know how you shoot the show, but it’s got to be done in front of a live audience.' That’s the only way I can do a show. To me, it’s sterile to do it to a laugh track. And he said ‘You got it,’ and he came back with an idea he had, which was Arthur Jeffries.’”\n\nNewhart asked if he was going to be introduced to the studio audience prior to filming, but Lorre assured him it wasn’t necessary.\n\n“I said, ‘I hope they remember me.' (Lorre) said, ‘They’ll remember you, don’t worry about it.’”\n\nNewhart says that the difference between current sitcoms and those of the 1960s and 1970s is that, in the early days, the writers took much more time to set up a joke than they do today.\n\n“Now you really have to set it up/joke/set it up/joke/set it up…” he said. “Because that’s what the young audience wants. That’s their pace.”\n\nNewhart cites Richard Pryor as the most influential comedian of the last 50 years, and his favorite. He also likes the comedy stylings of Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK and Wayne Federman.\n\nAt 87 years old, Newhart is trying to keep his standup performances at a maximum of 10 shows per year. He’s also appeared in feature films such as “Elf,” voiced the character Bernard in the animated movies “The Rescuers” and “The Rescuers Down Under,” and has been in television projects including “The Librarian” and its more recent incarnation, “The Librarians.” And despite expressing a desire to slow down, he’s open to other possibilities.\n\n“I filled in for Johnny Carson. I was the guest host when he was on vacation, 79 times,” he said. “I always enjoyed the interviewing part of that, so there’s something in the works now for a podcast. It’ll be very interesting to see how it works.”\n\nHe makes use of current technology by having a website and occasionally posting to Facebook, and says he was an early aficionado of home computing.\n\n“I got into computers very early, like 1977,” he said. “They had a very primitive word processor … and if you typed the wrong word you could go back to it and backspace and then type in the right word, and then wait about ten minutes and get the right word. And you’d say, ‘Wow, that’s amazing!’”\n\nA father of four and grandfather of 10, Newhart lives in the Los Angeles area, and is looking forward to performing at the Chumash Casino and Resort.\n\n“I’ll probably do one of what I call the old routines — the recorded stuff (from) when I first started out, because I know some of the older people want to hear one of those,” he said. “And then the rest is just observations on this crazy planet … and the only way to survive is to laugh.”\n\nBob Newhart at Chumash Casino Resort, 3400 CA-246, Santa Ynez, Thursday, Jan. 26 at 8 p.m.\n\nCOST: Tickets are $45, $55, $65\n\nINFO: 686-0855; www.chumashcasino.com\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2016/05/03/calgary-flames-fire-coach-bob-hartley/83867504/", "title": "Calgary fires Bob Hartley, a season after coach of the year", "text": "AP\n\nCALGARY, Alberta (AP) — The Calgary Flames fired Bob Hartley on Tuesday, a season after he was voted the NHL's coach of the year.\n\nCalgary took a big step backward this year after reaching the playoffs last season. The Flames finished 35-40-7, with only Vancouver and Edmonton posting fewer wins in the rugged Western Conference.\n\n\"Bob has taken this team as far as I feel he can take it,\" Flames general manager Brad Treliving said at a news conference.\n\nLast season, he led the Flames to a 45-30-7 record and third place in the Pacific Division, but there was no sign of that team this season behind Johnny Gaudreau and Marc Giordano. In February, Calgary dealt forward Jiri Hudler to Florida for draft picks and sent winger David Jones to Minnesota for goalie Niklas Backstrom and a sixth-round pick.\n\nIn four years with Calgary, Hartley had a regular-season record of 134-135-25.\n\nTreliving met with Hartley early Tuesday and fired the 55-year-old from Hawksbury, Ontario.\n\n\"This is isn't just a necessary move because we didn't make the playoffs, so we're going to throw a body on the tarmac,\" Treliving said. \"For us to move forward, I felt this decision had to be made for what Bob, in my opinion, can get from this group moving forward.\"\n\nAssociate coach Jacques Cloutier also won't return next season. But Treliving said assistant Martin Gelinas and goaltending coach Jordan Sigalet will remain with the club.\n\nAfter surprising many by making the playoffs in 2014-15 and beating Vancouver in the first round, Calgary finished 26th overall this season. The Flames' 77 points were 20 fewer than a year ago.\n\nThe problems came despite high-profile offseason additions. The Flames acquired defenseman Dougie Hamilton from the Boston Bruins at the draft, Michael Frolik signed as a free agent and Sam Bennett had a breakout rookie season.\n\nBut Calgary stumbled early, losing its season opener to Vancouver en route to a 2-8-1 start. The Flames weren't able to recover. Unlike last year, they rarely rallied for wins in the third period.\n\nThe team began the season with three goalies on one-way contracts. Karri Ramo and Joni Ortio both were waived at different times and sent to the minors. Veteran Jonas Hiller also struggled, his .879 save percentage the worst in the NHL in the last decade with a 25-game minimum.\n\n\"Our goaltending was not good this year,\" Treliving said. \"That falls on the general manager. I need to fix that. The way we played in front of the goaltender needs to be fixed as well.\n\n\"Our special teams, for a good portion of the year, were 30th in the league. There's some style of play issues in terms of how to move forward.\"\n\nHiller has signed with a Swiss club and won't return. Ramo, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in February, and Ortio are currently the top goalies in the system.\n\nHartley won a Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche in 2001, where he coached for five seasons.

Doug Wilson Jr., the San Jose Sharks’ director of amateur scouting, spoke and signed the name of the 31st and final pick in the round, forward Ozzy Weisblatt, for the benefit of Weisblatt’s mother, who is deaf.\n\nAnd then there was the utter silence that followed the Blue Jackets’ pick at No. 21 overall, delivered in no-nonsense fashion by general manager Jarmo Kekalainen. Staring straight into the camera, he rattled off the name of Russian right wing Yegor Chinakhov, a 19-year-old forward who went undrafted last year and was projected as a late first- or second-round pick by most analysts this year.\n\nKekalainen’s faint grin was evidence enough that he’s not like most “analysts.”\n\nUnlike the draftkniks, who were sent scrambling for information to share on Chinakhov, Kekalainen and his amateur scouting director, Ville Siren, knew all about the 5-foot-11 forward — including his NHL-ready shot.\n\n“He just keeps improving,” Kekalainen said of Chinakhov, a rookie playing for former NHL coach Bob Hartley with Avangard Omsk in Russia’s KHL. “He played 21:30 in his last KHL game and for an NHL coach. And anybody who knows Bob Hartley knows he’s not handing out ice time for free. You’ve got to earn it.”\n\nHow excited was the Jackets’ front office to land this kid?\n\nEnough that Kekalainen said Chinakhov was among the top 10 players in the entire draft, as judged by his scouting department.\n\n“We had him very high on our list,” Kekalainen said. “We had some chances to move back and take a chance at maybe getting him later, but if there’s one thing I’ve learned over the 25 years that I’ve been involved with NHL teams, it’s that if you have one guy available so high on your list, you don’t move back. You take him.”\n\nTheir decision, however, was a surprise to many — including Chinakhov's agent, Shumi Babaev.\n\n“I was thinking maybe after the 25th, 26th (pick) I would hear, ‘Chinakhov,’ and then ... boom,” Babaev said. “I was really surprised. I talked to (Yegor) and I called Jarmo right away. We (also) had a FaceTime call and they said ‘congrats’ to Yegor. He was sleeping (in Russia) and I woke him up. The guy is happy.”\n\nHartley is too, but more for what his rookie winger is doing for his team’s offensive attack. The KHL’s top rookie for September already has five goals and two assists in 12 games. He’s also in the final year of his KHL contract.\n\n“Until we know (the Blue Jackets’ plan) for sure, we’re not going to sign any deal with the KHL before the (2020-21 NHL) season ends,” Babaev said. “He’ll stay longer (in Russia) or he’s coming right away, right after the season, to join Columbus during this next NHL season.”\n\nWelcome aboard\n\nThe Blue Jackets didn't have a pick in the second round, so they waited to pick Slovakian-born defenseman Samuel Knazko in the third (No. 78), using the pick they acquired Tuesday in a trade that sent forward Josh Anderson to Montreal for center Max Domi.\n\nKnazko is ranked No. 42 among the top 100 European skaters by NHL Central Scouting and is a smooth skater. He's comfortable with the puck on his stick, knows how to evade those trying to take it from him and has razor-sharp accuracy with his passes.\n\nKnazko, 18, is currently playing for TPS U20 in Finland and is off to a strong start with two goals, three assists and five points in the first nine games. One of his teammates, forward Mikael Pyythia, is also now a Blue Jackets prospect after Columbus selected him with its next pick in the fourth round at No. 114 overall.\n\nPyyhtia, 18, is a dynamic Finnish forward with high-end offensive skill on the left wing and is also off to a great start for TPS' U20 team. He has three goals, three assists and six points in his first five games after finishing last season with 11-30-41 in 42 games for the TPS Junior A team.\n\nThe Jackets' draft list, compiled by Kekalainen, Siren and the rest of the scouting staff, then called for two more defensemen to be chosen with picks in the fifth and sixth rounds. Ole Julian Bjørgvik-Holm, 18, went to Columbus in the fifth at No. 145 and then Swedish blue-liner Samuel Johannesson, 19, was taken in the sixth at No. 176 to complete the Jackets' 2020 class.\n\nBjørgvik-Holm, the lone Norwegian player taken in the draft, is the biggest player of the bunch at 6-foot-3, 201-pounds and the 5-11 Johannesson is an impressive puck-mover who's playing for Rogle BK in his first full season in the Swedish Hockey League.\n\nKnazko and Bjørgvik-Holm each have left-hand shots, while Johannesson is a righty.\n\nThe Blue Jackets also entered Day 2 of the draft with a pick in the seventh round at No. 207, but Kekalainen traded it to the Anaheim Ducks for a conditional seventh-round pick in either 2021 or 2022.\n\nOh, so close\n\nBefore selecting Knazko, a couple of familiar names to the Jackets were selected by other teams.\n\nThe Ottawa Senators took power forward Egor Sokolov in the second at No. 61 and the Colorado Avalanche selected speedy center Jean-Luc Foudy in the third at No. 72, three picks away from potentially joining his older brother, Liam Foudy (2018 first-round), as a Blue Jackets' prospect.\n\nSokolov's connection to Columbus was through free-agent invites he'd accepted the past two years to join the Blue Jackets at the Traverse City Prospect Tournament in Michigan and NHL training camps.\n\nHe tied Blue Jackets forward Alexandre Texier for the team lead in goals at the 2019 prospects tournament and then recorded an assist in one preseason game for Columbus at Nationwide Arena before heading back to Cape Breton of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.\n\nThe Jackets could've signed Sokolov as a free agent prior to his departure from camp, after he's been passed over in back-to-back NHL drafts, but opted not to do it while keeping close tabs on him last season.\n\nSokolov, listed at 6-4, 240, dominated the QMJHL with a league-high 46 goals, 46 assists and 92 points in 52 games and finally drew enough attention to convince a team to draft him in spite of some skating flaws that need continued work.\n\nbhedger@dispatch.com\n\n@BrianHedger", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2015/05/06/vigneault-hartley-laviolette-are-jack-adams-finalists/70914536/", "title": "Alain Vigneault, Bob Hartley, Peter Laviolette are Jack Adams finalists", "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — The New York Rangers' Alain Vigneault, Calgary's Bob Hartley and Nashville's Peter Laviolette are the finalists for the Jack Adams Award as NHL's coach of the year.\n\nMmbers of the NHL Broadcasters' Association submitted ballots at the end of the regular season, with the top three designated as finalists Wednesday.

But in the end, Drury decided a new voice was necessary in order for the Rangers to take the next step and become a true contender.\n\nHe must feel there are available options that will represent an upgrade — now it's a matter of making the right choice.\n\nYOUTH: Young players who could make a jump for the Rangers\n\nAll things Rangers: Latest New York Rangers news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nAll signs are pointing to experienced coaches holding an advantage in this search. Coming out of a rebuild, which was guided by a first-time NHL coach who came from the college ranks, the feeling around Madison Square Garden is that an established bench boss will be the preference. Drury will prioritize someone who can mold the Rangers into a unit capable of imposing their will against playoff-hardened teams, yet do so without stunting the development of their young, skilled players.\n\nThere are a bevy of free-agent coaches with strong NHL résumés. A handful who are expected to be interviewed are mentioned here, although we're leaving one of the most prominent, Mike Babcock, off the list. Coming off a somewhat controversial exit in Toronto in 2019, he seems to be ranked behind others in the Rangers' current pecking order. The same goes for Jack Capuano, despite the fact that Drury just tapped him to coach the U.S. Men's National Team at the 2021 IIHF World Championships. And there doesn't appear to be any traction for beloved former captain Mark Messier, despite his recent lobbying.\n\nThat still leaves us with a long list of intriguing candidates. And while the front-runners might be the most recognizable names, there a few wild-card possibilities.\n\nBruce Boudreau\n\nThe 66-year-old didn't coach this season after being fired by the Minnesota Wild last year. The 2007-08 Jack Adams Award winner has been a very effective regular-season coach, only missing the playoffs twice in 12 full seasons of coaching the Wild, Anaheim Ducks and Washington Capitals, but he's never been able to get his teams past the conference finals. And while Boudreau is known as a good communicator, which will be an important requirement, his lack of big-game success may be a deterrent.\n\nGerard Gallant\n\nA popular choice among Rangers' fans already, the 57-year-old is best known for guiding the expansion Vegas Golden Knights to the Stanley Cup Finals in their first year of existence. That unprecedented success came after two nondescript stints in Florida and Columbus, elevating Gallant's status across the league. The Knights surprisingly fired him after a 24-19-6 start in 2019-20, but the hard-and-fast style he implemented in Vegas represents the brand of hockey Drury is looking for the Rangers to play more of. Gallant will coach Team Canada at the upcoming World Championships.\n\nBob Hartley\n\nThe 60-year-old was the man in charge when Drury played for the Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche in 2000-01. That connection could give Hartley, who is still very well-liked around the league, a leg up, assuming the two maintain a good relationship. He hasn't coached in the NHL since 2015-16 with the Calgary Flames. They missed the playoffs three times in his four-year stint, but Hartley won the Jack Adams Award the one year they made it in 2014-15. He's most recently coached in the KHL, where he just guided Avangard Omsk to the Gagarin Cup.\n\nClaude Julien\n\nA Jack Adams Award winner in 2008-09 and Stanley Cup champion in 2011-12 as the head coach for the Boston Bruins, the 61-year-old ranks 15th all-time with 667 career wins. He spent the past five seasons with the Montreal Canadiens before getting fired just 18 games into the 2020-21 season. The move came as a surprise to many around the league, especially considering the Habs weren't playing all that poorly at 9-5-4. That's why he's considered a solid bet to get a job somewhere for the 2021-22 season.\n\nKris Knoblauch\n\nRangers' fans became familiar with the 42-year-old this season when he was thrust into action as the fill-in coach while Quinn missed six games due to COVID-19. The team went 4-2 during that span, and while Knoblauch deflected game-planning credit to Quinn, the organization was impressed with the substitute's steady hand.\n\nIt was Drury who hired Knoblauch two years ago in an effort to revitalize the Rangers' AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. It's been a mostly successful endeavor, with the team compiling a 45-29-7-5 record on his watch. He and Drury have worked closely during that time and built a strong relationship, but the likelihood is that Knoblauch will remain in his current role. Throwing a young coach into a win-now situation for his first NHL job might be asking too much.\n\nLane Lambert\n\nIf you can't beat 'em... hire their top assistant? Of all the potential candidates with no head coaching experience in the NHL, the 56-year-old may be the most intriguing. He's been Barry Trotz's right-hand man for years, helping the Washington Capitals win a Stanley Cup title in 2017-18 and now turning the Islanders into a hard-hat contender. Lambert is expected to get an opportunity at some point, and with the Rangers looking to implement some of the Isles' physical-and-aggressive traits into their own game, perhaps they can do so by stripping their rival of a key strategist.\n\nPatrick Roy\n\nThe legendary goaltender represents one of the splashiest candidates. He's regarded as one of, if not the best, goalies of all-time, with three Vezina Trophies and four Stanley Cup championships won during his 20-year NHL career. Roy coached the Colorado Avalanche for three years, winning the Jack Adams Award in his first season of 2013-14. But they would miss the playoffs in each of the next two seasons before he decided to step down. The 55-year-old, who played with Drury for four years in Colorado, is currently the general manager and head coach of the QMJHL’s Quebec Remparts, but has expressed interest in another NHL opportunity.\n\nRick Tocchet\n\nFresh of being fired by the Arizona Coyotes after four seasons, there are rumors that the Rangers might be interested. Many around the league felt that the 57-year-old did a solid job with a young-and-limited Coyotes' roster, where he compiled a 125-131-34 record, and deserves another chance. He was known for his toughness in his 18-year playing career and could bring some of those elements to New York, but the knock on him in Arizona was that his teams didn't produce much offense. (Which some believe was a reflection of talent more than coaching.)\n\nJohn Tortorella\n\nAnd, finally, we get the name on the tip of everyone's tongue. Would the Rangers really consider a reunion with their fiery former coach? The short answer is yes, but there are several complicated factors in play.\n\nThe 62-year-old is out after a six-year run in Columbus, where his combative style had grown stale. After four straight playoff appearances, the Blue Jackets fell off and went 18-26-12 this season. That's the risk you run with Tortorella, but there's no doubt he can provide a jolt. He went 171-115-28 in five seasons with the Rangers from 2009-13, making the playoffs four times while kick-starting a successful decade for the franchise.\n\nThere are many people at MSG who still have a soft spot for Tortorella, including owner James Dolan. He's proven he can effectively toughen teams up and mold them into winners. But what may cause hesitation is how some of the Rangers' mild-mannered players will react to his abrasive nature. Would they rally or wilt if faced with Torts' tough love on a daily basis?\n\nVincent Z. Mercogliano is the New York Rangers beat reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

Chinakhov was selected by Columbus 21st overall in last year’s draft, which was conducted remotely in late October.\n\nThe 20-year old Russian forward had a standout rookie season in the Kontinental Hockey League playing for Avangard Omsk and helped his hometown team win the league’s Gagarin Cup championship earlier this week.\n\n“He’s done really well,” Babaev told the Dispatch in a recent interview. “This guy has shown has (what it takes) and he’s already a man. He can play in the NHL. He’s played really good in the playoffs with his team. He’s not playing like a young guy.”\n\nThe Blue Jackets haven’t released anything about signing Chinakhov, so nothing is official yet. Signing KHL players, even those drafted by NHL teams, can be a little tricky if their current teams decide to up the ante with lucrative contract extensions for players to stay put.\n\nBlue Jackets defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov delayed his arrival in Columbus to stay a couple extra years and develop in the KHL prior to playing his first NHL game in the second round of the 2019 playoffs. The Blue Jackets are still waiting to sign Russian forwards Kirill Marchenko (2018, second round) and Dmitri Voronkov (2014, fourth round), who both signed extensions with their KHL teams after being drafted by Columbus.\n\nBabaev also sent out a tweet written in Russian thanking Avangard Omsk for helping his client develop and prospect this season, so all signs are currently pointing toward Chinakhov signing with the Jackets.\n\nIt’s unclear whether he could get a work visa completed in time to make his NHL debut this season, but getting the prospect’s signature on a three-year ELC would be a victory. Chinakhov was a revelation this season for his KHL team, which was coached by former NHL coach Bob Hartley – who also coaches the Latvia men’s national team.\n\nChinakhov, a winger with a great shot, had 10 goals, seven assists and 17 points in 32 games during the regular season as a KHL rookie and had a 5-2-7 scoring line in 21 playoff games. He’ll have to make the adjustment to smaller rinks in North America and a sizable step up in talent level, but Chinakhov is a good skater and has a knack for scoring goals.\n\nHe played for Russia in the 2021 World Junior championship, as well, scoring one goal in five games and missing several games with an undisclosed injury that happened during the tournament. Chinakhov also missed the final two games of Avangard Omsk’s title run because of an illness, but Babaev said his client is now on the mend.\n\n“I think he’s ready,” said Babaev, who represents other players already in the NHL. “He’s an NHL player. He’s a 20-year old in the KHL and he (was) in the playoffs, and (during) the season he was the best young player in the KHL.”\n\nBlue Jackets general manager Jarmo Kekalainen stunned draft experts when he selected Chinakhov in the first round, causing at least a couple of television draft analysts to rifle through their notes trying to find anything they could on him. Most analysts didn’t have Chinakhov coming off the board until the second round or later.\n\nKekalainen said the draft being held later because of the COVID-19 pandemic allowed scouts to get better reads on players who’d already begun to play this season in European leagues. They saw Chinakhov’s breakout year from the start and grabbed him.\n\nEven Babaev was surprised at the spot his client was picked, but Chinakhov’s play since made it look much more like a steal than a reach.\n\n“When he started to play in the KHL, he was (improving) day-by-day, so it helped him,” Babaev told the Dispatch. “When he’s playing with the better players, he’s getting better. That’s the main thing, you know? When he comes to play in the NHL, he will be a much better player.”\n\nbhedger@dispatch.com\n\n@BrianHedger", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/30"}]}

Young people ages 18-24 are much more likely to identify as LGBTQ+, according to the report from the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles.\n\nThe report, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, found that in 2020 and 2021, there were nearly 14 million LGBTQ+ adults in the U.S. − with some states having noticeably higher percentages of gay and queer residents than others.\n\nEarlier this year, a poll from Gallup found a slightly higher percentage of U.S. adults are LGBTQ+. Overall, multiple polls show that the adult LGBTQ population has been steadily increasing for years.\n\n\"Look at the numbers, more people are coming out younger and people are coming out in places where LGBTQ folks have been less out and visible,\" Cathy Renna, a spokesperson for the National LGBTQ Task Force, told USA TODAY.\n\nBroken down by state, the report shows Washington, D.C., Oregon and Delaware top the list for greatest percentage of gay and queer residents.\n\nThe census, the nation's most well-known population survey, does not gather data on Americans' sexuality or gender identity. In 2021, other, smaller surveys from the bureau began asking those questions of respondents for the first time.\n\nHow many people in the US are LGBTQ?\n\nResearchers at the Williams Institute, a leading national LGBTQ+ population data research group, estimate more than 13.9 million LGBTQ+ adults live in the U.S., representing 5.5% of the population.\n\nEvery year, Gallup also releases results of a poll estimating how many Americans are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.\n\nGallup's last report, which polled a nationally representative group of 10,000 respondents, found 7.2% identified as LGBTQ+. The number was highest among adult Gen Zers, or people born between 1997 and 2012, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nSouth continues to have highest percentage of LGBTQ+ people\n\nThe new data shows nearly 36% of the nation's adult LGBTQ+ population lives in the South, representing more than 5 million people. The number is also an increase from the last data released by the Williams Institute in 2014, showing 35% of the nation's LGBTQ+ population lived in the South.\n\nResearchers defined the South as states spanning from Texas and Oklahoma, to Florida and north through Delaware. Kentucky, West Virginia and Washington, D.C., are included in the grouping.\n\nIn recent years, Southern Republican-led states passed more laws restricting transgender health care, access to school sports and instruction on LGBTQ+ history than any other part of the country.\n\nFor that reason, the South is at the forefront of the national fight for LGBTQ+ rights and equality, Renna said.\n\n\"Despite the backlash and despite challenges we're facing, we're resilient and we're not going anywhere,\" Renna said.\n\nSpeaking from New Orleans, which the National LGBTQ Task Force selected for its next annual conference, Renna said the South is where there's the most at stake for people's lives because it's home to the most people living under the most oppressive laws.\n\n\"This is where a lot of the work really needs to happen,\" she said, adding that her organization chose to host its conference in Louisiana because \"there are so many LGBTQ people here that are underrepresented in media, culture and frankly in the movement.\"\n\nResearchers found that 5.7% of Louisiana's adult population is LGBTQ+, ranking slightly higher than states like New York, California and Illinois.\n\nIn 2021, another LGBTQ+ advocacy group, GLAAD, analyzed Southern media coverage of LGBTQ+ communities and found that dozens of outlets published few or zero substantive stories on LGBTQ+ issues, including HIV/AIDS, during the 18-month period ending in December 2020.\n\nGen Z most likely to be LGBTQ+\n\nGeneration Z, the youngest American generation to include adults, has a much higher percentage of LGBTQ+ members than older generations.\n\nResearchers found that in 2020 and 2021, 15.2% of Gen Z identified as LGBTQ+, representing more than 4.6 million people.\n\nEarlier this year, Gallup found 19.7% of Gen Z − or nearly 1 in 5 − said they were LGBTQ+ in 2022.\n\n\"It's certainly not uncommon for younger people to say they're lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or however else they would identify themselves,\" said Jeff Jones, a researcher at Gallup who has been tracking LGBTQ+ population data since 2012.\n\nWith each passing year, as more Gen Zers enter adulthood, the cohort's LGBTQ+ members also push the entire adult national total higher, Jones said.\n\n\"As more come into adulthood, replacing the older people, the overall number should go up,\" he said.\n\nBisexuals make up majority of LGBTQ+ population\n\nResearchers have long found that bisexual people − people who are attracted to more than one gender − make up more than half of America's LGBTQ+ population.\n\nResearchers at the Williams Institute did not break down data based on sexuality, instead focusing on state-by-state LGBTQ+ populations.\n\nThe most recent data from Gallup found more than 58% of all adult LGBTQ+ people in the U.S. are bisexual.\n\nResearchers in 2019 found that compared with gays and lesbians, bisexuals are far less likely to be out about their sexuality with people they're close to.

John Carney directed the state Education Department to develop a regulation and model policy to address potential discrimination in Delaware schools.\n\nIt's called \"Regulation 225\" and was brought before DSEA's Executive Board and its members Wednesday night, where they voted in support of the proposed policy and its protections for students.\n\n“We have a diverse population of students inside of each public school in Delaware,\" DSEA President Mike Matthews said in a statement. \"We need to make sure that all students feel safe, secure and supported when they enter the doors to their school. I’m proud of this organization for supporting Regulation 225, which will help protect students against discrimination in our schools no matter their race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity or sexual orientation.”\n\nThe Executive Board also asked DSEA’s Ethnic Minority Affairs Committee to go over the proposed regulation and give them the committee’s feedback. The chair of that group, Karen Maull, is a teacher at Cape Henlopen High School in Sussex County, where the regulation has been most hotly contested.\n\n“As the Ethnic Minority Affairs Committee, we are against discrimination of any kind. Therefore, we support what is in the best interest of all students in our schools”\n\n*****\n\nA Sussex County school board is formally voicing its opposition to a proposed state rule that would allow students to pick their own name, race or gender without parental consent.\n\nThe Indian River School District Board of Education voted unanimously Monday to send a letter to Gov. John Carney and the Delaware Department of Education echoing concerns raised by parents.\n\n“It is my right to raise my child the way I see fit,” parent Michelle McDowell said before the meeting. “Not the school’s, not the government’s.”\n\nRELATED:Regulation would let students 'self-identify' gender, race without parental OK\n\nRELATED:Gov. Carney meets with Christina families ahead of Wednesday public meeting\n\nCarney directed the Department of Education to come up with Regulation 225. That would require schools to adopt a policy of their own that protects students from discrimination, including specific safeguards for transgender students.\n\nThat could include allowing a student to use the locker room or bathroom that aligns with their chosen gender.\n\nIt stipulates parents be approached for permission only if they are \"supportive of the student\" and aware their child identifies a specific way.\n\nThe regulation has received heated pushback, particularly in conservative Sussex County where some state legislators have encouraged residents to oppose the measure.\n\nSeveral parents who attended the Indian River school board meeting wore red shirts, some embellished with “I SAY NO,” in protest of the rule.\n\nNo one at the meeting publicly spoke in favor of the measure, including the board members. District officials outlined concerns regarding potential litigation, costly renovations and overwhelming public opposition.\n\nSome parents, like McDowell, say they will pull their children from public school if the regulation passes. She questioned how students, as minors, can make adult decisions without parental input.\n\n“Who are they to decide whether or not a parent is being supportive?” she asked. “Who is the authority who gets to make this decision?”\n\nProposal origins\n\nThe proposal came from a task force created by Carney in July as an effort to help schools institute safeguards for “protected characteristics” such as gender, age, race, sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nThe state has prohibited discrimination based on those characteristics since 2013, and also bars insurance companies from limiting or excluding health care coverage for transgender people.\n\nA memo from Carney to the Department of Education outlines a model policy each district could adopt as is or tailor by working with the community.\n\n“We will take our time with it,” said Mark Steele, Indian River School District Superintendent. “We will probably hold a couple extra meetings to make sure everyone in the community is aware of the policy that we would be adopting.”\n\nSupporters, including national LGBTQ organizations, have applauded Delaware’s efforts.\n\nEliza Byard, executive director of the New York City-based Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, called the proposal an important, common-sense step that would “provide greater clarity for schools and greater security for the transgender students of Delaware.”\n\nThe rule could put Delaware on “the right side of history” for equal protection regardless of gender and sexual orientation, said Sal Seeley of CAMP Rehoboth.\n\n“So many trans students have been discriminated against, either having to use locker rooms they don’t belong in or being misgendered by others, being forced to walk 15-20 minutes to go use a separate bathroom,” he said. “And by writing this, the state is saying these students have as much equal rights as other students.”\n\nFourteen states have laws or regulations protecting LGBTQ students from discrimination at school, while anti-bullying laws have been adopted by 18 states to protect students from harassment based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, according to Byard's New York group.\n\nLack of support in Sussex\n\nParents and grandparents also protested the proposal during a Cape Henlopen Board of Education meeting earlier in November.\n\n“Parents don’t know about it,” said Ave Mulhelm of Milton. “They think it’s an anti-discrimination policy, which sounds great, but there is already an anti-discrimination policy in Delaware.”\n\nMulhelm, a grandmother of public school students and member of the Delaware Family Policy Council – a conservative Christian nonprofit based in Seaford – said allowing children to claim their gender or race could lead to disciplinary problems in the classroom. The bathroom issue, she said, presents a separate problem.\n\n“It is telling kids [they] are allowed to claim their gender and race from K-12, and the school has to honor that,” she said.\n\nState Rep. Rich Collins, R-Millsboro, said the rule could result in mayhem.\n\n“It’s a Pandora’s box,” he said. “There is no legal authority for them to do this.”\n\nCollins said he has contacted an attorney in case the regulation passes.\n\n“If this actually comes to fruition, there will be a lawsuit,” he said. “This is absurd in a time when education in our state is in a crisis.

More than 4,500 adults here identify as transgender, the ninth-highest percentage by population nationwide.\n\nState policy mandates that transgender state employees be called by their preferred names and pronouns and be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice. But those protections don't extend to transgender students, a News Journal investigation has found.\n\nThe state Department of Education, whose mission includes promoting \"safe and healthy environments conducive to learning,\" doesn't track how individual districts treat transgender students and gives no specific guidance to schools, according to department spokeswoman Alison May.\n\n\"Districts are separate government entities from the state governed by locally elected school boards,\" May wrote in an email.\n\nAsked if he would encourage local school districts to adopt formal policies to protect transgender students, Gov. John Carney, who admonished President Trump for rolling back transgender student protections earlier this year, responded that it was a local matter.\n\n\"I expect them to work with their communities to ensure every student can use their schools' facilities comfortably and without fear,\" he wrote in a statement.\n\nOther states don't cede that control. In New York, the state education department announced last month that it would build or designate single-stall restrooms in all 1,100 school buildings to meet the needs of transgender and gender nonconforming students, and those with medical conditions or disabilities.\n\nSTORY: Transgender teen pushes boundaries to be legal\n\nAbsent state oversight in Delaware, none of the 11 public school districts that responded to questions from The News Journal has enacted a policy to give transgender students equal access to bathrooms, locker rooms and other facilities that align with their gender identity. Rather, individual school principals handle requests on a \"case-by-case basis,\" a majority of district spokespeople said, refusing to elaborate.\n\nSpokespeople for the Colonial and Indian River school districts noted that their districts' nondiscrimination policies cover gender identity.\n\n\"We have a committee in place that is addressing the transgender issue,\" Colonial spokeswoman Lauren Wilson said, declining further comment.\n\nIndian River spokesman David Maull said he wasn't aware of any transgender students enrolled in the 10,000-student Sussex County district.\n\nIn 2014, Indian River students flooded a school board meeting to protest comments made by one board member, Shaun Fink, about eliminating homosexuality from the health curriculum and promoting abstinence-only education. Fink later resigned, citing the district's \"acquiescence to the homosexual agenda.\"\n\nThat same year, the state Human Relations Commission began investigating the Cape Henlopen School District in Lewes after reports surfaced about a teacher disparaging gay students in her class, and members of the Gay-Straight Alliance Club complained that they were prevented from wearing rainbow-colored stoles at graduation.\n\nAt the time, high school Principal Brian Donahue explained that graduation stoles were limited to members of academic-oriented and service-oriented clubs. The district later amended its policy to allow stoles for all approved high school clubs and organizations.\n\nEarlier this year, Cape senior Arianna Carpenito, who is a lesbian, said she was so incensed by the school's lack of tolerance that she created T-shirts for her and her friends accusing Cape of supporting homophobia, racism and transphobia.\n\nWhen Carpenito wore the shirt to school in April, administrators ordered her to change, explaining that her political statement violated the school dress code, she said. Carpenito later wore a similar shirt to a school board meeting in protest.\n\n\"Teachers are preaching that homosexuality leads to polygamy and pedophilia,\" she said recently. Four other LGBT Cape students told The News Journal they had heard similar insults from faculty.\n\nDonahue declined a recent request for comment. District Assistant Superintendent Cathy Petitgout wrote in an email that individual schools provide accommodations for LGBT students on a case-by-case basis, but declined to be more specific.\n\nMadison, who socially transitioned from male to female two years ago and is now a freshman at Cape Henlopen High, said she had to circulate a petition and threaten a \"bathroom strike\" before the school would agree to let her use the girl's bathroom.\n\n\"I don't even know how I'm going to do this,\" she said of the next three years.\n\nIn Appoquinimink, spokeswoman Lillian Miles said no transgender student has \"requested the use of a bathroom or locker facility that corresponds to his or her gender identity.\"\n\nAppoquininimk, along with Milford and Polytech, offers transgender students the option of using gender-neutral bathrooms in the nurse's office or elsewhere. That practice, successfully challenged in courts nationwide, has been criticized by national LGBT organizations for further isolating transgender students.\n\nThree districts — Brandywine, Christina and Red Clay in New Castle County — reported that some or all of their schools open up bathrooms and locker rooms to transgender students that match their gender identity.\n\nIn Red Clay, where Madison had to use the nurse's bathroom before she switched to Cape Henlopen, administrators have no record that the transgender girl experienced bullying, spokeswoman Pati Nash said.\n\n\"She had a lot of friends,\" Nash added.\n\nAt Brandywine, Superintendent Mark Holodick said he has personally met with four transgender students this school year. The district is weighing adopting a formal policy to codify transgender student rights, he said.\n\n\"The topic isn't easy or comfortable to navigate,\" Holodick acknowledged. \"At some point, I do think the state should provide guidance.\"\n\nSpokespeople for the remaining eight districts, half of them in Sussex, did not respond to any questions on the issue.\n\nThe News Journal did not survey all private and charter schools statewide. But after hearing reports from students that some Delaware Catholic schools bar same-sex couples from attending school dances, the newspaper asked the Catholic Diocese of Wilmington to provide details on how individual schools treat LGBT students.\n\nDiocese spokesman Robert Krebs declined to answer specific questions, citing student privacy concerns. LGBT policies are developed at \"the school level to address the needs of the particular school community,\" he wrote in an email.\n\n\"The formal, written policy in all of our schools is that all students must at all times be treated with kindness and respect since all are made in the image and likeness of God,\" he added.\n\nIt's not surprising that Delaware schools are tight-lipped on such a politically charged, sensitive issue, said Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights in Washington, D.C., which promotes LGBT-inclusive policies.\n\n\"Treating people the same may make people uncomfortable but we never as a country see that as a good justification for discrimination,\" Minter said. \"It's a shame that this has become something that schools are afraid of even talking about.\"\n\nDoing so can be a Catch-22. Taking a formal stand can expose a district to a flurry of privacy-invasion lawsuits filed by non-transgender students, parents and conservative Christian organizations. By doing nothing, a district can be sued for violating Title IX, a 1972 federal law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in any educational program or activity that receives federal funding.\n\nTitle IX protections remain in effect even after the Trump administration in February revoked Obama-era protections for transgender students in public schools. Previously, the Obama administration had urged public schools to give transgender students access to restrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities or risk losing federal funding.\n\nEven before the Obama-era guidelines were in place, LGBT rights organizations successfully sued school districts to uphold transgender student protections.\n\nIn turn, the Alliance for Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian nonprofit, has represented nontransgender students and their parents who feel violated by policies that allow biological males to undress alongside biological females.\n\nHeartened by the Trump administration's recent action, Kerri Kupac, the alliance's legal counsel, said many of her clients have been \"bullied into silence.\"\n\n\"The reality is there's a reason we wear clothing,\" she added. \"People are fundamentally private about their bodies and anatomy.\"\n\nTrump's move kicked the issue back to the states and local districts. Appearing before a House Appropriations subcommittee last month, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos reiterated the administration's hands-off approach by refusing to say whether she would withhold federal funds from private schools that discriminate against LGBT students.\n\nSimilarly, Roger Severino, who now heads the Civil Rights Office of the Department of Health and Human Services, has argued against same-sex marriage and extending civil rights protections to transgender people.\n\nThe Alliance filed a federal lawsuit in March against the Boyertown School District in Pennsylvania on behalf of a high school student and his parents. The student charged that his \"bodily privacy\" was violated after he saw a transgender male student wearing a bra in the boys' locker room.\n\nThat suit came only a few weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court decided against hearing the case of transgender high school student Gavin Grimm, who was suing his Virginia school district for the right to use the boys' bathroom. Given the Trump administration's policy shift, the high court sent the controversial case back to the same U.S. appeals court that had ruled in Grimm's favor under the old federal guidelines.\n\nNewark Charter School Director Gregory Meece contributed to an amicus, or friend of the court, brief filed in the Grimm case. The charter school permits transgender students to access bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity.\n\n\"All students deserve to feel safe and accepted at school,\" Meece said in an interview\n\nIn 2015, Media Matters, a progressive research nonprofit, contacted officials at the largest school districts in a dozen states that have laws protecting transgender students. None reported \"any incidences of harassment or inappropriate behavior\" by allowing transgender students to access facilities that align with their gender identity, the group found.\n\nLast month, the private Wilmington Friends School held its first \"LGBT+\" dance open to all New Castle County high schoolers, offering them a nonjudgmental space.\n\nThe Quaker school, with 750 students, adopted a formal policy last year addressing transgender student rights, encompassing proper pronouns, access to bathrooms, locker rooms, field trips and more.\n\n\"Everything that's important to us is in writing,\" noted Kathleen Martin, the school's director of College Guidance.\n\nWilmington Friends' guidelines are modeled after another Quaker school in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The defining belief of Quakerism is that there is 'that of God' in everyone, according to the policy.\n\nSTORY: Under Trump, LBGT students fear their futures\n\nUnlike private schools, public schools have to answer to local taxpayers who may have strong opinions.\n\n\"People still have the same rights they had before Trump pulled the guidelines,\" said Richard Morse, legal director for the ACLU of Delaware. But if school districts fail to adopt written policies, he said, \"it's more likely people will make a mistake.\"\n\nIn the last year, the local ACLU has intervened on behalf of two transgender Delaware students who reported harassment and bathroom access problems at their schools. Both complaints were resolved privately without court intervention, Morse said.\n\nThe ACLU, in coordination with other national advocacy groups, has published a first-of-its-kind guide to help K-12 schools \"foster gender-inclusive learning environments.\" Among the recommendations are to give transgender students access to all facilities that correspond with their gender identity and update school databases to reflect the students' preferred names and gender markers. Other typical stumbling points involve afterschool programs, yearbooks, lunch cards and more.\n\n\"Even in the most supportive of school settings,\" the guide notes, \"simple bureaucratic oversights can cause real trauma for a transgender student.\"\n\nDownward spiral\n\nDelaware schools' lack of consistency in supporting transgender students has real consequences for their emotional well-being and ability to succeed, said Linda Gregory, president of the Rehoboth PFLAG support group for LGBT children, parents and allies.\n\nMore than half of transgender and gender nonconforming people who were bullied, harassed or assaulted in school because of their gender identity have attempted suicide, as reported in a 2010 survey conducted by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and National Center for Transgender Equality.\n\nA more recent survey from 2015 found that the majority of respondents who were openly transgender or perceived as transgender in grades K-12 experienced some form of mistreatment, including being verbally harassed (54 percent), physically attacked (24 percent), and sexually assaulted (13 percent) because they were transgender. Further, 17 percent experienced such severe mistreatment that they left a school as a result.\n\nThe Delaware Department of Education reported six substantiated incidents of bullying related to gender identity and expression and eight related to sexual orientation during the 2015-16 school year. That's roughly one-third of the cases documented three years prior.\n\nThe state Human Relations Commission, the agency responsible for enforcing Delaware's Equal Accommodations Law, has received no complaints from transgender students in the last five years, according to Commission Director Romona Fuller.\n\nLocal LGBT advocates say that does not tell the whole story, explaining that not all complaints bubble up to the state level.\n\nIn Sussex, where voters overwhelmingly supported Trump in the recent presidential election, most transgender students are homeschooled to avoid being harassed, said Gregory, who is not aware of an active Gay-Straight Alliance at any school in western Sussex.\n\n\"Students complain that their teachers say, 'You're going to hell,'\" she added.\n\nOne Sussex parent, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, said her 9-year-old transgender daughter begs to be homeschooled to avoid nasty comments from her peers and school bus drivers. Similarly, the girl's mother said she has been harassed by other parents online and at the school pick-up spot for \"putting little girls in harm's way.\"\n\nThe school, which the mother declined to identify, permits her daughter to use the girl's bathroom and added gender-neutral lavatories on each floor and more library books that address fluid gender roles. But administrators are reluctant to reprimand students who gender-shame her daughter, the mother said.\n\nIn one instance, a former friend of her daughter's publicly outed her in front of an entire class for using the girl's bathroom. Mortified and humiliated, the transgender girl refused to use the girl's bathroom for the rest of the year, and instead used a converted staff bathroom at the opposite end of the hall.\n\n\"It seems to me they are handling this as if my child will be the last transgender child to come out,\" the mother said.\n\nWhile access to bathrooms has dominated media coverage of transgender students, local advocates say they struggle quietly to use their preferred names on school IDs and standardized tests, and to be assigned to health classes and sports teams that correspond to their gender identity.\n\nAccording to Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association guidelines, transgender students are permitted to participate on teams that match their gender identity as long as the member school agrees and the student meets \"minimum standards\" developed by the association.\n\nThose standards include producing an official document with the student's gender identity listed, undergoing sexual reassignment surgery, or having a doctor certify that the student is in the process of transitioning. The association doesn't track how many transgender students play on Delaware sports teams, a spokesman said.\n\nDespite the state's paucity of data related to the school experience for transgender children and teens, Delaware officials continue to trumpet the state's record on protecting LGBT civil rights.\n\nLast year, in reaction to the controversial North Carolina bathroom bill, then-Gov. Jack Markell and Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, penned an op-ed for CNN.\n\nIn it, the pair praised Delaware as a place \"where transgender people can fully participate in society, including by using facilities in accordance with their gender identities.\"\n\nStarting this month, the state the Department of Education will use $700 from a multi-focused $1.8 million federal grant to offer one two-hour training for faculty, staff and parents to help navigate issues of transgender student inclusion, a Carney spokesman said.\n\nMore training is sorely needed, according to Bob Martz of the United Way Pride Council. In 2012, when the Pride Council began training administrators and teachers on gender identity issues, fewer than 15 schools statewide had Gay-Straight Alliance student groups.\n\nThat number has since doubled. The program also funds one LGBTQ case manager at Big Brothers, Big Sisters of Delaware, the first position of its kind in the country.\n\n\"We stay away from the bathroom talk,\" noted Martz, who prefers to review basic LGBT terminology during training. \"Is every teacher accepting? Hell no.\"\n\nSTORY: Transgender teen pushes boundaries to be legal\n\nCloud with a rainbow lining\n\nMaddie Heeney is one of the lucky ones. When classmates first teased her as a female imposter, she was too young to remember.\n\nNow 17, the transgender girl from Wilmington bats her long lashes and wears a scrunchie around her wrist. At age 2, a family member watched the biological boy sashay upstairs and blurted out: \"You know she's gay, right?\"\n\nAt age 6, Maddie, who went by a different name, told her parents she wanted to grow up to be a mommy. One year later, she was in therapy, and three years after that, she socially transitioned from male to female.\n\nHeeney's mother, Andrea Rashbaum, remembers having to pull Maddie out of her elementary school, which she declined to name. Administrators refused to accept Rashbaum's offer for staff training on LGBT issues, she said.\n\n\"Boys don't do that,\" was something Maddie heard often. To appear hypermasculine, she joined soccer and karate and got a buzzcut. She visited a therapist more than an hour's drive away to avoid running into classmates while wearing her pink T-shirts.\n\nBy fifth grade, Maddie was enrolled in the private Newark Center for Creative Learning. By that time, she had formally changed her name and presented as a girl.\n\nAfter she was outed by a former classmate, one family snatched their daughter from the Montessori school.\n\nToday, Maddie is one of about seven transgender students at Cab Calloway School of the Arts in Wilmington, where she has access to all amenities that correspond to her gender identity. Last year, after noticing that the hashtag #transtakeover was trending on Twitter, she decided to come out to many of her high school classmates who had no idea she was different.\n\n\"Some people don't know,\" she tweeted. \"But (expletive deleted) it.\"\n\n\"There's definitely a loss,\" admits Maddie's father, Brian, who used to call his son Buddy. \"Older memories don't go with Maddie now.\"\n\n\"It was society that told me I was a boy,\" his daughter politely corrects him.\n\nDownstate, another transgender teen reluctantly accepts the role of proud pioneer as the only openly transgender student in her high school.\n\nEven though substitute teachers continue to use her birth name during roll call, Madison feels more accepted here than at Skyline. A statuesque brunette, she plans to try out for cheerleading and run for prom queen. Sassy and self-assured, she insists that she doesn't care what anyone else thinks.\n\nYet she still yearns to blend in.\n\n\"I want to have a normal experience as every other girl in Cape,\" she said.\n\nReporter Jessica Bies contributed to this report.\n\nContact Margie Fishman at (302) 324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.\n\nAccommodations for transgender students vary by school district\n\nThe following school districts did not respond to any questions posed by The News Journal related to the treatment of transgender students: Caesar Rodney, Capital, Delmar, Lake Forest, Laurel, Seaford, Smyrna and Woodbridge\n\nNone of the 11 of 19 districts that responded to The News Journal has a formal policy to deal with transgender students.

He is allowed to play against out-of-state teams and Delaware Independent School Conference teams, which allow fifth-year seniors to participate in athletics. But he is not allowed to play against other DIAA member schools.\n\n\"We look at it like sometimes a guy gets injured and you've got to play without that guy,\" St. Andrew's coach Terrell Myers said. \"But he's great. He's been handling it great. I'm proud of him. He's been a leader, and he's continuing to get better.\"\n\nBentil has only had to sit out one of the Saints' first seven games, a 52-45 loss to No. 4-ranked Archmere on Dec. 12. Barring any change in eligibility, he will not be allowed to play in five of St. Andrew's final 12 games. Bentil must sit out against Glasgow, Smyrna, Dover, St. Georges and Brandywine.\n\nThe 6-foot-8 senior makes a huge difference in the Saints' lineup, averaging 17.5 points per game. He had 25 points and 16 rebounds in a 66-45 loss to No. 1-ranked Sanford on Jan. 14, and 31 points in a 55-42 victory over Wilmington Friends on Saturday. Bentil signed a national letter of intent with Providence College in November, choosing the Friars over Georgetown and Miami.\n\nBentil came to the United States from Ghana at the age of 15. He spent his freshman year at Haverford School (Pa.), then transferred to St. Andrew's.\n\nMyers said Bentil attended a school in Ghana from May to July before his freshman year. But without sufficient documentation to prove that claim, the DIAA has interpreted that to count as a full year. Myers said St. Andrew's is working to prove Bentil attended school in Ghana for only three months, in hopes that the DIAA could reconsider its ruling before the season ends.\n\nSt. Andrew's is 2-5, as the Saints have played only three in-state games and have been tested against some of the top teams in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. St. Andrew's is allowed to count games involving Bentil in its state-tournament points index, but without a new ruling Bentil will not be allowed to play in the state tournament. Myers said St. Andrew's has not decided whether it would accept a postseason bid if the school qualifies, since the tournament falls during the boarding school's three-week spring break. The Saints have played in the tournament the last two years.\n\n\"We're fine,\" Myers said. \"Our thing is to go out there and play competitive basketball against good teams. We're not worried about the state tournament. At St. Andrew's, we come out here to compete and play basketball.

The university has taken immediate action to quarantine the impacted students and is going above and beyond all guidance from public health officials,” spokesman Preston Sparks wrote in an email to the Associated Press. Sparks in a follow-up email said it involved four COVID-19 cases. The school did not name the fraternity or dorm. The university said that 32 students and eight employees tested positive for COVID-19 last week. Sparks said the students will remain quarantined until each has received medical clearance. The students will complete coursework remotely while quarantined. Auburn has about 30,000 students on its main campus. The university is requiring face coverings, both indoors and outdoors on campus, and has taken other steps to try to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The University of Alaska Anchorage will drop its men’s hockey program and three other sports next year because of significant reductions in state funding, the university said Wednesday. The school also will cut men’s and women’s skiing and women’s gymnastics. The moves will save about $2.5 million a year, chancellor Cathy Sandeen said. “This comes at a difficult time as they are already facing much uncertainty surrounding this year’s season due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Sandeen said. The Seawolves will go from sponsoring 13 sports to nine. The hockey team began play in 1979. The ski program dates to 1970, and the Seawolves have had nine skiers win national championships. About 55 athletes, seven coaches and two athletic department staff members are impacted. Travel to the Lower 48 states for competitions exacerbated the athletic department’s financial woes. Recent budget issues made the situation untenable.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Arizona’s downward trend of coronavirus cases means parts of the state could meet all three metrics the state’s health and education departments set for at least a partial reopening of schools by Labor Day, according to a former state health director. And bars and nightclubs in at least some counties could meet the parameters for reopening shortly after that, according to Will Humble, who now leads the Arizona Public Health Association. But caution is the word of the day, according to Humble and Dr. Joshua LaBaer, executive director of the ASU Biodesign Institute, which has been tracking the virus in Arizona. “Arizona continues on what I would consider a positive trend, a good trend for us,” LaBaer said Wednesday at his weekly media briefing. Humble credited local government officials for requiring masks and gives the Republican governor credit for closing bars. The third element in the case drop, he believes, is some level of so-called “herd immunity” that came from lots of people being infected.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas is seeking $300 in additional weekly federal unemployment benefits, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday as the state reported 729 new confirmed coronavirus cases. Hutchinson said the state is submitting its application to the federal government for the unemployment extension. He said state lawmakers are also reviewing the request. Arkansas is the latest state to seek the extended benefits under an executive order issued by President Donald Trump this month. Congress approved payments of $600 a week at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, but those benefits expired Aug. 1 and Congress has been unable to agree on an extension. Hutchinson opted against seeking $400 in weekly benefits, which would have required the state to pay a quarter of the cost. Hutchinson has said that would cost $265 million and would require tapping into coronavirus relief money the state has received that’s already been allocated for other programs.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Mayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday that he authorized shutting off utility services at a home in the Hollywood Hills that has been the site of raucous parties despite a ban on large gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. “Despite several warnings, this house has turned into a nightclub in the hills, hosting large gatherings in flagrant violation of our public health orders,” Garcetti said. “The city has now disconnected utilities at this home to stop these parties that endanger our community.” The city did not identify the home’s address or the owner. Garcetti announced earlier this month that he would ask the city’s Department of Water and Power to shut off service to houses and businesses hosting parties. With bars closed in town, large house parties can become “superspreaders” of COVID-19, Garcetti said. The announcement came days after an Aug. 3 party at a mansion where hundreds of people gathered without masks or social distancing. The party ended in a shooting that killed a woman and wounded two other people.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo:With the looming start of the 2020 Colorado State Fair, Pueblo County’s COVID-19 testing site will be temporarily relocated. The Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment said the site will move while the expo is in session, and an announcement about where the new site will be will be made soon. The site will be moved from Monday through Sept. 9, according to the health department. Testing will remain from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. The testing site is expected to move back to the fairgrounds once the state fair has ended. The site opened in April and 8,652 tests have been conducted there. There have been a total of 14,369 COVID-19 tests completed in Pueblo County to date. The fair runs from Aug. 28-31.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: University of Connecticut officials have evicted several students from on-campus housing after learning of a crowded dormitory room party with no mask-wearing or social distancing, which violated the school’s coronavirus rules. School officials notified the campus community of the disciplinary actions and investigations in a letter Tuesday night. Students began returning to campus Aug. 14, all were tested for the virus and all were supposed to limit their contact with others during their first 14 days back on campus. Video of the party was posted on social media. “Students were not wearing masks, closely assembled, and endangering not only their own health and well-being, but that of others at a time when UConn is working to protect our community and resume classes in the context of a deadly global pandemic,” said the letter sent by Eleanor Daugherty, associate vice president and dean of students, and Pamela Schipani, executive director of residential life. Temporary disciplinary action was taken against an undisclosed number of students and they were removed from student housing pending a school investigation, they said. Many colleges have changed course and moved all undergraduate classes online as schools struggle to contain outbreaks and students continue to gather in large groups without masks or social distancing. UConn officials, however, said there is no outbreak at the Storrs campus and the students’ actions were not representative of the entire student body, most of which has been following the coronavirus protocols. About 5,000 students are on campus.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Delaware and New Castle County are giving out $100million in grants for small businesses and nonprofits in the state. The program known as DE Relief Grants, which was announced on Wednesday afternoon, will provide grants ranging from $30,000 to $100,000 to 3,000 small businesses and nonprofits, according to a news release from Gov. John Carney's office. Organizations can use the money to buy equipment such as PPE, air purifiers or plexiglass to make the workplace safer during the COVID-19 pandemic; refinance debt incurred because of COVID-19, including the state's HELP loans; advertise efforts undertaken as a result of COVID-19; and fix expenses accrued during COVID-19. The size of the grant will depend on the organization's 2019 revenue. The Division of Small Business is administering the program and will start accepting applications in early September at business.delaware.gov/relief.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:As of Wednesday, 600 people have died from COVID-19 in the District of Columbia, WUSA-TV reported. The District reported 29 new cases of the coronavirus – its lowest daily number of cases since July 4. D.C. health has now reported successfully contact tracing more than 90% of new coronavirus cases for 60 consecutive days.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee:With more than 28% of Florida voters casting ballots, Tuesday’s pandemic-shaded elections drew the largest state primary turnout in 18 years – setting the stage for what could be another record in November. The primary can prove a tough sell to voters, but almost 3.9 million cast ballots in the primary – almost 1 million more than during 2016 presidential year. The turnout also was the largest in a presidential year Florida primary since 1992, when 35% of voters cast ballots. About 1.1 million people voted at the polls on Tuesday.Much of the primary turnout increase was powered by the 2.3 million vote-by-mail ballots submitted, which represented about 59% of all votes cast.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp defended his administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic in fiery remarks Wednesday after a report from the White House coronavirus task force said Georgia led the nation last week in new cases per capita. The White House report, dated Sunday, recommends several steps to curb the virus that Kemp has declined to take, including closing bars and issuing mask mandates in counties with 50 or more active cases. Kemp was among the first governors to ease earlier restrictions this spring, and although infections declined for weeks afterward, they began to rise in June and peaked in late July. First reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the report said “Georgia’s small gains are fragile and statewide progress will require continued, expanded, and stronger mitigation efforts, including in all open schools.” Kemp insisted Wednesday that other markers he’s watching paint a different picture. The report from the White House coronavirus task force says that last week Georgia had 216 new cases per 100,000 residents, compared to the national average of 112 new cases per 100,000 residents. State health officials say more than 243,000 people in Georgia have contracted the virus and at least 4,849 people have died from COVID-19.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii attorney general’s office denies threatening a Republican state House of Representatives candidate with arrest for violating a traveler quarantine mandated to protect the islands from the spread of the coronavirus. Lori Ford was in California visiting family when Hawaii’s 14-day quarantine on arriving travelers went into effect in March. She returned in May to file candidacy papers and then returned to California. Agents from the Hawaii attorney general’s office contacted her and told her she would be arrested for violating the quarantine, Ford and her attorney Bilal Essayli said. Because of that threat, she remains in California. “Our office has communicated with Ms. Ford’s attorney, and we informed him that if Ms. Ford were charged, we would contact him so he could assist her in receiving the Complaint and a penal summons to appear in court,” Krishna Jayaram, spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said in a statement. “These communications did not contemplate or threaten Ms. Ford with arrest should she return to Hawaii.” Ford said she didn’t attempt to seek an exemption to the quarantine so that she could file her candidacy papers. Essayli said she was required to appear in person at the elections office by June 2. However, Nedielyn Bueno of the state Office of Elections said Wednesday a candidate is not required to file candidacy papers in person. “Candidates may have a representative deliver or submit the required documents by mail,” she said. Authorities have routinely arrested tourists and returning residents for violating the quarantine.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Wednesday called the part-time Legislature back into a special session because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Republican governor in a news release said the special session will start Monday. He said lawmakers will consider election law changes as well as establishing temporary civil liability standards related to the pandemic. Lawmakers meeting in special working groups comprised of senators and representatives from both parties have been calling for a special session to address those two issues. Election officials have testified before those lawmakers that polling places for the November election could be limited because of a lack of volunteers afraid of getting the virus and some facilities declining to be polling places. That has led to suggestions of polling centers with expanded voting times as well as using National Guard soldiers at polling places. Election officials have also sought changes in the absentee ballot system to make vote counting more efficient due to possibly much larger numbers of absentee ballots. Another group of lawmakers said that a liability shield law is needed to protect government, schools and private businesses from frivolous lawsuits. Lawmakers said that if someone gets the virus at a school or workplace, they could file a lawsuit. But others said such a liability shield would remove responsibility from businesses, schools and government.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Gov. J.B. Pritzker touted a University of Illinois saliva test on Wednesday as a potential “game changer” in the fight against COVID-19. The test, which involves spitting into a test tube, can offer results in hours and is expected to cost about $10. The university has performed more than 50,000 tests since making it available at no cost to faculty, staff and students last month. University officials said Wednesday that the test had become the latest to receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The university expects to test up to 20,000 students at a day when the fall semester begins next week and students will be required to be tested twice a week. Pritzker said there are possibilities for the tests to be used statewide, particularly for K-12 schools. “If ongoing research continues to yield positive results, this has potentially game-changing implications for our statewide testing complex as well as for testing on a national level,” Pritzker said. “The potential here is enormous.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State officials are working to develop a public website that will track the number of coronavirus cases among students, teacher and other employees at Indiana’s K-12 schools. Dr. Kristina Box, the state health commissioner, said her goal was to have the website available by mid- to late September and that the information would broken down by individual school. The public tracking system is being developed as school districts across the state have struggled with reopening decisions. Gov. Eric Holcomb and state health officials have declined to set benchmarks for the circumstances when schools should close their doors to students. Several of the state’s largest school districts have started the academic year with only online classes. Some opened with in-person classes only to backtrack after facing coronavirus cases.\n\nIowa\n\nCoralville: An increase in coronavirus cases prompted Iowa prison officials on Wednesday to stop admitting inmates from county jails to the Iowa Medical and Classification Center in Coralville. The Department of Corrections said 59 inmates tested positive in the last week out of nearly 800 tests conducted at the center. When officials believe the virus is no longer spreading in the facility, it will end the suspension. Staff implemented enhanced quarantine and testing measures after an inmate tested positive for the coronavirus last week. Inmates typically are temporarily assigned to the center before being sent to another prison in Iowa’s system. The Coralville center usually admits about 65 inmates a week from jails.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: University of Kansas Chancellor Douglas Girod is seeking permission to obtain a $20 million, short-term line of credit in case the coronavirus pandemic significantly modifies the 2020 football and basketball seasons. The Lawrence Journal-World reported that Girod said in an email calling an emergency meeting of the governing board that oversees Kansas Athletics that the line of credit is just to provide “emergency liquidity.” Girod said the credit would also allow Kansas athletics to continue its operations in such a scenario without having to ask the university for financial assistance. The university is facing a budgeting shortfall of at least $120 million on its own during the current fiscal year. The meeting will take place through a group email, with the results of each board member’s vote made public. Votes must be submitted by 5 p.m. Friday. Girod, as chairman of the board, also requested that members give University of Kansas Athletic Director Jeff Long permission to refinance nearly $30 million in outstanding bond debt. If board members allow Long to undertake the financial restructuring, both the refinanced bond debt and emergency line of credit will be up for a final discussion and vote at the board’s September meeting.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron has ruled that the state cannot force religious schools to close as long as they are following health recommendations put in place to protect against the coronavirus. Cameron wrote in the Wednesday opinion that a forced closure of religious schools by Gov. Andy Beshear would violate the U.S. Constitution and state law, news outlets reported. When asked about the opinion, Beshear said Wednesday that “nobody is trying to close any school that is complying with guidelines and preventing outbreaks.” “I don’t know where that came from,” the Courier-Journal quoted him as saying. Republican state Sen. Wil Schroder requested the opinion, according to the ruling. Cameron said in a statement that religious schools were protected by the Constitution, even during the pandemic. “Religiously affiliated schools are an important extension of faith for many Kentucky families, and the state cannot prevent them from operating so long as necessary health precautions are observed,” according to the statement. The opinion comes after Beshear recommended Kentucky schools begin the year with online learning until Sept. 28 to give more time to bring a recent surge in virus cases under control. The Archdiocese of Louisville and other religious schools, as well as some public districts, have decided to move ahead with or have already begun reopening for in-person classes, the newspaper said. Others have said they plan to start virtually.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: As college students return to campus, Gov. John Bel Edwards is urging them to take precautions against the coronavirus, worried the schools could undercut recent progress the state has made in fighting the pandemic. Louisiana continued Wednesday to have one of the nation’s highest per capita virus infection rates in recent weeks. But the average number of new confirmed cases per day has fallen by more than 50% over the past 14 days, to about 1,000. The number of people hospitalized with the COVID-19 disease caused by the coronavirus also has significantly declined. But elementary and secondary schools started opening this month, and move-in days began last week at Louisiana’s universities, raising fears of a new spike in COVID-19 just as the state is making strides to contain its second surge of the disease. “This is going to be a lot more movement, a lot more activity and people coming into contact with one another than we have seen on our campuses since March … so we have to be especially vigilant right now,” Edwards said. Louisiana’s universities are planning to hold classes through a mix of in-person and online learning, with a wary eye toward the experiences in other states. Edwards is asking college students to wear masks as the state requires, maintain social distancing and to “think twice about going” to a party or event if it will be packed with people not following those rules.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The largest school district in Maine has approved a plan for the upcoming school year that will mix in-person learning with remote instruction. The Portland Board of Public Education unanimously approved the proposal on Wednesday. The school year will begin on Sept. 14. The proposal calls for elementary students to return to school full-time on Oct. 13. The possibility of more in-person learning for middle-schoolers is scheduled to be reassessed after the first trimester, school officials said. The plan also calls for students in grades 10 through 12 to take courses remotely four days a week and receive in-person instruction in a learning center one day a week. District officials said they hope to “maximize in-person learning time for students in grades 10-12 starting in October.” The district has more than 6,700 students.\n\nMaryland\n\nTowson: Multiple Maryland inmates have filed federal lawsuits alleging a leak spilled sewage into cells for days and that rules meant to protect against the coronavirus are being repeatedly ignored in state facilities. Baltimore County inmates Keith Wiggins and Reginald Dorsey said in separate complaints filed last week in U.S. District Court that they were forced to sit in dirty jails without running water for at least four days in April, The Baltimore Sun reported Thursday, citing the lawsuits.The men said staff members were slow in responding, and when they did, they shut off the water in the cells and kept inmates locked inside. The allegations join those that were contained in several other federal complaints recently filed against the Baltimore County Detention Center. Inmates are seeking damages and asking the court to address what they said are chronic health and safety issues, as well as repeated violations of coronavirus guidelines. Another inmate, Renardo Whitehead, alleged in a separate federal lawsuit that he asked for a coronavirus test several times and was denied. He added that staff has ignored social distancing orders, allowing groups of nearly 20 people to congregate. Other inmates accused prison officials of failing to provide proper access to protective equipment and overlooking mask mandates. The Director of the Baltimore County Department of Corrections contended the department has been following safety measures.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston:Ten people who work at a Massachusetts courthouse have tested positive for the coronavirus, and the building will remain closed until further notice, according to a court official. In addition to the 10 employees at New Bedford District Court who tested positive, 25 have tested negative for the disease and additional test results are pending, trial court spokeswoman Jennifer Donahue told The Standard-Times. The facility closed for cleaning and disinfecting last week after an employee tested positive for COVID-19. Donahue said in an email Wednesday that court officials do not yet have a reopening date for the public. “The Trial Court is analyzing the protocol in response to this situation and working with the Department of Public Health,” she said, “There are still virtual hearings going on, and in-person matters for New Bedford are currently taking place in Fall River.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Wednesday that her administration is assessing the risk of reopening Michigan businesses that have been closed for five months under her orders to curb the spread of the coronavirus, saying she will have more to say next week. Movie theaters, gyms and indoor pools are among the places that remain barred from operating in much of the state amid the pandemic. The Democratic governor told reporters her office is working with the state health department to “drill down” into businesses that are closed, “where we can do another assessment on risk mitigation and determine if we might consider making some improvements in the policy.” Whitmer said other states have taken “bad” steps that “we don’t want to do,” but there are “perhaps some things that they have done and been successful.” She has come under criticism from the owners of theaters and fitness clubs – which are now open with capacity restrictions in many other states – for letting Detroit casinos reopen at 15% capacity about two weeks ago while keeping their businesses shut except in northern counties. Other closed operations including amusement parks, arcades, bingo halls, bowling alleys, indoor climbing centers, indoor dance areas, skating rinks, trampoline parks, water parks and other similar recreational or entertainment facilities.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Minnesota’s unemployment rate fell to 7.7% in July from 8.6% a month earlier, the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development said Thursday, but cautioned that job growth is slowing as the coronavirus pandemic persists. The agency said Minnesota added 32,500 payroll jobs in July on a seasonally adjusted basis, while the U.S. added 1.8 million jobs in July. The U.S. unemployment rate was 10.2% for July, down from 11.1% in June. “We’re moving in the right direction, but job growth is slowing, a sign that this recovery will likely take some time,” DEED Commissioner Steve Grove said in a statement. Minnesota’s unemployment rate was 2.9% before the pandemic struck, according to the department’s revised figures. Some groups of Minnesotans have been more affected more than than others during the pandemic. Based on six-month moving averages, the agency said, unemployment for Black Minnesotans was 15.3% in July, up 9 percentage points from 6.3% one year ago. For Hispanic Minnesotans, unemployment was 8.6% in July, double the rate from July 2019. White Minnesotans had a jobless rate of 6.3% in July, up from 3.1% one year ago. Seasonally adjusted job gains in July were led by the leisure and hospitality sector, which added 17,200, or 9.8%.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Outbreaks of the new coronavirus have been found at two of Mississippi’s eight public universities within the first days of students returning to campuses, the state health officer said Wednesday. Dr. Thomas Dobbs said cases at the University of Mississippi in Oxford and Mississippi University for Women in Columbus appear to have originated off-campus. The University of Mississippi said in a memo Wednesday that 13 student-athletes and one employee had tested positive for COVID-19. The memo said 11 of the athletes are on the same team, but it did not name the sport. “These individuals were tested earlier this week as part of a mass screening for student-athletes returning to campus and were instructed to quarantine until test results were received,” the memo said. Mississippi University for Women said on its website Wednesday that seven students had reported testing positive for the virus since Friday, and each had been on campus within a week before the diagnosis. Dobbs said some of the Mississippi University for Women cases can be traced to the Cotton District in Starkville, an area with restaurants and bars that are popular with students from MUW and Mississippi State University.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A businessman who went to prison in June after pleading guilty in a pay-to-play scandal that brought down a top St. Louis County elected official has asked to be released because he has the coronavirus. John Rallo, 55, asked a federal judge to allow him to serve some of his 17-month prison sentence under home confinement with family in Salt Lake City because of health concerns, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Rallo pleaded guilty last summer to three bribery counts as part of a scheme involving former Democratic St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger, who pleaded guilty in May 2019 to corruption charges for providing political favors in exchange for campaign donations. Stenger is serving a sentence of nearly four years in prison. Rallo was sentenced in early March but his date to report to prison was pushed to late June because of the pandemic. In an Aug. 11 letter to U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber, Rallo wrote that his cellmate, Taiwan Davis, died after contracting COVID-19. Rallo’s attorney, Curtis Poore, told the newspaper that Rallo tested positive for the virus on Aug. 2, and that he has been very ill and is still having difficulty breathing. He said Rallo has a compromised immune system because he has thyroid cancer and a blood disorder. “No one deserves to be put in harms way and exposed to COVID-19 as I have been for the last several weeks,” Rallo wrote in his handwritten letter to the judge.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Visitation to Yellowstone National Park has increased substantially despite the coronavirus pandemic, park officials said. Visitation rates were higher in July than they were in the same month last year. This comes after the park’s overall visits had been down 49% from last year through the end of June. The park’s visitation rates were down 32% in June compared to the same month last year. The park hosted 955,645 people in July, up about 2% from July 2019. The influx of visitors occurred despite the fact that campsites and hotels inside Yellowstone have drastically reduced their capacity. Just over 1,000 campsites have been used inside Yellowstone this summer, compared with more than 57,000 last year. Park-operated campgrounds have seen 198,500 people this year compared with 380,900 last year. Concession lodging was down 84% from last year, with 72,700 this year and 465,000 in 2019. Backcountry camping in the national park was down by half. Visitors have used surrounding national forest campgrounds or lodging in bordering gateway communities for shelter instead, The Billings Gazette reported. Grand Teton National Park just to the south of Yellowstone also experienced a 3% increase in July visitors. “We are seeing visitors from all 50 states,” said Wendy Swenson, marketing director for the West Yellowstone Chamber of Commerce, who added that most visitors are from Idaho, California and Utah. Yellowstone was closed in full from March to May as a result of the pandemic. Its two Wyoming entrances reopened its doors on May 18. The park’s three Montana entrances followed suit on June 1.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Thirty-five confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Omaha-area schools in the early weeks of the school year, Douglas County health director Adi Pour said. Seventeen students and 18 school staff members have tested positive as of Tuesday night, Pour said Wednesday. Another 152 students, staff and faculty who had close contact with those who are ill were in quarantine, The Omaha World-Herald reported. Pour told the Douglas County Board of Health she was surprised more cases haven’t been confirmed but attributed that in part to the Omaha Public Schools teaching only remote classes for the first quarter. Positive cases have been confirmed at the Millard, Gretna and Ralston school districts in recent days, she said. County health department employees and experts from the Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center are working with schools to respond to the coronavirus.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A veteran Las Vegas police lieutenant who died from complications of COVID-19 was remembered Wednesday for his police career and for leading a program supporting families of officers injured or killed in the line of duty. Departmental honors for Lt. Erik Lloyd included a vehicle procession on area freeways and the Las Vegas Strip, and a memorial at a church in suburban Henderson. Lloyd, 53, died July 29 at a hospital in Las Vegas in what Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo classified as the line of duty. Lloyd was a police officer for nearly 30 years and was president of the Injured Officers Police Fund for 16 years. He and his wife, Minddie Lloyd, coordinated support for wounded officers and their families. They recently organized a fundraiser for Officer Shay Mikalonis, who is being treated for paralysis after he was shot June 1 during a protest on the Las Vegas Strip. Lloyd was a married father of two with five grandchildren. He was originally from Downey, California, and became a patrol officer in Las Vegas in September 1990. He became a narcotics detective and served in roles in internal affairs, counter-terrorism and use-of-force investigations.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Communities can require that voters and poll workers wear face coverings on Election Day to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, according to state officials. Attorney General Gordon MacDonald and Secretary of State Bill Gardner released a 10-page document Wednesday with guidance for the Sept. 8 primary and Nov. 3 general election. They said they agreed with town moderators that decisions about mask requirements should be made locally given the wide variation in the size of polling places, expected volume of voters and other factors. Communities that require face coverings for voters must, however, provide alternatives for those who can’t or won’t comply, the officials said. Although the officials said they believe towns likewise have the right to require poll workers to wear masks, they also highlighted the “risk of a legal challenge” and urged local officials to consult their attorneys. They noted that some voters might feel uncomfortable encountering unmasked poll workers, and that it might be hard to attract sufficient workers without a mandate. The guidance also clarifies issues around absentee voting, which has been temporarily expanded to allow the coronavirus pandemic as a reason for voting absentee. Municipalities can set up drop boxes to collect absentee ballots from those who don’t mail their ballots – both before Election Day and on Election Day – but the boxes must be staffed by election workers.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The agency that oversees high school sports in New Jersey has decided that indoor fall sports will be delayed until early next year, but outdoor sports will start their seasons in about a month. The New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association’s Sports Advisory Task Force released its “Return to Sports Plan” on Thursday. It features condensed schedules and will keep most contests local. The plan also prohibits out-of-state competition except for “exceptional circumstances” and states postseason play will be limited and local, with no statewide championships. Under the plan, outdoor fall sports – football, cross country, field hockey, girls tennis and soccer – will begin practice on Sept. 14. The girls tennis season will start two weeks later, while cross country, field hockey and soccer will begin competition on Oct. 1. Opening day for football will be Oct. 2. The indoor fall sports – gymnastics and girls volleyball – will be moved to a new, special season that will begin with practices on Feb. 16. They will start their seasons on March 3. The task force noted that if circumstances force the outdoor fall sports to be postponed, their seasons will also be played during this “special season” time frame. Winter sports teams will be allowed to start practicing on Dec. 3, with competition commencing on Dec. 21.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The Albuquerque Public Schools Board voted to extend online instruction through the end of the first semester. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had said classes would take place remotely until at least Sept. 7. The public schools board conducted a survey sent out to all 59,000 parents that said 56.3% of the nearly 14,000 who responded said they were “very uncomfortable” with their children returning to school in person. About 61% of parents who responded said that sending their children back to school in person was an “unnecessary risk.” That same survey found about 29% of the responding parents are thinking about transferring their children to a school that is teaching in-person and just over 34% are thinking about switching their children to home schooling. About 10% have transferred their children’s schools, and just below 12% have switched their children to home schooling. Three public schools in the jurisdiction have had positive cases of the coronavirus. East San Jose Elementary has seen two cases and Hawthorne Elementary and Hayes Middle School have had one each. All three schools are closed.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo dismissed concerns that his state’s coronavirus death toll in nursing homes could be a significant undercount, saying it makes sense to include only those residents who died on the home’s property. Unlike the federal government and every other state with major outbreaks, only New York explicitly said that it counts just residents who died on nursing home property and not those who were transported to hospitals and died there. “If you die in the nursing home, it’s a nursing home death. If you die in the hospital, it’s called a hospital death,” the Democratic governor said Wednesday during an interview on Albany public radio station WAMC. “It doesn’t say where were you before.” Cuomo said if New York were to count a death as a nursing home death and a hospital death, that could lead to a “double count.” “And if I’m a nursing home operator, I say: ‘Don’t say that person died in my nursing home, because they didn’t,’ ” Cuomo said. “‘They died in the hospital. And if the hospital did a better job, they wouldn’t have died. So why do I get the blame for the death when it didn’t happen in my nursing home?’ So it depends on how you want to argue it.” Some New York lawmakers have accused Cuomo’s administration of refusing to divulge the complete count to make it appear that his state is doing better than others on the nursing home crisis and make a tragic situation less dire.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Certain touch-screen ballot-marking machines will remain in use in North Carolina this fall, a judge ruled in a case in which voters questioned the equipment’s accuracy and health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The state NAACP joined the four voters who demanded in April that the ExpressVote machines – already used in roughly 20 of the state’s 100 counties since last year– be barred from future elections. They wanted hand-marked paper ballots used instead. But Wake County Superior Court Judge Rebecca Holt rejected their request, saying no tabulation errors have been reported since the machines were first used last fall. There’s also no evidence their use will increase the likelihood of the virus’s spread, especially with cleaning guidelines issued by the State Board of Elections, Holt wrote. The names of the voters’ choices are printed on the ballot by the ExpressVote machine. They correspond with bar code data that’s also printed on the same ballot and tallied by a separate counting machine.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gerald VandeWalle, North Dakota’s longest-serving Supreme Court justice, is expected to be released from a hospital this week, where he has been recovering from COVID-19. VandeWalle, who has been on the court for 42 years, has been hospitalized at Sanford Health in Bismarck since Aug. 3. The 87-year-old justice said the virus has been much more debilitating than a typical cold or flu. VandeWalle told the Bismarck Tribune that he lost a lot of his strength while being confined to his room. He said he has been keeping up with his work on the court, reading emails and printed briefs and drafting opinions. But VandeWalle said he hasn’t been able to communicate as well with his law clerks and four fellow justices. VandeWalle said he isn’t sure how he contracted COVID-19. He had been working from the state Capitol amid the pandemic and has worn a mask and gloves while shopping.\n\nOhio\n\nMiddletown:A 9-year-old girl who fought brain inflammation, COVID-19 and body paralysis for nearly three months died Wednesday, according to the family's online fundraiser. Dorielis Reyes-Paula, a fourth-grade student, was diagnosed with COVID-19 on May 10 after her mother Doranny Escolastico noticed her walking strangely and dragging one foot. Doctors found brain inflammation during an MRI scan. She was sent home with medication and returned to the hospital on July 19 after suffering from severe headaches and having an epileptic seizure. She also lost her ability to walk. Dorielis continued to get sicker while doctors at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital tried to figure out what was causing the brain inflammation, speech impairment and paralysis. During her stay at the hospital, she endured several biopsies, MRIs, blood tests, and treatments. At one point, the doctors tested her blood to see if cancer was causing the illness. Escolastico said her oxygen levels constantly fluctuated. Escolastico, a single mother of four, started a GoFundMe fundraiser to help cover bills and purchase household items for her other children. To date, the account has raised more than $19,000. The goal was $15,000.\n\nOklahoma\n\nStillwater: Mayor Will Joyce has signed an emergency proclamation limiting the number of people in bars and requiring people to be seated in order to be served after videos emerged last weekend of packed bars in the city that’s home to Oklahoma State University. The proclamation signed Wednesday closed dance floors and requires tables to be 6 feet apart and all customers to wear masks except while eating or drinking. All employees – including musicians and disc jockeys – must also wear masks. Bars are limited to 50% of maximum capacity or the maximum number of customers possible under the distancing guidelines, whichever is fewer people. The order took effect immediately and is set to expire Nov. 30. Meanwhile, one of the headliners at a three-day music festival in Stillwater called “Weedstock” canceled his appearance after testing positive for the coronavirus. Musician Parker McCollum said on Twitter that he had no symptoms. Stillwater’s mayor has expressed concern about the event, which was set to start Thursday, but he said the venue, Tumbleweed, is outside the city limits. A Tumbleweed official did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment and a recorded message said the venue follows U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that include masking, social distancing and personal hygiene.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Democratic and Republican lawmakers lawmakers said county governments should directly receive tens of millions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief funds rather than having the state government funnel them to communities. The Legislature has debated how to spend $1.4 billion in COVID-19 money for months, but last week more than half of Oregon’s lawmakers signed a bipartisan letter – addressed to Gov. Kate Brown, Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem, and House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland – requesting a $200 million payout that they said had been promised to local governments. “By keeping a disproportionate amount of the funds, the state has created inadequate resource distribution with significant statewide inequities in the amount of aid provided to local governments to help their communities respond to the COVID-19 pandemic,” the letter, signed by 47 of 90 lawmakers, read. The bipartisan letter specified that according to United States Federal Treasury guidelines, 45% of the funds must be given to local government – about $625 million.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Republican-sponsored legislation that would give Pennsylvania school districts the final say over whether to hold sports and other activities during the pandemic cleared a House committee Thursday, a day before the governing body for interscholastic sports was to decide the fate of the fall season. With dozens of parents, students and coaches staging a “Let Our Kids Play in PA” rally on the steps of the Capitol in Harrisburg, the House Education Committee passed a bill that would give “exclusive authority” to public and private schools to make decisions on sports, and require them to develop safety protocols. Majority Republicans in the Legislature introduced the legislation after Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf issued a “strong recommendation” that all youth athletics be canceled until 2021 to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Wolf and his administration have repeatedly said the decision on whether to hold fall sports rests with the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association and individual school boards. Some districts and leagues have canceled fall sports, saying the risk of spreading the virus is too great, and others plan to play if they get the PIAA’s blessing. Several Pennsylvania high schools have already reported virus cases among athletes, prompting temporary shutdowns of sports programs. The bill passed the committee largely along party lines, though it attracted the support of two Democrats. The PIAA had been making plans to start the season as scheduled when the Wolf administration recommended Aug. 6 that scholastic and recreational youth sports be put off until January.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island’s slow recovery from the economic shutdown prompted by the coronavirus continued last month as the state’s unemployment rate dropped to 11.2% and the economy added nearly 14,000 jobs, the state Department of Labor and Training said Thursday. The July unemployment rate was down 1.4 percentage points from the revised June rate of 12.6%. The rate in July 2019 was 3.6%. The national unemployment rate was 10.2% in July, down from 11.1% the previous month. With the addition of 13,800 jobs in July, the state has recovered more than half of the 98,100 jobs lost in March and April when the economic shutdown meant to control the spread of the virus took effect, the department said. The accommodation and food services sector accounted for about 4,000 of the jobs added July as full service and limited-service restaurants steadily continued to add employment to their payrolls, the department said. The health care and social assistance sector, which includes dentist’s offices, added about 1,600 jobs in the month.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The University of South Carolina is joining a handful of universities nationwide to implement saliva tests for COVID-19, as part of its plan to reopen for classes this week. The tests will be free for students, faculty and staff on the school’s Columbia campus, the university said in a news release Tuesday. The tests, which require a spit sample, are an alternative to nasal swab tests and typically deliver results within 24 hours. The implementation of the tests comes amid the university’s attempt to hold classes, which are set to begin Thursday, in person. Other higher education institutions in the state, including Clemson University and the College of Charleston, are delaying the start of in-person teaching because of the pandemic. The University of South Carolina is now the only school in the state to receive state certification for the saliva tests, and one of a handful of universities nationwide approved for the tests. The school said West Columbia-based Nephron Pharmaceuticals donated 50,000 sample tubes and a robot for processing samples.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State health officials warned Thursday that a number of people who attended the 10-day Sturgis Motorcycle Rally this month, including some who came from out of state, have come down with COVID-19. Department of Health officials did not give an exact number of attendees who tested positive, but they said it was below 25. The rally, which ended Sunday, brought hundreds of thousands of people from far and wide to the city in the western part of the state. Even before it kicked off, some locals and officials expressed concern that COVID-19 could spread rapidly at the rally and that it would be hard to track attendees who got infected before heading home. The state’s health department has received reports from other states that people who traveled from the rally have tested positive, state epidemiologist Josh Clayton said. Contact tracers have been able to work with most people to determine who they were around and might have infected. But the health department has issued public warnings for two bars in the region because they were not able to track all of the people at the bars who may have been exposed to the coronavirus. Sturgis is planning to conduct mass testing of its residents next week to stem a possible outbreak of infections from the rally.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State authorities cannot pursue perjury charges against voters who seek mail ballots by concluding on their own that they, or someone in their care, have a health condition that increases their risk for COVID-19, an attorney for the state said in court Thursday. The comment by Deputy Attorney General Janet Kleinfelter came during questioning by Davidson County Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle as the state and the groups that sued over absentee ballot access continued to argue about transparency in the state’s vote-by-mail eligibility parameters. Earlier this month, Tennessee’s Supreme Court sided with the state by overturning a vote-by-mail option ordered by Lyle for all eligible voters. Afterward, the state removed mentions of COVID-19 from the absentee ballot application. The plaintiffs argued the form doesn’t follow the Supreme Court’s order, which requires instructions for people with underlying health conditions to vote by mail. The state counters that underlying conditions are mentioned on its website and it has sent out news releases to publicize the change, which requires voters to check existing boxes on the form for either illness or caretaking. The state did change its form in another way. A new section on the absentee application offers a reward of up to $1,000 for reporting voter fraud that leads to a conviction. Additionally, the absentee application continues to requires voters to attest to the information they provide under the penalty of perjury.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Texas on Thursday joined the growing list of states that will pursue President Donald Trump’s plan to offer a stripped-down boost in unemployment benefits to millions of Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced that Texas will apply for federal grants allowing the state to increase unemployment checks by $300. An Associated Press survey found that as of Thursday, at least 25 states have said they intend to pursue the money while two states, Mississippi and South Dakota, have said they won’t. Abbott previously was noncommittal about whether Texas would accept the money while expressing optimism that Trump and Congress would reach a deal on a broader new coronavirus relief plan. People out of work had been receiving an extra federally funded $600 a week, but the boost expired at the end of July. The president signed an executive order on Aug. 8 to extend the added weekly benefit, but cut it to $300 or $400 a week, depending on which plan governors choose. “The Lost Wage Assistance program will provide crucial financial support to Texans who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Abbott said in a statement.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah overhauled crisis guidelines Thursday that could have put people with disabilities at the back of the line if hospitals become overwhelmed during the coronavirus pandemic, adopting a new plan that federal officials said should serve as a national model for removing bias from life-or-death decisions. The changes settle a complaint from disability advocates and set a new standard for other states in removing bias from making potentially agonizing decisions, said Roger Severino, director of the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “When the going gets tough you don’t throw the most vulnerable overboard,” he said. Utah was one of several states facing complaints over state guidelines meant to help doctors and nurses making life-or-death decisions about who gets care if faced with a nightmare scenario like a shortage of ventilators. Advocates said the criteria devalued older people and those with disabilities, putting their lives at risk in worst-case scenarios. Complaints have also been filed in places like Kansas, Washington state and Oklahoma. Five states have settled so far.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Federal coronavirus relief funding is now available to Vermont farmers, sugar makers, meat processors and agricultural food and forest products businesses to help cover losses and costs related to the pandemic. A total of $8.5 million in grants is available and will be distributed to applicants on a first-come, first-served basis. The deadline to apply for the Agriculture and Working Lands Assistance Application is Oct. 1. “Farmers have not stopped working since the pandemic and are providing us with food but many of their markets were disrupted, creating economic hardship,” said Gov. Phil Scott in a written statement. “These grants are intended to alleviate losses and added expenses due to the impacts of COVID.” Applicants are advised to complete a W-9 form and collect records of losses and costs since March 1 that are related to the public health emergency. The Vermont Agency of Agriculture will hold webinars on the application process, with the first one happening at noon Friday.\n\nVirginia\n\nHopewell: A prison staff union representative said nearly a third of inmates at a federal correction facility in Virginia have tested positive for the coronavirus. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Wednesday that the outbreak is at the Federal Correctional Institution Petersburg complex. It includes a work camp, as well as a low- and medium-security prisons in Prince George County. Michael A. Castelle Sr., a union representative for the facility’s prison staff, shared an email with the newspaper from a prison official that said that 60 of 187 inmates are currently positive for the virus. The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment on specifics. Emery Nelson, a bureau spokesperson, told the newspaper that all of its institutions “have areas set aside for quarantine and isolation. Inmates are treated at the institution unless medical staff determine they require hospitalization.” Nelson added that all inmates are managed per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. The Bureau of Prisons has reported that 1,378 federal inmates and 592 staff have currently tested positive for the virus across the country.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Gov. Jay Inslee on Wednesday updated his coronavirus proclamation so that it requires agricultural employers to test their workforce broadly when health officials identify an outbreak that passes certain thresholds. Since the governor first issued his proclamation on May 28, the total number of COVID-19 cases in Washington has increased from 21,138 to 67,721, an average of more than 500 new cases per day. Many of the new cases are appearing at farms and food-packing facilities, where employees often work, travel, and live together in close contact. “From the data, we know that people of color have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic, and while we have much work to do to address that, this is one step in the right direction,” Inslee said. In addition, Washington Secretary of Health John Wiesman ordered Gebbers Farms, located in Okanogan County, to test all its employees in coming weeks. Gebbers Farms has suffered a significant outbreak of COVID-19, including the deaths of three employees. “We call upon all agricultural employers to join us in proactively safeguarding against workplace outbreaks,” Inslee said. “When employers are unable to do so on their own, local health jurisdictions and state Department of Health will be ready to intervene.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A child has a rare, serious immune system condition associated with the coronavirus, health officials said Thursday. The Department of Health and Human Resources said the child was the first in the state to be diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at least 570 children in the U.S. have contracted the condition and 10 have died. “This development is an unfortunate reminder that COVID-19 does not just affect the elderly,” Dr. Ayne Amjad, the state’s health officer, said in a news release. “We must continue to be diligent in our efforts to protect each other by social distancing, wearing masks in public and following all recommendations of local, state and federal health experts.” Forty other states had reported similar cases from mid-February to mid-July. The CDC said a study found many of the patients with the condition had severe complications, including inflammation of the heart, shock and kidney damage. Nearly two-thirds of the cases overall were admitted to intensive care units, and the average ICU stay was five days.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay:Fifty-seven people have tested positive for the coronavirus at the Green Bay Correctional Institution, according to state officials. All of the prisoners who have tested positive are being isolated and anyone who was exposed is being quarantined, the Wisconsin Department of Corrections said. All inmates and staff at the prison are in the process of being tested for COVID-19 with the help of the National Guard. “As we’ve all learned about COVID-19, due to asymptomatic cases, mass testing is the only way for us to identify all persons in our care infected and isolate them from the uninfected,” DOC Secretary Kevin Carr said in a statement. Three staff members are among the 57 positive cases, the State Journal reported. Corrections officials completed a mass testing of inmates and staff at each of its 37 prison facilities at the end of July and just nine people tested positive. Green Bay prison staff have been required to wear masks, except while eating or drinking or while alone in an office, DOC said. Inmates are required to wear masks in common spaces. The only other major outbreak DOC has reported in a Wisconsin prison was at the Waupun Correctional Institution in May and early June, when there were 228 positive COVID-19 cases. among prisoners. All since recovered from the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The total number of coronavirus cases in Wyoming grew by 67 on Wednesday, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 59, the Casper Star-Tribune reported, according to the Wyoming Department of Health’s daily update. The newly confirmed cases come from Albany, Campbell, Carbon (eight), Converse, Crook (two), Fremont (14), Goshen, Laramie (six), Natrona (two), Park (four), Sheridan (nine), Sublette, Sweetwater (six), Teton, Uinta and Washakie (two) counties. The 59 confirmed cases are tied for the fourth-most announced in a single day in Wyoming, and the 67 total cases are the third-most.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/delaware/2017/11/27/anti-discrimination-proposal-draws-protest-ire-sussex-parents/897514001/", "title": "Anti-discrimination proposal draws protest, ire from Sussex parents", "text": "Parents protested a proposed regulation that would allow Delaware students to pick their own name, race or gender at the Indian River Board of Education meeting on Nov. 27.\n\nThose people in opposition wore red at the meeting to make their point known.\n\n\"It's my right to raise my child the way I see fit,\" said Michelle McDowell, a parent of Indian River school district children, in a phone call before the meeting. \"Not the school's, not the government's.

Of the nine people that spoke during public comment, not one spoke in favor of the regulation.\n\n\"The wording of Regulation 225 makes a protection of a minority group affected at the expense of a majority group,\" said Kay Fox, a mother of three students in the district. \"It strips away the fundamental rights of parents.\"\n\nFox added she intends to join a lawsuit against the state of Delaware if the proposed regulation is passed with its current wording, citing violations of the First Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment and Title IX, among other federal laws.\n\nBut supporters of the measure believe it is a step in the right direction.\n\nThe regulation is important because it will help Delaware be on \"the right side of history\" for equal protection regardless of gender and sexual orientation, said Sal Seeley of CAMP Rehoboth, in a phone call.\n\n\"So many trans students have been discriminated against, either having to use locker rooms they don’t belong in or being misgendered by others, being forced to walk 15, 20 minutes to go use a separate bathroom,\" he said.\n\nFourteen states have laws or regulations protecting LGBTQ students from discrimination at school said officials from GLSEN.

The Senate previously approved changes to a proposed ban on bump stocks and trigger cranks that sent the measure back to the House, where it has yet to be called up for a vote.\n\nDemocrats hold a one-vote advantage in the Senate, but that majority tends to fracture on gun control legislation, meaning Republicans votes may be needed to get a bill passed.\n\nHouse Bill 330 would raise the legal age at which someone can purchase a rifle and ammunition in Delaware from 18 to 21 – matching a federal restriction on handgun purchases from licensed firearms dealers.\n\nThe legislation was introduced just weeks after a 19-year-old gunman used a legally purchased, semi-automatic rifle to kill 17 people at a Florida high school on Feb. 14.\n\nThe bill initially sought to raise the legal age for the purchase of all long guns but was amended in the House to exclude shotguns and muzzleloaders – firearms typically associated with hunting – from the higher age restriction.\n\nThe measure also includes a carve-out for active members of the armed forces, qualified law enforcement officers and someone with a concealed carry permit. And it would allow parents or guardians to essentially gift rifles to their children.\n\nSome of the amendments introduced Thursday would expand those exceptions by allowing people between the ages of 18 and 21 to purchase a rifle if they pass a hunting course, are honorably discharged from the military or seeking a protection from abuse order from the courts. Others seek to exclude .22-caliber rifles and \"pistol caliber\" carbines.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Gary Simpson, R-Milford, introduced the proposed allowance for those who pass a hunting course.\n\n\"I think there is a good chance the bill will pass with that amendment,\" he said. \"I don't think it has a chance at all without it.\"\n\nSen. Robert Marshall, D-Wilmington, said he would support the change, even stating that hunting courses should be required in high schools. That put the Democrat's majority at risk and may have helped to trigger the decision to postpone a vote.\n\nSchwarzkopf said he is opposed to the Simpson's offer.\n\n\"What we're trying to do is keep kids 18 to 21 from going into a gun store to buy these weapons that are being used in these shootings,\" he said. \"Now you want to say they buy an AR-15 because they passed a hunter safety course?\"\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/01/guns-marijuana-delaware-bills-roundup/641304002/", "title": "From guns to weed: Delaware Legislature to debate a litany of bills ...", "text": "Gun control and school safety bills.\n\nTwo proposed amendments to the state constitution.\n\nA complete overhaul of Delaware's criminal code. A slew of election reforms. A minimum wage hike and the creation of a legal marijuana industry.\n\nThose are just a few of the hotly contested measures lawmakers are expected to tackle in the remaining weeks of the 149th General Assembly.\n\nBut with only 13 work days left, it is unlikely every bill still on the table will get a final vote.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThat means the race is on to see who can get their measure through both the Senate and the House before the final gavel strikes during the early morning hours on July 1.\n\n\"It always happens around this time and this year is no different,\" said House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth Beach. \"And, yes, there is always a chance some of these bills might not get a vote.\"\n\nThe good news is Delaware has a $430 million surplus this year. That means lawmakers are less likely to use what little time is left battling over spending cuts and tax hikes — the same brinksmanship that pushed last year's legislative calendar past June 30 for the first time in decades.\n\nThe expectation is that will open up room for debate over many of the bills left on the agenda.\n\nMuch of that legislation is currently awaiting action in the Senate, where Democrats' one-vote majority has contributed to what some view as a legislative bottleneck.\n\nSenate President David McBride, D-Hawk's Nest, does not see it that way.\n\n\"I think we're working right along,\" he said. \"I don't see why we can't get most of these bills done. The agendas might get longer and ladies and gentlemen might have to stay longer. But in my mind, this is not unusual.\"\n\nThe stakes are high for lawmakers to clear the final hurdle. Any bills that do not reach Gov. John Carney before the final gavel strikes will need to start the legislative process all over again next year.\n\nRegardless of whether they pass or fail, several of the bills will end up driving public debate as the end of the legislative cycle gives way to the start of election season and finger-pointing over what lawmakers were able to accomplish.\n\nA fierce gun battle\n\nThe dominant issue in the Delaware General Assembly this year unquestionably has been gun control.\n\nIn the wake of mass shootings at a Las Vegas concert and a Parkland, Florida high school, Democrats rolled out a string of proposals aimed at limiting the public's access to firearms, including an assault weapons ban sought by Gov. John Carney but intensely opposed by Second Amendment advocates.\n\nRepublicans have pushed measures that would fund or require more school security enhancements.\n\nSo far, neither side has gained much ground.\n\nLegislation that would allow police to temporarily seize firearms from someone a mental health professional deems a danger to themselves and others won bipartisan support and was signed into law by the governor. A bill strengthening a rarely imposed sentence for straw purchases also cleared the General Assembly.\n\nBut the proposed assault weapons ban has languished in committee for months. It is unclear at this point whether it has the votes to reach the Senate floor. Even if it does, wavering by a few key senators means it might never reach the House.\n\nThe Senate also has yet to take final action on measures that would raise the legal age at which someone can buy a rifle, outlaw devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire at a faster rate, and increase the penalties for failing to adequately store firearms.\n\nA bill to ban high-capacity magazines and another that would allow family members and police to recommend someone's firearms be seized temporarily are waiting to clear both chambers of the Legislature.\n\nSchool safety bills have not fared any better.\n\nLegislation that would require all 189 public and charter schools in Delaware to be outfitted with panic buttons has yet to be called up for a vote. Neither has a bill that would provide $50,000 grants to school districts for safety and security enhancements.\n\nSen. David Lawson, R-Marydel, last week unveiled a new proposal that would set aside $65 million of this year's surplus for school safety projects — funding that only could be unlocked by schools that agree to hire and arm at least two security guards.\n\nThat measure likely will be dead on arrival due to its massive cost and number of logistical issues that several lawmakers say it fails to consider.\n\nDELAWARE GENERAL ASSEMBLY\n\nDelaware lawmakers eye bonuses for state workers, other spending\n\nBudget deficit, then surplus: Delaware should consider plan to stop the crises\n\nA bill introduced by Rep. Earl Jaques, D-Glasgow, might have a better chance of success. It would require all future school construction and major renovation projects to include security features such as bulletproof glass, secured vestibules and lockable classroom doors. That legislation has passed the House and is awaiting a final vote in the Senate.\n\nBig changes, big votes\n\nThere are at least three proposals the General Assembly could consider in June that would have major impacts on state government.\n\nTwo would amend the state constitution while the third would make sweeping changes to Delaware's criminal code.\n\nEach would require a supermajority to pass. And one has yet to be introduced.\n\nA panel of economists and elected officials formally unveiled a long-awaited proposal this month that seeks to rein in Delaware's sometimes boom-and-bust budget process by fundamentally changing how the state allocates its surpluses.\n\nTheir \"budget smoothing\" plan would limit annual spending growth to a floating cap based on certain economic factors. Any revenue beyond that would be split evenly between funding one-time projects and a reserve account that could be tapped to fill future budget gaps.\n\nThe panel also recommended a series of tax reforms aimed at moving Delaware toward more stable revenue sources, largely by eliminating itemized deductions and consolidating myriad senior citizen tax discounts into a single, means-tested tax break.\n\nGov. John Carney and Republican state Treasurer Ken Simpler say the plan would help fix the state's structural deficit issues.\n\nBut getting there would involve amending the state constitution — a process that requires a two-thirds vote in consecutive General Assemblies. A bill to get that process rolling has yet to be introduced, although that could happen soon.\n\nMeanwhile, a proposed equal rights amendment that cleared the House in March is currently on life support in the Senate, where the measure failed, 11-9, earlier this month. The bill seeks to make men and women equal in the eyes of the law.\n\nA procedural ploy by Sen. Margaret Rose Henry, D-Wilmington, means the bill could be called up for a revote. Legislators say they are working behind the scenes to address Republican concerns that the measure could have unintended consequences ranging from co-ed prisons to mandatory state funding for abortions.\n\nIt's unclear whether those efforts will convince three Republicans to switch their votes to provide the supermajority needed for passage.\n\nSeveral efforts to pass ERA have failed since the 1980s. Supporters and opponents will likely find out next week if 2018 marks the latest defeat.\n\nA multiyear effort to revise the rules that define crime and measure punishment in Delaware also is facing a steep climb.\n\nProponents of the reform effort argue the state's criminal code has become a bloated mess rife with redundancy, contradiction and inconsistency. They want to streamline the rules that cover more than 200 felonies and misdemeanors into a document that is clear and accessible to police, the courts and the public.\n\nRetiring Attorney General Matt Denn has been steadfast in his opposition, however.\n\nSenate Minority Whip Greg Lavelle, a key supporter of the effort, recently called for the General Assembly to hit the brakes on two bills — totaling 282 pages — that would enact the new version and amend other sections of the code. Each would require a two-thirds vote.\n\n\"I strongly believe that the Delaware General Assembly should wait to allow the Attorney General's office to fully review and comment on these final bills before we act on them,\" the Sharpley Republican said. \"Rushing this bill through without careful scrutiny with just four weeks of session remaining would be a significant mistake.\"\n\nMoney bills left to tally\n\nJust because the Joint Finance Committee is hashing out a tentative spending plan for next year does not mean the rest of the General Assembly will not get a say in how that money is spent.\n\nWhile the budget-writing panel is penciling in some added expenses, several of the programs that proposal would fund have yet to be approved by the full Legislature.\n\nThat includes a bill to provide $20 million a year in tax relief to Delaware's three casinos. The deal cleared the Senate in April and awaits final action in the House where Schwartzkopf is in no hurry to bring it up for a vote.\n\nThe speaker has been outspoken in his opposition to that tax cut, saying he would prefer something far less costly to the state.\n\nHe also noted that a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that will bring full sports betting to Delaware could cause lawmakers to hesitate when it comes to granting a casino tax break.\n\n\"That's a game changer for that bill,\" he said. \"I think there are some folks [in the Senate] who would like to have their vote back now that sports betting is legal.\"\n\nSchwartzkopf, meanwhile, is championing a tax cut for first-time homebuyers that would excuse them from their half of a 1-percentage point increase in the state's real estate transfer tax that was imposed last year when the Legislature was facing a $400 million shortfall.\n\nThat measure was passed by the House and is awaiting action in the Senate.\n\nOther tax bills on the table include competing legislation — one sponsored by Republicans and the other by Democrats — that both seek to impose a tax on prescription opioids. Proponents say the levy would force drug manufacturers and distributors to pay for addiction treatment in Delaware.\n\nMore than a dozen states have introduced similar bills but only New York has approved such a measure, leaving many unanswered questions that may not be settled in time for the local bill to pass this year.\n\nLawmakers are expected to give New Castle County and possibly a few municipalities the authority to impose a local lodging tax for the first time — measures vehemently opposed by the state hotel industry.\n\nThen there are a few spending bills that would provide new benefits for state employees, who are also slated to get raises and bonuses next year.\n\nCarney opened this year's legislative calendar by offering his full support to a bill introduced by Rep. Debra Heffernan, D-Bellefonte, that would grant workers employed by the state for at least a year 12 weeks of paid parental leave.\n\nThat bill has yet to be called up for a vote in the House. A fiscal note that put the price tag at $2.5 million a year is no longer attached to the legislation. And Rep. Ruth Briggs King, R-Georgetown, recently introduced an amendment that would cut the length of paid leave down to six weeks.\n\nCarney also championed a bill that would create a student-loan forgiveness program for educators at high-needs schools and those who teach high-demand subject areas. The 250 educators accepted into the program would be eligible for loan repayments of up to $10,000 over five years.\n\nThat legislation has remained in the House Appropriations Committee for over a month.\n\nWaiting in the wings\n\nLegislation still pending before the General Assembly includes bills that could impact everything from the affordability of conception to the final days of life.\n\nState Sen. Bryan Townsend, D-Newark, has introduced several health care-related bills this year, including a measure that would require Delaware insurers to cover a range of fertility care services, such as in vitro fertilization.\n\nSupporters of the bill say the out-of-pocket costs for those treatments can be crippling, while opponents warn that requiring insurers to cover the procedures could raise premium costs for all residents. The measure unanimously passed the Senate in March and now awaits action in the House.\n\nRep. Paul Baumbach, D-Newark, has a highly-controversial bill focused on the other end of Delaware residents' life spectrum that would allow doctors to help terminally ill people end their own lives. Vehemently opposed by anti-abortion groups, the measure was introduced and moved out of committee in 2017 but has yet to come up for a vote on the House floor.\n\nSen. Robert Marshall, D-Wilmington, also is hoping to get a vote on his latest effort to increase the minimum wage in Delaware. A bill that would hike the state's base wage $2 over four years to $10.25 an hour in 2021 is awaiting a vote in the Senate, where similar legislation failed by a single vote in March.\n\nSeveral Democrats, meanwhile, are hoping to advance a series of election reform bills in the final days of the legislative calendar.\n\nThey include a bill that would allow voters to register on Election Day, cast ballots in person up to 10 days before the election, open polls for school board elections two hours earlier and move statewide primaries to coincide with the presidential primary in April.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Helene Keeley and Sen. Margaret Rose Henry, both Wilmington Democrats, are still holding out hope of advancing legislation that would make Delaware the ninth state to legalize recreational marijuana.\n\nLegislation they introduced last year would allow people 21 and older to purchase up to an ounce of marijuana from dozens of stores authorized to sell the drug. The legislation also would authorize the creation of an entire marijuana industry, including cultivation facilities, testing companies and manufacturing businesses.\n\nThat bill failed to come up for a final vote in 2017, leading to the creation of a task force that released a lengthy report under rather inauspicious circumstances in March.\n\nSince then, Keeley has been using the panel's recommendations to craft a new version of the bill that she plans to introduce next week.\n\nBut it also will require a two-thirds majority in both chambers to reach the governor's desk. Carney also has said repeatedly that he does not support the legislation at this time.\n\nDozens of other bills also are waiting in the wings with just a few weeks left in the legislative session, leaving many to wonder how much the General Assembly will be able to act on.\n\n\"We always get a lot of requests to move bills after the May break so I would say the volume is pretty normal right now,\" Schwartzkopf said. \"But my hope is we might be able to finish up not too long after midnight on June 30.\"\n\nMcBride agreed the list of pending legislation is long but manageable.\n\n\"It's always a dance,\" he said of the final month. \"But one thing is certain and that's that there will be a soft landing sometime in the early morning of July 1. My job now is to get us there.\"\n\nWEEKEND MUST-READS\n\nRegulation 225 would no longer let students \"self-identify\" without parents' permission\n\nHospital settles lawsuit claiming doctor removed wrong part of thyroid\n\nBromberg's Big Noise moves opening night to Constitution Yards Beer Garden\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/15/corporate-tax-hike/400601001/", "title": "Corporate tax hike, estate tax repeal pass General Assembly", "text": "The Delaware Senate gave final approval Thursday to bills that would raise taxes on major corporations and repeal the estate tax.\n\nThat means the General Assembly is officially about halfway done with fixing its $400 million budget problem. But there's no sign Democrats and Republicans are close to an agreement on how to repair the rest.\n\nBACKGROUND:A zoomed-out look at the budget debate\n\nDETAILS:An explanation of how the corporate franchise tax increase will work\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe first bill would create a new maximum rate of $250,000 for the corporate franchise tax, which companies pay to incorporate in Delaware. That rate would apply to about 1,900 companies that have more than $750 million in either revenue or assets and less than $250 million in revenue or assets.\n\nFor example: a web company that has $1 billion in revenue but only $150 million in assets would not in the new bracket. A real estate firm that has $3 billion worth of assets but only $200 in revenue would not qualify either.\n\nA bank with $800 million in revenue and $300 million in assets, however, would pay the new tax.\n\nCompanies in the second-highest bracket would also see their tax bill increase. And the incorporation fees that all businesses pay would be raised — state officials say the increases account for inflation.\n\nThe corporate taxes were proposed by Gov. John Carney. His administration said the increases would only apply to Fortune 500-sized companies, and said they were confident the increase would not stop businesses from incorporating in Delaware.\n\n\"We have not done this kind of increase for this particular set of companies, which are the largest companies in America or the world, in eight years,\" Secretary of State Jeff Bullock told the Senate.\n\nThe increased corporate taxes are expected to bring in about $116 million. The bill passed on a 16-4 vote.\n\nIn exchange for the Republican votes necessary to pass the corporate franchise tax, Democrats agreed to allow the elimination of the estate tax, which is paid when someone dies and leaves a large estate.\n\nDelaware taxes estates worth more than $5.49 million — or $11 million for couples — at a rate of up to 16 percent, depending on the size of the estate.\n\nRepealing the estate tax won't immediately hurt the state's budget because it won't take effect until next calendar year. The amount the tax brings in varies widely, since it depends on wealthy residents dying. It reaped $9 million in the last fiscal year but netted $1.3 million in 2014.\n\nDebate over the estate tax was fiercer than debate over the corporate taxes.\n\nRepublicans have long argued the estate tax was doing the state more harm than good because it was driving out wealthy taxpayers, causing the state to lose more in other taxes than it gained in estate taxes.\n\n\"I just think the whole idea of taxing someone when they die just because, 'Oh there's a lot of money there let's go get it, that bothers me,\" said Sen. Colin Bonini, R-Dover South. \"The narrative that these are selfish people, that they're rich people are giving money to their rich kids, I have a problem with that.\"\n\nSen. Bryan Townsend, D-Newark, said he found repealing the estate tax \"shocking and morally troubling,\" given \"rampant and historic\" inequality in Delaware.\n\n\"This is a tax designed to promote the kind of economic mobility that the American dream is all about,\" Townsend said.\n\nHe noted that the General Assembly is considering cuts to schools, health programs and other services he considers vital in a civilized society, so he said it was wrong to be reducing revenues.\n\nBecause it affected taxes, the estate tax bill needed 13 votes to pass. Three Democrats crossed the aisle and voted \"yes,\" giving Republicans exactly as many votes as they needed.\n\nSenate President Pro Tempore David McBride and Minority Whip Nicole Poore voted against the bill. That irked some Republicans, who said leadership traditionally votes for bills that are part of a bi-partisan deal.\n\nGov. John Carney's administration says he will sign both bills.\n\nThe all-consuming question in Legislative Hall now is: where will we come up with the rest of the money?\n\nThe budget-writing Joint Finance Committee has voted on $80 million in spending cuts. So, officially, lawmakers have found roughly $200 million, about half the $400 million they will eventually need.\n\nDemocrats are pushing for further tax increases, most notably increases to the personal income tax. But Republicans say they want consideration of several ideas for systemically trimming state government before they will consider voting for an income tax increase.\n\nState law requires the General Assembly to pass a balanced budget by June 30.\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428 or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/25/delaware-lawmakers-just-approved-state-budget-heres-whats/7773523002/", "title": "Delaware lawmakers just approved the state budget.

Brian Bushweller, D-Dover. \"They've got a good future.\"\n\nApproved 35-4, the latest draft of the bill would lower the casinos' tax burden $16.8 million by reducing the tax rate on slot revenue by 1 percentage point and cutting the tax rate on table games nearly in half.\n\nBushweller said that should provide significant breathing room for the casinos, which collectively employ close to 3,000 people — mostly in Kent County where Dover Downs Hotel and Casino and Harrington Casino and Raceway operate.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThose businesses have long argued Delaware's tax structure is threatening their ability to stay afloat in the face of growing competition from surrounding states.\n\nDelaware has hiked the tax rate on casinos seven times since it legalized slot machines in the mid-1990s.\n\nMost notably, the Legislature upped the rate on slot machine revenue to 43 percent in 2009 to help close a state budget gap during the height of the recession. That's nearly double the rate when the industry began.\n\nThe state also collects nearly 30 percent of all gross revenue generated by table games and another $3 million a year in table game licensing fees.\n\n\"If you look at what the industry has generated for the state over the years, it's close to $4 billion,\" said Denis McGlynn, the CEO of Dover Downs.\n\n\"We are in a partnership with the state, along with the horse racing industry, and I think this legislation shows lawmakers are grasping that we need all three partners to be healthy,\" he said. \"Our financial situation last year shows that's not the case.\"\n\nDover Downs, the only publicly traded casino in Delaware, reported losses of more than $1 million in 2017 — a deficit that came after the casino paid $75 million to the state and the Delaware Standardbred Owners Association.\n\n\"We've overtaxed this industry,\" said Rep. William Carson, D-Smyrna. \"We needed it at the time but we got it back to where it belongs.\"\n\nBushweller, who will retire at the end of 2018, has been working for years to secure a tax break for the casinos. He managed to convince lawmakers in 2014 to approve a nearly $10 million deal to help the casinos cover their payments to slot machine vendors.\n\nA year later, a state panel recommended the Legislature pass a tax package valued at $46 million — a proposal that never came to fruition. Dover Downs has since recorded an annual operating loss twice and eliminated 72 positions.\n\nA reversal in the state's own financial fortunes likely was the main reason this bill is headed for passage. Delaware went from closing a nearly $400 million budget gap last year to having $380 million in extra cash this year.\n\nReaching a tax cut for the casinos did not go smoothly, however.\n\nGov. John Carney's administration negotiated a tax break proposal valued at $20 million only after Sen. Harris McDowell, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, vowed to move Bushweller's original bill.\n\nThe Carney-backed deal cleared the Senate in April, 17-3. But it stalled in the House after encountering resistance from Speaker Pete Schwartkopf, D-Rehoboth Beach, who sought to chop the cut in half.\n\nHis opposition to Carney's plan seemed to be reinforced by the addition of full sports betting at casinos earlier this month, thanks to a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision. The casinos have argued sports betting will not be a major moneymaker.\n\nSchwartzkopf finally blinked Thursday by presenting a compromise that reduced the tax cut by $3.6 million next year and $3.2 million thereafter. That allowed the bill to reach the House floor on the second-to-last day of the legislative session.\n\n\"We were running out of time,\" Schwartzkopf said, noting the full tax cut proposal likely had enough votes to pass.\n\n\"They got the money they think they need to make their businesses solvent, keep all their employees and reinvest back into their businesses,\" he said. \"And we got $3.6 million. You can provide a lot of services for $3.6 million.\"\n\nThe budget-writing Joint Finance Committee will likely reallocate that savings on Saturday, while the Senate is expected vote on the compromise bill before it recesses sometime in the early-morning hours on Sunday.\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.\n\nREADING ON A BUDGET\n\nGov.

John Carney proposed the corporate tax increase in March, when he released his recommended budget for next fiscal year.\n\nThe plan would create a new, higher corporate franchise tax bracket for the largest companies. According to the Department of State, about 1,900 companies would pay the new top rate, $250,000 annually. The current maximum is $180,000 a year.\n\nThat bracket would apply to companies that have $750 million in either revenue or assets, but it would not apply to companies that have less than $250 million in one of those metrics.\n\nSo, for example, an internet-based company that makes $1 billion a year in sales but does not have assets worth $250 million would not pay the new top rate. But a company that has $755 million in revenue and $260 million in assets would pay the new rate.\n\n\"This is only the biggest of the biggest of the Fortune 500 companies we're talking about,\" said Schwartzkopf, who is lead sponsor of the bill.\n\nIf the legislation passes, the second highest rate also would see an upward move, and companies that fall into that category would pay $200,000 annually.\n\nCompanies would also pay more in late fees and to file records with the state. State officials say those increases account for inflation.\n\nThe corporate franchise is a central pillar of Delaware's economy — the state is famously home to more corporations than people. Corporate taxes and fees bring in more than a third of the revenue for state government's general fund budget.\n\nSecretary of State Jeffrey Bullock does not believe the tax and fee increases will scare away businesses. The fundamental reasons Delaware is appealing as a place to incorporate is its consistent and world-renowned Chancery Court and a nimble state government that quickly reacts to changes in the business world, he argues.\n\n\"The franchise is as strong as it's ever been in Delaware,\" Bullock said, noting that the number of Fortune 500 companies incorporating here has reached record levels. \"Do we want to be doing this every year? No. But as long as we're judicious about it and we don't go too far too fast, it will not cause us to lose business.\"\n\nDelaware State Chamber of Commerce president Rich Heffron says nobody likes raising taxes, but he agrees this should not cause major problems. The corporate franchise was last increased eight years ago, he points out.\n\n\"You have to be worried about the long-term trend, and you can't do this too often,\" he said. \"But they seem to be handling this responsibly.\"\n\nBecause the legislation raises taxes, it requires a three-fifths vote in each chamber. Schwartzkopf believes he has the votes, and the bi-partisan sponsor list suggests he is right.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Gary Simpson, R-Milford, is a co-sponsor, and he thinks the bill will pass.\n\n\"I'm certainly not thrilled about it,\" said Simpson, the Senate's ranking Republican. \"But if we're going to raise any tax, we might as well raise one that would not be harmful to our corporate image but would benefit the state.\"\n\nSchwartzkopf hopes the legislation will pass the House by the end of this week. Legislators go on a two-week break next week, so the Senate would vote on it June 6-8, at the earliest.\n\nIf they follow Carney's lead, legislators would also raise the personal income tax and taxes on tobacco. But those ideas — particularly the income tax — have proven more controversial.\n\nBACKGROUND:More on the debate over the income tax\n\nCarney proposed increasing rates for every income tax bracket and eliminating itemized deductions. But some of his fellow Democrats want to create new, higher tax brackets, which would mean the wealthiest Delawareans would see bigger tax hikes.\n\nSchwartzkopf would vote for creating new brackets. But he says there aren't enough votes to do so. Republicans and some Democrats dislike the idea of a higher top income tax rate, fearing it will scare away businesses.\n\nThe other question is whether the General Assembly will balance the budget with an equal balance of spending cuts and revenue increases. But some legislators think the state can find more places to shrink government before they turn to tax increases.\n\n\"The majority of our time has been talking about the cuts,\" Schwartzkopf said. \"When we get to a place where we're happy with the amount of cuts, that's when the conversation will steer to revenue.\"\n\nStill, Schwartzkopf says a deal will likely need to be struck on further taxes at some point.\n\n\"I don't think people want to do this with all cuts. That would have a major impact in our state,\" he said. \"We're still working on it. We're still talking. We'll get there.\"\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428 or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/08/prevailing-wage-republican/380521001/", "title": "Republicans seek prevailing wage change in budget deal", "text": "Republicans want to give counties, cities and schools a three-year exemption on the mandatory \"prevailing wage\" for government construction projects.\n\nRepublicans are trying the idea, which they have long pushed for, to the high-stakes negotiations over how to solve Delaware's $400 million budget problem. They argue it is a fair request to systemically reduce government spending at a time when Democrats are asking them to allow more tax increases.\n\nBACKGROUND:An in-depth look at the budget showdown.\n\nRELATED:Abortion is another white-hot debate in the General Assembly\n\n\"[Prevailing wage] is an outdated idea, and we can't afford to have it,\" said Sen. Greg Lavelle, R-Sharpley, and the Senate minority whip. \"The governor says we need structural reforms, well, we're not going to get there just by raising taxes.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nSome Democrats, however, accuse the Republicans of holding up the budget process in hopes of passing a policy for which they otherwise couldn't get the votes. They say the Republicans' proposal would lead to thousands of workers taking steep pay cuts.\n\n\"Our job should be to protect workers, not destroy the wages of workers,\" said Rep. Michael Mulrooney, D-Newark, and a longtime union official. \"Why you would want to balance the budget on the backs of workers...it just befuddles me that they want to do that.\"\n\nMulrooney said the prevailing wage also protects small construction firms by preventing larger companies from undercutting them on price.\n\nPrevailing wage is a minimum level of pay for workers on government contracts that is established by the Department of Labor. Different jobs have different prevailing wages, which are set by a survey of employers in similar fields.\n\nThe prevailing wage for a bricklayer in New Castle County, for example, is $51.99 an hour, while the wage for a truck driver in Kent County is $27.44. A laborer in Sussex County makes $43.60, while a New Castle County painter makes $46.72.\n\nDebate over the prevailing wage would likely be intense in any circumstance, but it takes on huge significance now that it is tied into budget discussions.\n\nDelaware faces a roughly $400 million budget deficit, but the General Assembly has only come to an agreement on about half the cuts and taxes necessary to fix that. Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over further tax increases, particularly the personal income tax.\n\nThe clock is ticking – state law requires them to pass a balanced budget by June 30.\n\nRepublicans have long argued the survey system is broken and that the prevailing wage is significantly higher than similar private sector workers. They point out that construction workers on government projects often earn noticeably more than teachers or nurses.\n\n\"Let's put it this way, you or I certainly wouldn't pay this rate to do work on our home,\" said Rep. Danny Short, R-Seaford, the House minority leader. \"No private business would build at this rate.\"\n\nRepublicans point to a recent Sussex County project to build a new EMS station. County officials estimate the project cost 24 percent more because of the prevailing wage than it would have at market rates.\n\nThe GOP is offering two bills, sponsored by the party's leadership in each chamber, that would create a three-year exemption to the prevailing wage. One would be for county and municipal governments and the other would cover school districts.\n\nThe governments and districts would be required to prepare cost comparison reports that show how much they saved without having to follow prevailing wage.\n\n\"We are not demanding that we eliminate it, we just want to get these comparison reports and get some hard numbers,\" Short said. \"Maybe it turns out that it wouldn't really save us that much, although I'm pretty sure that's not the case.\"\n\nHe added: \"We're trying to be congenial here. We get that this is a real struggle for [Democrats].\"\n\nThe bill would be controversial on its own, but its significance if ratcheted up because Republicans are using it as a bargaining chip in budget negotiations.\n\nDelaware has a roughly $400 million budget shortfall. Gov. John Carney has proposed fixing the problem with about $200 million in new taxes and $200 million in spending cuts, what he calls a \"balanced approach.\"\n\nBut legislators have only agreed to about $119 million in tax increases. Republicans allowed an increase in the corporate franchise tax because Democrats allowed the estate tax to be repealed.\n\nThe two parties have not been able to reach an agreement on further tax increases, however. Carney and Democratic leaders say an increase in the personal income tax is necessary for long-term budget stability, but Republicans have so far resisted.\n\nSince tax increases require a three-fifths vote, Democrats need a handful of Republican votes.\n\nGOP leaders have been saying for awhile that they wanted commitments to reducing spending if they were to support further tax increases but have previously been mum on specifics. The prevailing wage proposal appears to be part of their request.\n\nSpeaker of the House Pete Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth, does not think the prevailing wage should be part of the budget negotiations.\n\n\"Prevailing wage does not affect our budget one penny,\" Schwartzkopf said.\n\nSchwartzkopf points out that construction projects fall in the \"bond bill\" that funds capital projects or the Transportation Trust Fund. Both of those are separate from the General Fund, which is where the $400 million problem lies.\n\nBut Republicans point out that legislators often add general fund cash to the bond bill in, and could do less of that if the bond bill saved money on labor costs.\n\nAnd they say the state would save local governments and school districts money at a time when many in state government think they should be picking up greater responsibility for the state's costs.\n\nGov. John Carney opposes changes to the prevailing wage as part of a budget solution.\n\n\"Our budget negotiations need to focus on achieving a combination of new revenues and spending restraint that's necessary not only for this year but in the long term,\" spokesman Jonathan Starkey said.\n\nSen. Gary Simpson, R-Milford, said he thinks Carney needs to press harder on his own party to make responsible cuts. After all, they've agreed to less than half of the $200 million in cuts Carney proposed.\n\n\"I think the governor needs to get involved,\" Simpson said. \"I'm tired of meeting with a recalcitrant Democratic leadership that just keeps asking us to pass tax increases.\"\n\nRepublicans have questioned Democrats' commitment to responsibly cutting spending after Democratic leaders told the Joint Finance Committee to halt its work even though it had only voted to cut about $80 million\n\nSchwartzkopf says leaders have agreed to other cuts that don't require votes, like the decision to give zero general fund cash to the bond bill. He estimates Democrats have about $170 million in cuts ready to make.\n\nHe said the budget cannot pass unless more new revenue is added because Democrats — including possibly himself — would vote against a budget with almost $300 million in budget cuts.\n\n\"I'm still optimistic,\" Schwartzkopf said. \"But we're running out of time.\"\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428 or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/21/tax-increases-opposition/417792001/", "title": "Proposed Delaware income, alcohol tax increases draw criticism", "text": "Critics of proposed increases to taxes on income, alcohol and cigarettes packed Legislative Hall on Wednesday to argue the hikes could hurt the state's small businesses and economy.\n\nLegislative leaders said they didn't like asking for tax hikes, but said they were a necessary evil given that state government is still in a budget hole of hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\"I don't want you to sit here thinking that I'm liking what I'm doing. This is not fun,\" said Speaker of the House Pete Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth. \"If we have to cut $300 million out of our budget, explaining this bill to my district will be easy compared to explaining to everybody else in the state what we did to their jobs, their services, their livelihoods.\"\n\nBACKGROUND:Read details on the income tax proposal\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTHE BACKSTORY:Read about the state's budget plight\n\nThe House Revenue and Finance Committee approved three major bills to increase taxes on Tuesday.\n\nThe first is the Democrats' plan to raise income taxes. The legislation would create a new top tax bracket for people earning $150,000 or more, eliminate itemized deductions and increase tax rates for virtually all Delawareans.\n\nGov. John Carney and Democratic legislative leaders say that increase is crucial to a long-term budget solution because the income tax grows steadily with the economy. It would raise $68 million in the next fiscal year and $211 million in the next fiscal year after that.\n\nDemocratic leaders have not convinced Republicans to give them the handful of votes they need to pass the income tax increase.\n\nLeaders of the nonprofit community voiced fears that eliminating the itemized deduction for charitable donations could hurt their fundraising.\n\n\"We're dependent on the individual donor to give, and it is a very tough environment out there to give,\" said Tyrone Jones, chief impact officer at the United Way of Delaware.\n\nMany nonprofit leaders support the rest of the income tax bill because it would raise money that might help prevent cuts to their state funding.\n\nRep. Quinton Johnson, D-Middletown, said he didn't want to raise the tax but felt the General Assembly had little choice.\n\n\"We are at a point in time where these are mathematical decisions, not political decisions,\" Johnson said.\n\nThe tax that drew the most criticism Wednesday was a plan to raise taxes on beer, wine and spirits. So many distributors, brewery owners and liquor store owners flooded the basement hearing room that legislative staffers had to herd them into the cafeteria, where the meeting was shown on a television screen.\n\n\"Prices will go up. Of this, there is no doubt,\" said Jay Hibbard, vice president of the Distilled Spirits Council. \"When prices go up, sales go down.\"\n\nSchwartzkopf said he intends to file an amendment to lower the amount of the proposed increase from what was originally proposed.\n\nHere are the new rates: on a six-pack of beer, from 9 cents to 15 cents; on 750 milliliters of wine, from 19 cents to 32 cents; on 750 milliliters of spirits, from 74 cents to 89 cents.\n\nRepresentatives of several Delaware breweries, including Iron Hill and Dogfish Head, said the tax increase would harm a budding industry.\n\n\"This tax would directly, negatively affect my ability to expand, to hire more people,\" said Eric Williams, founder and owner of Mispillion River Brewing.\n\nWhile the bill passed the committee, several lawmakers said they would likely not vote for the alcohol tax increase in the full House.\n\nRep. Bryon Short suggested the tax increase was not worth the amount it would raise. With the amendment, the bill would raise $5.2 million in the next fiscal year and $7.1 million in the year after that.\n\n\"I think this is nibbling around the edges and, respectfully, does not contribute meaningfully to the solution,\" Short said.\n\nSchwartzkopf reiterated that he would prefer not to raise the tax.\n\n\"If we can get some kind of a bipartisan agreement to do a large amount with one bill, I'd be more than happy to do that,\" Schwartzkopf said, urging Republicans to support the income tax hike.\n\nThe committee also passed a proposal to raise increases on cigarettes, e-cigarettes and other tobacco products. It would bring in around $11.6 million.\n\nDavid Eisenhour, owner of Delmarva Vapor Lounge, said the 5-cent new tax on \"vaping\" products would stop people from coming to Delaware to buy his products.\n\n\"I could tolerate a penny. I could stomach two pennies. But when you get up to 5 cents, you're just going to murder our business,\" said David Eisenhour, owner of Delmarva Vapor Lounge.\n\nBut some health advocacy groups have criticized legislators for making the tax increases too small. Gov. John Carney had proposed a $1 per pack increase on cigarettes, but the bill would increase it only 50 cents.\n\n\"With a one dollar per pack increase, Delaware had the opportunity to make a bold statement about our desire to address the leading preventable cause of death and disease in our state,\" said Jonathan Kirch, government relations director for the American Heart Association in Delaware, in a statement. \"It is outrageous that some of our elected officials seem more concerned about keeping tobacco prices low than they are about keeping our youth from getting addicted to this deadly product.

So the tax on Glenlivet scotch is the same as Captain Morgan rum, and the tax on Dogfish Head beer is the same as the tax on Pabst Blue Ribbon.\n\nHere's how the cigarette taxes would increase:\n\nThe tax on cigarettes would increase by 50 cents per 20-cigarette pack, to $2.10.\n\nA new five-cent tax would be imposed on each millimeter of fluid for e-cigarettes or \"vapes.\"\n\nThe tax on moist snuff would grow from 54 cents to 92 cents\n\nThe tax on all other tobacco products would grow from 15 percent of the wholesale price to 30 percent\n\nIf passed, legislators would take a different approach than Gov. John Carney did in his budget proposal. Carney did not ask for an alcohol tax increase, but asked for a larger cigarette tax increase of $1 per pack.\n\n\"I thought that was excessive,\" said Sen. Gary Simpson, R-Milford and the Senate Minority Leader.\n\nCarney has said he will accept tweaks to his proposals if they help legislators reach a larger balanced budget deal.\n\nLegislative leaders in both parties believe the taxes can pass as part of the compromises over the state budget. Schwartzkopf said he intends to have the bill brought up in committee on Wednesday and, if it passes there, voted on in the House on Thursday.\n\nRELATED:Read about the Democrats' income tax proposal\n\nRELATED:The General Assembly recently hiked corporate taxes\n\n\"I think we'll come to a resolution on those two taxes,\" said Simpson.\n\nSchwartzkopf and Simpson both point out that the alcohol tax hasn't been increased since 1990. In fact, taxes on spirits were actually reduced in 1997.\n\nStill, alcohol producers, distributors and sellers are anxious about taxes increasing.\n\n\"There would not only be an immediate short time impact on the bottom line of our brewers, some of whom are struggling to make ends meet, but it would particularly affect new brewers coming into the state,\" said John Klein, president of the Delaware Brewers Guild, which represents 18 breweries in the state.\n\nKlein, who works for Dogfish Head, points out that the tax on a barrel of beer will go from $4.85 to $11.46, which he called a \"huge\" increase. He said most brewers and sellers won't have any choice but to pass the cost onto the consumer and increase prices.\n\n\"I like to think that Delaware's a business-friendly state, especially a small business state,\" he said. \"Keeping taxes lower is the path we should continue down.\"\n\nKlein said the increase would make Delaware's alcohol tax much higher than neighboring states. But lawmakers argue that Delaware has zero sales tax, so the total burden is still low.\n\nSmokers, vapers and stores that sell cigarettes won't be happy about the additional tax, but some medical groups — like the American Lung Association and American Heart Association — back legislators' efforts. They supported even higher rates.\n\n\"Tobacco is the number one cause of preventable death in Delaware and nationwide,\" stated the IMPACT Delaware Tobacco Prevention Coalition, a group of health and public advocacy groups, in a letter to The News Journal. \"This fact alone is sobering and should make the case for legislators in this state and across the nation to take appropriate action to curtail tobacco use.\"\n\nLawmakers have already signed off on increasing corporate taxes by more than $116 million. If the tobacco and alcohol taxes pass, they will have about $134 million.\n\nDespite these agreements, the burning question in Legislative Hall remains unanswered: will legislators raise personal income taxes?\n\nGov. Carney and his fellow Democrats believe the income tax is stable and grows with the economy, so raising it is a vital part of a long-term budget solution. Yet Republicans say they won't provide the votes necessary to pass it unless Democrats consider some of their ideas for spending reform, like a three-year elimination of the prevailing wage.\n\nLawmakers have until June 30 to strike a deal.\n\n\"We're still at a standstill on that issue,\" Simpson said of the income tax. \"I think my caucus, and I've heard the same thing from the House Republicans, we're not willing to budget without getting a meaningful move on prevailing wage.\"\n\nSchwartzkopf said he is hopeful that negotiations on the budget can come to a head next week after the last meeting of the Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council, a panel of economists and state officials that estimates how much the state will have to spend.\n\n\"My hope is that, Tuesday, we'll have a different tenor of the discussion,\" Schwartzkopf said. \"We still have time. We have 7 legislative days, and a lot can happen in 7 days.\"\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428 or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/01/06/hank-aaron-skeptics-mea-culpa-vaccine-campouts-news-around-states/115261226/", "title": "Hank Aaron, skeptic's mea culpa: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The mayors of at least three Alabama cities, including heavily populated Birmingham, have been diagnosed with COVID-19 as the illness spreads rapidly across the state following the holidays. The city of Birmingham said Mayor Randall Woodfin was admitted to a hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia Monday, five days after announcing he tested positive for the new coronavirus. Decatur Mayor Tab Bowling said he was quarantining at home after testing positive for the virus, and the city of Auburn said Mayor Ron Anders was in quarantine after testing positive. Bowling told the Decatur Daily he felt guilty about participating in holiday family gatherings with his adult children and their families over the holidays. Alabama on Monday hit a new high for the number of COVID-19 patients in state hospitals with more than 3,000 hospitalized. The new peak comes as health officials feared a new surge of cases in the wake of the winter holidays. There were a record 3,064 people in state hospitals Monday with COVID-19, according to numbers from the Alabama Department of Public Health.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Attorneys for the state are asking a judge to strike down provisions of law dealing with government appointments amid a dispute between Gov. Mike Dunleavy and lawmakers who did not meet to consider his picks for his Cabinet, boards and commissions. The state’s counterclaim last week comes in a lawsuit brought by the Legislative Council. The council, composed of House and Senate leaders, says the appointments Dunleavy presented in early 2020 lapsed in December after lawmakers failed to act on them. The council has asked a judge to block Dunleavy from continuing with those appointments and from reappointing people to posts until the start of the next legislative session Jan. 19. Typically, the House and Senate meet during the regular legislative session to consider appointments. But amid COVID-19 concerns last March, lawmakers passed a law allowing them to adjourn and take up confirmations later.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Agencies helping the homeless in the state’s largest county say the annual count of people living on the streets was canceled this year because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. The Maricopa Regional Continuum of Care, which includes shelters and other services for homeless people, says the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development allowed it to opt out of the January 2021 count of those sleeping outdoors. The one-night tally includes face-to-face interviews with people on the streets to help agencies understand how many need services. The Maricopa Association of Governments last week announced it canceled the outdoor count amid a surge in Arizona’s reported COVID-19 cases, deaths and hospitalizations. Arizona health officials on Monday reported 5,158 new cases and three additional deaths statewide, along with a record number of hospitalizations. Last year’s tally counted 3,767 homeless people in Arizona’s Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix. The county is Arizona’s largest and home to about 4.5 million people.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of patients hospitalized because of coronavirus in the state continued surging Monday to a new record of nearly 1,300. There were 1,296 people hospitalized with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, up from 1,234 a day before, according to the Department of Health. The state’s virus cases rose by 1,306 to 234,781, and 51 more people died from COVID-19, the department said. Gov. Asa Hutchinson called the increase in deaths and hospitalizations “vivid reminders of how many families are hurting because of this pandemic.” Just 4% of the state’s intensive care unit beds and 22% of its hospital beds were available, according to the Department of Health. There are 411 COVID-19 patients in ICUs around the state. The Arkansas Department of Corrections on Monday said it will conduct its first round of coronavirus vaccinations for employees. A department spokeswoman said at least 975 will receive the vaccine, which will go toward the department’s contracted medical provider and to officers permanently assigned to medical security and transportation roles.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Distribution hiccups and logistical challenges have slowed the initial coronavirus vaccine rollout in the state, setting a pace that’s “not good enough,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said. The state is trying to execute the massive immunization campaign “with a sense of urgency that is required of this moment and the urgency that people demand,” but so far only about 1% of California’s 40 million residents have been vaccinated, the Democratic governor said. The 454,000 doses of vaccine that have been administered in California represent just a third of the more than nearly 1.3 million received in the state so far, according to the California Department of Public Health. Newsom’s comments came Monday as the state’s death toll topped 26,500, and confirmed cases neared 2.4 million since the pandemic began. The state’s swamped hospitals held more than 22,000 coronavirus patients, including nearly 4,700 in intensive care units, the Department of Public Health said. Even as he acknowledged the state must do better, Newsom sought to shift some responsibility for the slow rollout, noting that “the vaccines don’t arrive magically in some state facility.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Inmates in El Paso County’s jail will get daily temperature checks, and those who test positive for the coronavirus will be regularly monitored by medical staff, under a temporary deal negotiated by lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union and the sheriff and approved by a federal judge Monday. The ACLU sued El Paso County Sheriff Bill Elder last month after his office acknowledged that inmates were not routinely given masks to wear to prevent the spread of infection until a large COVID-19 outbreak in the jail. Jail officials said they could not distribute masks initially during the pandemic because the only ones available had metal staples, which they said created safety concerns. Under the preliminary injunction approved by U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson, inmates will be given two cloth masks to use, and deputies who do not wear masks will face discipline. Deputies will check inmates’ temperatures twice a day, and anyone with a temperature over 99.4 degrees will be referred to medical staff. Those who test positive will be checked by medical staff daily and given access to over-the-counter pain and cold medicine for free.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Lawmakers are returning to the state Capitol building – at least physically for opening day – to kick off a new legislative session that’s expected to focus on the coronavirus pandemic and the state’s budget challenges. Plans are in the works to have members of the General Assembly brave chilly January temperatures and take the oath of office outside on the Capitol grounds Wednesday. They will then vote on the rules, which are still being hammered out, for what will undoubtedly be an unusual five-month-long session. “We don’t know how long we’re going to be in this,” said Sen. Kevin Kelly, the incoming Republican Senate leader. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont recently said he will likely address the lawmakers in his traditional opening day speech remotely. Meanwhile, the first legislative committee meetings have already been scheduled as Zoom meetings, to be aired simultaneously on newly created YouTube channels and in some cases on the Connecticut Network or CT-n. Lawmakers will likely participate online from home, returning to the Capitol for socially distanced floor votes. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff said members of the public will probably have to log onto the Zoom hearings to testify on bills.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Families and school staff now have access to more detailed data on COVID-19 cases in the state’s schools. On Tuesday, the state launched a data dashboard showing the number of coronavirus cases by school district. The state is not reporting school-level data, citing privacy concerns. “We knew that there was an interest in getting more local-level data,” said Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Division of Public Health. In December, COVID-19 cases in Delaware were quickly approaching levels that would have closed schools, based on the state’s criteria set over the summer. But the data dictating whether schools should be open should be reevaluated, Carney said at the time, noting that health experts had learned more about how the virus spreads in schools than they did at the start of the school year. In the weeks leading up to winter break, Carney recommended schools pause in-person learning until Jan. 11, not because schools were not safe but to give school leaders time to adjust to operational challenges. In the same announcement, Carney said the state would replace its previous data dashboard with data “more specific and relevant to the public health conditions affecting schools.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: By the end of the month, the district could begin vaccinating non-health care essential workers – those who work in grocery stores, public safety officers, and teachers and child care workers, WUSA-TV reports. Mayor Muriel Bowser laid out the city’s tentative plan for the next few weeks, with a soft goal of Jan. 11 for beginning to vaccinate those 65 and over who aren’t already in Phase 1A and Jan. 25 for the next group of essential workers. Residents in Phase 1A who haven’t been vaccinated yet can sign up for an appointment to through the city’s vaccination portal. Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt, director of the D.C. Department of Health, encouraged those who aren’t health care workers to hold off on signing up. “If people who rush to use this portal who are not health care workers, it will create a difficult situation for those people for whom it was designed,” she said during the mayor’s weekly coronavirus briefing Monday.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The push to vaccinate people over age 65 is drawing thousands of eager seniors in uneven rollouts across various counties, with some residents so set on getting a shot that they slept in their cars overnight. In Daytona Beach, hundreds of senior citizens determined to get vaccinated against COVID-19 camped out inside their vehicles in frigid temperatures to secure coveted spots in a vaccination line Tuesday morning, a day after seniors jammed the roads as they headed for the vaccination site. Officials tried to avoid a repeat of Monday’s traffic jams by opening a stadium’s parking lot to overnight camping for people 65 and older. By 7:30 p.m. Monday, senior citizens in 200 vehicles were on the property, set to brave overnight temperatures in the low 40s. A couple of hours north, in Clay County, people booked appointments online and walked in for their scheduled vaccination. Broward County Mayor Steve Geller said Tuesday that he’s being bombarded with emails and calls from senior citizens who are upset over how the vaccine distribution is going. He said the state simply does not have enough of the vaccine to administer it to all of Florida’s 4.5 million seniors.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron, former U.N. Ambassador and civil rights leader Andrew Young, and former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan got vaccinated against COVID-19 in Georgia on Tuesday, hoping to send a message to Black Americans that the shots are safe. Getting vaccinated “makes me feel wonderful,” Aaron said. Rolling up their sleeves to take the first of two doses, these octogenarians, their spouses and several other civil rights leaders who received the shots in a brand-new health clinic at the Morehouse School of Medicine acknowledged the legacy of mistrust that many African Americans have toward medical research, stemming from the infamous Tuskegee experiment in which U.S. health workers left syphilis untreated in Black men without their consent, making them suffer needlessly. “I’ve been taking vaccines now for 88 years, and I haven’t been sick,” Young said. “The truth of it is, Black folk have been living by shots, and just because they did something crazy and murderous and evil back in 1931, we’re still thinking about that. We’ve got to get over that.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The island of Kauai is reopening to tourists after a halt forced by the coronavirus, but the economic recovery in the vital tourism industry could be slow. Kauai had opted out of the state program that allows trans-Pacific visitors if they produce a negative test before arrival, and the island had required all travelers to undergo a 10-day quarantine. But Kauai began its own entry program Tuesday. Travelers can avoid quarantine if they go to another Hawaii island with the pre-arrival testing program and wait at least three days before coming to Kauai. A second option would enable travelers to quarantine for three days instead of 10. Kauai County said travelers could be released from quarantine if they’re tested before arrival, quarantine for three days at a “resort bubble” property and then get a second test that comes back negative. “To the extent that they can experience the rest of the island after three days, they’ll be more likely to come,” said Richard Albrecht, president of The Club at Kukuiula, one of the bubble properties. Participants will be required to wear tracking bracelets.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A group brought together by Gov. Brad Little to find ways to bolster faltering salmon and steelhead populations has agreed to encourage habitat restoration but avoided making a decision about breaching dams. The report released over the weekend by the Republican governor’s workgroup flatly states it’s not a recovery plan. Rather, it’s a list of recommendations approved by a group that includes conservationists, power companies, farmers, tribes, irrigators and ranchers. At the group’s first meeting in June 2019, Little tasked members with finding achievable goals to improve struggling salmon and steelhead populations. They met an additional 15 times through December to hash out recommendations, including creating a statewide inventory of habitat in all river basins and collaborating with property owners and water users to improve habitat. Thirteen species of Columbia River Basin salmon and steelhead are listed for protection under the Endangered Species Act, including all salmon and steelhead that return to Idaho. The Idaho populations once numbered more than 2.3 million fish combined, the report said. Now, they number about 45,000.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Some Chicago Public Schools teachers expected to report to the classroom ahead of preschool students’ anticipated return next week stayed home Monday over coronavirus concerns. The nation’s third-largest district plans to bring students back in phases. Starting next week, preschool and some special education students can return or continue remote learning. Students in K-8 have the option Feb. 1. A date for high school students hasn’t been set. The Chicago Teachers Union opposed the plan over safety. Dozens of aldermen also objected with concerns about health and racial equity. District data shows roughly 37% of eligible students planned to return, with that group disproportionately white. Linda Perales, a southwest side special education teacher, told reporters Monday she’d continue remote teaching, partly because social distancing measures have an impact on teaching. “They will have to wear a face mask all day,” she said. “Teachers will have to wear a face mask all day, and that is so important to note because it’s going to make it impossible to teach letter sounds and other things like that.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Lawmakers opened their 2021 legislative session Monday, largely wearing masks and in greatly modified settings for coronavirus precautions, even as leaders said they were braced for disruptions from possible COVID-19 infections. The House was gaveled into session for the first time in what will be its temporary location for the next several months, giving up its wood-paneled Statehouse chamber that has been deemed too crowded for the 100 House members and necessary staffers. The House will meet in a large conference room in a neighboring state office building that appears more like a business convention site. The Senate will continue meeting in its Statehouse chamber, but the balcony is closed to the public, as 20 of the 50 senators will be sitting there to allow greater distancing. Plexiglass surrounds the lecterns from which senators speak. The Republican-dominated Legislature will face debates over whether to roll back GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb’s authority to issue public health orders to stem the COVID-19 spread that has killed more than 8,000 in Indiana and flooded the state’s hospitals with thousands of patients since a sustained surge started in September.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds appears prepared to push schools to return students to classrooms this month, reinforcing her plans to prioritize in-person learning even when a local school board believes it’s too risky. In November, the state approved requests for 90 school districts or buildings to go to online learning as coronavirus cases escalated, causing many schools to run short of staff members as they tested positive or had to quarantine due to exposure. Student absenteeism also surged at many schools. Eleven districts had been approved during December, but the Des Moines school district’s request Dec. 28 was the first to be rejected since August. Virus conditions deteriorated in Iowa in November with a spike in hospitalizations and deaths. Trends appeared to improve in early December, although the positivity rate in Iowa has started to tick back up again in recent weeks.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly said Monday that she’s “very comfortable” with how Kansas is distributing COVID-19 vaccines despite U.S. government data showing its inoculation rate is the lowest of any state. The Democratic governor argued that Kansas likely has a more efficient distribution system than other states and is getting vaccine doses more quickly to more communities. The state Department of Health and Environment has said the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows Kansas behind other states because of a reporting lag. Kelly told reporters the state has concentrated on “getting vaccinations in people’s arms.” The state health department has not published or posted online its own data for the number of shots given, and Kelly has faced criticism from top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature over the CDC’s vaccination data. House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr., an Olathe Republican, said Monday that Kansas residents “are tired of hearing excuses.” The CDC reported Monday that Kansas had administered 20,110 vaccine shots, or 690 for every 100,000 residents, making it the only state to inoculate fewer than 700 residents out of every 100,000.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Following several days of an increasing coronavirus positivity rate, Gov. Andy Beshear announced the rate escalated again Monday, hitting 11.2% – more than 3 percentage points higher than it had been one week prior. Beshear said the increase could be due to some labs and public testing sites being closed over the holidays, thus increasing the percentage of tests conducted in medical settings where patients are experiencing symptoms, but it also may be a result of increased spread happening at gatherings over the holidays. “We think it is some of both, but it’s going to take days for the data to show us the truth,” the governor said during his Monday update. Beshear also reported 2,319 new cases and 26 deaths Monday. There were 1,737 Kentuckians hospitalized with the virus, including 456 in an intensive care unit and 216 on a ventilator. Monday marked three weeks since the first Kentuckians to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were innoculated, and Beshear said he is “not satisfied with the pace” of the vaccine’s rollout. There have been 60,414 doses administered in Kentucky, less than half of the 122,100 vaccines the state has received, according to state data.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state would broaden the mail-in balloting options for spring municipal elections and two upcoming special congressional elections because of the coronavirus pandemic, under an emergency elections plan that started advancing with lawmakers Tuesday. Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, Louisiana’s top elections official, wants to use the same expansion of absentee-by-mail voting that was in place for the summer and fall elections, including the November presidential competition. Without objection Tuesday, lawmakers on the Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee backed the package of COVID-19 emergency rules proposed by the Republican elections chief. A House committee planned to consider the proposal later in the day. Republican senators who in prior debates repeatedly expressed worry about voter fraud if they expanded mail-in voting offered no such concerns this time. Instead, they noted that Ardoin’s data showed only small percentages of voters used the COVID-19 rules in submitting absentee ballots for the 2020 elections. Most mail-in votes were cast by people legally able to do it without the emergency rules.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The City Council has extended outdoor dining in public spaces into the spring. The city already extended outdoor dining on public sidewalks and parking lanes in October to help local businesses during the pandemic. Councilors voted Monday for another extension through May 10. Many restaurants have shifted to takeout as the temperatures plunged. But others are taking advantage of outdoor spaces. “We never thought people would want to sit outside in January in February, but obviously times have changed,” Deen Haleem, who owns Old Port restaurant TIQA with his wife, told WMTW-TV. Even with outdoor seating, revenue in December was down by at least 70% at TIQA, he said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state is now accepting claims for three federal unemployment programs that Congress extended when it passed a $900 billion stimulus package over a week ago. The state Department of Labor is processing claims and issuing payments through the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, Pandemic Unemployment Emergency Compensation and Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation programs, which have offered a lifeline to people struggling to work during COVID-19. There should not be a delay in receiving payments through the extended programs. Claimants will receive an email directing them to file their weekly claim certification, reopen their claim or reapply for benefits. Anyone who is eligible for benefits will automatically begin receiving the $300 payments. Gov. Larry Hogan said in a news release that Maryland is one of the first states in the U.S. to have programmed and deployed the new programs.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The vice chairman of the Massachusetts Republican Party, a former coronavirus skeptic, has issued a mea culpa after falling sick with COVID-19, likely from being infected at a White House Hannukah party last month. “I will survive this, in spite of my own obvious negligence, and arrogance, towards a virus that knows no bounds and shows no mercy,” Tom Mountain, 60, wrote in an opinion piece in the Boston Herald published Tuesday. He got sick three days after attending the White House party, at which mask-wearing and social distancing were lax. He spread COVID-19 to other members of his family. Mountain, who is now recovering at home, wrote that he had chills, fever, nausea and “nearly every symptom attached with the coronavirus” that required two trips to the emergency room. “Masks? Who needs masks? I scoffed at the idea and rolled my eyes at so many for donning them. The mere thought of my wearing one got my libertarian self-righteousness up in arms,” he wrote. He said he now has a better appreciation of Republican Gov. Charlie Baker’s efforts to control the virus.\n\nMichigan\n\nGaylord: An event that draws snowmobile enthusiasts to northern Michigan has been postponed due to concerns about the coronavirus. The Michigan Snowmobile Festival has been moved to February 2022, according to the Gaylord Area Convention & Tourism Bureau, which has hosted the festival since 2015. “Our committee met in the fall, and we were moving forward with the event with several backup plans in place to comply with COVID-19 restrictions,” said Christy Walcott, the bureau’s marketing director. “We waited until it was necessary to start investing in marketing the event before deciding postponing was our best course of action due to the uncertainty as to when restrictions will be lifted.” The festival features a snowmobile fun run that attracts snowmobilers primarily from lower Michigan, Ohio and Indiana.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMaplewood: A Twin Cities-area man accused of pointing a gun at a fitness club manager after complaining that members were exercising without masks was charged Monday with assault with a dangerous weapon. Michael Florhaug, 64, was arrested following the incident Thursday at LA Fitness in Maplewood. Prosecutors said assistant manager Mike Olson, who thought Florhaug was going to shoot members without masks, eventually tackled Florhaug, took the gun and removed all the ammunition. Court documents do not list an attorney for Florhaug, of Maplewood. The complaint said Olson had stepped in after Florhaug confronted a front desk employee about gym members without masks, going against a state order that’s meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Olson told Florhaug the club lacked the staff to enforce the mandate, and Florhaug “was welcome to pay an employee out of his own pocket to enforce the mask rules,” the Star Tribune reports. Florhaug allegedly yelled at the manager, called him dumb and said he was going to photograph club members. When Olson tried to intervene, Flohaug pulled out a gun and pointed it at the manager, who backed away.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State officials announced a plan Monday to streamline access to coronavirus vaccines for vulnerable populations in the coming weeks. “We want to make sure that as many doses as we get this week, we’re getting that many shots in arms,” Gov. Tate Reeves said during a news conference. “It doesn’t do us any good if it’s sitting on the shelf.” The Republican governor said Monday that people over age 75 will have access to the vaccine, beginning next week, at private clinics and drive-thru sites. The week after, those over 65 will become eligible for the vaccine. “We know that we cannot afford delays in protecting those who are at the greatest risk,” Reeves said. “We must focus on saving lives.” The Department of Health has 18 high-volume drive-thru sites prepared for the vaccine rollout. Approximately 174 private clinics have also requested vaccines, State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said. He did not immediately release the names of the 174 clinics.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Two-fifths of all of Missouri’s COVID-19 deaths were reported in the last two months of 2020, according to the state health department. Data on the department’s COVID-19 dashboard shows 2,369 deaths were reported in November and December. That’s about 41% of the 5,825 deaths attributed to the virus since March. The death toll grew by 263 on Tuesday, largely because a weekly review of death certificates from around the state found 250 connected to the virus that had not been previously reported. The state also cited 2,632 new confirmed cases, bringing the total to 405,589 since the onset of the pandemic. Coronavirus hospitalizations remain at concerning levels. The St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force said the region’s hospitals are at 85% capacity, and intensive care units are at 87% capacity. With the rollout of vaccines slower than expected, a Missouri lawmaker has filed legislation that would allow dentists to administer coronavirus vaccines.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The state reached a grim milestone Tuesday, reporting 1,005 total COVID-19-related deaths, with 25 added to Monday’s total. In addition to crossing the 1,000-death threshold, Montana reported 834 new COVID-19 cases Tuesday, bringing the state’s total number since the pandemic began to 83,378. There are 4,924 active cases in Montana and 212 active hospitalizations out of 3,686 total hospitalizations. The state has administered 813,082 COVID-19 tests, 2,202 more than Monday. There have been 77,449 recoveries.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials are warning people to watch out for scams related to COVID-19 vaccines. State Attorney General Doug Peterson said Nebraskans should be wary about unsolicited offers to provide the vaccine, especially if they ask for credit card numbers or other personal information. The COVID-19 vaccine is being provided free. “Rely on your own health care practitioners for accurate information rather than unknown and unverified sources,” Peterson said. The number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus in Nebraska has remained relatively stable over the past two weeks. The state said 527 people were being treated for the virus in hospitals Monday. That was up from 511 on Sunday, but that total has fluctuated between a low of 503 and a high of 572 over the past two weeks. The number of virus hospitalizations is now just over half of the November record of 987, but it is still more than double where it was at the start of October. Nebraska reported 585 new virus cases and 10 deaths Monday to give the state 169,585 cases and 1,682 deaths linked to COVID-19 since the pandemic began.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: COVID-19 vaccinations for people 75 and older in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, could begin at pharmacies as soon as next week, health officials say. As in the rest of the country, vaccination efforts in Nevada so far have focused on front-line health care workers and staff and residents in long-term care facilities. Now, vaccinations for those 75 and up could begin as soon as Jan. 11, Southern Nevada Health District spokeswoman Jennifer Sizemore told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Nevada Health and Human Services spokeswoman Shannon Litz did not provide a specific time frame but said multiple counties, including Clark County, could “soon” begin vaccinating people in the state’s second-tier priority group, which includes older people. “Nevada counties are vaccinating individuals in Tier 1, and some counties may be moving into Tier 2 soon,” she said. “As this effort continues, counties may move throughout the tiers at different paces, based on factors such as population size and vaccine demand within the tier groups.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: While state lawmakers wrangle with how to conduct business during the pandemic, some are hoping to make things easier on town officials concerned about hosting annual meetings this spring. A bipartisan New Hampshire Senate bill would allow the governing bodies of towns and school districts to postpone their March elections to the second Tuesday of April, May, June or July if they are concerned about coronavirus. Towns also would be allowed to postpone the business or deliberative session of the annual town meeting at which budgets are adopted to later dates. In the event of postponement, elected officials whose terms would have expired would continue. The arrival of the pandemic last spring created confusion and raised questions about the legality of postponing such meetings. Some towns conducted parts of their meeting online and offered drive-up voting instead of the traditional in-person gatherings.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy vetoed a bill that made changes to the rules governing restaurants, bars, distilleries and breweries that have been permitted to serve food and drinks outdoors during the pandemic, saying it bypassed health and safety rules. “I commend the bill’s sponsors for their efforts to assist New Jersey’s businesses and farms in finding creative ways to continue to operate during the COVID-19 emergency,” Murphy said in a statement. “However, in seeking to deliver a degree of relief to these businesses, the bill circumvents existing licensing and regulation processes critical to protecting the public’s health and safety.” The bill would have allowed restaurants, bars, distilleries and breweries to continue to use their outdoor spaces – including patios, decks, yards and parking lots – to sell food and drinks without having to pay to submit an application or pay for an acceptance fee for a license. Municipalities would also have to approve applications for outdoor dining within 15 days of submission, which Murphy said would impair their ability to evaluate health concerns.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: Residents and businesses are getting free face masks from the City of Las Cruces through two new programs. At its Monday meeting, the City Council voted 5-0 to pass a resolution allowing city businesses to receive disposable face masks to use to prevent COVID-19’s spread. Councilors Gabriel Vasquez and Yvonne Flores were absent. The measure was recommended to the City Council by the Las Cruces Economic Recovery Board, an ad hoc committee that is acting as a local version of the statewide Economic Recovery Council. The board voted Nov. 5 to include businesses as part of a larger citywide mask distribution effort that will also include sending masks directly to residential Las Cruces Utilities customers. The local economic recovery board was created in May to provide the city with strategies for safely reopening the Las Cruces economy amid the pandemic. Its recommendations implemented by the city so far include the Las Cruces Safe Promise pledge for individuals, promoting COVID-safe certifications for businesses and a temporary reduction in annual business registration fees.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo offered competing strategies Tuesday for ramping up the city’s COVID-19 vaccination efforts, with de Blasio saying vaccine eligibility should be widened and Cuomo countering that hospitals need to do a better job of vaccinating the health care workers who are eligible now. “Move it quickly. We’re serious,” said Cuomo, who on Monday threatened to fine hospitals that don’t administer their vaccine allotments quickly enough. “If you don’t want to be fined, just don’t participate in the program. It’s not a mandatory program.” Only health care workers and nursing home residents and staff members are currently being vaccinated in New York. De Blasio said it’s time to broaden eligibility to include people older than 75 and essential workers such as police officers and firefighters. “Give them the freedom to vaccinate, and they will vaccinate thousands, then tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands, then millions,” de Blasio said. “What they don’t need is to be shamed; what they don’t need is more bureaucracy.” But Cuomo said vaccinations are lagging because some hospitals are just better managed than others.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper announced Tuesday that he’s calling in the North Carolina National Guard to help accelerate COVID-19 vaccinations in a state that’s been near the bottom of states in doses administered so far. Cooper said ensuring vaccines are given to individuals “is our top priority right now.” “We will use all resources and personnel needed,” Cooper said in a tweet. Nearly 108,000 people in North Carolina had received their first dose as of Tuesday morning, according to data from the state Department of Health and Human Services, while almost 500 people had received a second dose. The first-dose total is less than 1% of the state’s population. And data as of Monday accumulated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ranked North Carolina as sixth-worst among the states in first-dose vaccinations per capita. Hospital workers were the first in line to receive doses, and some remain unvaccinated due to limited supply. Several counties will soon begin administering doses to elderly people 75 years or older.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum used his State of the State address Tuesday to convey optimism about North Dakota’s fight against the coronavirus pandemic, while making a pitch for lawmakers to endorse his budget proposals that he said would benefit residents for generations. “This (coronavirus) battle is far from over. But we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and we have the tools to get us there,” the Republican governor told a joint session of the Legislature. North Dakota had led the country in per-capita cases for many weeks until a steady decline that started in mid-November. That also coincided with a two-thirds decline in hospitalizations due to COVID-19. “Fortunately, we have new tools at our disposal to fight COVID,” including vaccines, Burgum said. Burgum said Monday that he plans to ease restrictions on the number of people who gather in restaurants, bars and event venues, citing a decrease in active COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations due to the coronavirus.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: In about two weeks, adults who are 65 or older, school employees and people with medical conditions that put them at high risk should be able to obtain COVID-19 vaccines, Gov. Mike DeWine said Tuesday. That group, labeled 1B in Ohio’s vaccination plan, includes about 2.2 million people. About 100,000 vaccines will be available in the first week, and Ohio’s oldest citizens will be first in line, DeWine said. It’s not yet clear how those vaccines will be administered, but the Ohio National Guard will have a role. Adults 65 and up were prioritized because they are most at risk of death from COVID-19. The oldest adults will be vaccinated first, DeWine said. “We have chosen to prioritize those who are most likely to die without it,” Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said. Ohio will prioritize vaccinations at schools that are providing in-person classes, Husted said. The first group to receive vaccines, which includes nursing homes and hospitals, includes about 1 million people.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Residents 65 and older will begin receiving their COVID-19 vaccinations this week, and health officials announced Monday that they plan to release a mobile phone application as early as Thursday that will allow Oklahomans to schedule an appointment to receive their vaccine. The state has contracted with Microsoft to develop a mobile app that will allow people to schedule their appointment and track when they should receive their second dose of the vaccine, deputy health commissioner Keith Reed told reporters during a press conference. Oklahoma has received nearly 175,000 doses and administered more than 50,000 first doses of the two-dose vaccine, Reed said. Oklahoma expects to begin receiving between 30,000 and 40,000 additional doses every week, said Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye. “Our vaccine rollout can only go as quickly as we’re getting supplies from the federal government,” Frye said. First responders and health care workers who provide outpatient care to COVID-19 patients are also in Phase 2 and began receiving vaccinations last week. Adults of any age with underlying conditions and pre K-12 public school teachers also are in Phase 2, but those individuals have not started receiving their vaccines yet, Reed said.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown on Monday called for COVID-19 vaccination improvements. State officials have received nearly 200,000 vaccine doses but have administered only about a quarter, a rate that places Oregon among the slowest-performing states nationwide, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Brown’s comments came after the state recorded its deadliest month, with at least 436 deaths among Oregonians with COVID-19 in December. “Oregon, like most of the country, is not moving fast enough,” Brown said in a news release. “All states are grappling with the same logistical challenges, and while we are making steady progress, we must move even more quickly when every vaccination has the potential to save someone’s life.” She said she directed the Oregon Health Authority on Monday to administer 12,000 vaccinations per day by two weeks from now. Brown called it an all-hands-on deck-effort and said she directed the Oregon Health Authority to partner as widely as possible to make it happen. Hospitals and health systems have inoculated about 3,500 Oregonians per day, with some officials citing the holidays as one reason for the slow pace.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Democrats in the state House and Senate offered a solution Monday to a housing problem they say is affecting hundreds of thousands of residents. Pennsylvania Democrats want to pass an eviction and foreclosure ban that would extend 60 days after Gov. Tom Wolf’s third emergency declaration expires in late February. Sen. Vincent Hughes, D-Philadelphia, said about 240,000 Pennsylvanians are facing eviction. Rep. Sara Innamorato, a Democrat from Allegheny County, said a census study showed more than 691,000 Pennsylvanians were not current on their rent or could not pay on time. Innamorato pointed out that, even before the pandemic, many Pennsylvania families were already struggling and living paycheck to paycheck. “And now millions aren’t getting that paycheck,” she said. Evictions are particularly traumatizing for families with young children, lawmakers said. “It is never a good time to be kicked out of your home,” and certainly not during a pandemic, said state Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler, D-Philadelphia.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city’s schools announced Monday that the winter high school sports season will go on as planned with certain precautions in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Practice for basketball, track and field, swimming, and gymnastics is scheduled to start this week. “Providence Public School District understands the high value sports bring to student development and wellness,” Superintendent Harrison Peters said in a statement. “We are taking great care to provide a structured environment with layers of precautions so students can participate in winter sports as safely as possible.” Masks will be required, no spectators will be allowed, and hand-held equipment will be frequently cleaned. Locker rooms will not be available, and bench seating will be expanded to allow for social distancing. Student-athletes will also be required to bring their own water bottles, which they must not share.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Frustrated with what he said is a slow rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, Gov. Henry McMaster said Tuesday that hospital and health workers have until Jan. 15 to get a shot, or they will have to “move to the back of the line.” McMaster said he has asked health officials to speak to hospitals and then revise the rules. Current state rules say 70% of eligible health care workers and nursing home residents need to be vaccinated. When that has been accomplished, the state will start vaccinating people over age 75 and front-line workers such as police officers, prison guards, grocery store workers, teachers and postal employees. McMaster wants to establish the deadline instead. “If we need to move the next group up early, we’re going to do it,” McMaster said at a news conference. The pace of vaccinations has angered both the governor and lawmakers. State Sen. Nikki Seltzler, a Democrat from West Columbia, issued a scathing statement saying that after waiting patiently for 10 months to see a vaccine developed, South Carolinians now need prompt access to it.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s farmers could have what many would consider a successful bottom line for 2020 thanks to COVID-19. Direct government payments for farmers more than doubled from 2019 to 2020, increasing from $22.4 billion to a forecasted $46.5 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. All in all, that $46.5 billion in subsidies makes up nearly 40% of forecasted net farm income. By far, the largest increase in these subsidies stems from supplemental and ad hoc disaster assistance, which includes payments from congressional COVID-19 relief programs. While direct farm payments were common from the late ’90s until about 2009, federal institutions have largely switched to crop insurance programs to support farmers in a more sustainable fashion, said Evert Van der Sluis, a professor of agricultural economics at South Dakota State University. “There’s a widespread expectation that these payments are not sustainable, either financially, economically or politically,” Van der Sluis said. “It’s highly likely they’re not going to last. But nobody can see into the future.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Department of Education hopes a new literacy initiative will help teachers and school districts reach struggling readers. Officials plan to spend $100 million on “Reading 360,” which was launched Monday across the state. Before the coronavirus pandemic shuttered classrooms, only about 36% of Tennessee’s third graders could read on grade level, and educators anticipate struggling students will have fallen further behind. The new phonics-based reading program provides optional training and materials for school districts and resources for parents. It also gives districts access to grants to support tutoring programs and provide training to teachers. “When you think about the initiative overall, it’s a comprehensive approach to reading in the state,” Tennessee Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn said. “It is specifically intended to address with urgency the literacy crisis that we are experiencing.” The effort uses $60 million in federal funding earmarked for COVID-19 recovery and another $40 million from federal grants.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: Republican U.S. Rep. Kay Granger tested positive for the coronavirus upon returning to Washington for the new Congress and is quarantining, aides said Monday. In a statement, Granger’s office said she is asymptomatic and “feeling great!” The 77-year-old Texan is the top Republican on the House Appropriations Committee. Granger received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in December. People are expected to get some level of protection within a couple of weeks after the first shot, but full protection may not happen until a couple of weeks after the second shot. Meanwhile, Texas hit another new record high for COVID-19 hospitalizations Sunday with more than 12,500 patients statewide. It was the sixth time in seven days that the state reported record-breaking hospitalizations, and intensive care units in several parts of the state were full or nearly full.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Utah Department of Health is expanding the number of free coronavirus testing locations as doctors say the state’s positivity rate is troublingly high. The nearly two dozen new sites across the state are open for anyone to get rapid antigen testing for free even if they do not have symptoms of COVID-19. They were announced Monday as health officials announced just over 30% of people taking tests had a positive result. Positivity rates in recent days put Utah among the top 10 states with the highest positivity rates in the country, said Dr. Todd Vento, an infectious diseases physician at Intermountain Healthcare. “The fact is, if you still have percent positivity in the 30% range, that is very high,” he said. “We worry we’re not testing enough, and there may be more out there.” Any surge related to the Christmas holiday likely wouldn’t hit until mid- to late January, he said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The number of new coronavirus cases in the state is increasing, but it’s too soon to say if the increase is due to people visiting during the holidays, officials said Tuesday. The number of people from out of state who visited Vermont was half what it was during last year’s holiday period, but it was still the highest volume of visitors to the state since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. State investigators are starting to learn of holiday gatherings, but there are other cases that have not been linked to gatherings, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said. “It’s difficult to draw definitive conclusions yet regarding the holidays,” Levine said, noting more should be known by the end of the week. He is encouraging Vermonters to get tested for the virus, even those who are showing no symptoms. “Testing is really the only way we have to exercise what we are calling our containment strategy,” Levine said. People who are positive can then stay home and reduce the chance of spreading the virus. The tests are free, even for people who show no symptoms of COVID-19, and testing locations have been set up across Vermont.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Researchers are monitoring sewage in the city in an effort to predict surges of the coronavirus. The Daily Progress reports the research is part of a modeling project at the University of Virginia. Data from the area’s wastewater will be shared with local and state health officials as well as the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Wastewater Surveillance System. Other areas in the state that are testing sewage for COVID-19 include Hampton Roads and Stafford County. “Where we see the value in the wastewater surveillance in a post-surge period, during a calm time … the wastewater surveillance would be a good way to detect an unanticipated resurgence and even to zero in on what part of the city that resurgence is occurring,” said Brent French, a professor of biomedical engineering at UVa.\n\nWashington\n\nLongview: After nearly a month of serving customers indoors despite state rules against it, Stuffy’s II Restaurant received official notice Monday of a temporary restraining order and $126,000 fine. The Longview restaurant’s owners are set to appear at 1:30 p.m. Thursday in Cowlitz County Superior Court in response to a temporary restraining order filed by the state Attorney General’s Office, the Longview Daily News reports. The state Department of Labor and Industries also issued a citation for “willful serious violations for having inside dining each day for seven days Dec. 22-28,” for a total penalty of $126,000, said L&I spokesperson Dina Lorraine. A “Stand for Stuffy’s” rally to protest the order is planned one hour ahead of the court hearing. “We don’t have a ton of time to prep … so we are doing the best we can,” said Skai Hogue, the owners’ granddaughter and an employee at Stuffy’s. “Other than that, the community support is still really great.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice brushed off criticism that the posh resort he owns did not follow coronavirus pandemic guidelines after video surfaced of a New Year’s Eve gala showing a tightly packed ballroom, with many people not wearing masks. The Republican governor, who did not attend the event, has advocated strict mask-wearing – and now advocates vaccinations – as imperative to controlling the coronavirus across the rural state. But video posted online of the billionaire businessman’s resort, The Greenbrier, called into question whether Justice is enforcing pandemic restrictions that have curtailed other businesses. The governor on Monday called the criticism a “political hit” at him and referred to a Democratic state senator who posted video of the party. Justice defended protocols put in place by Greenbrier staff, although he said the situation could have been handled better. He rejected the notion that he isn’t pulling his weight while residents make sacrifices such as forgoing seeing family and not being able to play school sports. “If you don’t think I’m pulling the rope, then you really got a screw loose,” Justice said, referring to his handling of the pandemic.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s business community on Tuesday came out in support of a Republican-authored coronavirus response bill moving quickly through the Legislature that is opposed by public health officials and Democrats. The measure, introduced Monday and slated to pass as soon as Thursday, appears likely to be vetoed by Gov. Tony Evers. The governor said he still hasn’t read the bill or decided what he will do, but “the likelihood of a veto is pretty strong” if it contains provisions he can’t support. Evers said he was disappointed that Republicans weren’t offering the bill he put forward that he said included items that had bipartisan support. Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who sponsored the bill, testified that it was a “good faith effort to compromise with Gov. Evers.” But the proposal is not the compromise Evers or Democrats had been looking for and far from what Evers had put forward last month. The Wisconsin Restaurant Association, the state and Milwaukee chambers of commerce, the Wisconsin Grocers Association and others were among those in support of the measure that gives immunity to businesses from civil liability claims related to COVID-19.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Last winter, a group of farmers, educators and economic development professionals gathered on the Casper College campus to discuss what it would take to develop a self-sustaining food network in Wyoming and begin to solve food security issues that have long plagued small communities around the state. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, Wyoming – one of the few states in the country without a food council at the time – saw food insecurity rates in the double digits and, despite its agrarian reputation, offered few opportunities for farmers to reach new markets. About one year later, the Wyoming Food Coalition is nearly ready to go public with its efforts, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. This month the Wyoming Food Coalition met virtually to discuss the work of several subcommittees dedicated to addressing the issues holding Wyoming back from having a truly sustainable ecosystem. Their charges varied widely, looking at everything from marketing assistance and teaching sustainable agricultural practices to helping growers get into the market or, in some cases, learn to plant vegetables for the very first time.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/06"}]}

Mini frosted cupcakes sit under a glass domed cake plate at one end of the three-seat bar.\n\nAnd the dead giveaway that this is not a sports bar?\n\n\"We don't have TVs,\" said Gifford, 42, the co-owner of Brooklyn Street Local on Michigan Avenue at the corner of Brooklyn Street.\n\nAnd yet, she was shocked to see Detroit Lions fans fill up her small neighborhood cafe on Sundays as many prepared to head to Ford Field, some 2 miles away, during the Detroit Lions' thrill-packed run into the playoffs last season. \"It was great for us,\" Gifford said.\n\nNFL draft means a boost to business but who benefits?\n\nLike many small business owners in Detroit, Gifford remains hopeful that the NFL draft, which comes to Detroit April 25 through April 27, will boost the bottom line. She's planning on adding specials, such as chili cheese fries, chicken wings, maybe a Detroit Lions- or NFL- themed cupcake or cookie. Grab and go items will be available. And, definitely, she says, a football-themed cocktail.\n\nThe NFL draft in Detroit is charged with hope. Football fans eagerly watch the screen — and thousands even travel to host cities — as they root for the next young prospect to infuse talent into their favorite team. Picks aren't permanent, and can be quickly traded, generating even more anticipation during the draft.\n\nMore:Want to go to the NFL draft in Detroit? There's still time to book lodging but act quickly.\n\nAfter nearly 50 years of anchoring the draft in New York, the NFL began moving the draft among its team cities in 2015. The NFL draft heads to Green Bay in 2025. NFL cities that host the annual draft want to harness the economic energy that can be triggered by hundreds of thousands visiting football fans. Entry is free but food, beer and booze, and travel costs are not.\n\nBut it's a gamble when it comes to how much of that extra NFL draft spending will reach a specific business or go beyond the epicenter of the draft in downtown Detroit. Will neighborhoods and communities beyond the NFL draft footprint benefit? How much is too much for an individual restaurant or bar to stock up on when it comes to chicken wings, pizza, or beer? What kind of retailers will see a surge? And who won't?\n\nDetroit takes center stage in NFL draft in April\n\nDetroit is roughly five weeks away from the biggest annual offseason event that the NFL runs, an event that has never been held here. The hype, like most things with the NFL, is huge.\n\nThe record for attendance is more than 600,000 for the NFL draft held in 2019 in Nashville, Tennessee. Overall, about 312,000 people attended the 2023 NFL draft in Kansas City, Missouri, and the event generated an estimated $164.3 million for Kansas City.\n\nDetroit's attendance is expected to match or exceed that of Kansas City's.\n\nYet, it can be a gamble. What will the weather be like? How much will fans want to travel? And again, where will people who visit Detroit spend their money?\n\nSome businesses in Kansas City dubbed last year's draft as a \"big letdown,\" according to reports in the Kansas City Star, which highlighted complaints posted on social media about slower than normal traffic at some outlets.\n\nBut the complaints, Detroit observers say, generally arose from businesses that were farther away from the NFL footprint, held around the city's historic Union Station.\n\nThe advantage for attendance in Detroit is that fans from six NFL cities have a fairly easy drive here, five hours away or less, said Chris Moyer, senior director of communications and public affairs at Visit Detroit, which works to promote metro Detroit as a convention, business meeting and tourism destination.\n\nThe cities are Chicago, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Cleveland, Cincinnati and Indianapolis.\n\nMoyer noted that other NFL towns are a drive of about 12 hours or less, including New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Green Bay, Nashville and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe NFL draft footprint in Detroit — the heart of which runs from Campus Martius to Hart Plaza — can hold only so many people and more room will be needed to handle the crowds and parking.\n\nMore:Born In Detroit opens pop-up storefront ahead of NFL draft in downtown\n\nOfficial plans include handling overflow crowds and developing activities in several areas, including Beacon Park, Capitol Park, Grand Circus Park, Harmonie Park, and Corktown.\n\nDetroit's Corktown, a trendy area filled with bars, breweries, and industrial buildings turned into lofts, was once home to the many Irish immigrants who poured in after 1830. A number of Irish immigrants arrived here after fleeing the Great Potato Famine in Ireland in the 1840s.\n\nHistorians note that Latino populations arriving from the Southwest and Mexico came to Corktown in the 1920s seeking work in Detroit's auto factories.\n\nThe area suffered in the 1960s but began seeing a pickup of activity in the early 2000s. And has since undergone a great resurgence especially since 2018 when Ford Motor Co. acquired Michigan Central Station, now the centerpiece of the automaker's future 30-acre mobility-focused campus.\n\nThe 15-story building, which closed in 1988 and ended up essentially abandoned for years, will reopen June 6. The train depot’s restoration is part of a commitment from Ford to establish the Michigan Central Innovation District, the first piece of which opened in April. According to a Michigan Economic Development Corp. announcement in 2022, Ford already had invested $740 million in the 30-acre campus in Corktown that is expected to hold 5,000 workers, with at least 2,500 of those jobs being non-Ford employees.\n\nCorktown is roughly 1 mile away, west down Michigan Avenue from Campus Martius, where much of the NFL draft activity will take place. A draft theater — where fans can watch eligible players pour — will be located at Randolph and Monroe streets in the Monroe Street Midway area near Greektown.\n\nSome excitement — and some of the crowds — will be directed into Detroit's oldest neighborhood. Corktown events will include a youth hub, Eastern Market food trucks and a watch party from 8-10 p.m. on Thursday and 7-10 p.m. on Friday. Artisan tents are expected to pop up in the area featuring local small businesses and others.\n\n\"A lot of people know us, especially football fans,\" said Pat Osman, a manager at Nemo's, a popular Detroit sports bar that has been on Michigan Avenue since 1965.\n\nOsman, who has been working at Nemo's for 25 years, expects the crowds in Corktown to be even bigger than when Detroit hosted Super Bowl XL in 2005 and \"a lot of Lions fans were watching someone else play.\"\n\nSandy Simmons, another manager at Nemo's who has worked there more than 40 years, remembers the Super Bowl as one of the most fun weeks for Detroit, attracting people from everywhere.\n\n\"And I'm just thinking this is going to be that on steroids,\" Simmons said.\n\nThe NFL has 32 teams that will participate in the draft, creating the potential to attract fans from long list of towns. Simmons attended a meeting regarding the draft in early March where panelists, including a representative from the NFL draft, discussed what to expect.\n\n\"One thing they told us at the meeting, they're like, 'Don't let up on Saturday,' thinking that people lose interest after the 45th pick or whatever it is,\" she said.\n\nThe peak of interest in the NFL draft is Thursday, but events and activities go into the weekend. On Saturday, a family-oriented flag football tournament will be held at The Corner Ballpark, Simmons said, generating what could be more than 2,000 visitors to Corktown.\n\nThe new Godfrey Hotel, which opened in September is across the street from Nemo's and other businesses. Simmons said hotel guests are likely to stop by during the week for a drink or a Nemo's famous burger.\n\nCorktown is used to big crowds for events, such as the 66th annual St. Patrick's Day parade that took place March 10. \"You're packed for 14 hours straight,\" Simmons said.\n\n\"We have St. Patrick's Day this Sunday, which is on a lighter scale because you can go anywhere for St. Patrick's Day. But Parade Day is just in Corktown.\"\n\nMore:NFL draft footprint runs from Campus Martius down Woodward to Hart Plaza\n\nMore:Downtown Detroit parking lots to see upgrades ahead of 2024 NFL draft\n\nOne retailer is a bigger fan of Taylor Swift than NFL draft\n\nNot surprisingly, some retailers welcome the overall attention that Detroit will get in April but say they're not betting the NFL draft will boost their prospects.\n\nErin Gavle, 41, who owns the Eldorado General Store on Michigan Avenue in Corktown, is one retailer who admits she'd rather see Taylor Swift come back to town.\n\nHer store sells vintage clothing, turquoise bracelets and earrings, silk scrunchies, moonstone rings, antiques, locally made and fair trade pieces, scented candles, and more.\n\nEldorado has been in business 10 years, and as her website says, \"opening the year the city of Detroit announced bankruptcy.\"\n\nHer business saw some of the worst Sundays in a decade when the Detroit Lions moved further into playoffs in January. Sales, she said, were \"incredibly down; wildly, drastically different than for the last 10 years.\"\n\n\"Everyone was watching the game somewhere else,\" she said.\n\nShe is happy that other businesses, including restaurants in Corktown, will do well during the NFL draft. \"We're always excited to show off our neighborhood, our town, our corner,\" Gavle told me.\n\nShe's skeptical about whether the NFL draft could ring up as many sales for her store as the two Taylor Swift concerts last summer.\n\nThe Beyoncé concert, the Motor City Tattoo Expo, even the Metallica concert all brought in plenty of shoppers, too.\n\n\"If Taylor Swift just made her way a couple of times a year throughout Detroit,\" she said. \"It's like an economic wave that comes with it.\"\n\nShe isn't loading up on inventory or doing anything different at Eldorado General Store for the draft.\n\n\"I don't think people are coming in town specifically to come shopping at a vintage and jewelry store,\" Gavle said.\n\nMore:2024 NFL draft in Detroit: New details released, what to expect\n\nMore:Michigan football's Quinten Johnson returning after previously declaring for NFL draft\n\nBig tents, beer, and shuttles will be part of Corktown scene\n\nBob Roberts, co-owner of McShane's Irish Pub & Whiskey Bar, tells another part of the economic story ahead. Sure, he has vegan offerings at his establishment, too, like many trendy spots in metro Detroit.\n\nBut McShane's also has 25 TVs and a strong base of sports-oriented customers. More TVs will be outside in a tent during the NFL draft in Detroit. He senses the NFL draft will be three days of capacity crowds for McShane's.\n\n\"I really think Corktown is positioned well,\" said Roberts, 54.\n\nDetroit sports fans have long headed to Corktown to grab a burger and a beer, catch the game on TV, or catch a ride on a shuttle to a game be it the Red Wings, the Detroit Lions, or the Detroit Tigers. The old Tiger Stadium, which hosted its final game in 1999, was at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull.\n\nRoberts, who is president of the Corktown Business Association, said five separate outside tents will be set up during the NFL draft at different establishments for the big night of initial picks on Thursday evening. A tent will be at McShane's, plus there will be tents with TVs for viewing the draft at Mercury Burger & Bar, Nemo's bar,Bobcat Bonnie's, and the Gaelic League Irish-American Club. All are on Michigan Avenue in Corktown.\n\nAs part of the plans in Corktown, Roberts said, free shuttles will pick up guests from designated parking structures a bit away from the business corridor in Corktown, move people around Corktown to several venues within the business district, and take them to the entrance of the draft. Key streets are going to be blocked off at the epicenter of the draft.\n\nRoberts said his NFL draft plan for McShane's includes ordering a \"heck of a lot of beer\" and cutting back on the number of items on the menu to keep things running smoothly in the kitchen and deal with the crowds. He expects to keep popular items such as burgers and the Irish Egg Rolls, wontons stuffed with braised cabbage, corned beef and baby Swiss cheese.\n\nThe NFL draft is expected to be the crown jewel of a very busy late winter and spring — the St. Patrick's Day parade in Corktown on March 10, followed by the NCAA March Madness men's basketball Midwest Regional games scheduled for March 29-31 at Little Caesars Arena, and the Detroit Tigers' Opening Day at Comerica Park on April 5.\n\nOn Opening Day, Roberts said, McShane's expects to be at capacity both inside and on the patio with its Tiki Bar. \"We offer shuttle service, and I would expect to shuttle around 400 guests to the game,\" he said.\n\nYet, he estimated that the three-day NFL event combined could add up to a month's worth of business for McShane's in Detroit.\n\nRoberts says the excitement of the NFL draft has been building over the years. \"It's hope for your home team. You hope that they get a good prospect, and, obviously, someone who will make their team better.\"\n\nRoberts watches the NFL draft every year. His brother and his family will be traveling about 23 miles from the Downriver community of Gibraltar to Detroit for NFL draft events. He knows of six customers who get together every weekend at the McShane's in Ypsilanti who will be heading to the draft in Detroit too.\n\nRoberts has never attended the draft and won't heading to the draft in Detroit, as much as he might like. \"I'm not going to make it to this one either. I will be too busy working.\"\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

The first permanent addition to the Coke lineup in three years is laced with flavors of raspberry and spice, according to Coke, and comes in both regular and zero sugar variations.\n\n\"It’s Coca-Cola, only spiced,\" says Coke about the new flavor. \"Coca-Cola Spiced transforms the familiar into the extraordinary, blending the iconic taste of Coca-Cola with a burst of refreshing notes from raspberry and spiced flavors.\"\n\nThe new offering is \"Coke’s boldest tasting brand innovation yet,\" says the company about the new flavor, adding that the drink is not necessarily spicy but provides an \"uplifting taste experience unlike any other.\"\n\nWhen does Coca-Cola Spiced come out?\n\nCoca-Cola Spiced will be hitting shelves at retailers across the country on Feb. 19.\n\nWhat does Coke Spiced taste like?\n\nCoke Spiced includes notes of raspberry and an aromatic blend of spices, as per Coke.

Where do wings, beer and soda prices stand?\n\nThe new addition is part of Coke's focus on innovation in their brand strategy.\n\n“Innovation is so critical to Coca-Cola’s brand strategy – we're constantly looking at industry trends and exploring new ways to offer our customers more choice,\" Vice President Marketing Sue Lynne Cha said in an email to USA TODAY. \"We are always innovating with new flavors to offer new experiences for our fans.\"\n\nShe adds: \"People want to experiment with unique flavors and Coke Spiced is a direct response to that trend.\"\n\nCoca-Cola’s North American marketing chief Shakir Moin, at a media event in New York Tuesday, said the new flavor was developed in just seven weeks compared to the 12 months plus that it usually takes to develop a new product, adding that the company is \"disrupting\" the way they are working internally to better meet customer demand.\n\nOther Coke flavors\n\nOther flavors have been permanently added to the lineup over the years as well, like Diet Coke, Coke Zero Sugar (previously Coke Zero), Cherry, Vanilla, Cherry Vanilla.\n\nAnd then there was the infamous \"New Coke\", a reinvented version of the traditional soft drink that debuted in 1985 to much media attention and consumer interest, only to be discontinued years later.\n\nHappy tears\n\nBesides Coca-Cola Spiced, Coke is also dropping a limited-edition flavor on Random Acts of Kindness Day − \"Coca-Cola Happy Tears Zero Sugar\" − to \"celebrate acts of kindness\".\n\nThe new flavor, packaged in a \"hype kit\" containing two Coke Happy Tears Zero Sugar cans, a packet of tissue papers, \"Happy Tears\" stickers and apparel will only be available to purchase on TikTok while supplies last. This is the first time that Coke is launching a product directly on the social media platform. The cans and packaging of the hype kit have been embossed with an iridescent drop of joy.\n\nThe flavor, developed under Coke Coca-Cola Creations, \"draws inspiration from the simplicity of happy tears – a small, clear droplet filled with optimism and joy that’s created from the smallest acts of kindness,\" as per Coke.\n\nWhat is Coke Creations?\n\nCoke Creations was launched in 2022 as \"a culture-first innovation platform that introduces new expressions of the Coca-Cola brand, driven by collaboration, creativity and cultural connections,\" says Cha. \"We call it culture bottled.\"\n\nAccording to Senior Brand Director Oana Vlad, Coke creations \"is a really unique product innovation that gives a taste to something that's never been tasted before, like space, dreams, a future.\"\n\nThrough this initiative, the brand aims to better connect with Gen Z and the younger generations, said Vlad at Coke's media event in New York.\n\nSince its inception, eight Coca-Cola Creations have been launched around the world, as per Cha. In February last year, the company teamed up with Grammy Award-winning artist Rosalía to release a limited-edition flavor: Coca-Cola Move.\n\nPrior to that, in 2022, Coke rolled out five fantasy-flavored Coca‑Cola Creations: Coca‑Cola Starlight, Coca‑Cola Byte, the artist Marshmello’s Limited Edition Coca‑Cola, Coca‑Cola Dreamworld, and Coca‑Cola Soul Blast.\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Shocked. Grateful. Hesitant to go through their phone notifications.\n\nThose are just some of the feelings Olivia Kaiser and Korey Gandy experienced right after they were announced as the winners of “Love Island” Season 3 this week. Kaiser is a cosmetologist who owns a business in Scottsdale, and Gandy entered the show as a rental car agent from Virginia Beach.\n\nThe cross-country couple doesn't really know what they’re doing — will they even be able to go to Egypt soon? — but what they do know is this: The wedding cake challenge in Episode 29 was “the most disgusting.”\n\nOh, and everything ended up working out for Olivia and Korey, who had joined the villa in the first episode but had been officially coupled up for just six episodes when they were voted “America’s favorite couple.”\n\nBefore they left Hawaii, where the show was filmed, and returned to the real world on Aug. 16, The Arizona Republic spoke with Olivia and Korey about the origins of “What the freak,” the other islanders they would couple up with and what’s next for them. The interview was condensed for length and clarity.\n\n'Love Island' finale:Recap of the week leading up to Olivia and Korey's win\n\n'Love Island' cast will reunite in New York\n\nQuestion: What have you done since learning that you're America's favorite couple?\n\nOlivia: Well, we just got our phones back, and we're trying our best to not even, like, jump into that yet, and we're just trying to still enjoy this moment. But the love is insane, like, we were hoping for the best, obviously. But in the villa, we don't have any outside connection. So we don’t know what people are saying.\n\nKorey: For me, I don't think it's hit yet. We're all just … trying to keep each other's heads up. You know, along with those positive comments comes some negative comments as well. We’re just all trying to be together and cheer each other up, which is what we’ve done for the past whole summer, really.\n\nQ: What does the near future look like for the two of you?\n\nOlivia: We're going to reset, repack, go through our stuff — we have a lot of stuff we're going back with — and then we're going to New York on Friday. And then after New York, I'm going to go to Virginia Beach and hang out with him.\n\nI'll be back in Arizona for, like, a week and then New York, the whole cast is going to be out there, so we're going to hang out with everyone, just celebrate, you know? Because this is, like, insane.\n\nQ: I suppose there’s a group chat or something? How did that come together?\n\nOlivia: No, we actually FaceTimed Cash last night, and she's obviously over the moon. Her two best friends not only won, but they won together. And she's, like, losing it, and it's the best thing ever, but she was just like, 'Yo, come to New York on Friday. Everyone's going to be there; you've got to be here.' And we're like, 'Bet. We're on the way.' We don't know what we're doing. We just know we're going.\n\nWeek 5 recap:Why Josh and Shannon left 'Love Island'; Cinco and Cashay reunite\n\nQ: When are you jetting off for Egypt?\n\nKorey: Oh my gosh, I don't know. I'm trying to do it ASAP; I don't know how the COVID stuff is playing into effect. I heard it got crazy while we were away. There's like some … new disease out there.\n\nOlivia: New strain, yes.\n\nKorey: Hopefully — what is this month, August? — maybe like sometime in September? I'm trying to get on it ASAP, live it up while I can.\n\n'I don't think … I realized how many people watch the show'\n\nQ: I'm sure that's an experience in itself, being off of your phone for a month and a half and suddenly turning it on. What were you surprised to see when you turned your phones on?\n\nOlivia: I was just surprised with how many text messages I have. I'm not even going to start going through them because it's overwhelming. But I obviously reached out to the people that, you know, are my family and friends that I miss dearly.\n\nKorey: The same for me, too. It was just the amount of positive comments and the amount of people that were congratulating us. I don't think in the process, like, I realized how many people watch the show. So I'm still in shock over it. I don't think it's hit yet.\n\nQ: I'm sure being on the show is insulating, but it can be in a good way, because you can only focus on interpersonal relationships.\n\nOlivia: It’s so refreshing not having your phone, to be honest. I can't even describe the feeling, but getting the phone back, you definitely feel almost a little bit of a weight. But honestly, it's like the healthiest thing I think I've ever done for myself.\n\nQ: Olivia, what brought you to Scottsdale from Anchorage?\n\nOlivia: So I actually live in Scottsdale more full time, but I wanted to get out of Alaska, truthfully. And I also own my own business that is in Old Town Scottsdale.\n\nI mean, I love Arizona. It's beautiful. I try to convince everyone to move there because I'm like, you literally don't know how great life is unless you live in Arizona where it's summer every day.\n\n'I'm still feeling all the emotions of the villa'\n\nQ: Do you intend to watch your season?\n\nKorey: I heard there was a lot of episodes.\n\nOlivia: It’s a commitment. If you start, you have to binge watch it because even though we know what happens next, it’s like, ‘Whoa, what’s going to happen next?’\n\nPersonally, I don’t think I’m going to watch it for at least a month. I need to detach myself from the emotions. Because I'm still feeling all the emotions of the villa. And I don't know if that's the healthiest thing right now for me to do. But I think we'll watch it.\n\nKorey: Yeah. We'll have a big watch party. I'm sure everyone from the villa will get together and watch it all as one. It might cause some drama, but it'll be fun at the end of the day.\n\nQ: It seemed like there was a lot of tough love for Will Moncada and Kyra Lizama. In your experience, were discussions about their post-Casa Amor relationship really that prevalent, or was that storyline played up in editing?\n\nOlivia: Truthfully, when you're in the villa, you are so focused on yourself, and you have to be, and in your relationships that are growing, so a lot of us really just tried to stay out of it as much as we could and not be too in the mix.\n\nWe trust Kyra and any decision she makes and Will, obviously, as well. And I think that they're honest with each other. They didn't talk about it often, but also after they would talk about the situation, they were very honest and open, and they moved on from it. So there's really nothing to say about that, to be honest. They're good.\n\nQ: I catch myself wondering how reflective a one-hour clip of your day on the show is of what really happened.\n\nKorey: There's pretty much three sides: What you guys see on the TV, what we see and then what Will and Kyra talk about personally.\n\nOlivia and Korey's first impressions of each other\n\nQ: Taking it back to six weeks ago, do you remember what your first impressions of each other were?\n\nOlivia: I will say that I was like, 'Whoa, this boy looks like trouble.' And for me, I didn't know how damaged I truly was, I guess, walking in there, I thought I was healed from my past. And so I had those walls up. So he was the first person, and I was like, 'Absolutely not. Like, I don't want to risk getting hurt,’ but I was like, 'He was fine.'\n\nKorey: She said I was a player. She said I would break her heart. I remember that, but I get it. We've both been through some stuff and I know off of first impressions I probably (was) like what she described, like trouble and everything like that.\n\nSo I wasn't surprised when no one stepped forward for me, to be honest. But I think I just had to just really show who I was as a person, and it worked out.\n\nQ: Don’t judge a book by its cover.\n\nOlivia: It's cool, though, because, he is, you know, a great example of that, exactly. Don't ever judge someone because you have no idea who they are. And that's one of the lessons I've learned, too is just, like, you know, be more empathetic and gentle with people.\n\nAnd I've learned so many lessons from this experience. And it's, like, beautiful.\n\nOlivia on Korey: 'I've never met anyone like you'\n\nQ: You got to know each other so well. Is there anything about your partner that you think will surprise viewers?\n\nOlivia: Well, I don't know they what showed on the show, but this guy parkours off of every elevated surface — and well, if I may add. I'm like, 'OK, like, don't break anything.'\n\nKorey: I just like jumping off of stuff. I don't know why.\n\nOlivia: He's like a big kid, truly, and I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I've never met anyone like you before.'\n\nKorey: And I’ve got ADHD, that’s why. I’m just being too hyper, running through everywhere.\n\nQ: Do you have a least favorite challenge that you did on the show?\n\nOlivia: I would have to say the wedding cake one.\n\nTruly, the cake was so dense, and like, thank God this one took the lead on that, because I'm telling you, I mean, it was so hard to bite through. It was crazy. So it was a mess: up your nose, in your eyelashes, in your ear.\n\nBut we had a fun time doing it, and it's hilarious to look back. We saw some clips. So funny.\n\nKorey: Yeah, I would say that one. The cake one was probably the most disgusting one, like I think I had icing dripping out my ear, just cake batter up my nose. It smelled like curdled milk. Like, old, expired, cake batter or something. But no, it was fun just seeing everyone get dirty like that.\n\nWe killed it by a long shot, I think. I’m pretty sure we definitely had the fastest time.\n\nOlivia: We’re really competitive. Like, we’re so similar it’s crazy.\n\nKorey explains 'What the freak'\n\nQ: ‘What the freak’ — trademark it — where did that come from?\n\nKorey: What the freak, all right, so where it came from is: I just used to say, 'What the f---?' literally, like, a million times a day. I don't like cussing in front of my parents or anything. It started when I was little kid, so I would always say, 'What the freak?'\n\nAnd then that just stuck more than the other one, you know, so I brought it in the villa and everyone just started saying it, so it's crazy that everyone is saying it now.\n\nOlivia: It's so cute. That literally, like, describes who he is, in my opinion, he looks like a hard exterior, but he's just such a gentle, sweet guy.\n\nQ: If you could couple up with someone of the same sex and be a power couple in the villa, who would you choose?\n\nOlivia: I would probably say Josh.\n\nKorey: Oh, opposite sex.\n\nArizona Republic: Oh, I meant same sex, but everything goes.\n\nKorey: Now I know!\n\nOlivia: (Laughs) Me exposing myself! Well, Josh is, like, my best guy friend. I would say for girls, I mean, Cash.\n\nKorey: Obviously, Jeremy. So it only makes it right; he's my best friend. So yeah, I would like to recouple up with Jeremy.\n\nExclusive:Here's why so many Arizonans are on reality shows\n\nWhat's next for Olivia's Scottsdale business, Livbeautifullyaz\n\nQ: People want to know more about your business, Olivia. Are you going back? What should potential future clients know?\n\nOlivia: Yeah, I'm definitely going to get back to work. I love working. It's, like, part of who I am.\n\nI don't know. I mean, I definitely want to take a week just to destress. We're going to New York, (and) like I said, Virginia Beach, and then I'll get back to work in like a month, I would say. But then I might go to Egypt! So I don't know.\n\nReach the reporter at kimi.robinson@gannett.com. Follow her on Twitter @kimirobin and Instagram @ReporterKiMi.\n\nSupport local journalism.

Ted Kennedy set much of the tone when he dramatically claimed of the then-President’s plan to elevate the US appellate court judge: “Robert Bork’s America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, Blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens’ doors in midnight raids.”\n\nAt the hearings, Bork’s right-wing ideology, rather than his intelligence and experience, remained the focus. When asked why he wanted to be a justice, he memorably stressed the “intellectual feast” of it all: “I have spent my life in the intellectual pursuits in the law. And since I’ve been a judge, I particularly like the courtroom. I like the courtroom as an advocate and I like the courtroom as a judge. … (T)hat’s of course the Court that has the most interesting cases and issues, and I think it would be an intellectual feast just to be there and to read the briefs and discuss things with counsel and discuss things with my colleagues.”\n\nBork was defeated 58-42.\n\nClarence Thomas, 1991\n\nClarence Thomas, then nominee for Supreme Court associate justice, responds to questions from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearing in October 1991. Mark Reinstein/Corbis Historical/Getty Images\n\nHe was nominated by President George H.W. Bush to succeed the first Black justice, Thurgood Marshall, who was retiring.\n\nThomas, also African American, underwent two sets of hearings, the first devoted to his substantive record, the second following the sexual harassment accusations of law professor Anita Hill, a former Thomas employee. He categorically denied the charges, declaring to the committee, chaired by then-Sen. Joe Biden, “This is a circus. It’s a national disgrace. And from my standpoint as a Black American, as far as I am concerned, it’s a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves.”\n\nThe Senate confirmed him 52-48, which at that point was the closest Supreme Court confirmation vote in more than a century.\n\nJohn Roberts, 2005\n\nThen-nominee John Roberts answers questions as his wife, Jane Sullivan Roberts (right), watches during his third day of confirmation hearings in September 2005. Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nPresident George W. Bush nominated him to be chief justice upon the death of William Rehnquist, and Roberts’ balls-and-strikes metaphor continues to be evoked by judicial candidates today: “Judges are like umpires,” Roberts told senators. “Umpires don’t make the rules, they apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules, but it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire.”\n\nRoberts was confirmed for chief justice by a 78-22 vote.\n\nSamuel Alito, 2006\n\nThen-nominee Samuel Alito at his last day of confirmation hearings before the Judiciary Committee. Chris Maddaloni/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images\n\nBiden remained an active Senate Judiciary Committee questioner even after he passed on the committee chairmanship, and he brought in a prop for an exchange with Alito. The then-senator was exploring the nominee’s connection to a Princeton alumni group reputed to oppose the admission of women and minorities. Biden first referred to Alito’s Italian-American background and his own Irish Catholic roots.\n\n“I read your opening statement again, where you said that, ‘A generation earlier I think that somebody from my background probably would not have felt fully comfortable at a college like Princeton.’ … That’s how I felt,” said Biden, who went to the University of Delaware for college. Biden then produced a Princeton cap and put it on. “I can wear this hat proudly today,” he said, because the university improved its record of women and minority admissions. Alito told senators he could not recall participating in the controversial group.\n\nThe Senate confirmed him 58-42.\n\nSonia Sotomayor, 2009\n\nThen-nominee Sonia Sotomayor is sworn in during her confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee in July 2009. Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nThe child of Puerto Rican parents was nominated by President Barack Obama as the first Hispanic justice. She drew some controversy for a remark she often made as she spoke to women’s legal groups, that “I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn’t lived that life.”\n\nSome Republicans contended the comment was racist and it began to take on a life of its own. At her hearings, Sotomayor said she wanted to make clear that she was simply trying to inspire Latinas to believe that their life experiences would enrich the legal system. “I want to state upfront and unequivocally and without doubt, I do not believe any ethnic, racial, or gender group has an advantage in sound judging.”\n\nShe was confirmed 68-31.\n\nElena Kagan, 2010\n\nThen-nominee Elena Kagan is sworn in on the first day of her confirmation hearings in June 2010. Scott Andrews/Pool/Getty Images\n\nObama’s second nominee produced one of the lighter memorable exchanges as she was questioned by Sen. Lindsey Graham. The South Carolina Republican began asking her about a failed al Qaeda bomb plot on Christmas Day in 2009. Kagan was wary about where he was heading with his questioning about the man apprehended.\n\n“No,” Graham said, “I just asked you where you were on Christmas.” She rejoined, “You know, like all Jews, I was probably at a Chinese restaurant.” Appreciating the levity, Graham said, “Great answer.”\n\nThe Senate approved Kagan 63-37.\n\nNeil Gorsuch, 2017\n\nThen-nominee Neil Gorsuch arrives for the first day of his Supreme Court confirmation hearing in March 2017. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s first choice for the high court had a record from more than a decade as a US appellate court judge based in Denver, but one case was particularly targeted. It involved a trucker whose rig had broken down in sub-zero temperatures and who, against company rules, unhitched it and drove away to warm up awhile. When the case came before him, Gorsuch interpreted federal law to say the trucker who was fired was not covered by the usual statutory labor protections.\n\nThen-Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, drilled down on the case, identifying with the trucker and describing his plight as “absurd.” Gorsuch said his decision was limited by his interpretation of the law at issue. When pressed by Franken about what he would have done if he had been a trucker, the judge said: “Oh, Senator, I do not know what I would have done if I were in his shoes, and I do not blame him at all for a moment for doing what he did. I empathize with him entirely.”\n\nThe Senate confirmed Gorsuch 54-45.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh, 2018\n\nThen-nominee Brett Kavanaugh testifies to the committee in 2018. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nThis Trump nominee, like Thomas, had two sets of hearings, the second prompted by a sexual assault claim raised by psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford, dating to their teenage years living in the Washington, DC, suburbs.\n\nKavanaugh categorically denied the claim and told the committee, “This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups. This is a circus. The consequences will extend long past my nomination. The consequences will be with us for decades. This grotesque and coordinated character assassination will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country. And as we all know, in the United States political system of the early 2000s, what goes around comes around. I am an optimistic guy, I always try to be on the sunrise side of the mountain, to be optimistic about the day that is coming, but today I have to say that I fear for the future.”\n\nThe Senate confirmed him 50-48.\n\nAmy Coney Barrett, 2020\n\nThen-nominee Amy Coney Barrett holds up her notepad at the request of Sen. John Cornyn on the second day of her confirmation hearing. Tom Williams/Pool/Getty Images\n\nGraham chaired the Judiciary Committee hearings for Trump’s third nominee and declared at the outset, “This is the first time in American history that we’ve nominated a woman who’s unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology.”\n\nBarrett, a former Notre Dame law professor, had been vocal regarding her Catholic faith and opposition to abortion rights. In her own testimony, Barrett said she had “no agenda” regarding the reversal of the Supreme Court’s abortion rights precedent dating to the 1973 Roe v. Wade. Barrett testified without notes and, at the urging of Sen. John Cornyn, held up the blank notepad that was on the desk before her. “That’s impressive,” the Texas Republican said.\n\nThe Senate confirmed her 52-48.", "authors": ["Joan Biskupic"], "publish_date": "2022/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/main-street/whats-going-there/2023/04/17/jersey-shore-big-chain-restaurants-missing-monmouth-ocean/70089083007/", "title": "Jersey Shore big chain restaurants missing in Monmouth, Ocean ...", "text": "Restaurant chains are attracted to New Jersey's wealth and crowded population.\n\nBut that's not enough.

For a cafe, it may be important to be on the side of the road where people are driving to work. A fast food place with a drive-thru might look for a location on the side of the highway busiest on the drive home.\n\n\"It enhances your opportunity to do the business because you are being seen,\" Lanyard said. \"You are not only being seen, but you are really in a convenient location.\"\n\nWhat's Going There?Fort Hancock at Sandy Hook getting a tavern.

They have to choose the right location so it does not fail.\"\n\nWhy might a hot restaurant brand stay away? Maybe there's too much competition; they can't find the right site or they were out-positioned by a competitor, Medvin said.

Parks, a Black seamstress and activist who refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in 1955, was convicted of violating racial segregation laws. King, who helped lead the resulting Montgomery Bus Boycott, paid a $500 fine after being convicted in 1956 of violating a law banning boycotts. Parks refused to pay her $10 fine, and she and King went on to become icons of racial justice and the modern civil rights movement. Yet their cases remain on the books, said civil rights attorney Fred Gray, who represented both. Montgomery County District Attorney Daryl Bailey said he would generally support a move to expunge the arrest records of King and Parks, but he’d need to see details of any such request before responding in court. Colvin asked a court last week to remove records stemming her from arrest and conviction after she refused to move to the back of a bus in 1955 in Montgomery, before Parks did the same. Now 82, Colvin – who was a 15-year-old high school student when she was convicted of assaulting an officer during her arrest and declared delinquent – isn’t sure such an effort would be possible since there was so much injustice for so long. “That would take a hundred years, maybe 200 years to go through the court system,” she said. “You could never finish it.”\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: Twelve bears have been killed in the city this year, including four last week, that were deemed dangers to life and property, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reports. The southeast Alaska city “has a garbage problem,” Stephen Bethune, a wildlife biologist with the state Department of Fish and Game, told the local Assembly recently. “Neither I or any of my agency colleagues like killing bears or the labor that ensues but will continue to do so as necessary,” he said. “However, removing bears from the population only serves to treat the symptom and fails to cure the root problem. ... That problem can be linked directly to Sitka’s current garbage disposal system and the unwillingness or inability of some members of the public to properly store trash.” He urged the use of bear-resistant trash cans and told the newspaper he would encourage the use of electric fences to help deter bears. Teal West owns a car damaged by bears last month. “My back trim and my back bumper were basically ripped off my car,” West said. “I taped the bumper back on, but I’m looking at around $6,000 worth of damage.” Bethune said he hopes the tension with bears in town eases soon. “Hopefully in the next couple weeks they’ll disappear, go up into the hills for the winter,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: Conservationists and state officials say the popularity of Oak Creek Canyon, near Sedona, has created some real ecological problems for the corridor. A group of Arizona Conservation Corps members recently completed the second phase of a project that officials hope will rehabilitate many areas hit hard by visitors, improve water quality in the creek, and protect habitat for the threatened narrow-headed garter snake, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. A collaboration among the AZCC, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, the National Forest Foundation and the Coconino National Forest’s Red Rock District, among other groups, the project seeks to close hundreds of unofficial social trails that crisscross the area between the highway and the creek. Large rocks have been stacked under a fence. Guardrails installed along 89A have limited roadside parking spots that led visitors to cut more and more new trails. Teams have installed low fencing and placed thick blankets of cut juniper limbs along the edge of pull-offs. And they’ve improved about 40 trails in an effort to leave direct pathways to the creek, reducing erosion and making them safer. Over the last year, AZCC crews have addressed nearly 200 social trails along the creek corridor, said Ron Tiller, a Department of Environmental Quality scientist. In one area, he said, they cataloged 47 individual trails visitors had cut within just a quarter-mile stretch. The foot traffic increases erosion of sediment into the creek and often contributes to outbreaks of E. coli as human waste left by visitors is swept into the water.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: Jim Bob Duggar, whose large family was featured in the TLC reality show “19 Kids and Counting,” has announced he’s running for a seat in the state Senate. Duggar, who previously served in the state House, announced Friday on the family’s Facebook page that he’s running for the northwest Arkansas district that includes Springdale. Last week, Republican state Sen. Lance Eads resigned the seat to take a job in the private sector. A special election will be called to fill the term. TLC pulled “19 Kids and Counting” in 2015 over revelations that Duggar’s son Josh had molested four of his sisters and a babysitter. His parents said he confessed to the fondling and apologized. Josh Duggar has also apologized for his pornography addiction and for cheating on his wife. Josh Duggar is set to go to trial in federal court in November on two counts of downloading and possessing child pornography. He faces up to 20 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 on each count if convicted. A longtime family spokesman, Chad Gallagher, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that no family “is immune from tragedy, heartbreak or impact from the decisions of the ones they love.” He added that it’s “important to note that Josh is a grown adult.” Jim Bob Duggar, who was born and raised in Springdale, and his wife, Michelle, have 20 children and 22 grandchildren.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A $650 million plan would give the Los Angeles Zoo a theme park-style transformation over the next 20 years. The city-owned zoo in the city’s Griffith Park area would get exhibit upgrades and new attractions such as a 60-foot-deep canyon for rock climbing and a hilltop building called the California Center in the style of a Yosemite National Park lodge with a sweeping view of a 25,000-square-foot vineyard, the Los Angeles Times reports. Supporters of the zoo’s “20-year Vision Plan” said building the features would increase zoo attenance by 72%, to up to 3 million visitors annually. But the construction would consume 23 acres of native woodlands, drawing opposition led by the historical preservation group Friends of Griffith Park and the California Native Plant Society. Zoo officials were thinking about the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games as they crafted the plan, said Denise Verrett, the zoo’s director and chief executive. The renovation would happen in seven phases starting next year and would be funded by grants and donations raised by the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association, a nonprofit support group, and possibly a bond issue, according to the Times. The next step for the proposal is consideration by the Los Angeles City Council’s Arts, Parks, Health, Education, and Neighborhoods Committee.\n\nColorado\n\nBrighton: Three police officers and two paramedics indicted on manslaughter and other charges in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain appeared in court for the first time Monday since being charged. Officers Randy Roedema, Nathan Woodyard and Jason Rosenblatt and fire department paramedic Jeremy Cooper and fire Lt. Peter Cichuniec each took turns standing before Judge Priscilla Loew with their lawyers in a courtroom in Brighton. As McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain, watched from the gallery with her lawyers, each waived a reading of the charges and penalties they face. None was asked to speak. McClain, a 23-year-old Black man, died after being put into a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative in a fatal encounter in the Denver suburb of Aurora that provoked a national outcry during racial injustice protests last year. He never regained consciousness and was later declared brain-dead at a hospital. While the former district attorney said he could not file charges because an autopsy could not determine how McClain died, the officers and paramedics were indicted by a grand jury this summer over a year after Gov. Jared Polis ordered state Attorney General Phil Weiser to open a criminal investigation into the case.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: With the legalization of recreational cannabis for adults and the impending start of retail sales in the state next year, several coastal towns are saying no, for now. Guilford, Madison and North Branford recently put in place measures that stop cannabis establishments from opening for nine months to a year from now, and Clinton has made it unlawful for any building, structure or land to be used as a cannabis establishment, producer, retailer or dispensary, the New Haven Register reports. The law signed in June by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont law allows individuals ages 21 and older to possess or consume up to 1.5 ounces of “cannabis plant material” and up to 5 ounces in a locked container in a home or in the trunk or locked glove box in the person’s vehicle. Retail sales of recreational cannabis in Connecticut are not expected to begin until summer 2022 at the earliest. Clinton town manager Karl Kilduff told the Register that at a public hearing in September on the issue, 15 of 17 people spoke against allowing cannabis establishments in the town. The town’s police chief also expressed concern about a “black market” developing alongside the legal market.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The University of Delaware has introduced new safety measures following student protests that criticized the school’s delayed action after a student was charged with attacking his ex-girlfriend, also a UD student, on Oct. 8. The security initiatives, which went into effect last week, include an expanded safety escort program, a new nighttime shuttle service and a reevaluation of the blue light phone system that connects students to police. “The safety of our community is our top concern and we’ll be actively driving improvement of all available resources for our students to address that priority head on,” John Long, the university’s executive vice president and chief operating officer, said in a statement. Long, who oversees the units in charge of campus safety, said he worked with President Dennis Assanis and other campus leaders to develop the new pilot programs. He said they are specifically focused on students going to and from their residences. University police officers will now have a golf cart to drive students to and from on-campus residences, according to the announcement. Those in nearby off-campus housing can take a shuttle from four on-campus locations. Both programs will run from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m., seven days a week. Students can request rides using the LiveSafe app or by calling 831-RIDE.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A George Washington University fraternity house was broken into and vandalized, with a Jewish text desecrated, WUSA-TV reports. George Washington University Police are investigating the incident in which a Torah scroll at Tau Kappa Epsilon was destroyed. The crime happened Saturday and was discovered Sunday morning, according to a police report. “Our entire chapter is outraged and saddened by the blatant act of antisemitism against our brothers,” the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity said in a statement on Instagram. The fraternity said it is cooperating with police and the Anti-Defamation League. In a tweet, the ADL’s D.C. regional office said it was disturbed by the incident and said officials were in touch with students and the campus police. “We expect a full and rapid investigation,” the ADL said. University President Thomas LeBlanc issued a statement late Sunday saying George Washington University Police is working with D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department to find who is responsible. “I want to be clear: I condemn all such acts of antisemitism and all forms of hatred, discrimination, and bias in our community. Any act of antisemitism is an attack on the entire GW community and cannot, and will not, be tolerated,” LeBlanc said in the statement.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The University of Florida is prohibiting three professors from providing expert testimony in a lawsuit challenging a new law that critics claim restricts voting rights, saying it goes against the school’s interest by conflicting with the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis. Though the decision is being criticized as threat to academic freedom and free speech, the university said in a statement Saturday that allowing professors Dan Smith, Michael McDonald and Sharon Austin to serve as paid experts for plaintiffs challenging the law would be “adverse to the university’s interests as a state of Florida institution.” Lawyers for a coalition of civic groups challenging the law said in court papers Friday that the professors were told by the university that their expert testimony would dissent from the DeSantis administration, creating a conflict for the school. Attorneys for the professors said Saturday that they would take legal action claiming violations of the First Amendment and academic freedom if the school doesn’t reverse the decision. “The university cannot silence the professors on matters of great public importance. These professors are citizens entitled to participate in the marketplace of ideas,” attorneys Paul Donnelly and Conor Flynn said in a letter to a university lawyer. “These unlawful restrictions are shameful, and could very well deter top scholars from joining UF’s ranks.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A large spider native to East Asia has spun its thick, golden web on power lines, porches and vegetable patches all over north Georgia this year – a proliferation that has driven some unnerved homeowners indoors and prompted a flood of anxious social media posts. In metro Atlanta, self-described arachnophobe Jennifer Turpin stopped blowing leaves in her yard after inadvertently walking into a web created by the Joro spider. Stephen Carter has avoided a walking trail along the Chattahoochee River where he encountered Joro webs every dozen steps. Farther east in Winterville, Will Hudson’s front porch became unusable amid an abundance of Joro webs 10 feet deep. Hudson estimates he’s killed more than 300 of the spiders on his property. “The webs are a real mess,” said Hudson, an entomologist at the University of Georgia. “Nobody wants to come out of the door in the morning, walk down the steps and get a face full of spider web.” The Joro – Trichonephila clavata – is part of a group of spiders known as orb weavers for their highly organized, wheel-shaped webs. Common in Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan, Joro females have colorful yellow, blue and red markings on their bodies. They can measure 3 inches across when their legs are fully extended. Hudson is convinced they will spread across the South.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Lava continues to pour out of Kilauea’s summit crater, more than a month after the latest eruption began at the Hawaii volcano. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said Friday that lava was emerging from a single vent inside Halemaumau Crater. The eruption is contained within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and isn’t threatening any homes. Nightime aerial video shot from a helicopter shows lava gushing from a vent and spreading across the crater floor. Kilauea is one of the world’s most active volcanoes. It has erupted dozens of times since 1952. The latest eruption began inside the crater Sept. 29. In 2018, the volcano erupted from vents within a residential neighborhood. That episode sent streams of lava across the Puna district of the Big Island, destroying farms and more than 700 homes.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Instances of hoarding, illegal reselling and bad behavior by customers have caused the state agency that sells alcohol to change how it rolls out rare spirits at stores, officials said. The Idaho State Liquor Division late last month announced new rules involving rare but highly sought-after bourbons, whiskeys and other small-batch liquor offerings. That combination has resulted in what the agency calls unsavory behavior by some customers that includes harassment of store workers. The new rules mean the agency will now sporadically allocate rare products across its 67 retail outlets to create what it calls a “treasure hunt” approach. The agency also has stopped listing rare-product inventory on its website and will only sell alcohol visible on store shelves. The changes follow reports of shoppers getting “very aggressive with these products,” Tony Faraca, the Idaho State Liquor Division’s chief financial officer, told The Idaho Statesman. “We know that there is a lot of hoarding going on,” he said. “We know that there are illegal secondary sales going on. Our store employees are being harassed by these whiskey groups. It’s causing a lot of stress and turmoil with our staff.” He said some groups try to buy up rare bottles that have limits of one per customer. Some customers, armed with inventory details, have tried to persuade employees to go into storage and dig through unopened boxes. Now that the agency has stopped sharing inventory details, “our hope is that more people will get to partake in the rare product,” Faraca said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A judge on Monday suspended a Dec. 31 deadline for the city’s police officers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 but didn’t interfere with a requirement that they be regularly tested for the coronavirus. Disputes over vaccinations should be handled as a labor grievance with an arbitrator, Cook County Judge Raymond Mitchell said. “The effect of this order is to send these parties back to the bargaining table and to promote labor peace by allowing them to pursue” remedies under Illinois law, Mitchell said. The grievance process could last months, the city said last week. Officers who haven’t been vaccinated still must be tested twice a week under city policy. Officers also can lose work and pay if they don’t disclose their vaccine status. “The principal risk to those who are unvaccinated is to themselves and to others who choose to be unvaccinated,” the judge said. Police Superintendent David Brown last week said 70% had disclosed their vaccination status, and 80% of those officers reported being vaccinated. Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration announced the vaccine policy weeks ago, drawing sharp objections from police union leaders. The judge noted that COVID-19 has killed many officers nationwide. “In light of that terrible sacrifice, the police unions’ request just to have their grievances heard seems a pretty modest task,” Mitchell said.\n\nIndiana\n\nConnersville: A fire that badly damaged a Black City Council member’s home is being investigated by the FBI after a racial slur was found spray-painted at the house. The fire broke out about 3:30 a.m. Friday at the home of Connersville City Councilman Tommy Williams, who is Black, while his wife said the couple and their two sons were away on vacation. The racial slur was painted on the back patio, and FBI agents spent Saturday at the house, Emma Williams said. FBI Special Agent Steve Secor confirmed Monday that the agency was working with state and local authorities investigating the fire in the 13,000-person city about 50 miles east of Indianapolis. Secor said no suspects had been immediately identified. Williams said she had no idea who would attack her family in this way, and she was forgiving whoever is responsible. “I’m grateful for our community,” Williams told WXIN-TV. “We have really good people here, and I don’t want this to be a message that represents our village here because it’s a lie. It’s not what we’re about here.” Tommy Williams, a retired U.S. Postal Service worker and Army veteran, was elected by a Republican caucus last year to fill a City Council vacancy. An online fundraiser had collected more than $30,000 on Monday to assist the family’s recovery.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: Beef, chicken, bread, fruit and vegetables, and paper products are among items school districts are struggling to get so they can provide varied and quality meals to students. Schools are making changes to their breakfast and lunch menus “nearly weekly” to account for items that are delayed or unavailable, said Alison Demory, Iowa City schools’ nutrition services director. “If we saw the light at the end of the tunnel, we might feel a little better,” Demory told the Cedar Rapids Gazette. “I’ve heard this isn’t going to go away any time soon.” Staffing shortages at food manufacturers and distributors are making it challenging to make and transport enough products to meet the demand, Demory said. Some items can be ordered only in a limited quantity, which may not meet the needs of the Iowa City district. “If we can only order two cases of a product at a time, that’s a problem,” Demory said. Instead of providing individual bags of chips, the district is purchasing bulk orders and portioning them out to students, which requires more preparation, Demory said, giving an example of how the supply chain shortages can cause more work down the line. Cedar Rapids schools have had to substitute products but are able to offer similar items to “maintain the quality and integrity of our meals,” said Jennifer Hook, Cedar Rapids schools’ food and nutrition department manager.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A first-year state lawmaker, who was reprimanded by his colleagues for abusive conduct before taking office, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence. Democratic state Rep. Aaron Coleman of Kansas City remained in custody Sunday afternoon, according to Johnson County Jail records. The 21-year-old was arrested Saturday evening by Overland Park police on a domestic battery charge. Police didn’t immediately respond to messages Sunday, and calls to Coleman’s cellphone rang unanswered Sunday. Coleman is not married, and details of his domestic situation were not immediately available. It wasn’t immediately clear what consequences Coleman might face in the House after his arrest. He was being held without bond ahead of a court appearance scheduled for Monday. “Given what little we know about the situation, I am concerned for everyone involved,” Speaker of the House Ron Ryckman told the Kansas City Star. “I know that law enforcement will thoroughly investigate and assess the situation so that we can take appropriate action.” House Democratic Leader Tom Sawyer said Coleman should resign. “This is extremely disturbing news. We are watching closely to make sure we gather all the facts,” Sawyer said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The state’s workers are taking a cue from country crooner Johnny Paycheck, telling their employers to “take this job and shove it.” And they’re doing so at a rate higher than any other state in the country. In August, 84,000 Kentuckians quit their jobs – a 26,000-person increase from the number who quit in July, according to the State Job Openings and Labor Turnover report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the mass exodus of workers in Kentucky, the commonwealth has the nation’s highest quit rate, the total number of workers who quit during an entire month as a percent of total employment. In Kentucky, the quit rate was 4.5% as of August – a 1.4% increase from the month prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The states with the next-highest quit rates were Georgia and Idaho, with rates of 4.2% and 4.1%, respectively. But there is a glimmer of hope for the commonwealth: 103,000 Kentuckians were hired in August 2021, with a hire rate of 5.5%, the fifth-highest of any state and 1.2% higher than the national average. Gov. Andy Beshear said during a recent press conference that “our challenges in the labor market are complex” but that “there’s some really good things going on right now,” and “people ought to feel more hope than concern.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state is continuing its “Shot for $100” COVID-19 vaccine incentive program through November, hoping to persuade more people to get the shots by offering them money. More than 19,000 people have received a Visa cash card through the effort so far. The program aimed at college students started in August. Gov. John Bel Edwards expanded it in October to cover anyone getting newly vaccinated. The state Department of Health said 5- to 11-year-olds will be eligible if federal officials sign off on a vaccine for the children and if their parents give consent for them to get immunized. “Thanks to many Louisianans working together, the fourth surge is behind us, but in order to help avoid another surge we need many more of our people to get vaccinated,” Edwards, a Democrat, said in a statement. “This is how we’re going to put this pandemic behind us and protect our loved ones and our communities.” To be eligible, people must use one of the community-based vaccination sites listed on ShotFor100.com. A person may only participate once in the program. After getting the shot, those participating receive the gift card and must register it online so it will be loaded with $100. More information is available on the website or by calling Louisiana’s vaccine hotline at 1-855-453-0774.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The battle over a 145-mile electricity transmission line is the most expensive ballot-question campaign in the state’s history. More than $90 million from utilities has flowed into the fight over the $1 billion project funded by ratepayers in Massachusetts that supporters say would remove carbon from the environment and provide needed electricity. The high-stakes campaign put environmental and conservation groups at odds and pitted utilities backing the project against operators of fossil fuel-powered plants that stand to lose money. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who supports the project, made a last-minute pitch over the weekend for bold action against climate change. “We just can’t afford just to do nothing,” she said. A ballot question Tuesday will let Maine voters have their say. The project has received all the necessary permits, and construction began 10 months ago. But a court ruling called into question a state lease for a 1-mile section. More litigation is expected regardless of the outcome of the vote. Lewiston Mayor Mark Cayer said he doesn’t understand the opposition, noting that the new sections are being built in working forests that have been logged repeatedly over the years.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The process of recognizing saints in Catholicism can take generations, but the church can accelerate matters when it wants, as it did in the cases of Mother Teresa of Calcutta and Pope John Paul II, waiving a five-year waiting period after their deaths to get the process started. Now a group of Baltimore Catholics says it’s time to expedite the cases of six other heroes of the faith. Parishioners of St. Ann’s Catholic Church, a predominantly African American congregation, and the two other churches in its pastorate, Historic St. Francis Xavier and St. Wenceslaus, seek to make the case that the church should immediately canonize six Black American Catholics. Those include Mother Mary Lange, a Baltimore nun who started and ran a school for Black children during the era of slavery. They supporters planned to use a special Mass at St. Ann’s on Monday night to advocate for the cause, and organizers have said they’ll also use the All Saints’ Day service to launch a national letter-writing campaign to Pope Francis. Also among the proposed candidates are a Haitian American former slave, Pierre Toussaint, who went on to became a successful business owner and philanthropist, and Mississippi-born scholar-evangelist Thea Bowman. They had to overcome so much racism inside and outside the church during their lives that their cases should be viewed as exceptional, said Ralph E. Moore Jr., a St. Ann’s member helping to lead the effort. The church has never made a Black American Catholic a saint.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nOrleans: The Coast Guard and other authorities were searching off the coast of Cape Cod on Monday for a small plane that failed to arrive as scheduled Sunday night, officials said. The Piper PA-28 that departed from Reading, Pennsylvania, was reported missing about 10 p.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. It was headed to Chatham Municipal Airport in Massachusetts. One person was on board the plane, the Coast Guard said in a tweet. The original call was made to the Air Force Regional Command Center by a concerned friend who was waiting for the aircraft in Chatham. The Air Force then contacted the Coast Guard. The aircraft’s last transmitted transponder signal was at 6:49 p.m. descending at 4,000 feet per minute. The search taking place off Nauset Beach in Orleans involved a Coast Guard fixed-wing aircraft and a helicopter and three Coast Guard vessels, as well as area harbormasters and other assets, the Coast Guard said. No information about the plane’s occupant was released.\n\nMichigan\n\nMackinaw City: Business owners on Mackinac Island are celebrating a big rebound in tourism this year after fewer visitors made the journey to the island in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Many visitors discovered the iconic carless-island getaway for the first time this year, said business owners on the island, which sits in the Straits of Mackinac separating Michigan’s upper and lower peninsulas. Chris Shepler, a third-generation operator of Shepler’s Ferry, which shuttles visitors to Mackinac Island, said the summer “was out of control” for the ferry service. “Absolutely crazy. We set records for our all-time busiest summer in the history of our company,” he said. Through Sept. 1, the island’s overall hotel room revenue for the 2021 season was on pace to smash the record year it saw in 2019, when revenue topped $74.56 million, said Tim Hygh, executive director of the Mackinac Island Tourism Bureau. Final data is still be crunched for 2021, he said. “It came after vaccinations, and people were so eager to travel. The market found us,” Hygh said. As everything closes up for the season on the island known for its hiking, biking and horse-drawn carriage rides, Mackinac Island Mayor Margaret Doud said she’s cautious but hopeful about what 2022 may hold. “I look forward to moving out of the pandemic, but we are still in a pandemic,” said Doud, who is often found at the front desk of the iconic Windermere Hotel.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Those who monitor voting access for people with disabilities say the state generally does a good job on the issue, but it’s not without challenges. Minnesota Council on Disability ADA Director David Fenley said while barriers still persist, the state provides good general access for voters with different disabilities. Polling stations are equipped with an accessible voting machine for people with vision impairments, with many counties using an electronic ballot marker machine called AutoMARK. “Just say, ‘Hey, where’s your AutoMARK? I need an accessible voting machine,’ ” he advised. Grace Gouker Littlefield, executive director at a new Minnesota-based organization called Able to Vote, is working to connect people with voting resources. Littlefield said she wants to see more disabled voters like herself with equal access across the country, starting in her own backyard this fall, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. A chat feature on AbleToVote.org connects staff to people who need assistance finding transportation to the polls, coming up with a voting plan or reporting an accessibility barrier. “Just understand that the lives of people with disabilities can be very complex,” Littlefield said. “And this process should not be political, even though people are voting for political offices sometimes.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city will soon start installing larger water pipes to replace some of the lines that failed during a deep freeze that struck the Deep South in February. WLBT-TV reports 48-inch cast iron water transmission lines have been arriving in south Jackson. City engineer Charles Williams said officials gave the order last week to proceed with the final phase of the project, which involves laying 2 miles of pipes in the area. The work will connect water transmission lines from the O.B. Curtis Treatment Plant to south Jackson. They will replace 24-inch pipes that failed to provide adequate water pressure from the plant during the winter storm. Thousands of Jackson residents lost water service for weeks after the storm, and those with running water had to boil it because of the danger of contamination when pressure is low. “We’re actually placing a new water main service, and then we’ll be taking off some of the existing service lines that are in the area that are smaller and tie it into that 48,” Williams said. “So the improved capacity will help improve water pressure and also limit disruptions of service due to failed water mains.” The $8 million project is funded through federal money. Installation of the new pipes is expected to be complete by March 2023, depending on weather.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: One of the leaders of a St. Louis charter school has been appointed to the State Board of Education by Gov. Mike Parson. Kerry Casey will begin serving on the state board immediately, the governor’s office said Monday. Her term will run until July 1, 2027, if she is confirmed by the state Senate. The State Board of Education oversees Missouri’s 518 public school districts, 37 charter schools, and state schools for the blind, deaf and severely disabled. Casey, of Chesterfield, was a founding board member of the KIPP Charter School and continues to serve on its board. She also is vice president for global sales at Exegy, a financial markets data company. She replaces Victor Lenz of St. Louis, whose term on the State Board of Education expired in July 2019. Missouri law allows board members to continue serving until the governor appoints a replacement. Lenz had been serving as the board’s vice president. Two other board members also are serving on expired terms: President Charlie Shields of St. Joseph, whose term expired in July 2020, and Donald Claycomb of Linn, whose term expired this past July.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s redistricting commission delayed a decision on a map dividing the state into congressional districts after an all-day meeting Saturday. The commission failed to reach a consensus on the map proposals it was considering, instead kicking the decision until after receiving more public comments this week as it speeds toward a Nov. 14 deadline. The two Democrats on the commission pushed to approve a map they had proposed that would divide the state into an eastern and western district and place Kalispell, a Republican stronghold in the northwest corner of the state, in the eastern district. That map would give Democrats a fighting shot at winning in the western district despite the state’s increasingly red political hue. But the map faced opposition from Republican members of the commission, who are against placing the mountain community of Kalispell in an eastern district dominated by prairieland and agricultural communities. Commission Chair Maylinn Smith, who was appointed by the state’s Supreme Court, said she could not break the tie in favor of a proposal by Democrats or Republicans before receiving additional public comment on a new proposal submitted by the Republican members of the commission just two days before the meeting.\n\nNebraska\n\nBridgeport: One small western Nebraska county is using roughly half the federal coronavirus aid money it is set to receive for bonuses of up to $10,000 each for county employees. Morrill County officials approved the bonuses in August as hazard pay for the county’s roughly 50 employees, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The county is set to receive about $900,000 from the federal program. Most of the state’s 92 other counties are still deciding how to spend the roughly $376 million they will share from the American Rescue Plan Act, but the Morrill County attorney and officials with the Nebraska Association of County Officials say using the money for premium pay is allowed. Jon Cannon, the executive director of the counties group, said he’s telling officials not to rush to spend the money because they have until the end of 2024 to decide what to use it for. Morrill County officials said the bonuses were warranted because of the work employees did throughout the pandemic, which included keeping the courthouse in Bridgeport open the entire time. “There were a lot of things you couldn’t use it for,” said Jeff Metz, of Angora, chairman of the three-member Morrill County Board. “We ran across that one of the allowable expenses was hazard pay. We felt that fit with what we were trying to do.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The return this week of a big automotive products trade show is expected to draw as many as 100,000 people to the Las Vegas Convention Center, tourism and event officials said. The Specialty Equipment Market Association show, commonly known as SEMA, opens Tuesday, after being canceled last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. It runs through Thursday, followed by a public event Friday dubbed “SEMA Ignited” in the convention center parking area. A companion event, the Automotive Aftermarket Products Expo, will be held at the Sands Expo and Convention Center – part of what the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority dubs Automotive Aftermarket Industry Week. SEMA represents a multibillion-dollar automotive aftermarket industry and has been held in Las Vegas since 1977, when it moved from the Anaheim Convention Center in California. Electric vehicles will be featured this year, and convention attendees will be able to ride Tesla vehicles in the nearly 1-mile underground people-mover built between convention center stops by Elon Musk’s The Boring Co. SEMA executive Tom Gattuso told the Las Vegas Review-Journal the show this year has 51,000 registered buyers and could host 100,000 industry professionals.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLincoln: A company that offers old-fashioned train rides along Lake Winnipesaukee and the Pemigewasset River says it won’t operate its annual Santa Express Trains this season because of rising COVID-19 cases in the state. The Hobo & Winnipesaukee Scenic Railroad said in news release Monday that it hopes to offer the holiday trips, during which participants meet Santa and Mrs. Claus, next year. The Santa Express trains run from Lincoln. The railroad still plans to reopen for its regular season next year in mid-May. “The railroad had planned to make Santa Express Train tickets available in early November, but due to COVID-19 positivity rates trending upward, we felt it best to hold off on ticket sales due to the surrounding uncertainty,” railroad manager Benjamin Clark said. Last week, Dr. Benjamin Chan, the state epidemiologist, said New Hampshire continues to have a high or substantial level of community transmission, averaging 500 to 550 new infections per day with a coronavirus test positivity rate around 6%.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Calls for help to a statewide children’s mental health hotline have increased compared to last year as parents seek help, especially during the morning hours, according to the commissioner of the Department for Children and Families. The overall call volume to the Children’s System of Care increased, with the most calls coming from parents as their children experience stress before school hours, Commissioner Christine Norbut Beyer said during a state COVID-19 briefing. “Getting adjusted to something as simple as taking the bus can be stressful,” she said, referring to behavioral and emotional challenges faced by K-12 students returning to in-person school after a year of hybrid or remote learning as “a pandemic of mental health.” It is typical to see a rise in mental health reporting from K-12 students during the month of October, when educators become familiar with their students and are able to assist parents in reporting complaints and concerns. But this year, the uptick in calls occurred in September, with more than 10,000 calls, peaking in the morning, and particularly on Monday mornings, said Jason Butkowski, a DCF representative. Such calls in the morning usually have to do with school-avoidant behavior.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nBernalillo: Town officials deny wrongdoing in the installation of a hidden surveillance camera in a police office used by a now-former police sergeant who says her expectation of privacy was violated. An attorney for Monica Torres has formally notified the town that Torres intends to file a lawsuit alleging violation of a state law requiring consent from at least one person in a recording, KRQE-TV reports. Video obtained by KRQE shows a town worker installing the video camera in an air conditioning vent under the direction of Bernalillo Police Department Chief Broderick Sharp and a police lieutenant when Torres was on vacation in November 2020. “I freaked out,” Torres recalled to KRQE about when an office visitor spotted the camera a week or two later. “I had changed (clothes) numerous times in there.” KRQE reports it obtained records of a New Mexico State Police investigation prompted by a complaint by Torres. Video from the hidden camera showed a male sergeant shutting the door to change clothes inside the office, KRQE reports. The State Police investigation ended by concluding that no crime had been found. The matter was submitted to the District Attorney’s Office of the 13th Judicial District for review. That office said a special prosecutor would decide whether to file charges.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A giant red heart sculpture installed last week in Central Park as a tribute to health care workers and COVID-19 victims has been taken down – an apparent casualty of confusion and red tape. Italian sculptor Sergio Furnari said he was walking by the park Thursday afternoon with friends when he noticed that his “Heroes Heart Monument” was gone. When he went to file a police report, he said, he was bounced from police station to police station until a police officer on Friday showed him video of people removing the 10-foot-tall, 3,000-pound monument and placing it on a truck. “They literally broke my heart,” he said. Furnari conceded he did not have a permit to place the heart in the park but considered a $4,000 grant he received from New York City’s government to be his permit for the temporary installation. He said he considered the removal of his memorial “an abuse of power.” A message seeking comment was left with the Central Park Conservancy, the nonprofit that manages the park on behalf of the city. Furnari said he planned to go to the organization Monday to find out what happened to his heart. Furnari said he wanted the sculpture to be a place for emotional and spiritual solace in the bustling city and not just a popular spot for selfies, though he said he was cool with that, too.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGreensboro: Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones has urged supporters of public education to organize to fight “anti-history laws” being promoted by Republican lawmakers. Hannah-Jones said the left hasn’t gotten “mad enough” in opposing the “culture war that has been contrived by the right wing” that has led to laws banning schools from teaching things such as her 1619 Project. She said at an online forum of North Carolina educators last week that people are living in “dark and scary times” in which teachers are “afraid to even teach and talk about the experiences that their children are having.” “We’re being outgunned right now, and I think that’s because this is not an issue that’s getting enough of the people on the left angry,” Hannah-Jones said. “People on the right are very angry, and anger is often what inspires you to organize and to push for laws and to push for these changes.” Hannah-Jones was the keynote speaker Tuesday at the Color of Education Summit, a two-day virtual event drawing 1,600 people “to engage in critical conversations centered on addressing issues of racial equity and education.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Paleontologists have given the name “Beautiful Nightmare” to a rare dinosaur fossil thought to be the only partial skull of its species found in North Dakota. “She is a beautiful example of her species, and she was a nightmare in her day to a lot of other critters,” said Fossil Excavators President Mike Kjelland, an assistant professor of biology at Mayville State University. The specimen, which includes an upper jawbone and lower teeth, is thought to be a Nanotyrannus, closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex. Only five Nano partial skulls have been found in the world, though there is debate about whether the fossils are instead of juvenile T. rex, Kjelland said. Researchers uncovered the Nano and myriad other fossils – some rare and potentially new species – on private land at a remote Badlands canyon Kjelland found two years ago near Bowman while looking for the fossil-rich Hell Creek Formation. The site comprises an ancient river channel and sandbar. The fossils, which date to 66 million to 69 million years ago, represent a diverse array of creatures from the Late Cretaceous, including two notable Triceratops skulls that drew national attention, The Bismarck Tribune reports.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A concealed weapons permit would become optional, and the requirement that individuals “promptly” notify police officers they are carrying a concealed weapon would be eliminated, under proposed legislation in the state House. The bill is similar to a measure pending in the state Senate and one of several GOP-backed proposals in recent years seeking to expand gun rights in Ohio. The concealed weapons bill, dubbed “Constitutional Carry” by its backers, is sponsored by Republican Reps. Tom Brinker of Cincinnati and Kris Jordan of Ostrander. Gun owners could still apply for a concealed weapons permit under the measure, allowing those who obtain it to carry a concealed weapon in states with reciprocity agreements recognizing such permits. The GOP-controlled House Government Oversight Committee approved the bill along party lines last week. The concept has the backing of the Buckeye Firearms Association, which says 21 other states allow people to carry a concealed weapon without a license. Gun control groups such as Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America oppose it, along with law enforcement groups. Rep. Paula Hicks-Hudson, D-Toledo, said the bill has been rushed with little time for discussion and would make Ohio less safe.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Pardon and Parole Board on Monday recommended Gov. Kevin Stitt spare the life of death row inmate Julius Jones, whose murder conviction for the 1999 killing of an Edmond businessman has drawn national attention. The board recommended in a 3-1 vote that Stitt grant Jones clemency and commute his sentence to life in prison with the possibility of parole after hearing from Jones, 41, who testified via video link from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. Several members of the panel agreed they had doubts about the evidence that led to Jones’ conviction. One board member, Scott Williams, recused himself from the vote because of an existing friendship with an attorney who has advocated for Jones. “I continue to believe there is still doubt in this case,” said board member Kelly Doyle. The lone vote against clemency came from Richard Smothermon, a former prosecutor, who said he believed Jones was not being truthful in his testimony. “To believe in Mr. Jones’ theory of the case, you have to disbelieve every other piece of evidence in the case,” including testimony from law enforcement officers, independent witnesses and physical evidence, Smothermon said. Stitt must now decide whether to grant clemency or commute Jones’ sentence.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: An agreement has been reached between timber and environmental groups to overhaul management of 10 million acres of private forestlands in the state. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the deal, announced Saturday by Gov. Kate Brown’s office, concludes more than a year of negotiations to develop a plan to boost protections for vulnerable fish and wildlife while shielding the timber industry’s ability to log. Friday was the deadline for both sides to either reach consensus, abandon the process or move the deadline. “Today’s historic agreement is a perfect example of the Oregon Way – coming together at the table to find common ground, to the mutual benefit of us all,” Brown said in a statement. Jim James with the Oregon Small Woodlands Association similarly praised the compromise. “We were able to put down the contentious situations that we’ve had in the past, and we had a continuous agreement to move forward,” James said. Speaking on behalf of the timber coalition, Adrian Miller with the Florida-based forest products company Rayonier said Saturday’s agreement gives timber operators a sense of security going forward. “I think we’re all really proud to be part of a new era of forestry in Oregon,” Miller said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration told more than 70,000 state employees Monday that it is offering five days of paid leave for getting fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the end of the year, quickly drawing opposition from the state treasurer over the potential cost. The administration told employees that five days of “verification leave” can be used between Dec. 20 and March 31. Employees who don’t use the days by then will be paid for them, and an employee who has verified fully vaccinated status to the administration will automatically receive the days, it said. “This leave will help incentivize the vaccinations that protect commonwealth employees and the Pennsylvanians we serve,” the administration told employees. “It’s one more way we can show our gratitude to employees who step up to help us protect our communities and bring this pandemic to an end.” The administration already offers employees a paid day off to get vaccinated. Treasurer Stacy Garrity, a Republican, called on Wolf, a Democrat, to abandon the plan. Her office said the cost to taxpayers for paying employees who do not use the days could amount to more than $100 million.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A federal appeals court has upheld a settlement between Brown University and student-athletes who had challenged the Ivy League school’s decision to drop several women’s varsity sports. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the university and the athletes who originally sued in letting the settlement stand. Twelve athletes on the women’s gymnastics and ice hockey teams had asked the court to reject the settlement in the interests of current and future female athletes at Brown. The settlement, approved by a federal judge in Providence last year, restores the women’s equestrian and women’s fencing teams to varsity status and calls for an end in 2024 to a 1998 legal agreement ensuring gender equity in varsity sports at Brown. The legal challenge centered on the Providence school’s decision to reduce several women’s varsity sports teams to club status. Several men’s sports were also reduced to club status, although some were later restored. The student-athletes alleged that the cuts violated the 1998 pact. The 1998 agreement had stemmed from a legal challenge to Brown’s decision to cut women’s gymnastics and volleyball in the early 1990s. Brown has said the agreement established unique reporting requirements not faced by any other U.S. college or university.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The Historic Columbia Foundation has unveiled a new look at the capital city’s LGBTQ past. Historic Columbia launched its comprehensive online oral history of the capital city’s gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer communities last month at the city’s Famously Hot South Carolina Pride festival. The foundation worked with the oral history department at the University of South Carolina to collect the stories of a diverse range of LGBTQ+ people in Columbia so that the often untold story of those communities in the Midlands can be honored and remembered. “We have to do this now before some of this stuff is lost forever,” said Kat Allen, director of research at Historic Columbia, who worked to put the comprehensive project together. “Every day more stuff gets thrown away. People pass away, and then someone says, ‘Nobody’s going to want this,’ but USC will absolutely take all of this stuff. … There are things we would have never known about without some of this material.” The project maps a timeline of Columbia’s LGBTQ+ history, from early 1900s drag shows and a procession of gay-friendly establishments to the first Pride March to the S.C. State House in 1990 that birthed today’s Pride festival.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Labor shortages in the service industry are high enough that there is now a $1,000 offer for new workers to move to the Mount Rushmore State. A new employee coming from out of state to work a job in retail, restaurants, hospitality, grocery, trades and other needed sectors can receive $1,000 payment through the South Dakota Retailers Association and its “$1,000 Workforce Incentive” push. SDRA, a partner organization for dozens of companies, is launching the $1,000 payment to supplement any hiring bonuses or other incentives straight to new employees, according to a press release Monday. The cash payout would supplement any hiring bonuses or other incentives offered by an individual business. The incentive will be paid directly to an employee hired from out of state to work in a Retailers Association member business. To be eligible, an employee must work at least 30 hours per week for 90 days at a physical location in South Dakota. Additional eligibility details are available at www.sdra.org.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Grand Ole Opry’s broadcast of its 5,000th Saturday show attracted a host of big country music stars to its historic venue. Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood, Darius Rucker, Vince Gill, Chris Young and a half-dozen others lined up to celebrate the nearly century-old country music program. The radio broadcast was carried by WSM radio, the same station on which it debuted as the “Barn Dance” program in 1925. Bill Anderson, a 60-year Opry veteran, kicked off the show with the Roy Acuff tune “Wabash Cannonball.” Singer Vince Gill played an acoustic guitar he said was once owned by Opry star Sam McGee. Gill said McGee first played the famed radio program in 1926, months before the barn dance program became known as the Grand Ole Opry. Brooks and Yearwood closed the show with a set of several songs before Brooks ended with his country classic “Friends in Low Places.” “Happy 5,000 to the Grand Ole Opry,” Brooks said. “Can’t tell you how lucky we feel to be a part of it.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The city’s school district is defying a request from a Republican state lawmaker for select school districts to investigate and catalog library and classroom books related to race, gender identity or sexuality. District spokesman Jason Stanford said in an email Friday that district officials “decided that a response is not necessary, especially since anyone can search our library catalogues on this website.” Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth, chairman of the Texas House General Investigating Committee, made the request to select superintendents and Texas Education Agency deputy commissioner Lily Laux in a letter with a list of more than 800 books for districts to check against library and classroom collections. The letter appears to have been sent to large urban and suburban school districts across the state, said Joy Baskin, director of legal services for the Texas Association of School Boards. The list includes award-winning books on race and social justice, as well as health books and guides, including “The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine” and titles on sexually transmitted diseases. The letter also called on districts to identify other books or content addressing “human sexuality” and “material that might make students feel discomfort ... or convey that a student, by virtue of their race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously,” mirroring language in a new Texas law targeting classroom discussions of such topics.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The city, the 2021 DOCUTAH International Film Festival, and Art Around the Corner are collaborating to bring a mural to life for the public. Artists featured in the films “Alice Street and Prophets” and “Teachers & Kings” will create a mural on the side of the Electric Theatre in real time during the festival, which began Monday. This year’s mural will be a mix of artistry and an ode to filmmakers in the form of Charlie Chaplin filming a Shivwits powwow dancer and a jazz band with an artist using a paintbrush to depict the scene. Artists Desi Mundo and Pancho Peskador will be the featured artists. Initially, the films were set for 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic put them on hold. The artists and films are now back for the 100-film festival and in what DOCUTAH considers an expanded edition of the festival. “This public space mural is intended to remind us that with understanding our past and looking toward our future, St. George continues to be a vibrant and welcoming place for all to enjoy,” said Rhondalon Crawford, Board Chair of the Art Around the Corner Foundation. “The partnership with DOCUTAH and the City of St. George demonstrates the commitment our community has to all of the arts and to providing our citizens and visitors with a wide variety of artistic experiences.”\n\nVermont\n\nWinooski: State educational officials will ban spectators from a high school boys soccer state semifinal this week, following alleged racist behavior and overly rough gameplay between two schools’ players earlier this year. The Vermont Principals’ Association said in a statement Monday that “this decision has been made to ensure the physical and emotional safety of all student-athletes involved.” Winooski High School has said that during the first home game of the season, its players were targeted with racial slurs by Enosburg High School’s players and fans. There’s also a separate investigation into Winooski players getting violent with Enosburg players during that Sept. 18 game, which ended in a 3-2 Winooski win. In response to the alleged racial abuse during the game, Enosburg conducted an internal investigation but found no evidence of wrongdoing. However, the school said its report was incomplete without interviewing Winooski players, who declined to participate in the investigation. Winooski’s school officials said they believe what their student-athletes reported about the racial abuse from Enosburg. Winooski Athletics Director Sam Jackson has characterized the school as Vermont’s most diverse high school.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: A schoolhouse where enslaved and free Black children were taught before the Revolutionary War will be moved from the William & Mary campus to Colonial Williamsburg and restored to its original state, officials announced Friday. The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation is buying the building that housed the Bray School, the university and foundation said in a news release. Once modern additions to the building are removed, it will be moved a few blocks to the living history museum’s campus, where it will be restored and incorporated into the foundation’s public history programming. “This nondescript building that was hidden in plain sight for decades is taking the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and William & Mary in a new and exciting direction,” Colonial Williamsburg President and CEO Cliff Fleet said. “This important work will expand our understanding of 18th-century America and add to our body of knowledge about this important time in our nation’s history.” The university says the building is likely the oldest surviving schoolhouse for African Americans. It will be the first addition to Williamsburg’s collection of historic buildings since the 1960s. The foundation expects to restore the building by 2024, the 250th anniversary of the school’s closure just before the Revolutionary War.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The former Spokane County health officer who believes he was fired last year due to unpopular decisions he made to try to contain COVID-19 has filed a claim with the health district, which could lead to a lawsuit. The Spokesman-Review reports Dr. Bob Lutz filed the administrative claim Oct. 8. Robert Carlson, Lutz’s attorney, said the hope is that the district determines Lutz’s claim has merit and works to resolve the issue out of court. Lutz is claiming at least $1.4 million in damages for wrongful termination in addition to “defamation, emotional distress, mental anguish and injury to professional reputation” as a result of his firing in October 2020. The health district has 60 days to respond to Lutz’s claim, at which point Lutz could proceed with a lawsuit. The claim details several examples of alleged political pressure and tension between Lutz and certain Board of Health members throughout 2020, especially when the county was stuck in limited phases due to COVID-19 case rates. “I took a stand for Public Health. It cost me my job,” Lutz said in a statement released through his attorney. “As a public health physician, it has been my responsibility to protect the public’s health and safety.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University has launched its newly formed Institute for Cyber Security. Marshall President Jerome Gilbert said the institute is an academic and research cluster that will support cybersecurity-related programs across the campus. “We can do research and teaching to expand our presence in the cyber arena,” Gilbert said. The new center will work to address emerging needs in cybersecurity, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. David Dampier, dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Sciences, said it is designed to tap into a new mix of students and early-career professionals and connect those learners with top cybersecurity talent in the region. The institute is housed in the university’s Applied Engineering Complex.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gun dealers in the state are struggling to keep shelves stocked with ammunition. Supply chain disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic and increased demand for guns and ammunition have left shelves empty in some cases. And when a shipment does arrive at local gun stores, ammunition is quickly snapped up. Tony Blattler, of Phillips, watched as employees unloaded a shipment of .270 Winchester hunting cartridges recently at the Fleet Farm in Marshfield. Not long after, about two dozen people had filed into the store, grabbing ammunition as fast as workers could unload it, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. “Probably by within an hour or two, they were sold out of that ammunition just by word of mouth,” Blattler said. Pat Kukull, owner of Superior Shooters Supply, said the store had a shortage of shotgun ammunition for trap shooting over the summer, with vendors sending maybe 2% of the usual 500 cases it might receive. She said there’s been “absolutely nothing” for those hunting pheasant, grouse or waterfowl. “Now, we’re moving into rifle season, and we haven’t had any .30-30 shells in a year to speak of, really,” Kukull said. Across Wisconsin, background checks for handguns surged 174% last year from 2019, according to the Wisconsin Department of Justice.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Employee transition efforts are ramping up with just a few weeks left before the state’s last underground coal mine shutters. The long-anticipated closure of the Bridger Underground Coal Mine was originally expected to affect 94 mine workers, according to the layoff notice sent to the Rock Springs City Council a month ago. The number of affected staff has since fallen to 89 and is continuing to shrink as staff leave to start new jobs, the Casper-Star Tribune reports. Rocky Mountain Power, whose subsidiary Bridger Coal Company owns the mine, hosted a job fair last month at which the workers it’s not retaining were able to interview with other mining companies. Two of the five companies were from out of state, meaning new hires would have to leave Rock Springs for work. But Rocky Mountain Power is also collaborating with Western Wyoming Community College in an effort to help underground mine workers access vocational training programs. Many will qualify for federal retraining funds targeting displaced coal workers. Employees’ existing skills also translate well to other mining jobs, including in the trona industry, which produces a source of soda ash, said Rick Lee, CEO of the Rock Springs Chamber of Commerce. The Green River Basin trona patch is about 40 miles from Rock Springs.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/12/26/stories-behind-northern-nevadas-notorious-crimes-and-disasters/975573001/", "title": "Stories behind Northern Nevada's notorious crimes and disasters", "text": "RGJ archives\n\n1900: The Wild Bunch escapes with $32,000 in gold\n\n\"The First National Bank of Winnemucca was robbed today at noon by three desperate men, who entered the front door of the building with leveled revolvers and made all present throw up their hands,\" the Sept. 19, 1900, Reno Evening Gazette reported. \"The robbers threatened with instant death the first man who made any show of resistance.\"\n\nThe three men, part of the Wild Bunch made famous by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, felt no need to mask their faces in broad daylight. In true Wild West style, they loaded their horses with $32,000 worth of gold coins and sped out of town amid a hail of gunfire. Two posses of lawmen spent three days searching for the culprits, but the robbers had escaped to Wyoming and later Texas.\n\nA few months later, a photo of the Wild Bunch dressed in their finest was sent to the bank from Fort Worth, Texas, along with a note of thanks for the gold.\n\nThe robbery quickly became a Nevada legend. Nearly 100 years later, Winnemucca continues its annual celebration of Butch Cassidy Days, despite recent evidence that proves Cassidy and the Kid never set foot in the bank that day.\n\nIn a collection of letters between the cashier George Nixon (who later became a millionaire and Nevada senator) and the Pinkerton Detective Agency, Nixon wrote: \"While I am satisfied that Cassidy was interested in the robbery, he was not one of the men who entered the bank.\"\n\n1906: Prominent county sheriff is killed in a brothel\n\nNye County Sheriff Tom Logan, well-respected and liked throughout Nevada, was shot to death at a Manhattan brothel April 7, 1906.\n\nEarly newspaper reports told of his heroic fight to stop a \"pistol duel\" between two \"gamblers.\" Questions arose, however, when it came out that Logan, a family man with eight children, was found dead clad only in a blue nightshirt.\n\nWalter Barieau, black and blue from a fight with Logan, was arrested while lying in the street outside the Jewel House with Logan on top of him. He was taken to the Tonopah Jail to escape a quickly forming lynch mob.\n\nRather than stopping at the brothel to break up a fight, it turned out Logan had been spending the night with his mistress and the brothel's madam, May Biggs. Barieau had been sleeping in Biggs' parlor when she tried to rouse him about 5 a.m. and send him on his way.\n\n\"I suppose I wasn't moving fast enough and she started to shove me along,\" Barieau testified at his trial. \"I objected to this and hit back with my elbow, striking the woman on the arm. As soon as this happened, she screamed.\"\n\nAt Biggs' scream, Logan burst out of his bedroom and began beating Barieau, he said. Seeing Logan had a gun and not knowing he was the county sheriff, Barieau fired once and retreated out of the house. Logan followed and Barieau fired four more shots, each striking Logan.\n\nThe defense showed Logan had been involved in a long-term relationship with Biggs, showering her with expensive gifts and purchasing lumber that built the Jewel House.\n\nBarieau's fledgling defense lawyer, Pat McCarran, argued Barieau acted in self-defense against an attacker who was trying to avenge his mistress, not a lawman acting in the line of duty. The jury found Barieau innocent.\n\n1907: Mining barons railroad Wobblie murder conviction\n\nTensions between union organizers and the mining barons and business owners of 1906 had been running high for months when a Goldfield restaurant owner raised his gun at a man leading a group of pickets in front of his business.\n\nMorrie Preston shot and killed restaurant owner John Silva in self-defense. The shooting gave the mining barons the perfect opportunity to turn the tide of public sentiment against the International Workers of the World that had been working for months to organize miners.\n\nPreston and Joe Smith, both IWW organizers, were arrested shortly after the shooting. \"Anonymous sources\" told newspaper reporters of a labor conspiracy to murder Silva, prominent banker George Wingfield and several other men.\n\nU.S. marshals were brought in to protect the gold-mining boomtown, as rumors ran rampant that the community would be destroyed. Armed men roamed the streets. The mines closed their doors until their workers seceded from the IWW, putting the lid on organization efforts.\n\n\"The committee of safety came to the firm decision to rid this camp of the anarchists who were infesting it and organized a posse to go out and get them,\" the Reno Evening Gazette reported. \"One-hundred-eighty feet of carefully greased rope was taken along as a proper precaution and, by twos and threes, the posse quietly moved through the streets, the rendezvous being the jail where Joe Smith and Preston had been incarcerated.\"\n\nExpecting a lynch mob, the Nye County sheriff had taken the suspects to a jail in Hawthorne.\n\nPublic sentiment against the union radicals ran high throughout the Preston-Smith trial. Preston was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 25 years in prison, serving seven years. While serving his sentence, he was nominated by the Socialist Labor Party as candidate for the U.S. presidency. Preston refused the nomination.\n\nSmith was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to 10 years, serving five.\n\nSeven years after the convictions, the Nevada Pardons Board found that much of the trial testimony had been perjured, saying it \"was entirely satisfied that there was no element of conspiracy\" in the murder. However, the governor, who reportedly was threatened by Wingfield, refused to pardon the men.\n\nIn 1987, after a book chronicling the event by Guy Rocha and Sally Zanjani, the men received the second and third posthumous pardons granted in Nevada.\n\n1911: Posse massacres the last roaming band of Indians\n\nThe year was 1911 when a posse of ranchers slew the men, women and children of a band of wandering Bannock Indians suspected of killing four Basque sheepherders — the last Indian uprising in the country.\n\nAlthough the term \"last Indian uprising\" originally referred to the slaughter of the sheepherders, it has come to describe the massacre of Shoshone Mike and his band.\n\nRefusing to live on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation in Idaho, Shoshone Mike gathered his extended family and began roaming the Western states, living off the land. In 1910, a horse thief killed one of Mike's sons. The band then killed one of the rustlers.\n\nFleeing posses, the band crisscrossed Nevada and California, finally coming to Little High Rock Canyon in Humboldt County to winter. Finding food scarce, the band butchered some cattle. They are suspected of killing the four ranch hands who came to investigate the dead livestock. However, some evidence suggests the group could have been killed by Miller-Lux cowboys, who mutilated the bodies as the Indians might have.\n\nThe slayings spurred talk of an Indian uprising, as lawmen and ranchers gathered into posses to hunt down Shoshone Mike. Newspapers reported murderous Indians roaming the countryside. The Elko sheriff urged that folks \"kill all the Indians and every Indian found roaming the Idaho country.\"\n\nThe posse found the band in their canyon, first firing at a woman leading some horses. The band answered back with bullets from black-powder guns, arrows and spears. Cornered children threw handfuls of rocks and gravel at the men. One of the posse members died.\n\nOnly four children survived the massacre; three probably died from tuberculosis shortly after the killings.\n\nShoshone Mike's granddaughter, Mary Jo Estep, who was plucked from her bloody cradle board on the back of her dead mother, lived to be 89. She died in 1993 in a Washington nursing home after attendants gave her another patient's medication.\n\n1916: Bloody palm print leads to major murder conviction\n\nThe only contact the small mining camp of Jarbidge had with the outside world in 1916 was the stagecoach that visited once a week, bringing in the money used by merchants to cash miners' paychecks.\n\nThe stagecoach was late Dec. 5, the day before payday. A group of men gathered to search for the coach, finding it with Frank Searcy sitting in the driver's seat — dead from a gunshot wound. The mail sacks had been emptied of $3,200, and an envelope in the coach bore a bloody palm print.\n\nThe miners formed a posse to search for the hand that matched the print, each knowing the killer had to be a colleague. The posse began turning up physical evidence: a bloody coat, a bloodstained shirt found at the bottom of the river, a bag of coins. The shirt and coat matched clothes worn by most men in the camp.\n\nBut one man, Ben Kuhl, was not in the posse. They ransacked his riverside cabin, finding a .45-caliber gun. Kuhl was hauled off to jail, shouting his innocence.\n\nIn September he stood trial, the bloody palm print being the most compelling piece of physical evidence against him.\n\nBased on the print, he was convicted and sentenced to death. His was the first fingerprint to be used as evidence in a criminal trial. His robbery was the last stagecoach robbery perpetrated in the world.\n\nAt an appearance before the Board of Pardons in 1918, Kuhl changed his story, saying he and Searcy had planned the robbery together and were to split the loot. At the last minute, however, Searcy changed his mind and struggled when Kuhl tried to rob him. Kuhl shot him in self-defense, he said.\n\nKuhl's death sentence was commuted to life in prison, where he served 27 years before being released in 1945 at age 61. He died of pneumonia in 1960.\n\n1927: State officials lose embezzled funds on the market\n\nIf the stock market had been up that decade, the $516,322.16 missing from the state coffers might have gone unnoticed.\n\nInstead, State Controller George Cole, State Treasurer Ed Malley and Carson Valley Bank cashier H.C. Clapp took a hit too big to cover up after skimming state money from 1919 to 1926 to invest in the Signal Hill Oil Co.\n\nBy carefully manipulating treasury and bank records, the trio had been able to cover their embezzlement. But in 1927, Clapp was fired from his job in George Wingfield's bank, and Cole and Malley were caught.\n\n\"Word that those two men were accused by Gov. Fred Balzar of being responsible for the most gigantic fraud in the history of Nevada hit Nevada a blow under which it staggered,\" the Nevada State Journal wrote May 8, 1927, the day after the trio was arrested in the Treasurer's Office.\n\nWingfield declared the two officials had confessed their fraud to him. Their lawyer, Pat McCarran, maintained their innocence, saying the discrepancy between bank and state funds was a civil matter between the two parties.\n\nOne month later, Clapp pleaded guilty and turned state's evidence against the two officers.\n\nFound guilty in 1928, Cole and Malley spent three years in Nevada State Prison. To date, they are the only two Nevada constitutional officeholders to be incarcerated. Clapp spent 1927 to 1931 in prison.\n\n1934: Star witness is Nevada's most famous missing man\n\nIt was a warm March evening in 1934 when bank cashier Roy Frisch left the home he shared with his mother to take in a movie at a downtown theater.\n\nHe never made it to the theater, never returned home, never got the chance to testify against two of Reno's biggest crime bosses — and his body never was found.\n\nFrisch was to testify in a federal mail-fraud case against William Graham and James McKay, who controlled illegal gambling, prostitution and bootlegging in Reno. Some said he was paid off to disappear.\n\n\"The problem with that is most people don't stay disappeared,\" historian Phillip Earl said.\n\nA massive, unsuccessful manhunt ensued.\n\n\"There remains no longer the slightest doubt that Frisch has been murdered,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney William A. Licking announced on April 18, 1934. \"That's been confirmed by one of the most thorough searches ever conducted.\"\n\nClues remained scarce, although gangster friends of Baby Face Nelson confessed after their boss' death a year later that they had shot Frisch in the head and dumped his body in an abandoned mine shaft.\n\nWhen Graham and McKay went to trial, they tried to set Frisch up as the fall guy. Two trials subsequently ended with hung juries. Both men were convicted after their third trial and sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nTwo years ago, new tips led Reno police investigators to the yard of George Wingfield's former mansion on Court Street, just a few doors from Frisch's home. The yard never has been searched for the body, however, because of the age of the case and lack of available resources, police said.\n\n1939: Sabotaged luxury train kills 24 in Nevada desert\n\nThe night was still in August 1939 when the City of San Francisco luxury train, on a jaunt from Chicago to San Francisco, crumpled into the Humboldt River in a remote canyon outside of Carlin, killing 24 people and injuring more than 100.\n\n\"I jumped out of the cab and ran back,\" the engineer, the first person out of the wreckage, told reporters. \"There was no breeze, and the dust had gathered into a huge cloud. There were no lights and I couldn't see a single living person. I could hear the screams and moans of the injured and the dying.\"\n\nTraveling through the canyon at about 60 mph, the train hit a sabotaged piece of rail about 100 yards in front of a bridge over the river. The train broke in two, tearing into the supporting beams. Several cars, including the diner car, plunged down the embankment into the river, sending bodies flying through the air. The club car struck the bridge's steel girders, \"tearing them to ribbons.\"\n\nThe next day, police in several states began arresting \"suspicious characters\" from railyards in a search of the \"saboteur and mass murderer.\" Authorities searched for an \"earless man\" who was \"sore at the railroads.\"\n\nThe saboteurs had removed one of the rails, moving it over four inches and covering their work with tumbleweeds. They painted the shiny end of the cut rail to keep it from alerting the engineer. Nobody ever was charged with the crime.\n\nIn 1995, an Amtrak passenger train crashed into a riverbed in Arizona and authorities began investigating similarities, because a magazine article had run several weeks earlier about the San Francisco wreck.\n\n1947: Teenage escapee murders two police officers in Reno\n\nOpening fire as soon as the bedsheet was lifted from him, 18-year-old David Blackwell shot and killed two Reno officers before a third wounded him in the shoulder with another suspect's gun.\n\nIn November 1947, Capt. Roy Geach, Sgt. Allen Glass and two other officers had tracked a group of teenagers suspected of robbing several downtown nightclubs to the Carlton motel room. When they entered the room, one of the suspects attacked the officers, but quickly was disarmed and pinned behind the door.\n\nGeach and Glass approached the bed, where Blackwell was hiding beneath the covers. When they lifted the sheet, Blackwell unloaded seven rounds from a .38-caliber pistol, striking Geach three times and Glass four times. Both men died in the room.\n\nSgt. Eugene Cowan, who had disarmed the first teen, shot Blackwell in the shoulder with that gun.\n\nBlackwell, who had escaped from a Washington State reformatory shortly before the shooting, pleaded guilty and a hearing was set to determine the degree of murder and sentence. Calling the murder \"wholesale slaughter,\" Judge Merwyn H. Brown sentenced Blackwell to death.\n\nIn the gas chamber less than two years later, Blackwell grinned and winked at Cowan an instant before the cyanide pellet was dropped into a pot of sulfuric acid.\n\n\"The day he shot Roy and Allen, I promised him I would be here when this time came,\" Cowan told reporters after the execution.\n\n1949: Reno gambling icon survives a shotgun attack at his home\n\nGaming icon Lincoln Fitzgerald's body was silhouetted against the bright garage lights of his Mark Twain Drive home shortly before midnight in November 1949 when an unknown assailant fired a blast from a 12-gauge shotgun into his side.\n\nFitzgerald collapsed as the 110 pellets traveled through his body, lodging against his spine and tearing out part of his liver. As he slumped, a second shot aimed for his head hit the garage wall instead.\n\n\"How or why he missed that second shot, no one will ever know,\" one police officer said.\n\nFitzgerald was rushed to the hospital, where a team of four doctors operated on him, shaking their heads at his prognosis. Nearly five months later, Fitzgerald overcame the odds of death or permanent paralysis and walked out of the hospital.\n\nThe assailant left few clues and the investigation was crippled from the start. No suspects ever were identified.\n\nHowever, police believe the work could have been done by a group of hoods from Detroit, possibly the notorious \"Purple Gang\" that controlled the area where Fitzgerald and a partner ran a nightclub. Fitzgerald and his partner had been central figures in a Michigan gambling investigation involving charges of corruption and bribery of government officials.\n\nFitzgerald went on to build the Fitzgerald's Hotel-Casino in the mid-1970s. The reclusive casino boss spent most of his time in his room at the hotel, rarely making an appearance in public. He died in 1981, at age 88.\n\n1960: Man slays two lawyers in Washoe District courtroom\n\nEach time Robert \"Sandman\" Williams entered a Washoe County courtroom, deputies searched him for weapons. The day before Thanksgiving 1960, Williams wore a thin silk shirt that revealed no gun.\n\nBut as Judge Jon Collins read his decision in a property-settlement case involving Williams' estranged wife and her mother, Williams pulled a pistol from his waistband and opened fire, killing two of the opposing lawyers and wounding a witness. His attorney, Sam Frankovich, and the court reporter wrestled the gun out of his hand.\n\nEli Livierato, who had gone to the sheriff a year earlier fearing Williams would become violent, died on the courtroom floor from three bullet wounds to his chest. Edwin Mulcahy, who represented Williams' mother-in-law, died in the hospital four days later.\n\nDuring his trial, Williams tearfully argued the shooting was justified, although he could not remember it.\n\n\"They were trying to rob us of everything he had,\" Williams said, almost shouting. \"I was double-crossed all along the way during the land-settlement trial and I know the judge and attorneys went into the back room to decide against me.\"\n\nWilliams sobbed when the judge sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole after the jury convicted him of murder. He died in 1973 at age 71.\n\n1963: Mutilated body of skier is found stuffed in a hope chest\n\nSonja McCaskie's heart, lying in a pool of blood on the floor, was the first thing to greet a Reno officer checking on the Olympic skier when she failed to pick up her son April 5, 1963.\n\nHer left foot, severed at the ankle, lay nearby; her decapitated body was stuffed into her hope chest.\n\n\"It is certainly the most brutal murder I have ever seen,\" Police Chief Elmer Briscoe said after the discovery.\n\nThe crime's brutality shocked northern Nevadans, who lived in fear for eight days as authorities searched for the killer.\n\nThomas Lee Bean, an 18 -year-old Wooster High School student, was arrested after pawning a camera he had stolen from McCaskie's house. He confessed to investigators that he strangled her with a piece of twine, raped her and dismembered her body.\n\nBean told investigators how McCaskie had awakened as he strangled her, begging him not to kill her because she had a baby to support. He said it had been a childhood dream to rape a girl.\n\n\"I don't know why I cut her up,\" Bean told investigators. \"I don't ... I just shoved the knife in and started to cut, that's all.\"\n\nBean smiled slightly when the jury came back with a guilty verdict, recommending a sentence of death.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he told them sarcastically.\n\nBean was taken off death row when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional in 1972. He remains in the Northern Nevada Correctional Center today.\n\n1963: Sinatra's son kidnapped from a casino in Lake Tahoe\n\nTwo men abducted Frank Sinatra Jr. from his hotel room at the Harrah's South Lodge, where he was performing in December 1963.\n\nAnswering a knock at the door, the men held the 19-year-old and one of his musicians at gunpoint, binding them with duct tape.\n\nFrank Sinatra, who immediately flew to Reno from Los Angeles, was trapped in the valley by a raging snowstorm. He spent three tense days at the Mapes Hotel waiting for contact from the kidnappers. Two days after the kidnapping, Sinatra sneaked past a barrage of reporters and traveled to a Carson City service station to negotiate with the men who took his son.\n\nOne day later, Sinatra Jr. was released unharmed but exhausted on a Los Angeles freeway in time to celebrate his father's 46th birthday.\n\nThree men were arrested two days after Sinatra paid the $240,000 ransom, and most of the money was recovered.\n\nJohn William Irwin, 42; Barry Worthington Keenan, 23; and Joseph Clyde Amsler, 23, originally received life sentences. Those convictions were reversed on technicalities. Irwin and Amsler then received five years probation. Worthington, the reputed ringleader, served fewer than five years of a reduced 12-year prison sentence.\n\nIn May 1999, when Keenan — a Mississippi land developer — attempted to sell the story to a movie studio, a California appeals court ruled he could not profit from his crime.\n\n1971: Legendary hijacker jumps into history with $200,000\n\nIt was Thanksgiving Eve 1971 when a man dressed in a dark business suit and sunglasses took a seat in the last row of a Northwest-Orient Airlines flight out of Portland, Ore.\n\nThe olive-skinned man presented a typewritten note to a stewardess, demanding $200,000 in $20 bills and four parachutes in exchange for not blowing up the plane.\n\nThe plane landed in Seattle, where the man now commonly known as D.B. Cooper allowed the passengers and most of the crew to get off. He was given his parachutes and the money, and he ordered the pilots to fly to Mexico. The pilot told him the plane would have to refuel in Reno.\n\nPolice and FBI agents swarmed the runway at the Reno/Tahoe International Airport. But when the plane landed, Cooper was nowhere to be found. A search began in Washington and Oregon, where he was believed to have jumped. Neither he nor his body was ever found.\n\nFive years later, the statute of limitations for the crime ran out and Cooper was believed to be a free man. In 1980, a family picnicking along the Columbia River in Oregon unearthed $5,880 of soggy $20 bills.\n\nThe FBI agent who followed the case believed Cooper wound up a crumpled skeleton on the forest floor.\n\n\"I think he was a stupid, desperate rascal, a brutal unscrupulous man who endangered the lives of more than 40 people for money and caused his own death,\" Ralph Himmelsbach said 10 years after the jump.\n\nFollowers, who gather in several states to celebrate the anniversary, believe Cooper pulled off the perfect crime, melting back into society a rich man.\n\nBut two former federal employees asserted in a book published in 1991 that Cooper died in a 1974 shootout during a bank robbery, after he escaped from a prison where he was serving time for attempting to hijack a second plane in Utah.\n\n1976: Brothel bodyguard shoots a world-famous prizefighter\n\nA bodyguard for Mustang Ranch owner Joe Conforte shot Argentine prizefighter Oscar Bonavena through the heart in front of the infamous brothel in 1976.\n\nThe murder sparked conspiracy rumors that Conforte had Bonavena killed for sleeping with his wife, Sally Conforte, also Bonavena's manager.\n\nConforte said bodyguard Willard Ross Brymer shot the boxer because of \"bad blood.\" Bonavena was trying to get into the brothel to kill him in order to take over the business, Conforte said. A gun belonging to Sally Conforte was found in Bonavena's boot.\n\n\"One of the biggest mistakes of my life is when he (Bonavena) came in; I took him to my home instead of my hotel,\" Conforte testified during the murder trial. \"As soon as he moved into my house, he got real chummy with my wife.\"\n\nBonavena's death sent Argentina into an uproar, its citizens demanding justice for their slain hero. Brymer's first trial ended in a mistrial when Conforte was spotted talking to a juror. Before a second trial could be scheduled, Brymer pleaded no contest to manslaughter.\n\n\"Until yesterday, all attempts at getting the criminal to admit his guilt had been frustrated,\" a Buenos Aires newspaper wrote after Brymer's guilty plea. \"Using subterfuge and various alibis the criminal had eluded the justice that had been demanded from this part of the world.\"\n\nThousands of mourners chanted and threw flowers at Bonavena's funeral, including former Argentine President Alejandro Lanusse.\n\n1976: Community locks its doors after murder at university\n\nUniversity of Nevada, Reno sophomore Michelle Mitchell's car broke down near the school when she was on her way to the store to buy her father some orange juice. She called her mother to pick her up, but when her mom showed up 20 minutes later, Mitchell had disappeared.\n\nA couple returning home later that night found Mitchell's body on their garage floor, her hands tied behind her back and her throat slashed.\n\nThe seemingly random and brutal murder of the popular coed sent the community into a panic and police into one of the most intensive investigations in city history. Gun sales to women sailed and reports of a knife-wielding maniac spread. After a year, the hysteria began to subside and police still were empty-handed.\n\nOn the third anniversary of the murder, former topless bar manager Cathy Woods was admitted into a Louisiana mental hospital. She told staff members she wanted to talk to police about slashing the throat of a girl named Michelle.\n\nWoods told detectives she killed Mitchell because she laughed at her sexual advance. But investigators continued to explore the possibility her murder was committed to throw police off the track of a stabbing murder of a topless bar employee. Two people arrested in that murder had connections with the same topless bar that employed Woods.\n\nWoods was found guilty in 1980 and sentenced to life in prison, but the conviction was overturned five years later and she received a new trial. A second jury convicted Woods again in 1985 and she was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nWoods was exonerated in September 2014 after DNA evidence found on a cigarette butt left at the scene matched someone else. She was then granted a new trial, but six months later, the state dismissed all charges against her. Woods is one of the longest-serving women to be wrongfully convicted and then exonerated in United States history, according to the National Registry of Exonerations database.\n\n1980: Lincoln Continental wreaks Thanksgiving holiday horror\n\nObeying voices that told her to kill, 51-year-old Priscilla Ford drove her Lincoln Continental down a crowded Virginia Street sidewalk on Thanksgiving Day, killing seven people and injuring 23.\n\nFord was pulled from her car and arrested after a couple stopped their car in front of the Lincoln. In 1982, she received the death sentence. More than 25 years after the crime, Ford died of emphysema at the Southern Nevada Women's Correctional Center. She was 75.\n\n1980: Extortion bomb rips through Harvey's Resort at Lake Tahoe\n\nHotel directors tried to pay extortionists the $3 million they wanted to keep a 1,000-pound homemade bomb from exploding in the building, but it went off anyway when experts tried to defuse it.\n\nHarvey's Resort Hotel and all the surrounding businesses had been evacuated the day before the blast and no one was hurt or killed. Neighboring resorts opened for business within hours after the explosion.\n\nSpectators watched as specialists spent hours working to defuse the device. One man sold T-shirts emblazoned with \"I survived the blast at Harvey's.\"\n\nFifteen minutes before the explosion, county sheriff's deputies warned people to take cover. Tourists ducked behind cars. The explosion sent chunks of concrete flying. Dust and ash plumed out of the casino as people rushed to catch a glimpse of the three-story hole in the building's side.\n\nAuthorities immediately began the search for three suspects seen leaving the casino after the desk-size bomb was planted near second-story executive offices. Tahoe casinos issued a $175,000 reward.\n\nOne year later, authorities arrested six people in Fresno, Calif., after parts of a bomb similar to the one at Harvey's were found in a van belonging to one of the suspects.\n\nThe mastermind behind the plot, John Birges Sr., was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He died in 1996 of liver cancer.\n\n1980: Interstate 80 slayer preys on young girls in Carson City\n\nGerald Gallego and his common-law wife preyed on young girls in three states, kidnapping, raping and killing as many as 10 people in their quest to fulfill a sex-slave fantasy.\n\nGallego's wife, Charlene Williams, would lure young girls out of malls or state fairs into a van where Gallego was waiting. Williams served 16 years in prison for her role and was released in 1997.\n\nHis first victims — Kippi Vaught, 16, and Rhonda Scheffer, 17 — were lured from a Sacramento mall in 1978. Gallego raped, then shot the girls in the back of the head, according to Williams, who testified against him in a plea bargain with prosecutors. The pair then hit the Nevada State Fair, where they kidnapped Brenda Judd, 14, and Sandra Colley, 13, disposing of their bodies in a shallow grave off U.S. Highway 395 in Lassen County, Calif.\n\nIn 1980, the pair picked up a pregnant hitchhiker in Oregon. Williams said they took her to a secluded beach, where Gallego bludgeoned her unconscious and buried her alive in the sand, where she suffocated. Gallego never was prosecuted for those crimes.\n\nBut in 1980, a witness noted Gallego's license plate number when he picked up Craig Miller, 22, and fiancée Mary Beth Sowers, 21. Authorities traced the number back to Gallego and charged him with the murder of the young couple.\n\nA California jury convicted Gallego and sentenced him to death.\n\n\"I can honestly tell you — and I'm not bragging — if I had a problem with girls, it's not because I didn't have enough, it is because I had too many,\" Gallego testified in that trial.\n\nFearing he wouldn't be executed in California, Nevada prosecutors tried him for the murder of Stacy Redican and Karen Chipman, who were abducted in Citrus Heights and murdered near Lovelock.\n\nResidents across the state sent donations to Pershing County to defray the costs of his trial and, in 1983, he was found guilty and sentenced to death.\n\nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the sentence in 1997, ordering a new penalty hearing. In June 1999, Gallego was deemed mentally competent to participate in the proceedings, and was once again sentenced to death. He died of cancer in 2002.\n\n1992-93: Stolpa family lost in snowstorm for days\n\nOn Tuesday, Dec. 29, 1992, Jim and Jennifer Stolpa decided to take a shortcut across the wilds of Nevada to get to Idaho for a family funeral. Interstate 80 was closed, so they drove their 1988 Dodge Dakota pickup on Route 299.\n\nThey got stuck on a gravel road in northern Washoe County. For four days, they waited in their car for help in a howling blizzard. When none came, they set out Saturday and trudged through knee-deep snow for 12 hours, carrying their 4-month-old son, Clayton.\n\nBy Sunday night, they were freezing and still unable to find another person in the remote Nevada desert.\n\nAuthorities said the mother and son survived by taking refuge in a hollow under a snow-covered manzanita bush — which formed a natural snow cave — while coyotes paced and howled outside.\n\nThe father walked from the cave, on the Humboldt/Washoe County line, to Vya, more than 30 miles in driving snow. He found the home of David Peterson, a Washoe County road maintenance worker.\n\nStolpa, somewhat incoherent and suffering from hypothermia and frostbite, told Peterson about his family and described landmarks he passed in his search for help.\n\nPeterson, driving a front-end loader and followed by rescue crews in Snowcats, found Jennifer and Clayton in the cave with little food, no water but with dry clothing and a sleeping bag.\n\n“You learn not to take so any things for granted,” Jennifer said of her two days in the cave.\n\nClayton escaped uninjured, but both Jim and Jennifer lost toes to frostbite. Temperatures during the week ranged from a high of 42 to a low of minus-4.\n\nThe Stolpa family’s ordeal was made into a TV movie in 1994, “Snowbound: The Jim and Jennifer Stolpa Story,” with Neil Patrick Harris and Kelli Williams in the tile roles.\n\n1998: UNR police officer is slain while he patrols the campus\n\nWhen UNR student Andrew Ciocca saw Officer George Sullivan lying next to his car just before midnight Jan. 13, he first thought Sullivan simply was looking underneath it.\n\nBut when he approached the officer, he found him lying face down in a pool of blood, his head severely beaten with a hatchet. Ciocca tried in vain to resuscitate Sullivan.\n\nThe next day, officers from agencies across northern Nevada searched the campus, looking for the suspect or for clues to help locate him. Officers, some without sleep for two days, conducted a shoulder-to-shoulder grid search of the grounds, while others knocked on doors and detectives quickly began running down tips and researching clues.\n\nWith Sullivan's gun missing, police knew they had an armed and dangerous suspect on the loose.\n\nOne day later, after a two-hour standoff in Salt Lake City, police arrested a man who reportedly bragged to his friend that he wanted to kill a cop hours before Sullivan was found dead.\n\nSiaosi Vanisi's first trial began one year after Sullivan's death.\n\n\"He said, `I want to kill a cop,'\" a 19-year-old witness said during the first day of emotional testimony.\n\nTwo days later, the judge declared a mistrial after the prosecution discovered the defense had built their case around a single word that was incorrect in the transcript of a witness statement. A second trial nine months later found Vanisi guilty and sentenced him to death. The Nevada Supreme Court confirmed his conviction and death sentence in 2001.\n\n1998: Hot August Nights finale descends into chaos\n\nOn the final night of Hot August Nights 1998, a riot ignited after drunk spectators pulled out ignition keys to a car paused at a traffic light at Second and Sierra streets and threw them into the crowd.\n\nReno police officers present that night said spectators then rocked the car full of females and overturned it. And when police tried to get the women out, the crowd became hostile and flooded the streets. More cars waiting in traffic were shaken and jumped. Bottles were thrown at officers.\n\nLaw enforcement had to use dogs and tear gas to get the crowd under control. Casino security guards were deputized. More than 200 people were arrested, which prompted racial-profiling studies to be done during future events. The studies showed police did not arrest based on race and that the high number of minority bookings reflected the complexion of the crowd.\n\nSince that night, police say actions such as limiting alcohol sales, conducting undercover stings and having a bigger police presence have contributed to less violence in downtown Reno during the final night of the classic car event.\n\n1999: I-80 sniper targets drivers near Mogul\n\nAs Carl Ruggiero drove from Reno to his home in the Belli Ranch area, his windshield burst and glass fragments cut his face. A bullet whizzed by — inches from his face.\n\n“You don’t think about a bullet coming through your windshield,” he said. “It shattered in my face and that was it, really. I didn’t see anything.”\n\nRuggiero was one of three victims of a sniper on Interstate 80. The incident shut down I-80 traffic for more than five hours the morning of Jan. 4. Twelve hours later, Christopher Lee Merritt was arrested north of Las Vegas for a minor traffic violation. Police found 3,000 rounds of ammunition, a Ruger .22-caliber rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and three knives in the pickup truck Merritt's grandfather had reported stolen in Missouri.\n\nMerritt, a part-time pig farmer and college dropout from Missouri, pleaded guilty in November 1999 to six counts of attempted murder and one count of battery with a deadly weapon a year later. A year later, Merritt was sentenced to 20 to 55 years in Nevada State Prison.\n\nHe was sentenced to 20 to 55 years in Nevada State Prison in January 2000. He was found dead in his prison cell Aug. 23, 2012.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/17/jim-beam-airbnb-sasquatch-museum-police-lowriders-news-around-states/40331271/", "title": "Jim Beam Airbnb, Sasquatch Museum: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Panhandlers and people who donate to them could face punishment including jail time if an amendment to a city law is passed and signed. The City Council discussed the contentious panhandler law Tuesday that would make it punishable for a person to give or receive an object through a car window on a public road. The panhandling ordinance was passed unanimously in July but was never signed by Mayor Todd Strange. If signed with the new definitions, the law would also clarify that a person giving or receiving an object from a car window while on public property would also be breaking the law. The punishment for the first offense would be a minimum of two days in city jail and a fine. People breaking the law for the third time could spend five days in jail. For the fourth offense, the perpetrator would face a minimum of seven days in prison.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Forest Service is taking comments on a proposal that would exempt the country’s largest national forest from a ban on timber harvests and road building in roadless areas. This option is listed as the preferred alternative by the agency in a draft environmental review and would exempt the Tongass National Forest from the so-called Roadless Rule. The Forest Service says this alternative is in line with a request from the state. The state submitted a petition seeking an exemption in 2018. The agency says the alternative affects 9.2 million acres of inventoried roadless areas and would convert 165,000 old-growth acres and 20,000 young-growth acres from a designation as unsuitable timber lands to suitable. Conservationists criticized the plan as shortsighted and lacking in rationale.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: For years, Arizona State and Arizona fans have clamored about how underrated their college football rivalry is. That might change. A recent New York Times article noted the ASU-Arizona rivalry as one of the biggest in sports and the No.1 rivalry in all of college football, according to a study conducted by two college professors and published at KnowRivalry.com. Some other teams from the state came up in a different part of the study, which weighed unbalanced rivalries, fans of one team that hated another team much more than that perceived rival hated them.0 According to the study, the Arizona Coyotes and Arizona Diamondbacks led their respective leagues in “Largest Rivalry Gap.” Coyotes fans perceive the Los Angeles Kings as their main rival, but Kings fans don’t feel the same way. Same goes with Diamondbacks fans and the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The University of Arkansas at Monticello says its chancellor will step down at the end of the semester as the school faces a budget deficit amid a large drop in student enrollment. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports Karla Hughes will resign Dec. 31 after three years leading the school. She is the first woman to lead a four-year University of Arkansas System school. Gregg Reep, who chairs the school’s board of visitors, says the administration told the board that it expects there to be a $1 million to $2 million budget shortfall. Hughes took over as chancellor in January 2016, and enrollment has steadily dropped under her watch, from about 3,900 that year to 2,855 this semester.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The western Joshua tree needs protection under the California Endangered Species Act because of threats from climate change and habitat destruction, the Center for Biological Diversity said in a petition Tuesday to the state’s Fish and Game Commission. The petition comes amid rising concern about the future of the crazy-limbed trees with spiky leaves that have come to symbolize the Mojave Desert and draw throngs to Joshua Tree National Park. Researchers have found Joshua trees are dying off due to hotter and drier conditions, and fewer young trees are surviving, according to the center. The trees are migrating to higher elevations with cooler and more moist conditions, but they face destruction by fire due to invasive, non-native grasses in those locations. Joshua trees also face challenges from urban sprawl in the desert, energy projects and off-road-vehicle use.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Weather officials have verified a new high temperature for the state that surpasses the previous record by a single degree. KCNC-TV reports the Colorado Climate Center confirmed the Lamar area reached 115 degrees Fahrenheit on July 20. The previous record of 114 degrees was recorded in July 1933 in Las Animas and again in July 1954 in Sedgwick. A previous report says the high temperature required verification after it was first reported by a Twitter user, whose Aug. 1 post was noted by a state climatologist. The temperature was submitted to the Colorado Climate Center, the National Weather Service, the National Center for Environmental Information and other agencies. Officials say Colorado weather has also set records this year for hottest monthly average, largest hailstone and lowest pressure level.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Hampton: A police officer’s membership in the Proud Boys, a far-right group known for engaging in violent clashes at political rallies, didn’t violate department policies, the town’s police chief has concluded in response to a civil rights group’s concerns. The East Hampton officer, Kevin P. Wilcox, “stopped his association” with the Proud Boys in February, about five months before the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law inquired about his social media connections with other group members, Police Chief Dennis Woessner said. In a letter to the Washington-based civil rights group, the police chief acknowledged Wilcox had been a Proud Boys member and made online payments to a group leader. The rights group described those publicly visible, online transactions as monthly dues that helped fund the Proud Boys’ “violent or otherwise illegal” activities.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: Rebecca Louise Vitelli, a preschool teacher in the Colonial School District, was named this year’s state Teacher of the Year on Tuesday night. Vitelli is a preschool special education teacher at the district’s Colwyck Center, where she works with students with autism and different health and cognitive needs. She says she strives to be inclusive in her teaching and believes every student has the drive and ability to learn. A graduate of the University of Delaware, she has been teaching for four years and has her master’s of education. Vitelli was selected out of a group of 20 teachers, one from each district as well as a charter school representative. The candidates were nominated by districts and charter schools for their teaching ability and dedication to students.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district wants to increase low-cost housing options in its more affluent neighborhoods. News outlets report the D.C. Office of Planning released a housing equity report Tuesday that details the mayor’s plan to break up concentrated poverty. Mayor Muriel Bowser says the separation of affordable housing from other housing was created to disadvantage specific populations, especially black residents. She says in the report that residents are spending a large share of their income on housing, and low-income residents are feeling the encroaching threat of displacement, despite existing housing protections. She has set a goal to build 36,000 new district homes by 2025, and a third of those homes would be affordable housing units.\n\nFlorida\n\nPanama City Beach: Amid the devastation of Hurricane Michael along the Panhandle, experts say there’s a ray of hope – a once-imperiled bird is enjoying a renaissance. There are an estimated 225 to 250 breeding pairs of snowy plover in Florida. The majority of the state’s threatened species live in the Panhandle. The snowy plover has struggled to survive as its habitat has succumbed to development and overgrown vegetation. But when Category 5 Hurricane Michael washed ashore last October, it created the sparsely vegetated conditions the birds prefer. Sixty-eight snowy plovers were successfully fledged this year on about a 40-mile stretch from Port St. Joe to St. Andrews State Park. That’s up from just 12 successful fledglings in 2018. The Palm Beach Post reports the last time plover productivity was so high in the Panhandle was after hurricanes Ivan and Dennis in 2004 and 2005.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCherry Log: In the picturesque mountains of north Georgia, an unassuming roadside building is now ground zero in the search for Bigfoot. David Bakara has put his passion for the legendary creature on display at Expedition: Bigfoot! The Sasquatch Museum in Cherry Log. Bakara welcomes skeptics and believers alike, but he has no doubt these strange creatures really do exist. The longtime member of the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization opened the museum in early 2016. The attraction has an elaborate display of Bigfoot laying siege to a remote cabin. Color-coded maps document hundreds of alleged sightings. A towering reproduction depicts a hairy, 8-foot-tall beast. And the famed 1967 video of an alleged Sasquatch sighting plays on a loop, along with harrowing recollections from those who claim to have encountered a Bigfoot.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A city councilor says she wants visitors to take a pledge to respect and help protect the island’s natural resources. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports Councilwoman Kymberly Pine wants tourists to Oahu to sign a form with a pledge to be environmentally responsible and culturally sensitive during visits. Pine has proposed a bill to enlist the Office of Economic Development or another city agency to help establish the Keep Hawaii Hawaii program. A City Council committee is expected to discuss the proposal at an Oct. 22 meeting. Pine says the program could work with the visitor industry to promote its environmental goals. Similar pledge programs have been established in Hawaii and Kauai counties, but Pine’s program would be the first in Hawaii to coordinate with a local government agency.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Air Force wants to fly supersonic fighter jets at lower altitudes in lightly populated areas of southwestern Idaho, northern Nevada and southeastern Oregon to better simulate combat conditions. The Air Force on Wednesday said it plans to prepare an environmental impact statement to study the idea and will hold meetings and take public comments through Nov. 25 to help shape the study. Mountain Home Air Force Base in southwestern Idaho operates flights over portions of the three states. The Air Force says allowing jets to fly lower will give crews training in low-altitude tactics and radar masking using mountainous terrain for survival. The first meeting is Nov. 4 in McDermitt, Nevada. Later that week in Idaho, meetings are planned for Boise, Grand View and Mountain Home.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state’s top leaders trumpeted the benefits of automatic voter registration when signing a bipartisan plan in 2017 to change how the state finds and signs up eligible but unregistered voters: more civic participation, fewer barriers to the ballot box and modernized systems. But Illinois hasn’t lived up to its promise, rolling out automatic voter registration far behind schedule and struggling with other changes the law made. The delays have elections experts and advocates worried, saying it’s meant missed opportunities for voters and less time to work out potential problems ahead of 2020. “There are a lot of advocates and community members who thought the bill was signed, a switch was flipped. That we won. In fact, that’s not the case,” says Jay Young of Common Cause Illinois, which backed automatic voter registration. “This is exceptionally frustrating.”\n\nIndiana\n\nCrawfordsville: Some students at Wabash College are calling for transparency and communication after the all-male school ended a longtime practice of handing out sheepskin diplomas to graduating seniors. President Gregory Hess of the private liberal arts college in western Indiana told students last week about the planned end of the 187-year-old tradition and the switch to paper diplomas. Administrators say the change was made because the quality of sheepskin diplomas was worsening, and the prices were increasing. Hess noted that the Crawfordsville school made the decision in April. Roarke Tollar, a graduating senior, says he’s concerned the school’s decision to quit using the specialty diplomas presents a “slippery slope” as it pertains to what the administration is willing to eliminate.\n\nIowa\n\nBagley: Nick Lestina made a frightening discovery at his home this month. Five inches of animal blood, fat and tissue from a neighboring meat locker had seeped into the basement through a floor drain, creating a scene worthy of a Halloween movie. “Some things you just think you’ll never see,” Lestina said. The father of five has lived next door to Dahl’s Custom Meat Locker for 10 years. He said there was never a problem until Oct. 3, when he stopped home to pick up a power drill and noticed his sump pump spewing red liquid. Two weeks later, the blood is still seeping into the basement, and the Iowa Department of Public Health has told the family it’s not safe to live in the home. The floor drains in both buildings are connected to the same tile line, a clog in which most likely caused the blood to back up into the home.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: Attorneys are considering offering diversion to a 13-year-old girl arrested last week for pointing a finger gun at classmates. The Kansas City Star reports diversion was discussed Tuesday during a juvenile court hearing for the Overland Park eighth grader, charged with felony threatening. Another court hearing was scheduled for Dec. 17. The girl’s mother told The Star last week that on Sept. 18, a boy asked her daughter who she would kill if she could kill five classmates. The girl reportedly made a gun with her fingers and pointed at four students, then herself. Overland Park Police Chief Frank Donchez confirmed the mother’s story but said there are more facts he could not disclose. Under diversion, the charge would be dismissed if the girl successfully meets certain conditions set by authorities.\n\nKentucky\n\nClermont: For about $23 bucks, you can either get a bottle of Jim Beam bourbon or spend a night at the company’s distillery in Kentucky. The company has posted the Clermont property on Airbnb, with reservations running from Oct. 21 through the end of the year. The online posting says Jim Beam American Stillhouse renters will “join the Beam family for a weekend and live like one of Jim Beam’s seven generations of Master Distillers.” It says stays at the property built in 1919 includes a distillery tour and tasting. The posting also promises that the three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath rental comes with a bar fully stocked with premium Jim Beam bourbons. The posting is signed by Fred Noe, the seventh generation master distiller and Beam’s great-grandson.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A man who has spent two-thirds of his life in prison for a murder he always denied committing has pleaded guilty to manslaughter and will be released. Since his arrest in 1977, shortly before his 20th birthday, Elvis Brooks of New Orleans has maintained that he’s innocent. Advocates from the Innocence Project-New Orleans say evidence that would have cleared him was withheld at trial. Brooks said Tuesday that prosecutors offered the plea bargain while he was with his lawyers last Thursday, preparing for a hearing on that claim. After pleading guilty Tuesday to manslaughter and armed robbery, the 62-year-old told reporters he’s been locked up since 1977 and wants his freedom. He had to return to prison for processing but was expected to be released Wednesday.\n\nMaine\n\nCalais: The National Park Service is looking for someone to lease a house located on a historic site near the border of Maine and Canada. The structure up for lease, called the McGlashan-Nickerson House, is located within Saint Croix Island International Historic Site. The park service says it has declared the house to be excess to its own needs, but it wants to preserve it through a lease. Superintendent Kevin Schneider says the lease opportunity is a chance to “repurpose a historic home and an even greater opportunity to preserve an important historical building that was connected to the 19th-century Maine Red Granite Company.” The Italianate-style house was constructed around 1883. The park service is accepting proposals until Dec. 10. The lease can last up to 60 years.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan says he’s ordering expedited work on repairs to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge that are causing major traffic backups, but the work can’t be delayed without a risk to safety. Hogan said Wednesday that maintenance delays for more than a decade have “caused tremendous safety problems.” He says if repairs are neglected, “the crisis could go from terrible and unbearable to catastrophic and life-threatening.” The bridge is the only one in Maryland that crosses the bay and connects the state’s western and eastern shores. An average of 74,870 vehicles use it daily. It’s just over 4 miles long. The $27 million deck rehabilitation project began last month. It’s slated to last about two years. Hogan says crews will work 24 hours a day.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Civil War monument standing across the street from the Massachusetts State House will be taken down for a makeover. The Boston Globe reports the Robert Gould Shaw and Massachusetts 54th Regiment Memorial in Boston will be removed from its base and transported offsite so it can be restored and a new concrete foundation can be built. Local leaders gathered around the sculpture Tuesday to discuss the $2.8 million restoration project set to start in the spring and expected to take five to six months to complete. The leaders also unveiled the launch of a new augmented reality app, Shaw 54, that gives visitors a new way to experience the memorial that was first unveiled in 1897. The sculpture honors the first regiment of black troops recruited in the North to fight in the Civil War.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Legislation advancing in the state is designed to help police better interact with people with autism or hearing issues. The state Senate voted unanimously Wednesday to let people elect a “communication impediment designation” when applying for or renewing their driver’s license, vehicle registration or state ID card. Law enforcement would be notified of the designation when looking up a license or registration in a database during traffic and other stops. Supporters say the bills would help officers avoid misinterpreting autism-related behaviors that could escalate interactions with law enforcement. The legislation goes to the House for consideration next.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBecker: A missing 6-year-old boy was found safe early Wednesday after a search by hundreds of volunteers and the use of a drone with a thermal camera that helped locate the child in a dark cornfield. The boy, named Ethan, hadn’t been seen since 4:10 p.m. Tuesday, when he got off a school bus with his siblings near Highway 25 in Becker and ran to play with the family dog, according to the Sherburne County Sheriff’s Office. Becker is about 45 miles northwest of Minneapolis. The sheriff’s office said on its Facebook page that Ethan was found safe with his dog about 1:50 a.m. Wednesday, about 1.5 miles from his home. He was brought to a hospital to be checked and was cold but otherwise OK, authorities said. One of the more than 600 volunteers who helped search for the boy brought his drone with thermal imaging. The device targeted Ethan and the dog in the cornfield that had already been searched, sheriff’s officials said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Abortion opponents have filed a lawsuit challenging a local ordinance that will restrict noise levels and require protesters to remain a certain distance from the entrance of health care facilities. The lawsuit says the Jackson ordinance unconstitutionally limits free-speech rights as people try to persuade women not to end pregnancies. Owners of nearby shops and restaurants have complained about commotion outside Mississippi’s only abortion clinic, Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The bright pink clinic is in the eclectic Fondren neighborhood. Some protesters use bullhorns, and the clinic plays loud music to cover the sound. Jackson City Council members adopted the ordinance Oct. 1, and it is scheduled to take effect Oct. 31. Clinic workers have said protesters harass women.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State Auditor Nicole Galloway says the state isn’t saving enough money to avoid having to cut spending or raise taxes in the event of a recession. Galloway released a report Tuesday suggesting lawmakers come up with a way to save more money than is currently allowed by the state constitution to be kept in the Budget Reserve Fund. The fund was capped at $642 million to start the current fiscal year. That’s because the constitution limits the fund to 7.5% of net general revenue, with a maximum of 10% under special legislative approval. Galloway pointed to a 2018 study by Moody’s Analytics that estimated Missouri would need about $1.3 billion in reserves to survive a moderate recession without cutting spending or raising taxes, or $2 billion to survive a severe recession.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state is considering five sites for a new history museum. Lee Newspapers of Montana reports the possibilities include upgrading the Montana Historical Society building and adding another building nearby or purchasing property at the former site of the Capital Hill Mall in Helena. Other candidates include a spot east of St. Peter’s Health, land the state owns near the Department of Transportation building on the east side of Helena and property available for long-term lease near the airport. The 2019 Legislature approved an increase in the state’s lodging tax to help pay for the project, which would allow the Montana Historical Society to display a larger share of the state’s collection.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A group of business, education and government leaders has launched an initiative to grow the state’s pool of tech workers. CQuence Health CEO Mike Cassling, who chairs the newly formed Nebraska Tech Collaborative, says the state is losing jobs at an alarming rate because Nebraska companies are choosing to expand elsewhere or not at all due to a lack of qualified workers. He says that there isn’t enough awareness in Nebraska of the tech jobs available; that more tech education is needed, especially in K-12 schools; and that more women and minority workers need to be recruited and developed. “This is an issue where failure is not an option,” Cassling told the Omaha World-Herald. “We are definitely behind other states, other cities, all around us.”\n\nNevada\n\nGerlach: Burning Man’s theme next year is set to blow Burners’ minds and thrill “Rick and Morty” fans. Despite sardonic speculation that Burning Man could go with a “Hindsight 2020” theme, the organization announced Tuesday that it was instead going with the theme of “The Multiverse,” a physics theory based in the idea that there are some number of universes beyond ours, if not infinite. The theme of Burning Man, which hosts 80,000 people in northern Nevada’s Black Rock Desert each year, informs the aesthetic of the man sculpture and Black Rock City, as well as other secondary art. In the animated adult series “Rick and Morty,” Rick, a sociopathic scientist grandfather, and his grandson, Morty, embark on endless adventures across space and time in the multiverse, but the mutliverse is a serious concept initially introduced by physicist Hugh Everett in 1957.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: A research center at the University of New Hampshire is getting a federal grant to support police officers and others who investigate crimes involving child sexual abuse images. Officials say a surge of such images online and new technology designed to intercept them mean more investigators are being hired to review such material, but doing so can have toxic effects on their mental health. The university’s Crimes Against Children Research Center will use a three-year grant to interview police and forensic examiners across the country to identify best practices for workload, counseling and debriefing. The center also will use its findings to develop a screening instrument to help agencies assess whether candidates are suitable for such work. The funding comes from the National Institute of Justice.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHackensack: A Jersey-based group of former A-list session musicians that has toured together since 2012 is receiving an award. The Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee, is giving The Hit Men its “Road Warrior” award later this month. The group will play a concert in Nashville on Oct. 28. The hall of fame recognizes the often-unsung musicians who have backed legendary pop performers. Former members of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons initially formed The Hit Men in northern New Jersey and began touring to capitalize on the success of the Broadway musical “Jersey Boys,” which showcased Valli’s music and career. They added studio musicians who had recorded and toured with a who’s who of rock superstars in the 1960s and ’70s. The group continues to play concerts around the country.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest police force wants to go slow and low. The Albuquerque Police Department is inviting high school students to design the department’s first lowrider patrol car. The winner of the competition will have his or her artwork displayed on the car’s hood and will receive a $5,000 scholarship. Officials say the design must be free of offensive, inappropriate or gang-related material. The contest winner will be selected by the Albuquerque Police Department’s Southwest Area Command Program Response Team. Lowriders are custom cars dropped low to the ground with murals and sometimes hydraulics. The vehicles are popular among Mexican Americans in New Mexico, Texas and California.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Museum of Modern Art’s new $450 million, 47,000-square-foot expansion offers visitors more than much-needed elbow room. It emphasizes new juxtapositions of works to encourage broader perspectives and new narratives. The revamped MoMA, a third bigger than the old one, opens to the public Oct. 21. While iconic works by the likes of Monet, Van Gogh, Picasso and Pollock remain dependably on view, visitors are invited to see them in a new light, now displayed side by side with less familiar works by women and minorities, as well as artists from places like Africa, South America and Asia. The goal is to rethink the familiar and make Modernism feel fresh and challenging again. The revamped MoMA promises to rotate many of the works in its galleries every six months.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nKill Devil Hills: The National Park Service says a bust of Orville Wright that was stolen from the Wright Brothers National Memorial on the North Carolina coast has been found. A news release from the park service Tuesday said a visitor to the beach at Kill Devil Hills called authorities in Dare County to say the bust was tucked into some dunes. The park service said initially that the monument was damaged either Saturday evening or Sunday morning. The granite base on which the bust was mounted had been toppled and damaged. An investigation continues into the theft as well as damage to the granite base. Homeowners have been asked to review security video footage for suspicious activity. The memorial honors aviation pioneers Wilbur and Orville Wright.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A clinic is accused of participating in kickback schemes that have cost the federal government millions of dollars in fraudulent Medicare and Medicaid claims. A whistleblower complaint brought against Bismarck’s Mid Dakota Clinic and its building partnership alleges that doctors referred patients to the clinic’s surgical center, allowing them to increase their pay in the form of profits from the center. The document says Mid Dakota Clinic had a similar kickback arrangement with another physician group in Bismarck. The suit was filed in January 2017 by former Mid Dakota CEO Jeffrey Neuberger and unsealed last month. The federal anti-kickback law is meant to prevent abuses that occur when a person profits from a patient referral. That often includes ordering unnecessary procedures.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A new state law taking effect Thursday raises the minimum age to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21. Ohio is one of 18 states that have raised the minimum age for purchasing cigarettes, cigars, electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products. The law signed in July by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine also applies to rolling papers, filters, and other smoking and vaping accessories. Violations could lead to penalties for both the seller and buyer. State officials say it also will become illegal to give such products to someone under 21. The governor and other supporters of the change say the new law is intended to help prevent children from becoming smokers. National statistics have shown Ohio has one of the highest rates of adult smokers at just over 21%.\n\nOklahoma\n\nAda: For the past 15 years, casino gambling has been a financial boon for the state and many of the Native American tribes located there. Tribal casinos generate more than $2 billion a year, with $139 million going to the state last year to fund education. But the financial windfall has increased more than the tribes’ wealth. It has also brought influence in many towns, where casinos are major employers and tribes fund local services. The tribes are now locked in a showdown with Oklahoma’s new Republican governor, Kevin Stitt, who has demanded a larger share of casino revenue for the state. The tribes have refused. Many now question whether even a popular governor now has the clout to challenge the popular support for the tribes.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Two counties in the state are offering the opportunity for U.S. military members, their dependents and others living overseas to vote in special elections this November with smartphones, officials announced Wednesday. While some technology experts have warned that such systems could be insecure, the two counties have already advised hundreds of registered voters living overseas about the option to cast ballots using blockchain-based mobile voting. Oregon residents normally vote by mail. Jackson County Clerk Christine Walker expressed confidence in the system and said it will help ensure that the votes of those overseas will be counted. She noted that overseas mail systems can be unreliable and said she was very worried that Washington’s threats to pull the United States from the United Nations’ postal agency would prevent voters overseas from casting ballots.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nJim Thorpe: A popular excursion train in eastern Pennsylvania says it is shutting down next month because of a tax dispute with the local borough. The Lehigh Gorge Scenic Railway says it will cease operations Nov. 25 after 15 years of running vintage coaches along the Lehigh River through Glen Onoko and into Lehigh Gorge State Park. In September, a tax collection agency filed suit saying Jim Thorpe borough was owed about $95,000 in unpaid amusement taxes from 2016 to 2018. Railway’s owner – Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad – maintains that the ride is not an amusement and is exempt. It says the company makes its money from freight. Mayor Michael Sofranko says officials were “blindsided” and had been trying for weeks to meet with the company and work out an agreement.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A group protesting federal immigration policies is planning to “occupy” the Statehouse. Former Democratic state Rep. Aaron Regunberg, who helps lead Never Again Action Rhode Island, says he’s bringing a toothbrush and pillow Thursday. The group plans to stay through the evening to coincide with Sukkot, the Jewish holiday commemorating the desert wandering of the Jews. Capitol Police say anyone in the building after it closes at 4:30 p.m. could face arrest for trespassing if they refuse to leave. Regunberg says the group wants state leaders to close a Central Falls detention facility used by federal immigration officials and stop collaborating. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo’s spokesman says the governor understands there are concerns about the facility and is open to reviewing future legislation about the issue.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A group of state senators is studying what South Carolina needs to do if it wants to increase the pace of widening interstate highways. The Special Interstate Subcommittee met Wednesday for the first time, getting an overview of projects in the works, like widening Interstate 85 near the North Carolina state line and Interstate 20 west of Columbia. State Department of Transportation Secretary Christy Hall also detailed future projects like the $1.6 billion to untangle the intersection of I-20, I-26 and I-126 in Columbia. Hall says lawmakers’ 2017 decision to increase the gas tax 12 cents over five years and other fees are helping accelerate the pace of work, but some projects like widening I-26 from Columbia to Charleston or Interstate 526 around Charleston are still decades away.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A local psychology teacher has been recognized as one of the top educators in the U.S. Alison Ter Horst was surprised Wednesday with a check for $25,000 at Washington High School. Ter Horst was one of only 40 teachers selected nationwide – and the only one in South Dakota this year – to receive a Milken Educator Award. The Milken Family Foundation uses the awards – dubbed “the Oscars of Teaching” – to recognize inspirational teachers who encourage others to join the field. Ter Horst was recognized in part for helping create a dual-credit program that lets students get college credit if they enroll in a teacher preparation program after graduation. She’s been teaching for about 12 years but says she originally wanted to be a guidance counselor.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s attorney general says a new law allows felons to have antique guns. An opinion last week by Attorney General Herbert Slatery’s office says the law removed a ban on guns manufactured before 1899, certain replicas and black powder-using muzzleloaders for people convicted of felonies or certain misdemeanors. The bill passed this year without any state lawmakers voting against it. The change took effect in May. Federal law doesn’t prohibit felons from having antique guns. But a 2015 state attorney general’s opinion concluded that Tennessee law generally prohibited it. Republican bill sponsor Sen. Kerry Roberts requested the legal opinion. He says the antiquated weapons do not use modern ammunition and said his research found they are seldom if ever used to commit a violent crime.\n\nTexas\n\nPoint Comfort: Formosa Plastics Corp. has agreed to pay $50million to settle allegations that a company plant spilled tons of pellets into waterways near the Gulf of Mexico. Texas RioGrande Legal Aid on Tuesday announced the agreement involving the Formosa plant in Point Comfort. A judge in Houston will consider approving the settlement, to be paid over five years into a fund supporting environmental water projects. U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt in June ruled in favor of people who alleged the Formosa plant violated clean water laws through discharges into Lavaca Bay and Cox Creek that began in 2016. Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, representing plaintiffs, said the consent decree means Formosa agrees to “zero discharge” of plastics and will clean existing pollution.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A proposed conversion therapy ban in the state is in danger of being derailed after the influential Church of Jesus of Christ of Latter-day Saints came out Tuesday night in opposition, just months after it said it wouldn’t stand in the way of a similar measure under consideration. The church said in a statement that the regulatory rule prohibiting Utah psychologists from engaging in LGBTQ conversion therapy with minors would fail to safeguard religious beliefs and doesn’t account for “important realities of gender identity in the development of children.” State regulators crafted the rule at the request of Republican Gov. Gary Herbert, a member of the church, who in June asked for a set of rules after a similar bill died in the Legislature despite the church not taking a position.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: A feasibility study has found that the shuttered College of St. Joseph could be converted for use as an education center. College officials have been looking for a way to put the campus to use that maintains the original education mission. They are considering the possibility of converting it to the CSJ Center for Excellence and Innovation. The proposed center would provide non-degree education and workforce development, accelerator programs, office space and more. The college is among three independent Vermont colleges that closed last spring. The Rutland Herald reports the next phase will be to attract potential investors for the proposed center.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: A group dedicated to preserving the city’s Confederate monuments is asking the city to pay for an inspection of recent vandalism to two monument pedestals and install cameras in the area. The monuments, like others around the country, have been a source of controversy for years. White nationalists rallied in Charlottesville two years ago in part to protest the city’s plans to remove a Gen. Robert E. Lee monument. The Monument Fund sent a letter to Charlottesville’s city attorney Tuesday, saying monuments of Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson were vandalized in mid-September and again Monday. The group asks the city to investigate. A city spokesman couldn’t immediately be reached for comment Wednesday.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A federal judge has ruled the city may consult outside experts to study ways to fix flaws in the Seattle Police Department’s internal investigations of officers accused of misconduct. But The Seattle Times reports U.S. District Judge James Robart, who is presiding over a 2012 consent decree requiring the city to address allegations of excessive force and biased policing, warned the city against using the results to justify its current accountability system. If that occurs, “then the exercise will be a failure, reform will be delayed, and full and effective compliance with the Consent Decree will recede further into the future,” Robart wrote in a nine-page order. Robart’s ruling made clear the city must correct deficiencies in the accountability system that prompted him to rule in May that the police department had fallen partially out of compliance with the consent decree.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state is offering free rain barrels to schools. The Department of Environmental Protection says schools with current or planned flower or vegetable gardens will be given priority. Applications on the agency’s Rain Barrel Program website must be submitted by Nov. 1. The project’s goal is to teach students about stormwater pollution and how collecting rainwater helps reduce pesticides, bacteria and litter in waterways. The program offers hands-on installation of the rain barrel, including the rain barrel and parts kit, with student participation and will be paired with a one-hour water education session.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case seeking to dramatically scale back the ability of governors to change the intent of lawmakers through partial budget vetoes. Rick Esenberg, leader of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty that brought the case, said Wednesday that the court had agreed to take the case, skipping the usual process of lawsuits working their way up from lower courts. Wisconsin’s Supreme Court is controlled 5-2 by conservatives. The case seeks to reverse more than four decades of precedent upholding the governor’s broad veto power. The lawsuit seeks to overturn four of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ 78 partial vetoes, arguing that he improperly and unlawfully used his broad constitutional powers to create new laws never approved by the Legislature.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The University of Wyoming could lose the papers of a longtime “Superman” comic book editor after his son took offense to comments by U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. The Casper Star-Tribune reports Hank Weisinger contacted the university’s American Heritage Center on Tuesday demanding the return of the collected papers of Mort Weisinger. The elder Weisinger spent three decades as the story editor of the “Superman” series published by DC Comics Inc. Hank Weisinger says his action was prompted by comments Cheney made Monday placing blame for Turkey’s Oct. 9 invasion of Syria on presidential impeachment proceedings by Democrats. Weisinger says he does not want his father’s papers at a university represented by a member of Congress he perceives as opposing Superman’s values of “truth, justice and the American way.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/17"}]}

Melody Eagan, an attorney with Birmingham-based Lightfoot, Franklin and White, which represented two families and two physicians in a lawsuit titled Ladinsky v. Ivey, wrote in an email Monday that they planned to “file a new case in the immediate future” against SB 184. Gov. Kay Ivey signed the law April 8; it will take effect in early May. “We promptly filed a lawsuit on behalf of two families and two doctors on the day Governor Ivey signed the bill,” Eagan wrote. “After filing that case, we are hearing from numerous Alabama families, including patients facing loss of critical medical care and parents facing potential criminal penalties. We also are hearing from numerous medical providers and others who care for transgender youth.” The law subjects doctors who prescribe puberty blockers and hormones to transgender youth to a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. It also forbids public and private school personnel from withholding information about a student’s confusion over their gender identity and bans genital surgeries (except circumcisions) on minors. Health professionals have said surgeons don’t perform those procedures on youth in Alabama.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Officials have purchased a gondola in Austria for a city-owned ski area in Alaska’s capital city, but questions remain about the installation and long-term plans for the gondola. City officials have expressed interest in working with an Alaska Native corporation on the project. Eaglecrest Ski Area’s general manager and a city project manager recently visited a ski area in Austria to examine the lift and sign a sale agreement for $1.33 million, the Juneau Empire reports. Deputy City Manager Robert Barr said the city is seeking bids from transport companies to bring the gondola to Juneau. Eaglecrest has said its leaders have been looking for ways to expand summer operations and create opportunities for a more sustainable year-round model. The ski area, on its website, said it would work with planners, engineers and contractors on the best placement for the new infrastructure. Eaglecrest is on Douglas Island. City leaders last week authorized City Manager Rorie Watt to negotiate an agreement with Goldbelt Inc., an Alaska Native corporation that operates a tram near downtown Juneau and owns land near Eaglecrest. Watt, in a memo to the city’s Assembly, said Goldbelt has expressed interest in providing funding for up to $10 million for the installation of the gondola and “other related improvements.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Metro-area eviction filings are climbing back to pre-pandemic levels despite hundreds of millions of dollars in rental aid going to landlords. Moratoriums helped keep many Valley renters in their homes, but those are over. Now tenants, some still trying to pay back rent after struggling during COVID-19, are also facing skyrocketing rents and wages that aren’t keeping up. And Maricopa County renters who had evictions filed against them during the pandemic are facing record judgments despite all that relief money funneled to landlords. Housing researchers and tenant advocates say the rent-income gap, the lightning speed of Arizona’s eviction process and a lack of legal support for renters led to an eviction crisis in the Phoenix area that started even before the pandemic. An Arizona Republic analysis found eviction filings in Maricopa County hit a five-year high in 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic. In January, February and March of this year, Valley evictions reached about 91% of filings from the first three months of 2019. About 65,000 Arizona renters believe they will likely be evicted in the next two months, according to the latest Census Pulse Survey. State law allows a landlord to initiate an eviction as soon as five days after a tenant misses rent, and the tenant is typically locked out within three weeks of filing.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders continues to far outpace her rivals in fundraising and spending for her bid for governor, the latest campaign finance reports show. Sanders, the daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee, reported raising more than $680,000 last month in her bid for Arkansas governor by Friday’s deadline for monthly campaign finance reports. She faces former talk radio host and podcaster Doc Washburn in next month’s Republican primary. Sanders spent more than $834,000 during the month and reported having nearly $7.4 million on hand. Sanders has raised more than $14 million since announcing her candidacy last year, a record for a governor’s race in the state. Sanders’ closest rival among the Democrats, Chris Jones, raised more than $120,000 in March and spent more than $213,000. Jones’ campaign reported having nearly $94,000 on hand. Jones faces Anthony Bland, Jay Martin, James “Rus” Russell and Supha Xayprasith-Mays in next month’s Democratic primary. Term limits bar Republican incumbent Asa Hutchinson from seeking reelection.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A $1.8 billion facility intended to connect Metro light-rail lines under downtown Los Angeles is 90% complete, and test runs of trains are underway, officials said Monday. The Regional Connector Project was designed to save commuters’ time by eliminating transfers between trains, allowing one-seat rides across Los Angeles County. “The trackwork, the rail guideways, the platform areas are now complete,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told a press conference. “We’ve been waiting for like 10 years.” County Supervisor Hilda L. Solis, board chair of the Los Angeles County Transportation Authority, said the connector will open later this year. The overall project is a 1.9-mile underground light-rail extension connecting the A, E and L lines and three new stations, including the Grand Av Arts/Bunker Hill Station about 100 feet beneath ground level.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The state is expecting the birth of another litter of wolf pups any day now, creating both excitement and concern over the natural rebirth of a predator with a long, human-induced absence from the state. The breeding pair of wolves that naturally migrated into the state last year formed the pack north of Walden in Jackson County with the birth of six pups. Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials had watched the pups for some time before announcing their birth in early June as the first litter of wolf pups born in the state in several decades. And soon that pack could grow, as wolves typically have pups from mid-April through mid-May. State wildlife officials said staff have not seen evidence of denning behavior or any sign of a new litter from the pack this year. “How could it get any better that soon we will see more pups,” said Dale Baker, a wolf advocate from Fort Collins who volunteered to watch North Park rancher Don Gittleson’s cattle herd after Gittleson lost three cows to the wolfpack. “The folks in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming had a big outcry when they brought wolves there, but now that this is naturally happening here, it seems like there should be less of an outcry.” Gittleson said the pack’s adult female was observed in heat, ready to mate in a pasture on his property in February.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The city’s aging housing is creating public health concerns on top of squeezing a tight market. Shiela Hayes, president of the NAACP Norwich Branch, said the pandemic laid bare the importance of having the city address housing quality. “We can no longer act like that neighborhood, or that section, or that backstreet (can) continue to be underperforming housing stock; we don’t have that kind of luxury,” Hayes said. The majority of resident-owned homes in the state are 60 years or older, said Sam Giffin, a policy and data analyst for the Hartford-based Open Communities Alliance, as housing production has fallen since the baby boom – more so in Connecticut than in other parts of New England. Some of the risks that come from older houses include paint and other sources of lead. “There’s concern across the state that our old housing stock is a concern to both health and safety,” Giffin said. Hayes said Norwich has a lot of older housing, especially in Greenville, Taftville and downtown, where there are cheaper, privately held, multi-rental units converted from single-family homes. “They’re old, and they take a lot of maintenance,” Hayes said. Maintenance is usually not a matter of upgrading a single unit but multiple units at the same time, which means more money must be spent to get them up to code.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: President Joe Biden will return to his alma mater to give the commencement speech at the University of Delaware graduation in May, the university announced Tuesday. It’s the first time a sitting president will speak at a UD graduation ceremony. Biden is no stranger to visiting UD or giving graduation speeches there. May’s ceremony will be his fifth time speaking at commencement at the school – last in 2014, while serving as vice president. “(Biden’s) commitment to a lifetime of public service is an inspiring example for our graduates, as well as all our students and alumni, of what they can accomplish with a UD education, whatever path they may choose in life,” University President Dennis Assanis said in a statement. Students and their guests should expect heightened security at the graduation ceremony, UD spokeswoman Andrea Boyle Tippett said. Secret Service members will also likely visit campus to prepare with UD Police Department officers prior to the president’s arrival. The ceremony to honor this year’s 4,000-student graduating class is slated to start at 9:30 a.m. at Delaware Stadium on May 28. The event will also be livestreamed.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Museum of American History is opening a permanent entertainment exhibit in December, WUSA-TV reports. “Through the National Museum of American History’s extraordinary collection of theater, music, sports, movie and television objects, the exhibition Entertainment Nation will feature a powerful, ever-changing selection of objects and interactive experiences,” the museum said in a press release. “Through the objects and their stories, the exhibition will explore how, for over 150 years, entertainment has provided a forum for important national conversations about who we are, and who we want to be.” Some of the items set to go on display can be previewed online, including pop culture relics like Prince’s yellow “cloud” guitar, Muhammad Ali’s boxing robe, and Tejana singer Selena’s leather jacket and pants. The goal is to highlight how entertainment has shaped the nation’s society and shine a light on entertainers who have broken barriers. The permanent bilingual exhibit is set to open Dec. 9.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state Department of Education rejected more than 50 mathematics textbooks – about 40% of those submitted – for failing to meet Florida’s new learning standards or because they “contained prohibited topics” that included references to critical race theory. Now, the only publisher approved by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the department for K-5 mathematics is Houston, Texas-based Accelerate Learning. “In the subject area as large as mathematics for grades K through five, it is unusual for there only to be one publisher to choose from,” said Billy Epting, assistant superintendent for academic services for Leon County Schools. DOE said more than half the textbooks being disallowed incorporated “prohibited topics or unsolicited strategies, including CRT,” which is an academic framework that is rarely seen outside of higher education. The term has become a highly charged catch-all buzzword for discussion of diversity of inclusion. Other books were not allowed because publishers “rebranded” Common Core Standards. DeSantis has taken a lead role nationally in Republican efforts to aggressively push back against liberal cultural values and what he calls “woke indoctrination.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Students at Druid Hills High School put together a short documentary video, shot on iPhones, to show the troubling conditions inside their learning environment. The video opens with a student explaining how human waste flows up from the ground and floods an area where he and his friends eat lunch. The high schoolers’ footage shows the classrooms, hallways and bathrooms crumbling around them. Plaster falls off walls, and water drips around electrical outlets. So much water has leaked into the weight room that it oozes up from the floor when a student steps on it. Another student demonstrates how one of the holes in a ceiling is so large that he can put his entire hand through it. “You can tell someone about the conditions, but when you visually see it, it’s a lot more impactful,” sophomore Harley Martz, one of the video’s producers, told the Associated Press in an interview. “Some of the things we pointed out in the video are very undeniable.” In the video, Druid Hills junior Montrice Berry describes the assault on the senses: “As you walk through the school now, you can smell the mold, and it’s kind of really nasty. So I tend to walk outside just so I can avoid the smell.” The video, which has garnered more than 40,000 views since it was posted on YouTube this month, has prompted outrage among some parents in the suburban area just east of Atlanta who want repairs made. It was produced after the DeKalb County School Board in February removed Druid Hills from a list of schools in need of priority renovations.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Federal authorities have begun monitoring the state’s wastewater for COVID-19, while Hawaii expects its own monitoring program to be fully operational this summer, officials said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been testing in the islands as part of its National Wastewater Surveillance System, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The agency posts wastewater data on its COVID Data Tracker website, denoted by dots on a U.S. map. Data from Hawaii hasn’t been included yet due to “a technical glitch being resolved with how the points are displayed on the map,” said CDC spokesperson Nick Spinelli. The agency said it would also display data from the Hawaii Department of Health once the state is able to submit its own figures. More than 30 states have been funded to participate in the CDC program, but some are still getting their collection efforts up and running. Several issues delayed Hawaii’s early plans to set up its own statewide monitoring program. The state faced a six-month wait for shipment of sample-collection machines, which were back-ordered due to high demand. Federal funds paid for the the monitoring equipment at a cost of about $100,000. The equipment is now in place, as are protocols.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory have completed a rare overhaul of one of the world’s most powerful nuclear test reactors, and normal operations are expected to resume later this spring, officials said Monday. The 11-month outage at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Test Reactor in eastern Idaho allowed a core overhaul that’s done, on average, about every 10 years. The change-out was the sixth since the reactor started operating in 1967 and the first in 17 years. “Overall, I’m very pleased with the ATR workforce and teamwork they demonstrated during the longest and most complex outage in our history,” said Sean O’Kelly, associate lab director for the Idaho National Laboratory’s Advanced Test Reactor Complex. He said the coronavirus pandemic and supply chain issues caused some delays beyond the best-case scenario of completing the work in nine months. Experiments at the reactor help the U.S. Navy’s nuclear-powered war fleet stay at sea longer, bolster NASA’s space exploration, and advance lifesaving medical treatments. The reactor also plays a key role in the effort to keep commercial nuclear power plants running longer and creating new and safer reactors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The reactor is now going through readiness assessments, instrument calibrations and low-power system checks.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Federal authorities on Monday said they will not criminally charge Jason Van Dyke, the Chicago police officer convicted of murder in the 2014 shooting death of Black teenager Laquan McDonald. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Chicago said in a news release that the decision was made after consulting with the McDonald family and that the “family was in agreement not to pursue a second prosecution.” According to the release, prosecuting Van Dyke on federal charges would have been much more difficult than it was to prosecute him in state court because the burden of proof is far higher. Federal prosecutors “would have to prove not only that Mr. Van Dyke acted with the deliberate and specific intent to do something the law forbids, but also that his actions were not the result of mistake, fear, negligence, or bad judgment,” the office said in the release. “It requires federal prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable doubt what Mr. Van Dyke was thinking when he used deadly force, and that he knew such force was excessive.” Van Dyke, who was captured on video shooting the teenager 16 times, was convicted in Chicago in 2018 of second-degree murder and aggravated battery and sentenced to 81 months in state prison. The former officer served less than half that sentence before he was released from prison in February.\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel: A priest who was “suspended from public ministry” last month is suing a man who came forward with allegations about the priest’s behavior. James De Oreo, who was an associate pastor at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church, was suspended March 11 after allegations of “inappropriate conduct with a minor.” The priest filed a lawsuit April 4 against the man who wrote two letters in 2021 to the Diocese of Lafayette-in-Indiana about De Oreo’s behavior toward him when he was a teen attending St. Alphonsus Liguori Catholic Church in Zionsville. The man said he was considering becoming a priest, and De Oreo used his position of power to emotionally abuse, sexually harass and groom him for sexual abuse. This led to an eating disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder as well as “extreme emotional distress” from acts that his lawyer said were intentional and preventable. In the lawsuit, De Oreo disputed the man’s claims and said there was no “intentional infliction of emotional distress.” He said the man’s allegations could lead to “irreparable harm” that would prevent him from participating in parish ministry and doing his job. Diocese spokesperson Gabby Hlavek confirmed the diocese was aware of the De Oreo’s lawsuit but didn’t comment further.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A ride at an amusement park where an 11-year-old boy died last summer will not reopen this year, the park’s new owners said. Bill Lentz, general manager of Adventureland in Altoona, said officials have not determined if the Raging River ride will ever reopen. Michael Jaramillo died and his brother and father were injured July 3, 2021, after their raft overturned and trapped them in the water. Park owner Palace Entertainment has hired the ride’s original maker, Intamin Amusement Rides, to determine what would be needed to make the ride safe, Lentz said. That project could take several months, he said. Palace Entertainment, the U.S. subsidiary of Madrid-based Parques Reunidos, bought the almost 48-year-old theme park in December. Ryan Best, the attorney representing the Jaramillo family, of Marion, Iowa, said recently that his clients believe the ride should never be reopened. The Iowa Division of Labor, which licenses amusement park rides, required Adventureland to make several changes and receive approval from the ride’s manufacturer or a certified engineer to reopen the ride.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Under legislation signed Monday by Gov. Laura Kelly, fairgoers will be able to more widely consume adult beverages at the Kansas State Fair. The proposal, Senate Bill 2, will allow beer and wine to be consumed outside designated areas. The fairground’s current liquor policy confines drinking to the grandstands and certain beer gardens throughout the property. It will also pave the way for the sale of hard liquor. Fair officials have not yet determined if the policies will be in place for the 2022 edition of the fair, scheduled to take place Sept. 9-18, or if they will instead roll out next year. The policy was intended to help the fair recoup revenue lost after the 2020 event was canceled due to COVID-19. Legislative proponents of the bill also argued it was in line with what consumers were demanding from the event. “People wanted to have more wine and more outlets at the state fairground. They also wanted spirits,” Rep. Louis Ruiz, D-Kansas City, said on the floor of the Kansas House. “They wanted to walk around to look at animals ...with a daiquiri.” But the move was not without its critics, some of whom argued making liquor more readily accessible would harm the fair’s family-friendly nature. Some Wichita-area lawmakers pointed to the city’s vaunted Riverfest festival, which opted to expand liquor sales, dividing residents.\n\nKentucky\n\nBowling Green: The National Corvette Museum says it’s adding an education gallery that will feature artifacts and interactive technology to share the brand’s story. Construction of the 2,000-square-foot gallery is set to begin in late May, museum officials said. The gallery is scheduled to open late this year or in early 2023 at the Bowling Green-based museum. “This new gallery will educate, engage and entertain our guests,” said Sharon Brawner, the museum’s president and CEO. The gallery will provide a state-of-the-art educational experience geared toward the next generation of Corvette enthusiasts, the museum said. “The new education gallery will be designed for both children and adults to enjoy, featuring artifacts and interactive technology celebrating the unique story of Corvette,” said museum educator Deb Howard. The project was made possible through the generosity of donors Tim and Melanie McMichael of Gypsum, Colorado, the museum said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A proposal to let New Orleans adopt a set of gun control measures than are stronger than the state currently allows was overwhelmingly rejected Tuesday by a state House panel. The Criminal Justice Committee voted 9-1 against the measure by state Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans, despite calls for passage from a City Council member, a deputy chief of the police department and District Attorney Jason Williams. Among the specified laws the city would have been allowed to pass were the bill to become law: a requirement that loss or theft of firearms be reported to police, prohibition against openly carrying firearms at public events requiring government permits, and prohibition on carrying firearms where alcohol is being served. Backers of the bill said it would help fight increasing violent crime by helping prevent gun trafficking or the use of guns at large events where alcohol is consumed, in a city known for festivals and Bourbon Street nightlife. “At the end of the day, we’re asking this committee and the Legislature to allow New Orleans to carve out legislation that affects the unique problems that we have,” said City Council member Eugene Green. Gun control advocates said the laws the city sought to pass would be ineffective and slammed the bill as an attack on Second Amendment rights.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: The arrival of the first large cruise ship in two and a half years in Maine is another signal tourism is getting closer to pre-pandemic normalcy. Last year, more than 15.6 million visitors came to the state – a third more than made the trip the year before, at the start of the pandemic, officials said. But there were no large cruise ships until the arrival of the Norwegian Pearl in the waters off Bar Harbor. The ship dropped anchor in Frenchman Bay, and visitors were ferried to shore on tenders. “It’s exciting to see these ships and their passengers coming back to Maine,” said Sarah Flink, executive director of CruiseMaine. Cruise ships could restore some visitation. The number of visitors last year remained about a million below 2019, before the pandemic. Cruise ships made 409 port calls and brought 450,000 passengers in 2019. One positive sign from the 2021 tourism numbers is that spending soared. Spending grew 63.7% from 2020 and 20.3% from 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A former small-city mayor who admitted to posting nude photos of his ex-girlfriend on Reddit will not have to spend time behind bars under a plea deal announced by the state prosecutor’s office on Monday. Former Cambridge Mayor Andrew Bradshaw pleaded guilty to five counts of distributing revenge porn online and was sentenced to a year and a day for each of the five counts, with all the incarceration time suspended. He also was sentenced to three years of supervised probation and fined $1,000 for each count. Bradshaw was ordered to pay $750 in restitution to the victim and to perform 100 hours of community service. The ex-mayor had faced a maximum penalty of two years’ incarceration and a $5,000 fine for each count. Bradshaw pleaded guilty to posting nude photos of a woman with whom he was once in a relationship after the relationship had ended. The woman contacted authorities in May after learning the photos were posted on Reddit. She told authorities she had sent the photos only to Bradshaw while they were in an intimate relationship, and she didn’t give him permission to redistribute them. Investigators discovered Bradshaw had made numerous separate public posts that contained at least 10 unique visual representations of the victim, many with language related to humiliation and degradation, the state prosecutor’s office said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A shooting at an MBTA station in the city left one person injured Monday, according to transit police. Officers were called to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s Ruggles Station shortly after 6 p.m. on reports of shots fired. At an area where buses stop for passengers, officers found a man suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. The man was taken to a hospital with injuries that were considered serious but not life-threatening, police said. No arrests had been made in the shooting. Police said they were investigating and would continue to look for suspects. Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden denounced the shooting and said gun violence “is something that we’ve really got to lay a hold of and take care of.” “Every time there’s a shooting, there are multiple victims,” Hayden said, according to WCVB-TV. “There’s obviously the victim that’s shot, but there’s also the community at large.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state has reached a 19.3% recycling rate, an increase of 35.4% from prior to 2019, according to an analysis the state of Michigan released Monday ahead of Earth Day on Friday. Before 2019, the state estimated Michigan’s recycling rate, the rate at which recyclable materials are recycled from waste, was 14.25%. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy estimates the state now has a 35.4% recycling rate. Increasing access to recycling services has helped the state to increase recycling, EGLE Director Liesl Clark said at a news conference Monday. More than 75% of the state’s households have access to either curbside recycling bins or drop-off sites in their communities. The increase in recycling equals out to Michigan recycling 500,000 more tons of recyclable materials a year, according to EGLE. Since 2019, more than $460 million has been invested into technology for recycling and maintaining existing recycling infrastructure, Clark said, all in an effort to help Michigan reach its goals to fight climate change and reach a 45% recycling rate by 2030. This Thursday, the state will release a plan outlining a 30-year strategy to make Michigan a carbon neutral state by 2050. A rough draft of the plan was released earlier this year.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Roseville School District has settled two federal lawsuits accusing a former second grade teacher of discriminating against Black students. The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports the district settled the cases privately, and terms were not disclosed. One case was settled last week and the other in January, according to court records. The lawsuits accused Geraldine Cook of making the Black students in her class sit apart from their peers in 2019. She allegedly grabbed a girl’s arm, tearing her shirt, and choked a boy after he gargled water and made him walk to the principal’s office with his hands behind his back. The mothers of the girl whose shirt was torn and the boy who was choked filed the lawsuits. Cook taught at Harambee Elementary, a year-round racial integration school. She resigned in December 2019.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An assistant chief says the city’s police department is short-staffed, and recruitment and retention are big challenges. Joseph Wade of Jackson Police Department discussed staffing levels Monday during the City Council’s Public Safety Committee meeting, WLBT-TV reports. He said JPD is budgeted for 356 sworn officers but has 258. On the civilian side, JPD is budgeted for 199 employees and has 132. “I went to a leadership class in Ohio, and guess what? They’re having (retention issues),” he said. “It’s not a popular job right now.” JPD loses officers to smaller departments, where officers can earn comparable salaries but answer fewer calls, Wade said. He said the city needs to enforce a state law that would require departments to reimburse JPD for training costs of any officer it hires who has been with Jackson less than three years. Wade said JPD leaders appreciate the premium pay that the City Council approved for police department employees earlier this year. The assistant chief also suggested a signing bonus and a tuition reimbursement program for new officers. Capitol police officers, who work for the state Department of Public Safety, also patrol in parts of Jackson where state government buildings are located.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Regal fritillary butterflies, which subsist on violets and stick to prairie habitats, are disappearing. “They’ve almost been entirely lost from the eastern U.S.,” Chris Barnhart, distinguished professor of biology at Missouri State University, said of the vulnerable insect species. One-third of Missouri used to be covered in tallgrass prairie. Where there’s a decent patch of prairie, regal fritillary butterflies can be seen in good numbers, Barnhart said. However, without extra help, Missouri may lose the “Queen of the Prairie” altogether. MSU and the Missouri Department of Conservation are two years deep into a project to examine the reproduction and survival of the butterflies, developing methods to raise them in captivity and reintroducing them to suitable sites. Missouri has some of the highest numbers of these butterflies, Barnhart said during a tour of MSU’s Temple Hall greenhouse. Fifteen million acres of tallgrass prairie once covered Missouri, said Francis Skalicky, MDC spokesman. “Today, 99% of Missouri’s tallgrass prairie habitat has disappeared, and a number of species that depend on plants found in this habitat have been negatively impacted by the state’s dwindling prairie acreage,” Skalicky said. The regal fritillary butterflies are considered “a species of concern” and at a S3 level of endangerment, Skalicky said.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The board of trustees of the state’s largest school district has voted to allow students additional time to graduate after a public campaign by the family of a student with Down syndrome who otherwise would not have been allowed to attend her senior year with her classmates. Under the policy passed Monday by a 5-3 vote, any student who does not turn 20 before Sept. 10 will be able to enroll in classes at Billings high schools. For students receiving special education services, enrollment will continue as long as the student hasn’t turned 21 before the Sept. 10 deadline, The Billings Gazette reports. The family of Emily Pennington had urged the school district to take advantage of a law passed by the Legislature in 2021 that offered some state funding for students who are receiving special education services to continue attending school as long as they had not turned 21 before Sept. 10 and had not graduated. Schools are not required to participate. Emily repeated kindergarten because she had been dealing with numerous medical issues. She will turn 19 in July, which would have made her ineligible to attend school this fall under the old policy. After the school board declined to hear Emily’s request for a change in the age-out policy, Billings West students staged a brief walk-out in support.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Former U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford, a Democrat who served one term representing the state’s Omaha-centered district, died Tuesday morning. He was 72. Ashford’s family announced his death in a Facebook post, saying that “his death was peaceful though much too premature.” Just two months earlier, Ashford had revealed he was undergoing treatment for brain cancer. Ashford was a state senator from Omaha when he unseated longtime Republican incumbent Lee Terry to represent Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. Ashford lost the seat two years later to current GOP Rep. Don Bacon. He sought the seat again in 2018 but lost the Democratic primary to Kara Eastman. In 2020, his wife, Ann Ferlic Ashford, announced her candidacy for the seat, but she also lost the primary to Eastman. Brad Ashford shook up the general election race by endorsing Bacon over Eastman. An attorney and lifelong Omaha resident, he began his political career in the 1980s as a Democrat but switched parties several times over the years and pitched himself as an independent-minded moderate. Ashford earned his bachelor’s degree from Colgate University in 1971 and his law degree from Creighton University in Omaha in 1974. He worked as an attorney for the Federal Highway Administration in 1974 before opening a private practice the next year. In the 1990s, he became co-owner of the Nebraska Clothing Company.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The Nevada office of the FBI has a new special agent in charge, with the announcement Monday that Spencer Evans will head the bureau’s Las Vegas field office. Evans has held various investigative and leadership positions since joining the FBI in 2004 as an agent in New Haven, Connecticut. His most recent post was as deputy assistant director in human resources at FBI Headquarters in Washington. In Las Vegas, Evans replaces Special Agent in Charge Aaron Rouse, who retired in February after 25 years with the bureau. Rouse arrived in the city in 2016 and headed the Nevada field office during the 2017 mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip that killed 58 people and became the deadliest in modern U.S. history. Two additional deaths later were attributed to the shooting.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMerrimack: A chemical company agreed Monday to providing drinking water to about 1,000 properties in the state that showed elevated levels of toxic industrial compounds associated with serious health conditions. The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services and Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics announced the agreement for properties in the towns of Bedford, Hudson, Litchfield, Londonderry and Merrimack. It also provides a framework should additional properties be affected. “Ensuring safe drinking water is something we take very seriously,” state Attorney General John Formella said in a statement. “This agreement is an important step forward in a continuing, multi-faceted effort to ensure impacted New Hampshire residents have access to clean drinking water.” A spokesperson for Saint-Gobain didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The company, which bought the Merrimack plant from ChemFAB in 2000, initially believed it wasn’t emitting anything harmful. But the state said that changed in 2004 after the company installed more sophisticated technology and realized it was emitting the chemical. After the company alerted the state, DES determined Saint-Gobain was exceeding state air limits for the chemical, and the company agreed to significantly reduce emissions.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The state’s robust sports betting market broke the $1 billion mark for the sixth time last month in terms of the amount of bets taken. But the news was bad in March for seven of the nine casinos that continued to lag behind their in-person gambling revenue levels from before the coronavirus pandemic hit, according to figures released Monday by state gambling regulators. The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement reported the state’s casinos and three horse tracks that take sports bets handled over $1.12 billion worth of such wagers in March, aided by the March Madness college basketball tournament. Yet out of that total, only $66.4 million was kept as sports betting revenue by the casinos and tracks after paying off winning bets, third-party partners and other expenses. The casinos and tracks made $423.6 million in gambling and sports betting revenue in March, up nearly 18% from a year earlier. However, that comparison is flawed because in March 2021, Atlantic City’s casinos were still operating under state-imposed pandemic-related restrictions. Going back two years is also an invalid comparison because the casinos shut down in the middle of March 2020 as the pandemic originally surged.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is getting married, and Vice President Kamala Harris has been picked to officiate. The first-term Democratic governor made the announcement through her personal spokesman Tuesday, saying a small ceremony will be held May 21 in Washington, D.C. No other details about the upcoming ceremony were released. Lujan Grisham, who is running for reelection, will be tying the knot with fiancé Manny Cordova. The couple have been together about 10 years, and Cordova was at her side during an inaugural Mass in Santa Fe before her public swearing-in ceremony Jan. 1, 2019. “We’re delighted to celebrate our wedding in front of family and close friends,” Lujan Grisham and Cordova said in a joint statement. “Like so many New Mexicans, we’ve postponed family celebrations over the past two years during this pandemic. We feel fortunate to be with our loved ones in celebration of our marriage.” The couple initially planned to get married in 2021 but had not set a date, said Jared Leopold, a spokesman for Lujan Grisham. Both Lujan Grisham, 62, and Cordova, 66, were previously married and have adult children and grandchildren. Lujan Grisham was married to her first husband, Gregory Grisham, for more than 20 years until his death in 2004. The son of ranchers, Cordova grew up in a rural community south of Albuquerque. He owns an auto repair shop in Santa Fe.\n\nNew York\n\nBinghamton: About 100,000 customers were without power Tuesday morning in upstate New York as a late-season storm dumped a foot or more of heavy, wet snow on some high-elevation areas. In the Binghamton area, Broome County Executive Jason Garnar declared a state of emergency and issued a travel ban for nonessential workers. Gov. Kathy Hochul said in an interview on Binghamton radio station WNBF that listeners in the area should stay home if they could. “It was a very heavy snow. And as a result, the weight … is snapping these limbs, which is sad when you see your beautiful trees harmed like that,” Hochul said. “But it also can be dangerous for people walking on the streets or walking under power lines or if people are getting into their cars.” Some higher-elevation areas of the Southern Tier had up to 14 inches of snow, though accumulations were less for lower elevations, according to the National Weather Service in Binghamton. “That is pretty typical for a for a late-season storm; you’re going to have quite a bit of elevation dependency,” said meteorologist Bryan Greenblatt. Power outages stretched from the Southern Tier to the Adirondack Mountains, which was forecast to get up to a foot of snow by Tuesday night.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Buncombe County jail detainees have spent up to a week in group holding areas with no blankets, constant light, cold temperatures, and nowhere to sleep but hard surfaces, such as concrete floors, according to several people who spent time behind bars in the local facility. “There’s no cots; they don’t give you a blanket. Everyone is in flip-flops without socks. And all the drunk tanks were full. There’s 10 of you in there. And it’s all concrete,” said Eric Stimson, who said he spent five days trying to find ways to sleep and stay warm in a group cell with an overflowing toilet before being moved to a regular cell for the remainder of his 16-day DUI sentence in January. The harsh conditions were detailed by three detainees and confirmed by the Buncombe County chief public defender. They appear to represent direct violations of state rules meant to protect those in the custody of the jail, most of whom have not been convicted of crimes of which they are charged and are awaiting their day in court. Spokespeople for Sheriff Quentin Miller, who is responsible for managing the jail, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In an attempt to block out light to sleep and find some comfort, detainees took to stuffing their court papers behind COVID-19 masks to use as eye shields, Stimson said, adding that they would stack their slippers to create something like a pillow. As far as COVID-19 infection concerns go, “if you didn’t have COVID coming in, you’ve got it now,” he said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: The future of Minot State University’s sports bubble is up in the air after a blizzard last week caused it to collapse. The university was forced to cancel all the activities that were scheduled in the bubble, which is on the grounds of the athletic facility. The bubble has been used as a fallback location for softball games when weather is poor, Minot Daily News reports. And MSU planned to hold a spring football game in the bubble, which is also used for various sports practices. The athletic staff is meeting this week to begin rescheduling and searching for other places to practice. Athletic director Andy Carter said the university is waiting for the company that supplied the bubble in 2016 to send representatives to assess the damage and how much it would cost to repair it. “It’s covered in snow now,” he said. “You can’t even really get to it right now.” He said a considerable amount of sporting equipment had been stored in the bubble. “It could be a big issue. We don’t even know because we can’t see it. So we don’t know if it’s damaged or it’s just sitting there under the tarp,” he said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A judge has blocked early enforcement of an abortion law signed by Gov. Mike DeWine in December that included additional licensing requirements challenged by the ACLU and Planned Parenthood as unnecessarily onerous. Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Alison Hatheway’s ruling Friday blocked restrictions imposed on two southwest Ohio clinics by the Ohio Department of Health that came before June 21. That date ends a 90-period for compliance that followed its original effective date of March 23. Hatheway issued a temporary restraining order against the law March 2, before it could take effect. The stated goal of the bill was to impose criminal penalties on doctors who fail to give medical care in the extremely rare circumstance of a baby born alive following an abortion attempt. However, provisions were added to the legislation that prevented abortion providers from contracting with backup physicians who teach at or contract with public medical schools. Abortion rights groups said eliminating such a broad swath of physicians to serve as their backups could lead to two clinics in southwest Ohio being closed. The lawsuit argued the requirements would almost certainly have shuttered Women’s Med in Dayton and Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio in suburban Cincinnati.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt signed legislation Monday to allow law enforcement to keep from the public audio or video recordings showing an officer’s line-of-duty death. The measure was drafted after Tulsa police were required under Oklahoma law to release a video of a suspect shooting two officers, one of whom later died. A jury trial began Monday for the man accused of the killing. “This bill is about protecting the dignity not only of our fallen heroes but their fellow officers and surviving family members who can be retraumatized by these recordings,” state Sen. John Haste, R-Broken Arrow, said in a statement. “It can also make it more difficult to seat a jury in such cases.” The bill prohibits the public release of such videos unless a judge determines the public interest outweighs the reason for denial. It also authorizes a deceased officer’s family members to view the audio or video. Prosecutors and defense attorneys retain the right to use such videos in legal proceedings under the new law.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown has signed a bill into law that phases out the state’s agricultural overtime pay exemption. The Capital Press reports Brown wrote in a letter Friday to Senate President Peter Courtney and Speaker of the House Dan Rayfield that she views the bill as an important step in the right direction to correct a historic wrong. “This policy will make a significant difference in the lives of farmworkers and their families,” Brown wrote. The new law establishes overtime pay requirements for agricultural workers in Oregon after 40 hours per week, with the requirements phased in over five years starting in 2023. Under the law, farmworkers will be owed time-and-a-half overtime wages after 55 weekly hours of work next year, after 48 hours of work in 2025-2026 and then after 40 hours per week beginning in 2027. Most farmers will be eligible for one of three tiers of tax credits, depending on how many people they employ. Tax credits will incrementally decline between 2023 and 2028 and then will end or be reevaluated by lawmakers. Brown wrote that the law may need to be changed and improved over time, so she said it’s important that conversation about the issue continue.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDents Run: The FBI might not have found any Civil War-era gold at a remote woodland site, but it definitely has records of the agency’s 2018 dig and will soon have to turn them over to a father-son pair of treasure hunters. A federal judge has ordered the FBI to speed up the release of records about the search for the legendary gold, ruling Monday in favor of Finders Keepers, the treasure hunting outfit that led FBI agents to the remote site. The group accuses the Justice Department of slow-walking their request for information. The FBI must turn over 1,000 pages of records per month, starting in 30 days, and the first batch of records must include a key report sought by Finders Keepers, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta ordered. The ruling came four months after Finders Keepers sued the Justice Department over its failure to produce records on the FBI’s search. The FBI has long insisted its March 2018 dig came up empty, but Finders Keepers says the government has acted suspiciously throughout the four-year saga. Finders Keepers’ owners, the father-son duo of Dennis and Kem Parada, spent years looking for the fabled 1863 shipment of Union gold that was supposedly lost or stolen on its way to the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia. The pair eventually led the FBI to the remote site, where the agency took over.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city’s newly formed reparations commission is considering what form payments might take and looking to other cities for inspiration. In a meeting Monday, Silas Pinto, who is serving as Providence’s first-ever director of diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, noted that reparations are being considered and implemented in a dozen other cities, including Boston and Amherst, Massachusetts. So far, housing and land ownership comprise one of the largest spending categories for cities investing in reparations. Those funds are not paid to individuals but toward renovations and down payments, for example. Direct cash payments, tuition and scholarships have also been popular investments. Pinto said it’s evident that cities are “viewing reparations work really through the lens of closing the racial wealth gap,” and “it’s going to come down to issues around land ownership, around how are we supporting our minority-owned businesses, and how are we helping individuals?” However, as Providence is aiming to use $15 million in federal pandemic relief, it will need to comply with rules on how those funds should be spent.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Five University of South Carolina trustees won’t be allowed to run for reelection next month after some powerful lawmakers felt they were responsible for hiring a president who crudely criticized the school, interfered in daily school affairs and left in less than two years. The legislative board that screens university trustees is refusing to send them to a May 4 election by the General Assembly at which more than a dozen other trustees for universities across the state will be elected. The decision comes as the state Senate prepares to review a bill that passed the House earlier this month, the day after it was proposed, that would fire all current trustees at the end of June 2023 and redraw their districts, cutting the board from 20 members to 13. Trustees kicked off the board could run for the new seats. The University of South Carolina trustees the College and University Trustee Screening Commission refused to allow to run for reelection to a new four-year term are board chairman C. Dorn Smith as well as trustees Thad Westbrook, C. Edward Floyd, John von Lehe and Charles Williams. The trustees will be allowed to remain until either the board is restructured or the screening board takes further action.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A deadline for Gov. Kristi Noem to respond to a pair of ethics complaints levied again her last year has passed. But neither Noem nor the panel of retired judges vetting whether the Republican governor misused state airplanes for personal use and improperly interfered in a state certification program in which her daughter was enrolled will say whether a response was submitted by Friday’s deadline. The South Dakota Government Accountability Board is scheduled to revisit both complaints during its next meeting at 10 a.m. May 2 in Sioux Falls. But because the confidential nature of the board and the complaints it examines, few other details are known. Assistant Attorney General Katie Mallery, who serves as the board’s liaison, said Tuesday that the April 15 deadline for the subject of the complaints to respond remained in place, though she declined to say whether any response or responses were received by the board. Created in 2017 by the Legislature, the South Dakota Government Accountability investigates complaints against state officials. The majority of its work is done behind closed doors. Considering complaints in secret, GAB is by law required to keep any complaints and related information it receives confidential throughout its proceedings.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Republican legislators passed legislation Monday to make camping on public property a misdemeanor crime, which critics say effectively criminalizes homelessness. Under HB978, a person who camps on the shoulder, right-of-way, bridge, overpass or underpass of a state or interstate highway could face a misdemeanor offense and a $50 fine or community service requirement. The legislation cleared the state Senate last week after a lengthy debate and now goes to Gov. Bill Lee’s desk. Sponsors Sen. Paul Bailey, R-Sparta, and Rep. Ryan Williams, R-Cookeville, have defended the bill as a tool local law enforcement could use to address homelessness. Rep. Antonio Parkinson, D-Memphis, said he experienced homelessness multiple times as a child and criticized the legislation, calling for a more “compassionate” approach. Sen. Frank Niceley, R-Strawberry Plains, drew widespread criticism last week for meandering comments tenuously connecting Adolf Hitler to the legislation. Niceley said Hitler at one point lived on the streets and used the experience as a “way to connect with the masses.” “People can come out of these camps and have a very productive life, or in Hitler’s case, a very unproductive life,” Niceley said. Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Nashville, called the comments “embarrassing” to Tennessee.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Some Republicans are pushing state leaders to declare an “invasion” at the Mexican border in response to an increase in migrant border crossings, allowing Texas to enforce federal immigration policies, according to some interpretations of the U.S. Constitution. Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth, chair of the House Committee on General Investigating, has asked state Attorney General Ken Paxton for a legal opinion on “whether the federal government has failed to uphold its obligations to protect Texas from invasion under article IV section 4 of the United States Constitution, and whether Texas has the sovereign power to defend itself from invasion.” Paxton’s opinion would be nonbinding, but his answer could add ammunition to a push from conservative groups for states bordering Mexico to use a formal declaration of an “invasion” to justify allowing state authorities to deport migrants suspected of crossing the border illegally. The effort comes as Republicans, including Gov. Greg Abbott, have continued to criticize the Biden administration for not doing enough to stem the flow of illegal immigration and as federal authorities prepare to end a Trump-era public health mandate that allowed for the immediate expulsion of migrants.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Huge numbers of Washington County students started eating breakfast and lunch at school last year when pandemic-related federal waivers made it possible for schools to offer free meals to all students. Now, the program that made those free meals possible is ending, and some hunger advocates are worried that children who benefited from the program could go back to being hungry. The Seamless Summer Option program had allowed any Washington County School District student to receive two free meals per day, regardless of status. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, school officials in Washington County and across the U.S. were concerned for students’ well-being and whether they would find enough food to eat. The U.S. Department of Agriculture set aside money to help schools offer free meals on a temporary basis. With the expiration of the federal waivers, as well as the SSO program, local schools will go back to offering free or reduced-price meals only to students who qualify under household income guidelines. With no limits on who could get their meals for free, the district saw large increases in the number of students who ate at school. In September 2020, the district provided 1,842 breakfasts and 10,712 lunches a day on average. By March 2022, those figures had jumped to 4,531 and 16,166.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: After a failed attempt to pass a plan to regulate short-term rentals, city councilors have decided to begin the process again in an attempt to reach a compromise. City officials and councilors agree that short-term rentals are contributing to the housing shortage. The ongoing argument lies in how to regulate the housing that is commonly rented through sites like Airbnb and VRBO. A new version of the ordinance that will be considered in the City Council’s ordinance committee would allow for short-term rentals to be located in detached homes, accessory dwelling units, duplexes and homes with three to four units as long as they are on the same lot as the host’s primary residence. Hosts could also rent their own home out to guests. The exceptions to the necessity for owner-occupancy would be seasonal homes and units in a multi-unit building where one unit is rented out at an affordable rate to a long-term tenant. A previous version of the ordinance that Mayor Miro Weinberger vetoed would have limited short-term rentals to bedrooms within a host’s home with few exceptions. The prior proposal would have stopped people from creating short-term rentals out of independent units on their property such as detached houses, carriage houses and units in an owner-occupied multi-unit home.The ordinance committee will bring a new proposal for regulating short-term rentals to council by June 1.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The father of a journalist fatally shot during a live broadcast in 2015 has conceded that he failed to make the ballot in the Democratic nomination contest for the 5th Congressional District. Andy Parker, who announced in January that he would seek to unseat incumbent GOP Rep. Bob Good, said in a statement Monday that he would instead throw his support to Democratic nominee Josh Throneburg. “I was looking forward to a spirited primary and campaign against Good this fall, but to my great disappointment our campaign did not meet the technical requirements to be on the primary ballot. I want to thank the thousands of Virginians and supporters across America who stood with me,” Parker said. Since the death of daughter Alison, a 24-year-old reporter at Roanoke’s WDBJ-TV who was killed by a former colleague during an interview, Parker has pushed for gun-control measures. He’s also battled with Facebook over its allowing the video of his daughter’s slaying to circulate. Parker’s campaign told WDBJ last week that it was reviewing its petition signatures after being informed that the 5th District Committee was able to verify only 937 of the 1,000 required. Alison Parker’s death also prompted her boyfriend, WDBJ anchor Chris Hurst, to run for the General Assembly in 2017. The Democrat served two terms in the House of Delegates before being unseated by a Republican last November.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected Klickitat County’s claim to a portion of the Yakama Indian Reservation, likely ending a dispute that has raged for more than a century. The court denied the county’s appeal without comment. Klickitat County had argued that 121,465 acres in the southwestern portion of the reservation, including the eastern half of Mount Adams and the Glenwood Valley, were not actually included when the reservation was created. “The Supreme Court’s decision once again validates the continuing strength of our treaty rights under the United States Constitution,” said Yakama Tribal Council Chairman Delano Saluskin. “The Yakama Nation will never compromise when our treaty is at stake.” The dispute involved ambiguous language in the tribe’s Treaty of 1855 with the U.S. government. Territorial Gov. Isaac Stevens, who drafted the treaty, wrote that the reservation’s southwestern border passed “south and east of Mount Adams, to the spur whence flows the waters of the Klickatat and Pisco rivers.” The tribe said that no such spur existed and that the Yakama Nation had always understood that Mount Adams and land known as Tract D was reservation land. That position was affirmed by the Indian Claims Commission in 1966, by an executive order by President Richard Nixon in 1972, by federal surveyors in 1982 and by numerous earlier court cases.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nGlen Jean: New River Gorge National Park and Preserve is offering special events this week to celebrate National Park Week. The park is uploading its museum collection online. Information and images give details about the prehistoric and industrial past of the communities in the area. Some of the more than 5,000 items include a miner’s belt designed for self-rescue, a fossil from a time when the entire gorge was an underwater home to marine life and a Native American hammerstone used to prepare food hundreds of years ago. On Wednesday, the public can watch Cultural Resource Program Manager David Fuerst clean a 1942 mural that depicts early 20th-century coal miners. The park hopes to restore the painting to its appearance 80 years ago. The mural demonstration leads up to the opening Friday of the Smithsonian Institution’s “Crossroads: Change in Rural America” exhibit at the historic Cottle Mountainair Hotel in Mount Hope. The exhibit runs through May 30. Winning art for the Youth Arts in the Parks Appalachian Spring Wildflower Art Contest will continue to be displayed at Tamarack Marketplace and online at nps.gov/neri/youth-arts-in-the-parks.htm.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The brother of former first lady Michelle Obama and his wife are suing a private school alleging it refused to allow their two sons to reenroll after they voiced concerns that racism and inappropriate conduct at the school had not been satisfactorily addressed. In a civil lawsuit filed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court, Craig and Kelly Robinson accuse University School of Milwaukee of terminating their 9- and 11-year-old sons’ reenrollment contracts for the 2021-2022 school year after the couple complained that teachers treated students of color and socioeconomically underrepresented students unfairly. According to the lawsuit filed Monday, the school failed to provide the supportive and inclusive learning environment it had promised in its enrollment contracts with the Robinsons. The boys had attended the pre-K-12 school for about five years, the Robinsons said Tuesday in an interview with the Associated Press. The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and a trial by jury. USM said in a statement that the enrollment decision had nothing to do with their complaints of inequity or discrimination. The independent school, with a campus that stretches from Milwaukee to the nearby suburb of River Hills, enrolls about 1,100 students every year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Federal officials are including only about two-thirds the previously expected number of Wyoming sites for lease for oil and gas exploration this summer, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The first such lease sale of President Joe Biden’s administration will list 129 tracts across the state, covering more than 130,000 acres, according to the paper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/10/coronavirus-new-jersey-timeline-events-covid-covid-19/4964918002/", "title": "Coronavirus in New Jersey: A timeline of events from first cases to ...", "text": "Editor's note: This file will be updated frequently.\n\nNew Jersey has been on the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak since January, when Newark Liberty International Airport became a major screening and quarantine station for foreign travelers, to March, when the first New Jerseyans were diagnosed with the disease.\n\nHere is a timeline of events based on news reports and information from the state Department of Health.\n\nMarch 4\n\nJames Cai, a 32-year-old New York physician assistant with an apartment in Fort Lee, is the first person in New Jersey to be diagnosed with coronavirus.\n\nCai developed symptoms of COVID-19 on March 1, went to an urgent care facility and was eventually admitted to Hackensack University Medical Center.\n\nCai had not traveled to countries where the virus is spreading, and has no school-aged children.

Over the past two weeks, Alabama had the second-highest number of new cases per capita in the nation. South Carolina was fourth. Louisiana and Mississippi were also in the top 10. “We are extremely concerned about these numbers. We know if they continue, we will see more hospitalizations and more deaths,” Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said. The combination of preexisting health conditions and limited health care access in the region, along with pockets of public skepticism about health officials’ advice on the illness, complicate attempts to manage the virus. Dr. Selwyn Vickers, dean of the UAB School of Medicine, said the South has high rates of diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease and high blood pressure – all illnesses that put people at risk for poorer outcomes with COVID-19. But Vickers said human behavior is the most difficult aspect of fighting the disease. “When you open the doors and you look at the beaches, you look at the restaurants and you look at cities that choose not to do masks, or individuals who don’t, … I would say our behaviors create the biggest challenge for us,” Vickers said. Vickers said people who won’t wear a mask for their own protection should “think about worrying about infecting someone else.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state government said child-care providers will receive an additional $10.5 million from the state’s portion of federal coronavirus relief funds. State Department of Health and Social Services Commissioner Adam Crum said in a statement that the department and Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy directed the additional funding to businesses providing child care, The Anchorage Daily News reported. “We found that the funding available to this sector was not coming fast enough,” Crum said. Child care is crucial to the economy because it allows parents to return to work, said Stephanie Berglund, CEO of thread Alaska, which provides a child-care resource and referral network. The programs need government assistance to survive the financial impact of the pandemic and “to provide strong child care infrastructure when this is all over,” Berglund said. The state previously told licensed child-care providers to expect more federal relief money than they received. The state’s Division of Public Assistance announced enough funding would be available to cover revenue losses among providers for March, April and May. But the funds only covered March payments with $6.5 million in federal funds and another $2.6 million in state money. About half of Alaska’s child-care providers temporarily shut their doors in March, and others operated with severe reductions, Berglund said. About 69% are now open, but some have closed permanently, including at least five in Anchorage. Many of those remaining open operate at 30% to 50% capacity, Berglund said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:A mall that was once considered a perennial teen hangout and featured in the movie “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure” is closing. The owners of Metrocenter Mall announced that the north Phoenix shopping complex is shuttering after 47 years mainly because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The mall’s last day of operation will be June 30. But tenants have until July 15 to clear out. Metrocenter was facing declining foot traffic before the pandemic began. Several storefronts were already vacant. The mall closed in mid-March under a statewide shutdown and reopened May 9. But it never recovered, according to mall managers. Constructed in 1973, the mall was a popular hub over the years that included a movie theater, skating rink and arcade. The mall’s biggest claim to fame might be serving as a backdrop in action scenes in the 1989 time-travel comedy “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure” starring Keanu Reeves.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Some school districts are completing virtual learning options for students in kindergarten through 12th grades because officials are uncertain if schools can safely operate on a traditional schedule amid the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Education Secretary Johnny Key have repeatedly said that they want schools to reopen since closing in mid-March, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. But schools have been warned that they might have to pivot among traditional and virtual educational programs. Last week, Hutchinson said districts want to teach in the classroom. But if someone tests positive for the new coronavirus or there are students with preexisting conditions, then districts need to be ready to have online instruction. Superintendent Mike Poore of the Little Rock school district said they intend to roll out their 2020-21 school year plan no later then the first week of July. It might change depending on guidance from state officials, but it calls for a virtual instruction and a more traditional learning option for its more than 20,000 students. “We’ll do everything that is humanly possible to follow recommendations … and requirements,” Poore said of safely reopening schools. Keith McGee, the interim superintendent at North Little Rock School District, said they have not made a final decision about school structure this coming year. But there are some ideas that are being considered, which include a virtual academy and a traditional learning environment that would require following safety directives. More information will be available to parents during the “Virtual Cupcake and Conversations” event on July 9.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: This year’s Miraramar Air Show in Southern California, billed as the world’s largest military air display, has been canceled over concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. The show, which usually draws more than 500,000 spectators, was scheduled for September at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego. Col. Charles Dockery, the base’s commanding officer, made the decision as a safety measure because of “public health risks” in the midst of the continuing COVID-19 outbreak, a statement from the base said. “The Miramar Air Show brings in aviation enthusiasts from all across the United States and from every corner of the world,” Dockery said in the statement. “While we had initially hoped to host the show and help usher in a re-opened San Diego, there are still a great many risks posed with a mass gathering of this size and scale to do it in a way that ensures our guests’ absolute safety. It remains a prudent choice to look ahead to 2021 and make it better than ever.” The base said Miramar is the largest military air show in the world. It is one of many large events that have been canceled this year because of concerns over COVID-19, including county fairs, Comic-Con in San Diego and the annual Coachella and Stagecoach music festivals.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo:Gov. Jared Polis signed a slew of bills Monday aimed at sharing federal CARES Act dollars and bringing coronavirus pandemic relief to Coloradans as he urged residents to “build on the success” the state is seeing to avoid a virus resurgence that could hurt the economy. During a brief teleconference with The Pueblo Chieftain on Monday, Polis said he soon will sign health care legislation that will offer a 26% reduction in insurance premiums for residents and also pave the way for “absolutely critical access to telehealth and telemedicine” consultations that will prevent residents having to go out for routine health care. “We need to build on the success. If there is a virus resurgence, it will hurt the economy,” Polis said. “We need to continue to wear masks in public and maintain social distancing so we don’t experience growth” in coronavirus cases. The bills Polis signed will provide $20 million in housing assistance to help renters and homeowners unable to make payments; and $20 million for small businesses, especially rural businesses that have not previously received Payroll Protection Plan dollars as well as those that are veteran-, minority- or women-owned. Another $5 million was earmarked for basic utility services for those financially impacted by the pandemic. Polis also signed bills that provide additional behavioral health care dollars to assist those facing substance abuse and domestic violence issues; funding for unemployment, which is at a record level in the state; and paid sick leave for hourly workers.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: City officials have shut down a bar after more than 1,000 patrons were witnessed late Saturday, a violation of the state’s reopening rules for outdoor dining and outdoor events, as well as various health codes. In a statement released Monday by Mayor Justin Elicker’s office, Building Inspector Jim Turcio said he saw the patrons firsthand and asked the owners of 50’s Lounge LLC to close but they refused. Bars have not yet been allowed to open in Connecticut. “We spoke to the owners of this establishment and made a request that they shut down immediately, with which they did not comply, and we had no choice but to shut them down as a result of these violations,” Turcio said. Owner Joy Monsanto, who owns the establishment, told NBC Connecticut the event was held to celebrate Juneteenth and no one was inside the bar. “So there wasn’t a thousand people in the establishment,” Monsanto said. “There may have been people sprinkled throughout the parking lot.” The city’s health director issued a cease-and-desist letter to the owners, alleging numerous violations including failing to ensure the attendees at a large outdoor public gathering remained at least 6 feet apart; failing to ensure they were wearing face masks except when dining; permitting the sale of alcohol without the sale of food; and operating in excess of 50% capacity on an outside deck, among other violations.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark:University of Delaware students will return to campus in the fall, president Dennis Assanis said Tuesday, but with different class schedules, health protocols and a blend of online and in-person learning. Following the spring semester’s last-minute transition to online learning, in-person classes will resume Sept. 1. However, students will leave campus over Thanksgiving break and complete the remaining weeks of classes and finals remotely, a coursework schedule many colleges are adopting. Residence halls will also be operating, and move-in dates will be spread over the second half of August. “This reflects our decisions as of today, based on the information we have as of today,” Assanis told the Board of Trustees on Tuesday. “As Dr. [Anthony] Fauci says, we don’t control the timing, the virus controls the timing.” Plans for the fall semester are still subject to change, Assanis said, and the university will release weekly updates throughout the summer. Following the state’s limits on indoor gatherings, in-person classes will be capped at 49 students with one professor. These classes will operate on what the university calls an A/B schedule. For one week, half of classes will be taught in-person and half will be taught online. The next week, the classes will switch. This will continue each week through the semester. In order to lessen traffic on campus, there will be a 25-minute passing period between classes, and classes will operate from 8 a.m. to 7:15 p.m. In-person classes will meet for 75 minutes twice a week, spaced out Monday through Saturday. All classes are prepared to move fully online if necessary during the semester, and the university will make accommodations for faculty members and students who cannot attend in-person classes for health reasons.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:D.C. Metro will reopen 15 of its stations on June 29 after closing those locations because of the COVID-19 pandemic, WUSA-TV reported. Three stations on the Orange and Silver lines – Greensboro, East Falls Church and McLean – will reopen with shuttle bus service because of the ongoing platform reconstruction work at East Falls Church. Metro announced on March 17 the drastically reduced service as stay-at-home orders were issued, reducing the number of bus lines and rail stations in addition to scaling back on train frequency to every 30 minutes. Also on June 29, buses will be added to the system’s 14 busiest bus lines to provide more capacity and more frequent service as the region reopens, officials said. To make these additions possible, Metro will temporarily suspend bus service on four routes that have extremely low ridership: NH2, C14, G2 and M6. Metro is asking customers along these routes to use other Metrobus routes nearby.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The state suspended the alcohol license of The Knight’s Pub, a popular bar where dozens of workers and patrons have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, after a state inspector found patrons weren’t socially distancing and following other rules meant to slow the virus’ spread. At least 13 employees and 28 patrons have tested positive for COVID-19 at the The Knight’s Pub, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation said late Monday in a statement. But the number of cases linked to the bar could be much higher. Dr. Raul Pino, a state health officer in Orlando, said without naming the establishment, that a bar near the University of Central Florida campus had been linked to 152 coronavirus cases.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp is giving lawmakers permission to spend $250 million from Georgia’s rainy day fund to decrease budget cuts in the year beginning July 1. Kemp agreed to tap the state’s piggy bank Monday as he set a new revenue estimate for the 2021 budget year because of the coronavirus pandemic, cutting the ceiling for spending state-collected revenue from $28.1 billion to $25.9 billion. The Republican governor’s power to set the maximum amount of revenue that Georgia’s government can spend in a year is one of his key influences over how the General Assembly writes a budget. His new estimate of $2.2 billion less in state funds is actually an improvement over earlier outlooks. It will equal a 10% funding cut for state agencies, K-12 schools, universities and colleges, down from earlier forecasts of as much as 14% reductions.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Democratic state House Rep. Tina Wildberger and her husband, Michael, are scheduled to be arraigned on charges of violating a coronavirus stay-at-home order for stretching on a Maui beach. Wildberger and her husband are scheduled to appear in Wailuku District Court on July 16, The Maui News reported Saturday. The citations issued by police said the couple was at Keawakapu Beach in Kihei on May 3 and were seen stretching without moving from a spot for more than 10 minutes. They told an officer they did the same thing the previous day without being cited by officers who passed by, the citations said. The misdemeanor charge carries a penalty of up to one year in jail and a fine up to $5,000. Tina Wildberger said in an email that police officers on all-terrain vehicles were stopped nearby while she and her husband were stretching. One of the officers approached and said they were observed remaining in one place for 10 minutes in violation of health restrictions. “We responded that we are actively stretching and that beach exercise had been permitted by the mayor,” she said. Mayor Michael Victorino’s emergency order that took effect in mid-March prohibited sunbathing, sunset-watching and other sedentary activities at beaches, while other activities including exercise and fishing were permitted. Maui County beaches were reopened May 16 for all activities. When appearing in court, “we intend to present that while officers were put in a very difficult position trying to adjudicate various behaviors, all in an effort to keep residents safe, this case was clearly one of what-aboutism,” she said. Wildberger represents state House District 11, which includes Kihei, Wailea and Makena.\n\nIdaho\n\nTwin Falls: The 2020 Idaho primary drew the state’s highest voter turnout in decades in an election conducted entirely though mail-in voting for the first time because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Idaho Secretary of State’s Office said 335,037 residents voted in the statewide primary for which results were reported earlier this month, The Times-News reported. The voter turnout of 36.94% was the highest in an Idaho primary since a 41.34% turnout in 1980. There were 906,877 registered voters at the time of the election, an increase of about 19% from 2016. Idaho’s voting-age population increased by 11% over the same period. “I thought it was a thundering success,” Deputy Secretary of State Jason Hancock said. High turnout could be explained by increased media attention on the unique election, and voters might have had more free time, Hancock said. “There were a lot of people with the lockdown going on who were just sitting at home and didn’t have as much to do,” he said. Registered voters were required to request a ballot, but the state enabled online requests for the first time. About 170,000 of the 429,463 people who received a ballot submitted an online request. The state also sent mail-in requests with prepaid postage to all households for voters who did not apply online.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A federal judge ordered the release from prison of an alleged organized crime enforcer who is said to have health issues that place him at heightened risk from the novel coronavirus. Mario Rainone, 65, has spent nearly half of his life in prison for extorting borrowers with death threats and throwing a grenade onto a theater roof to take over the business, among other crimes. He was serving time for gun possession. Rainone asked for release to home confinement last month, saying prostate cancer, liver disease and heart problems make him susceptible to COVID-19. Court records showed U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber rejected prosecutors’ objections and granted Rainone’s request, ordering prison officials to release him for time served. “The court is optimistic that Rainone understands that given his long criminal history and his advancing age, he is likely to spend the rest of his natural life imprisoned if he breaks the law again,” Leinenweber wrote, noting Rainone’s last conviction for violent crime was more than 30 years ago. Rainone was released from prison in in 2006 after serving time for racketeering and extortion and was not allowed to have a firearm. Then, in 2009, authorities found a stolen Smith & Wesson revolver during a search of his home. Leinenweber gave Rainone a mandatory minimum 15-year sentence. Assistant U.S. Attorney Amarjeet Bhachu said Rainone’s prostate cancer had been successfully treated seven years earlier, and he accused Rainone of misleading the judge.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s public schools can apply for funding to improve their remote learning capabilities during the coronavirus pandemic through a $61.6 million grant program, Gov. Eric Holcomb said. The deadline is July 17 to apply for the needs-based, competitive funding through the Governor’s Emergency Education Relief, which is financed by the federal CARES Act. Traditional public school corporations, public charter schools, accredited nonpublic schools, higher education institutions and other education-related entities are eligible to apply for the funding. The grants will go toward paying for digital learning devices, technologies to boost internet connectivity and to support partnerships that advance remote learning. The state expects to award dozens of grants through the program, which is a collaboration between the governor’s office, the Indiana Department of Education, the Commission for Higher Education and the State Board of Education.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Iowa State University economists estimated that Iowa farmers – corn, soybean, pork, beef and ethanol producers – will lose nearly $7 billion because of the coronavirus pandemic. The largest hits are to ethanol producers, estimated to lose $2.5 billion, and hog producers, shorted an estimated $2.1 billion. The Trump administration has sent $4 billion in payments to U.S. farmers to help cover losses because of the pandemic, part of $16 billion that’s available to provide direct aid to offset losses for farmers and ranchers. Iowa farmers have snagged $423.5 million of the pandemic payments, the most of any state nationally, based on USDA data through Monday. But critics said the coronavirus program addresses only a small portion of the losses farmers are experiencing. The American Farm Bureau Federation and other major ag groups are pushing Congress to include agriculture in the next federal coronavirus aid package.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly is recommending that communities wait a little bit longer before moving to the next phase of reopening as cornovirus cases increase. The “Phase Out” stage of Kelly’s Ad Astra reopening plan was set to begin Monday, but Kelly and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment are now advising communities to stay in Phase 3 for at least two more weeks. The main difference is that Phase 3 limits mass gatherings to no more than 45 people. The “Phase Out” stage merely urges social distancing but doesn’t limit the size of crowds. The ultimate decision, though, rests with local officials. “Though many Kansans and communities have been social distancing, wearing masks, and working hard over the past few weeks to mitigate the spread of the virus, we have unfortunately seen an increase in disease spread,” Kelly said in a news release.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:The coronavirus pandemic isn’t going to cancel the Kentucky State Fair, as it has several state fairs across the nation, but it will dramatically dial back the tradition-laden event scheduled for Aug. 20-30. Because of restrictions and social distancing requirements, the fair is expected to draw about half of the usual 500,000 visitors. And many vendors intend to sit it out this year because of the lack of coveted indoor spaces. Some companies and groups are predicting they will trim back their expenditures. “It’s going to be a very different fair,” Ian Cox, a spokesman for Kentucky Venues, said. In past years, the fair allocated 7 square feet per guest. This year, it will allot 15, which will require organizers to slice the normal attendance in half. Gates will be closed whenever necessary to limit the crowds. Aisles inside the Kentucky Exposition Center will be one-way and widened. To accommodate daily cleanings, hours will be reduced this year for the general public. The plan allows for several family friendly amenities, including midway rides, free concerts, roving entertainment and the 4H livestock competition. But much of what people have come to expect at the fair will be gone or drastically reduced. The World Championship Horse Show, usually a huge draw: It will be held at Freedom Hall in front of just 310 spectators. Also canceled: The Kentucky Farm Bureau’s Country Ham Breakfast and the champion ham auction, which typically raises $1 million. Nonlivestock competitions, everything from largest watermelon to the blue ribbon-winning cake and home brewed beer, also have been canceled. There were 20,807 entries last year.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLivingston: Laine Hardy, the 2019 winner of “American Idol,” said he has been diagnosed with COVID-19 but his symptoms are mild and he is recovering under home quarantine. “This wasn’t what I expected on the first day of summer,” the 19-year-old from Livingston wrote on his Facebook page and on Instagram. “My doctor confirmed I have Coronavirus, but my symptoms are mild.” He ended his tweet: “Y’all stay safe & healthy!” Hardly had performed Friday, singing the national anthem at swearing-in ceremonies for Livingston Parish Sheriff Jason Ard’s third term, The Advocate reported. Hardy also recently completed a virtual tour that was watched by more than 2 million viewers. And his next livestream is scheduled Thursday night. Acoustic versions of his new songs “Ground I Grew Up On” and “Let There Be Country” will debut on Friday.\n\nMaine\n\nFreeport: A candy company found something sweet during the coronavirus pandemic. Dr. Nirav Shah, director of Maine’s Center for Diseaser Control and Prevention, has served as inspiration for the “Shah Bar” created by Wilbur’s of Maine Chocolate Confections. The candy bars feature an image of the smiling, bespectacled doctor, along with a big red heart in an outline of the state. The doctor “has been a big part of not only keeping Maine safe but also to convey a sense of warmth and caring for the people of Maine. He seems to really have a lot of compassion,” Kristin Frazier from Wilbur’s told WCSH-TV. He’s become the face of the state response to the pandemic through daily briefings that were held for weeks. He has been praised for his calm, reassuring demeanor. He has also reminded Mainers to take time to do things that bring them joy, such as eating soup and calling their mothers. Shah was the head of the Illinois Department of Public Health before coming to Maine. He had been on the job for less than a year when the pandemic struck.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Faculty members at Johns Hopkins University are demanding that the school provide a detailed report of its finances and put a moratorium on cuts to research funding and staffing salaries announced in April as a result of multimillion-dollar losses arising from the coronavirus pandemic. Six-hundred faculty from across the university, which has been at the forefront of the global response to the virus, made the demands last week in a letter to the school’s president and board of trustees, the Baltimore Sun reported Monday. They wrote that they believe the institution’s financial health can be maintained without “undermining the work it was created to enable.” The private research university has played a globally prominent role in tracking the spread of the virus. But like other colleges across the nation, it is facing financial challenges because of the public health emergency. University President Ronald Daniels in April announced that the university expects to lose more than $100 million by the end of June and as much as $375 million during the coming fiscal year. Before the outbreak, the university had projected a positive margin of $72 million this fiscal year on an overall budget of $6.5 billion. Daniels said furloughs and layoffs within parts of the university will be an “unavoidable consequence of the losses.” The school also imposed a hiring freeze on staff positions for the fiscal year starting July 1 as well as restrictions on hiring for academic positions. Base salaries for faculty and staff for the same period will not increase, with no annual merit raises. The school at the time said the reductions would have no impact on its data-gathering and research on the virus.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: After thousands of demonstrators took to the streets across Massachusetts following the killing of George Floyd, public health officials worried the mass protests could give the novel coronavirus a chance to spread. On Monday, Gov. Charlie Baker said about 2.5% percent of those who were checked last week at dozens of pop-up facilities opened for demonstrators have tested positive for the virus. The test rate was in line with what the state has been experiencing in general, Baker said at a Tuesday news conference. About 17,600 were tested at the facilities. Baker said many of the protesters took steps to help lower the possibility of spreading the virus. “We’re obviously pleased to see that the percentage of positive tests was quite low considering the frequency and the size of those protests and demonstrations,” he said. “Vast majorities of the folks who participated in those demonstrations were wearing masks or face coverings of one kind or another. In many cases they were moving, which I think made a big difference, and of course they all took place outside, which we all agree is a far safer environment than indoors.” In general, officials say, Massachusetts is continuing to make progress in its efforts to curb against the coronavirus. There has been a 74 percent drop in the number of people hospitalized for COVID-19 in the state since April 15, Baker said Tuesday.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Republicans who control the Legislature proposed a $1.3 billion plan to help K-12 schools reopen during the coronavirus pandemic, saying districts should have flexibility to start when they want and to offer remote instruction as an alternative if necessary. The one-time funding, including an $800 per-pupil increase to address new costs related to COVID-19, would come from $3 billion in federal relief. Teachers would get a $500 bonus. Uncertainty remains because the state’s school aid fund is $1.2 billion smaller than expected this fiscal year and $1.1 billion short for the next budget year because of tax revenue declines from the monthslong lockdown. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is pushing Congress for flexibility to use bailout money to fill the holes and for an additional round of funding. But Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey said GOP lawmakers put a proposal on the table now because superintendents and principals “need clarity sooner rather than later.” Their fiscal year starts next week. Although schools typically begin in late August or early September, some with year-round calendars start earlier. The governor previously issued an order giving schools flexibility to resume before the day after Labor Day without needing a state waiver. The Republican plan calls for redefining “attendance” to allow for online learning without reducing schools’ funding and cutting the number of snow day allowances from six to two so remote instruction occurs instead. Districts would work with local health departments on safety requirements for schools, sports and extracurricular activities. They also would do initial benchmark testing to assess if students need additional attention.\n\nMinnesota\n\nShakopee: The Amazon fulfillment center in Shakopee has one of the larger coronavirus outbreaks in a warehouse or distribution plant setting, according to state health officials. At least 88 of its approximately 1,000 workers have tested positive for the disease caused by the virus. Another 99 workers at other Amazon sites in the Twin Cities have also tested positive. Kris Ehresmann, director of infectious disease for the Minnesota Health Department, said state officials are reaching out to employers when clusters at workplaces begin to emerge, the Star Tribune reported. “Anytime we have a situation in which a worksite is a critical workforce and they’re in a position where they don’t have the luxury of working from home, or working in a cubicle … you tend to see a greater likelihood of transmission,” Ehresmann said. Ehresmann said the state is providing guidance to mitigate the spread of the disease.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state Senate is working to limit lawsuits by customers who said they were exposed to the new coronavirus at businesses or medical offices. Senate Bill 3049 would shield businesses, health care providers, religious organizations and other entities from lawsuits related to COVID-19 if they show a “good faith” effort to follow public health guidelines. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves has pushed for the bill. If it lands on his desk and he signs it, the bill would take effect retroactively to March 14. “In the beginning of this thing, nobody really knew what to do. Should you wear a mask, should you not, should you do this, should you do that? It provides some protection for our essential business who did remain open,” Senate Judiciary A Committee Chairwoman Sally Doty said during a hearing on the bill Tuesday. Doty, a Republican from Brookhaven, said fear of litigation has stopped businesses from providing services the last several months. She said the problem is still persistent now that state is reopening. The bill would still allow people to sue if plaintiffs can show “clear and convincing evidence” that a business owner acted with “actual malice or willful, intentional misconduct.” The bill is being introduced after Reeves suggested it during news briefings on the virus. It cleared the Judiciary Advisory Study Committee by a voice vote Tuesday and will move to the full Senate for consideration.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The Springfield-Greene County Health Department is notifying the public of potential community exposures from two COVID-19 positive individuals, a news release said. Before being diagnosed, a Greene County case visited the following locations: on June 14, a Walmart Neighborhood Market at 3720 E. Sunshine from 11 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. (infectious but not symptomatic, masked); June 15, Pat Jones YMCA weightlifting area at 1901 E. Republic from 6 a.m. to 7:15 a.m. (infectious but not symptomatic, not masked) ; June 16: Pat Jones YMCA weightlifting area at 1901 E. Republic from 6 a.m. to 7:15 a.m. (infectious but not symptomatic, not masked). A case from another county spent about 15 minutes at each Walmart Supercenter and Lowe’s Home Improvement in Republic between noon and 3 p.m. on June 16. The individual was infectious and symptomatic and was wearing a mask, the release said. Anyone who was at these locations on these dates is at low risk for contracting COVID-19, but should monitor for symptoms, the release said. There is no need to self-quarantine or isolate unless symptoms develop.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Health officials reported 69 new cases of COVID-19 over the weekend and counted an additional death on Monday. A man in his 60s died in a Yellowstone County hospital on Saturday from complications of COVID-19, according to county officials. It is the 21st death in the state and the fourth in Yellowstone County. More than 2,800 tests were reported between Friday and Sunday, with 32 new cases announced Saturday, 20 on Sunday and 17 on Monday. The state amended the case count Monday afternoon, after six cases were duplicated as a result of repeat testing, officials said. The number of cases originally reported by the state on Monday was 23. The 32 cases reported on Saturday mark the second-highest single-day total, trailing the 35 cases reported on March 26. The number of positive cases is expected to increase as testing increases and as the state relaxes coronavirus-related restrictions, according Jon Ebelt, public information officer for the Department of Public Health and Human Services. “Through local contact tracing efforts, clusters of cases involving close associations have been identified in communities,” Ebelt said. Beginning earlier this month, the state implemented a policy of testing all close contacts of confirmed cases, both symptomatic and asymptomatic.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A number of bars and restaurants in Lincoln would be able to expand their outdoor areas under requests approved Monday by the Lincoln City Council, but a final decision will be left to a state agency. The council unanimously approved requests by Backswing Brewing, the Hub Cafe and five businesses in The Railyard entertainment district to offer more outdoor seating as they struggle to attract customers still concerned about gathering inside amid the coronavirus pandemic. The request now goes to the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, which City Attorney Jeff Kirkpatrick said has been supportive of temporary measures to help restaurants and bars that have been restricted to 50% capacity, according to the Lincoln Journal Star. Those restrictions have ended, but businesses still must follow social distancing rules and require customers to be seated most of the time. Given that, Kirkpatrick said an expanded outdoor liquor license makes sense. Doug Dittman, owner of the Hub Cafe, said the change would “help people be more comfortable and safe.” Hobert Rupe, executive director of the Liquor Control Commission, said the agency probably would approve most requests but only for a limited period. Gov. Pete Ricketts said he hopes to end social distancing requirements by next month. If that happens, Rupe said the commission likely wouldn’t allow expanded outdoor licenses.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A union representing workers in Las Vegas casinos again called for all customers and workers in reopened casinos to wear face masks and for daily cleanings of guest rooms and regular testing of all workers for the novel coronavirus. The Culinary Union said an order by gambling regulators last week protects dealers by requiring face masks to be worn by gamblers at table games. But the union said those same protections need to be broadened to protect bartenders, cocktail waitresses, cleaners and other workers who interact with guests. The union is calling for Gov. Steve Sisolak, the Nevada Gaming Control Board and Clark County Commission, which oversees the Las Vegas Strip, to impose stricter safety measures. Yolanda Scott, a food server at a coffee shop at Treasure Island, estimated 10% of guests are wearing masks in public spaces at the resort. “That concerns me because I don’t feel safe. I do not want to bring the COVID-19 back to my family, my children. My partner has a bad kidney and a bad heart and we have to be extra cautious,” she said. Geoconda Argüello-Kline, the union’s secretary-treasurer, said workers are afraid to go back to work because they know the number of virus cases is going up in Nevada. She said 17 union members or people in their immediate family have died from COVID-19 since the outbreak started in Nevada. Argüello-Kline questioned why Sisolak isn’t following the lead of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who last week required that people wear masks in most indoor settings and outdoors when they aren’t able to socially distance. Sisolak’s office did not immediately respond to a message seeking a comment. On Friday, Sisolak said in a tweet that he was asking a team of doctors who have been advising him to evaluate potential options for face-covering policies. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday that Atlantic City’s casinos will be able to reopen July 2 at 25% capacity and guests and employees will have to wear face masks and undergo some level of health screening. Nevada’s casinos reopened June 4, after being closed for more than 11 weeks.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Many parents, teachers and education officials are eager for students to get back to school this fall, but there’s a lot of concern about achieving social distancing and workable hybrid learning plans, a state education task force said. The School Transition Reopening and Redesign Taskforce plans to issue 10 preliminary recommendations by June 30 to the state. The group got through questions and suggestions on the first half, which deal with establishing district and school management communications plans; determining public health protocols; preparing the school environment; supporting student, family and educator wellness; and establishing hybrid learning capacity. Task force members recognized that it’s very difficult for students to social distance and that guidelines might work for one district, but not another. “We could write all the recommendations in the world, but kids are going to do what kids are going to do,” said member Phil Nazarro of Southern New Hampshire University. Students also have mixed feelings about whether the wearing of personal protective equipment, such as masks, should be forced on them, said student representative Ben Lambright. Members also expressed concern about teachers’ workload and well-being over balancing classes in school with remote learning. Member Keith Noyes, a teacher, said colleagues with young children of their own would be in “crisis mode” trying to follow a schedule where students are alternating days at home and school.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Amusement and water parks, along with playgrounds across New Jersey can reopen on July 2, Gov. Phil Murphy said Tuesday. The parks must limit capacity to 50% and face masks must be worn by workers and attendees “where practicable,” the governor said. The announcement includes rides at shore resorts, he added. The new openings come just a day after the governor said casinos and indoor dining could restart also on July 2, but at 25% capacity. The state is in Stage 2 of three of reopening from the coronavirus lockdown. Salons, barbershops and tattoo and massage parlors also reopened this week.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico is under a state order for residents and travelers to wear masks in public places, but visitors to Santa Fe continue to stroll through the city’s downtown with uncovered faces. City officials plan to post signs by this weekend encouraging the use of face masks to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, The Santa Fe New Mexican reported Monday. Randy Randall, executive director of Tourism Santa Fe, the city’s convention and visitors bureau, expects to have 50 signs posted downtown. “I think we’re guilty of not properly advising people yet,” Randall said. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham spelled out the statewide rule in a May 15 public health order that said masks are required in public places, with exceptions for eating, drinking, exercising and medical requirements. The Santa Fe City Council approved a measure June 10 requiring everyone in the city over 15 to wear a mask in most public settings, including in public where maintaining a distance of 6 feet from others is not possible. Repeat offenders face a $50 fine for second and subsequent violations. Visitors often wear masks or other face coverings in Santa Fe stores but are reportedly lax about keeping them on outside, even in crowded public places. Downtown hotel and shop workers have attempted to spread the word about the rules, with many of their customers complying with requests.\n\nNew York\n\nRochester:Gov. Andrew Cuomo has given no indication when indoor shopping malls will be allowed to reopen with new safety precautions after they were closed in mid-March amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to more than 24,700 deaths in New York. In-person retail shopping was allowed weeks ago in Phase 2 of the state’s four-phase reopening plan. For malls, only stores with exterior entrances, such as department stores, were able to reopen. Stores inside the malls have been able to have curbside pickup for customers, but few are doing so – leaving mall owners, stores and customers wondering when the ban on indoor areas will be lifted. The uncertainty has been frustrating to mall owners who feel they have been without any clear sense of their immediate future. A spokesperson for Wilmorite, a company that owns four malls and major shopping plazas in the Rochester area, said that company leaders aren’t sure which phase their properties are in, and haven’t recieved any information from the state about when they move forward. Last week, Cuomo indicated no time frame for malls to reopen as five regions of upstate New York are expected to enter the fourth and final phase on Friday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s COVID-19 case trends have worsened since the economy has reopened in recent weeks, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Mandy Cohen said. But she wouldn’t say whether they would prevent more shuttered businesses from reopening when restrictions otherwise expire later this week. The number of virus-related hospitalizations remains near a record high for the pandemic, with 870 as of Monday morning, and the number of deaths exceed 1,200, according to DHHS data. Although the number of completed tests continues to grow rapidly – to more than 750,000 overall – the percentage of positive tests is on the upswing. “As we’ve reopened, we’ve seen our trends go in the wrong direction,” Cohen said during a media briefing. An executive order by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper that took effect May 22 lifted a stay-at-home order, allowed restaurants to open their dining rooms, and barber shops and salons to reopen. But bars, gyms, movie theaters and bowling alleys remain closed. The order expires Friday. Cooper has said he would announce early this week how he will modify the current restrictions, which also prevent outdoor mass assemblies above 25 people. Cohen was reserved in response to questions about what the data means for Cooper’s upcoming decisions. She said the public can help reverse the trend by wearing face masks, washing hands regularly and practicing social distancing.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state has collected about $43 million in online sales taxes since they were authorized two years ago, according to state revenue officials. The U.S. Supreme Court in June 2018 ruled that states can force online shoppers to pay sales tax. North Dakota began collecting from remote sellers that fall. “This was indeed a landmark decision for North Dakota and all states that use sales taxes as a vital source of state funding,” state tax Commissioner Ryan Rauschenberger said. The court’s decision leveled the playing field for local sellers who were no longer at a competitive disadvantage with their online competitors because of a sales tax requirement, Rauschenberger said. North Dakota cities and counties that impose local sales taxes have received nearly $15 million through the first half of this year, the Bismarck Tribune reported.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:Gov. Mike DeWine said earlier this month that every Ohioan who wants a coronavirus test can get one. On Tuesday, DeWine emphasized that point by submitting to a test on live TV. DeWine was swabbed for the virus by an Ohio National Guard nurse during his coronavirus briefing. His wife Fran and Lt. Gov. Jon Husted were also swabbed for the virus. On June 11, Ohio opened testing to anyone who wants one, even if they don’t have symptoms of COVID-19. Several “pop-up” testing sites are planned across the state, including 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday at CityLink Center, 800 Bank St., Cincinnati. A list of testing sites is available at coronavirus.ohio.gov.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The city’s metro area is witnessing an alarming spike in COVID-19 infections among young people that is being driven largely by “super spreader” indoor events like church activities, fitness classes, weddings, funerals and at bars, city officials said Tuesday. Mayor David Holt held his first news conference in weeks to discuss the dramatic increase in the number of new cases, especially among people in the 18-to-49 age group, and a spike in hospitalizations. Although evidence suggests young people are less susceptible to serious illness and death, Holt said he fears younger people could help facilitate a renewed outbreak of the disease. “People between the ages 18 and 50 don’t live in some sort of a bubble,” Holt said. “They are the children and grandchildren of vulnerable people. They may be standing next to you at a wedding. They might be serving you a meal in a restaurant. And people between the ages of 18 and 50 are more likely than ever before to be carrying the virus in Oklahoma City and giving it to vulnerable people.” The number of people hospitalized in the Oklahoma City area for COVID-19 jumped from 43 last week to 79 on Monday, and the number of people in intensive care units increased by about 50% over the same period, Holt said. “If hospitalizations continue to rise at the rates seen in the last few days or if deaths return to the rates seen previously, we will have little choice but to roll back to earlier phases of our reopening,” Holt said.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Oregon’s coronavirus case numbers increased by 514 people during the weekend and Monday, officials reported. A quarter of the new cases are based in Multnomah County, where officials said a majority of the spread is occurring among close social networks. “It’s human nature, I think, to expect that the people that might be more risky to someone would be strangers,” said Kim Toevs, who leads the Multnomah County’s infectious disease team. “And the people they feel more safe (with), are the people they know – especially family and friends.” However, authorities said when people are around friends or family they might opt not to wear a mask or not practice physical distancing. “Those are more likely the people to infect you because they are going to be closer to you, in your personal space and, usually, you are going to be interacting with them for a longer period of time,” Toevs said. Multnomah, which is Oregon’s most populous county and home to Portland, implemented Phase 1 of the state’s reopening plan Friday. Hood River, Marion, and Polk Counties also entered new reopening phases Friday. Although health officials reiterated Monday they expect an increase in cases during reopening, the goal remains to minimize the number of people that are hospitalized. There are 93 people who have tested positive in Oregon who are in the hospital – 24 of those patients are on ventilators, according to data on the state’s website. “The measure of hospitalizations and hospital capacity is something that we are going to be watching very closely,” Jennifer Vines, the lead health officer for the Tri-county area, said Monday.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration said Tuesday that its most recent count showed about 518 contact tracers are in place to investigate and monitor the spread of the novel coronavirus. Those tracers are following more than 4,000 contacts. The Health Department said more than 2,700 cases were added to the investigation total during the week that ended Thursday. The agency said it has been getting back nearly 14,000 test results per day over the past month.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A fund established to support Rhode Islanders struggling because of the coronavirus pandemic has distributed another $700,000 to 23 nonprofits across the state to help with food, rent, utilities and other expenses, the fund said Tuesday. The COVID-19 Response Fund created in March by the Rhode Island Foundation and the United Way of Rhode Island has now awarded nearly $8 million in grants ranging from $10,000 to $50,000. One of the organizations helped in the latest round of funding is Connecting for Children & Families in Woonsocket. In addition to a food pantry and help with utility bills, the nonprofit has expanded its services to include a food-delivery service for front-line health workers, older and disabled residents. The Trinity Episcopal Church Food Closet in Scituate, the Housing Hotline in Newport, and the African Alliance in Providence are also among the organizations that received funding. The fund has raised about $8.5 million, but there is still a need for donations, Neil Steinberg, president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation said in a statement. “As a state we have begun to shift focus from COVID-19 response to relief and recovery, but even with that positive shift, need in the community continues to grow,” he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: The City Council voted Monday to require people to wear masks in grocery stores and pharmacies, becoming the first in the state mandating face coverings to fight COVID-19. The council passed the rule unanimously hours after placing it on its regular agenda. All employees in restaurants, retail stores, salons, grocery stores and pharmacies will have to wear masks. Customers in grocery stores and pharmacies will need coverings over their noses and faces, but anyone who can’t wear a mask because of age or underlying illness is excluded. Anyone convicted of breaking the rule will be fined up to $25. Greenville has had some of the highest COVID-19 rates in the state in recent weeks. Mayor Knox White said the city carefully chose to require masks in only businesses that everyone has to use, whether they are trying to isolate themselves or not. “Anybody can choose or not choose to go to a certain retailer, like a dress shop or something. You really don’t have a choice for groceries,” White said. Gov. Henry McMaster again said Monday that he isn’t considering a statewide mask requirement because it might violate people’s rights. He has emphasized making the right choice and wearing face coverings voluntarily to slow a rise in cases that has the state in the top five in the nation for new infections.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid: Gov. Kristi Noem made another stop Tuesday in Rapid City on her tour of the state and told local leaders that Rapid City would be able to access up to $17.5 million and Pennington County would get $7.5 million in federal coronavirus relief funds. Rapid City Mayor Steve Allender said the city plans to have money it spent on an emergency shelter and emergency services reimbursed. He said police and emergency medics have seen their work “dominated by COVID and the effects of it.” Noem made a similar announcement on Monday in Sioux Falls, which will be able to expense up to $41.5 million to federal funds the state has received. The governor said the federal funds can also be used to develop a program to help businesses hurt by the economic downturn, but that it would require action from the Legislature. She said that might be considered by lawmakers at a special session in the next several months. Noem has encouraged businesses to “innovate” rather than shutting down completely during the pandemic, a move she hopes will help the state bounce back from the pandemic.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state has started offering high school equivalency exams online, another option while many in-person testing locations remain closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The state Department of Labor and Workforce Development said the online testing option began Monday through a new online program, HiSET Exam at Home, through the ProctorU service. The online exams are the same as ones taken at testing centers in terms of content, format, on-screen experience and scoring. The state has a voucher program to cover all costs for the testing. Test takers must be at least 18 years old and ensure that their computer and testing room meet remote proctoring requirements. Those interested in taking the online test should contact their local adult education provider.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi:Del Mar College officials said three students have tested positive for COVID-19. College officials said in a statement late Monday they received information during the weekend that the students tested positive for the virus.The students are in different degree programs and the cases are not related. All three were immediately instructed to self-isolate. Thirty additional students and eight employees who were in close contact with the individuals have also been asked to self-isolate. Areas on Del Mar’s West Campus, where the exposures occurred, have been disinfected, the college said in the statement. Those identified as being exposed to the virus while on college property have been personally notified by a college representative as per guidelines devised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “The health and safety of our students and employees remain our top priority at Del Mar College,” the college said in the statement. “All College facilities remain closed to the public. Only restricted access for approved employees and designated students is allowed at this time.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Gary Herbert said he has no plans to shut down the economy even though he shares some of the concerns of the state’s epidemiologist, who warned a “complete shutdown” might be imminent if the state can’t stop a prolonged spike of coronavirus cases. Herbert tweeted late Monday that he appreciated the analysis by epidemiologist Angela Dunn in her memo. It detailed the seriousness of a spread of COVID-19 that has doubled the infection rate and daily case count since Herbert allowed many businesses to reopen in mid-May. “We will work to stem this tide, but I have no plans to shut down Utah’s economy,” tweeted the Republican governor, who isn’t seeking reelection after holding the post since 2009. Utah is one of nearly two dozen states dealing with rising case rates following reopenings. Herbert’s tweet came after his office issued a different statement Monday afternoon that expressed his shared concern but didn’t include the vow not to shut down the economy. He has pointed to his decision to gradually lift restrictions allowing restaurants, gyms, pools and salons to reopen as a key reason why Utah has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. Herbert has said the state can begin to recover economically without risking people’s health.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Vermont businesses are going to be getting a break on the costs of their unemployment insurance, and people collecting unemployment benefits will be getting more money, Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday. Starting July 1, the Vermont Department of Labor will change its rate structure, reducing individual employers’ rates. In the first full week of July, the maximum benefit for people collecting unemployment will increase from $513 to $531. The tax relief will help reduce the burden on employers who have had to make difficult decisions to protect the health and safety of workers while limiting the spread of COVID-19 in Vermont, the Republican governor said in a statement. “We know Vermonters made a tremendous economic sacrifice in order to respond to this virus, and we will continue to pull every lever we can to help workers and employers recover from this pandemic,” Scott said. Labor Commissioner Michael Harrington said the lower rates were based on 2019 information and do not include the effects that COVID-19 has had on the economy. “Unfortunately, we will feel the impacts of COVID in the subsequent year and for years to come,” Harrington said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam said Tuesday that he plans to further relax restrictions on businesses and public gatherings next week, saying trends related to cases of COVID-19, hospitalizations and other key health metrics were moving in the right direction. Northam said at a news conference that he’s planning for the state to enter Phase 3 of reopening July 1. Under Phase 3, restaurants and nonessential retail stores would no longer have to limit indoor capacity to 50% of what their space can hold but would still have to keep customers 6 feet apart. Gyms could go from 30% capacity to 75%, and social gatherings of up to 250 people would be allowed. Outdoor swimming pools could operate with fewer restrictions at 75% their normal capacity. Recreation and entertainment venues at may operate at 50% occupancy, or a maximum of 1,000 people. Northam, who is a doctor, said Virginians are still “safer at home,” especially if they are elderly or have underlying conditions that make them more vulnerable to the virus. “I want to reiterate that everyone should continue to take this pandemic very seriously. Cases are on the rise in many other states. … I do not want to see that happen in our Commonwealth,” he said.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: State firefighters are preparing for a season of potential summer wildfires while adopting new health safety measures amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic has added a new layer of uncertainty to the work of preparing for wildfire season, The Skagit Valley Herald reported Sunday. A period of dry spring weather was followed by an onslaught of rain, sending mixed signals about the likelihood for major fires this summer. The emergence of the coronavirus has meant firefighters also have to rethink how to work without infecting each other. Firefighters are screened when reporting to work. Their temperatures are taken and they answer health questions such as whether they have had sore throats or fevers in recent weeks, and if they have traveled or been exposed to anyone with COVID-19. Care is taken in the field to avoid sharing tools, move individuals and groups in as many separate vehicles as possible and sanitize vehicle interiors and equipment at the end of each shift. Firefighters are also equipped with face masks for work that requires being in close proximity. “Fire season isn’t going away. We can’t just work from home or take the summer off,” Jason McMillen said during a state Department of Natural Resources annual training last week.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nInstitute: All in-person homecoming activities will be canceled this year at West Virginia State University because of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. The university said that homecoming activities scheduled between Sept. 24-26, including class reunions and a parade, would be canceled, WCHS-TV reported. The only event not canceled is the Sept. 26 football game against Notre Dame College. That game will take place with reduced fan attendance, Details on the social distancing policy will be announced at a later date. The university plans for in-person classes this fall with a modified academic calendar that was announced earlier this month. The fall semester will begin Aug. 10 and conclude on Nov. 20. More safety precautions for the fall semester will be announced soon.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: New state guidelines for reopening schools this fall are merely suggestions and local officials will ultimately decide the parameters for bringing their students back, Gov. Tony Evers said Tuesday. The governor closed schools in March as the coronavirus pandemic seized the state. Districts finished out the year through distance learning. The state Department of Public Instruction issued reopening guidelines for schools on Monday. The guidelines call for face masks, a maximum of 10 students per class and keeping buildings open as few as two days a week. Evers, a former state schools superintendent, told reporters during a conference call that the guidelines are a list of options, not orders. Local school districts can make their own choices, the governor said. Local school boards have been pondering how to reopen since March, the governor said, and he has “confidence school districts will be able to figure this out.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Health officials worry an event in the state capital city last weekend could worsen a spike in coronavirus cases. The Cheyenne area went weeks with few new cases. Then on Monday, city officials announced 15 new cases, most of them people between 20 and 30. The cases preceded last weekend’s “Summertime On the Streets” event that brought hundreds of people downtown. Some went to Accomplice Beer Company, a microbrewery in the historic Union Pacific Depot where workers recently tested positive for COVID-19. The brewery shut down Monday for a sanitizing period and health investigation, owner Roy Sandoval told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle. Workers at no fewer than three restaurants in Cheyenne have tested positive or otherwise likely have COVID-19, Cheyenne-Laramie County Health Department officials said. The crowds at “Summertime in the Streets” raised concern the Cheyenne-area spike could worsen, department executive director Kathy Emmons said. “It doesn’t appear like a lot of people were wearing masks,” Emmons said. “If people weren’t practicing social distancing – which, from the pictures I saw, I didn’t see that – that’s going to most likely lead to increased numbers in the county.” Elsewhere, health officials blamed a lack of social distancing at bars in Evanston around Memorial Day for a spike approaching 100 active cases.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/09/10/school-starts-paper-masks-hero-pay-news-around-states/113747132/", "title": "School starts, paper masks: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: The city eased pandemic restrictions and began allowing bars to reopen with limits Tuesday, days after the University of Alabama reported nearly 850 new cases of the coronavirus, which has affected more than 2,000 students at the school. The change followed complaints from bar owners that a two-week shutdown, meant to stem the spread of the illness on campus, was unfair and hurting business. But critics charged that allowing bars to reopen after the closure would make it easier for the new coronavirus to infect people. School and city officials said the university appears to be headed in the right direction in combating the virus despite reporting 846 new cases Friday. That equaled 121 new cases daily from Aug. 28 to Sept. 3 as opposed to more 160 new cases reported each day Aug. 25-27. Some bars tried to lure patrons by announcing the reopening on social media with drink specials and games.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A lawsuit filed Tuesday asks a judge to block election officials from enforcing during the COVID-19 pandemic a requirement that Alaska absentee voters have someone witness them signing their ballots. The plaintiffs are the Arctic Village Council, a tribal government; the League of Women Voters of Alaska; and two individuals who the lawsuit says have health concerns. The lawsuit seeks to have the witness requirement declared “unconstitutionally burdensome” on the plaintiffs’ right to vote amid the pandemic. Maria Bahr, a state Department of Law spokesperson, said the department needs time to evaluate the complaint. The lawsuit names as defendants Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer, who oversees elections; Gail Fenumiai, director of the Division of Elections; and the division. Meyer has encouraged voters to “think creatively” about how to fulfill the witness requirement “in a safe manner.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State health officials reported just over 80 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and two deaths Tuesday, fueling some business owners to call for an end to operating restrictions. The Department of Health Services reported 81 additional cases statewide. The last time the state saw a daily case count below 100 was in March, according to online data. So far, 5,221 people in the state have died of the disease caused by the coronavirus, and there have been 206,045 confirmed cases. The state, once a national hot spot for infections, continues to see a downward trend in infections and hospitalizations. The number of reported infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State health officials on Tuesday said their biggest growth in new coronavirus cases is among college-aged people, with the number of active infections at the University of Arkansas’ main campus approaching 1,000. The Arkansas Department of Health on Tuesday reported 294 newly confirmed virus cases statewide, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 66,021. Cases among people 18 to 24 years old grew by nearly 17% last week, two to three times more than any other age group. The state Health Department said the school has 961 active cases. The spike comes days after the school moved to restrict on-campus events and off-campus parties over concerns about the outbreak. The school told students they would treat organizing or attending large parties without masks or social distancing as a violation of the student code.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Significantly fewer people are testing positive and being hospitalized for the coronavirus, but Gov. Gavin Newsom and his top health official said Tuesday that they won’t speed up the deliberate process they established last month for reopening the state. The system allows counties to reopen more businesses and activities as they meet thresholds for infection rates and cases. There are four color-coded levels, and five new counties – Amador, Orange, Placer, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz – moved out of the highest tier, clearing the way for their restaurants, movie theaters, gyms and churches to resume limited indoor activities. Statewide, California’s infection rate has dropped steadily for weeks and now sits at 3.8% for the past seven days. Hospitalizations total about 3,100, the lowest since mid-June and down 24% in two weeks. “If those appear to be promising numbers, it’s because they are,” Newsom said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Coloradans will soon be able to download or activate a free app that will notify them when they might’ve been exposed to COVID-19, Gov. Jared Polis announced at a Tuesday press conference. Also at the press conference, Polis detailed plans for in-person attendance at the upcoming Sept. 27 Denver Broncos game, when an estimated 5,700 fans will watch the game at Empower Field at Mile High Stadium. Paired together, the two pieces of news preview a return to “quote-unquote normalcy” if Coloradans can keep up social distancing, Polis said. The exposure notification app, called EN Express, will be available on smartphones at the end of September as an iOS update for Apple users and an app for Android users. The voluntary, free app won’t track or share people’s location or personal information, said Sarah Tuneberg, Innovation Response Team Lead for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.\n\nConnecticut\n\nSomers: Two schools have been temporarily closed, and staff members in several others have been sent home to quarantine following positive tests for the new coronavirus just days into the start of a new academic year. The Valley Regional High School in Deep River, which opened Sept. 1, was closed Tuesday and Wednesday after two students were diagnosed with COVID-19, according to Regional School District 4 Superintendent Brian White. The school continued classes online while staff worked to clean the building. Families of children in the Somers Elementary School, which opened Tuesday, received similar news after a staff member in a pre-kindergarten class there reported a positive test. That school announced it will be closed to in-person learning through Thursday for cleaning. Schools remained open in Waterbury, Glastonbury, Plainville, Newington, Washington, Cornwall and Coventry despite positive tests for the virus.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state is investigating what might be behind a slight increase in coronavirus cases over the past week or so. The cities of Wilmington, New Castle, Newark and Dover in particular are seeing a rise in cases. Gov. John Carney said the state has made progress but still needs to do more. “We have an upper hand, but we’re not completely winning,” Carney said. “We’re not hammering down this virus like we need to. And that just requires everybody to lean in just a little bit more and to wear that mask when you’re in public.” Carney said the focus of the outbreaks are the young adults who are less concerned about the virus and have a “sense of invincibility.” He pointed to parties on college campuses as well as bars and restaurants. Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Delaware Division of Public Health, said the University of Delaware has reported 41 cases since Sept. 3. Investigators have been unable to find a single point of exposure.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Unemployed D.C. residents are set to get more much-needed relief and money from the federal government, WUSA-TV reports. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the District of Columbia Department of Employment Services said federal officials approved the district’s application to participate in the Lost Wages Assistance Program, allowing D.C. to offer an additional unemployment compensation benefit of $300 per week to eligible unemployment insurance recipients. The LWA program has helped provide money for unemployment after the expiration of the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation’s $600 weekly benefit in July. Payments would be retroactive to Aug. 1, and the district expects recipients will start receiving payments by the first week of October.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The number of Florida State University students testing positive for COVID-19 showed a marked increase in the past week. Figures released Tuesday show more than 700 Florida State University students tested positive in the past week, compared to the previous week. The latest numbers show 839 students and 14 employees testing positive. The university pointed to an overall positivity rate of 7.32% for cases collected since Aug. 2. That rate includes data from before many FSU students arrived for the first day of class Aug. 24. The spike in positive tests at FSU comes as Leon County was recently listed as a hot spot, having been on The New York Times’ online map of coronavirus cases. The vast majority of new cases have been in the school- and college-age group.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Workers coming to the coast to cut apart and remove a giant cargo ship that overturned a year ago will be sequestered at a nearby resort, which will close to the public for up to four months, in an effort to prevent coronavirus infections among the salvage team. Tuesday marked a year since the South Korean freighter Golden Ray capsized off St. Simons Island. Experts determined the ship was too badly damaged to be floated out intact, so they plan to slice it into eight massive pieces for removal by barge. Cutting had been scheduled to begin in late July but was delayed after nine workers tested positive for COVID-19. The salvage team hopes to begin cutting in early October, said Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Himes, a spokesman for the multi-agency command overseeing the salvage. He confirmed the command booked the resort Epworth by the Sea to keep about 100 salvage workers housed in a “bubble” for a four-month period.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Mayor Kirk Caldwell said Tuesday that he would extend the city’s stay-at-home order for two weeks to control the coronavirus but will modify the rules to allow solo activity at beaches, parks and trails. The stay-at-home order will be kept in place through Sept. 24. Individuals will be able to go to beaches, parks and trails to run, sit or eat by themselves beginning Thursday. Caldwell said he extended the order because the number of new COVID-19 cases hadn’t declined as much as he wanted to loosen rules more significantly. He said he wants to discuss over the next two weeks how to cautiously reopen more activities. Caldwell said the city relaxed restrictions too quickly when it lifted the previous stay-at-home order, contributing to a surge in cases. The mayor said he wants to avoid that outcome this time. The state Department of Health reported 66 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, a lower figure than in recent days.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State tax revenue for August blew past predictions for the second consecutive month, state budget officials said Tuesday. Idaho’s state tax revenues came in $37 million, or 13%, over forecasts, and the state is looking at a potential $500 million in surplus tax revenue for the fiscal year that started in July. Republican Gov. Brad Little told the Associated Press the latest numbers bode well for his plan to reopen the economy while handling the continued impact of the coronavirus pandemic. But he said he’s viewing the latest budget numbers cautiously. “We’re budgeting in a time of great uncertainty,” he said. “One or two months does not make a long-term trend, but it’s darn better than having to go the other way.” He attributed some of the good numbers to conservative budgeting and cuts to regulations.\n\nIllinois\n\nPeoria: Bradley University is requiring its entire student body to quarantine for two weeks because of clusters of COVID-19 on campus and is reverting to remote learning, officials announced Tuesday. Officials of the private university said they have linked a spike of the coronavirus to off-campus gatherings. The Peoria school is requiring students to limit nonessential interactions; stay in their off-campus apartments, residence halls or Greek houses; and take classes remotely beginning Tuesday. In announcing the measure, the university said it has tallied about 50 COVID-19 cases so far, adding that emergency measures are needed to respond to the outbreak without disrupting academic progress. Most of those who tested positive are asymptomatic carriers, and others have experienced mild symptoms, Bradley President Stephen Standifird said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Mayor Joe Hogsett on Tuesday announced the city will devote millions in federal coronavirus aid to provide rehousing services to the homeless. About $7.1 million will be used to connect hundreds of Hoosiers who are currently experiencing homelessness with up to 12 months of rental assistance and wraparound services to help them find housing and stay housed long-term. A tenet of the city’s housing-first strategy to combating homelessness, rapid rehousing has three main components, said Chelsea Haring-Cozzi, executive director of the Coalition for Homelessness Intervention and Prevention: housing, rental assistance and connections to services, including employment, to provide long-term solutions to homelessness. An estimated 90% of those who have been housed through rapid rehousing programs remain housed after two years, she said.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Falls: The city approved a mask mandate Tuesday, joining with others in the state that have taken similar moves amid continued high numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases. Cedar Falls joins Cedar Rapids, Des Moines, Dubuque, Iowa City, Mount Vernon, Muscatine and Waterloo in enacting mask requirements. Enforcement of the rules varies but is primarily focused on education, with police in some communities instructed to hand out masks to those not wearing them. Gov. Kim Reynolds has declined to approve a statewide mask order because she said it would be impossible to enforce. Reynolds has told local jurisdictions that because she hasn’t issued an order, they don’t have the authority to enforce their mask mandates. In Cedar Falls, the mask rule takes effect immediately and will last for six weeks. It requires masks for people older than 5 while in indoor public places and outdoors when it’s not possible to maintain a distance of 6 feet.\n\nKansas\n\nOlathe: Students and teachers facing an already challenging new school year dealt with technology issues as more school districts reopened Tuesday with many students working online. In Olathe, service was interrupted Tuesday when nearly 50,000 users on separate devices tried to log on to the district’s online teaching system that is designed for 30,000 students, school officials said. Middle and high school students were using only remote learning, while elementary students started with a hybrid of online and in-person classes. The district had previously increased its bandwidth. After more servers were added, the disruption was cleared by mid-morning, spokesman Cody Kennedy said. In Wichita, where students in sixth through 12th grades were only online and elementary students started with the hybrid model, the district had enough devices for online students but still needed hot spots for some, Superintendent Alicia Thompson told KAKE-TV.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Leaders with the Metro Disability Coalition protested Tuesday what they called a “horrible situation” facing drivers with disabilities aboard Transit Authority of River City buses. Marcellus Mayes, president of MDC, stood in front of TARC headquarters and compared buses to a “nursing home on wheels.” He and Bobbie Jones, vice president of MDC, said TARC isn’t enforcing personal protective equipment on buses; isn’t providing drivers with enough cleaning supplies and PPE for their routes; is not making drivers coming in from hot spots or other countries quarantine before driving; and is not treating a personal care attendant as an individual who factors into the headcount. TARC has a 25-person limit on fixed routes, and TARC3, which provides transportation for people with disabilities, has a two-passenger limit on buses and a one-passenger limit on vans and cars.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Republican state officials’ reluctance to allow expanded mail-in voting this fall – despite having done so for summer elections – is at issue in a federal case unfolding this week amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Voting rights advocates have filed a lawsuit against the current, limited plan for absentee mail balloting drawn up by Louisiana’s Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin. Ardoin, a Republican, has said he could not get needed approval from GOP lawmakers for anything more expansive. But Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards’ approval also is needed, and he has said Ardoin’s plan does too little to protect voter health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Edwards has asked U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick in Baton Rouge to resolve what amounts to a stalemate by ordering broader mail-in voting in the state. Dick presided over an online hearing where preliminaries were discussed Tuesday.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Public health officials monitoring the spread of coronavirus in other states are no closer to easing travel restrictions put in place because of the virus. Maine requires travelers from other states to produce a negative coronavirus test or quarantine for two weeks. It exempted New Hampshire and Vermont from those requirements in late June and added Connecticut, New York and New Jersey to the exempt list in early July. Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Nirav Shah said Tuesday that the state recently reviewed case statistics in other states and “didn’t see anything that prompted us to move any states into the ‘can visit without negative test’ category.” That means the travel restrictions still apply to Massachusetts, which sends droves of tourists to Maine every summer and fall. But Shah said the number of new cases per million in Massachusetts was 769, more than three times the number in Maine.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Hospital workers out front in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic would receive “hero pay,” or bonuses, under a bill proposed by a U.S. representative. Democratic Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland’s Second Congressional District plans to roll out his proposal Thursday, The Baltimore Sun reports, citing a news release from the congressman’s office Tuesday. The plan would provide hazard pay to doctors, nurses, specialists and nonmedical staffs in hospitals such as custodians who work in close proximity to COVID-19 patients within federally designated virus hot spots, the news release said. It’s not immediately clear how much workers would receive or where funding for the plan would come from. Ruppersberger named the bill after Dr. Joseph Costa, the director of the critical care unit at Baltimore’s Mercy Medical Center who died of COVID-19 in July.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A coronavirus testing lab that counts dozens of nursing homes among its clients has been suspended by the state after it returned nearly 400 false positive tests, state officials say. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health opened an investigation in early August after it became aware of an unusually high positive rate of COVID-19 tests reported by Orig3n Laboratory, the agency said in a statement Tuesday. Retests found at least 383 false positives that were actually negative. The state late last month notified Orig3n of “three significant certification deficiencies that put patients at immediate risk of harm,” including failure of the lab’s director to provide overall management and a failure to document the daily sanitizing of equipment used for coronavirus testing. An Orig3n spokesman told Gannett New England, which first reported the story, that the false positives were due to “human error.”\n\nMichigan\n\nEast Lansing: More than 120 students last week reported positive results for the coronavirus – a “wake-up call to our community,” Michigan State University said Tuesday. The students, nearly all living off campus, had symptoms and were tested on campus or reported the results from tests performed elsewhere. President Samuel Stanley Jr. said the numbers were “disappointing but not unexpected.” “As students return to off-campus housing, some are attending large gatherings where people are in close contact without an appropriate face covering,” he said. “This is the easiest and fastest way for the coronavirus to spread.” MSU said 124 students and two employees tested positive. The Ingham County health department has limited outdoor gatherings in East Lansing to 25 people who aren’t from the same household. East Lansing also is requiring masks on streets and sidewalks in popular commercial areas.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Winona State University quarantined itself for two weeks starting Tuesday amid an increasing spread of the coronavirus on the southeastern Minnesota campus, while most of the state’s elementary and secondary schools kicked off a school year that will test whether their preparations to teach amid the pandemic will pay off. The day after Labor Day marks the traditional return to school for most Minnesota school districts, though some started earlier. The state’s colleges and universities have been seeing a lot of coronavirus spread already, said Kris Ehresman, the infectious disease director at the Minnesota Department of Health. Besides Winona State, she cited Concordia-Moorhead and Minnesota State-Moorhead as collectively having a large number of cases. Minnesota State-Mankato has stabilized, she said, “but we’ll see what comes after the holiday weekend.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said it’s “unfortunate” that the coronavirus pandemic broke out during an election year, and the upcoming election has made conversations about the virus overly political. “It’s certainly unfortunate that if we’re going to have a pandemic, the likes of which we haven’t seen in over 100 years, that it would happen to occur – maybe it wasn’t happenstance – but that it would happen to occur during an election year, which has made a large number of people look at every single decision from a political viewpoint,” Reeves said at a Tuesday press briefing. He said initiating those conversations “certainly hasn’t always been helpful.” The governor did not elaborate on what he meant when he said “maybe it wasn’t happenstance” that the pandemic occurred during an election year. He said he believes President Donald Trump has gone above and beyond in his response.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: A 34-year-old teacher has died after a three-week-long hospitalization with COVID-19. AshLee DeMarinis taught social skills and special education at John Evans Middle School in the Potosi School District in eastern Missouri. Superintendent Alex McCaul announced her death in a letter Monday that was posted on the district’s Facebook page. The letter didn’t cite a cause of death. But DeMarinis’ sister, Jennifer Heissenbuttel, said DeMarinis had been hospitalized with the coronavirus and died Sunday. Heissenbuttel said her sister had not yet begun teaching students when she became ill last month but had returned to the classroom to prepare for the school year. McCaul said contact tracing has found DeMarinis had no close contact with any other teachers or staff. The district’s school year began Aug. 24 with in-person classes, though students can opt to attend classes virtually.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A tribal college in southern Montana is waiving tuition and fees for the fall semester in an effort to ease hardships created by COVID-19, school officials said. Little Big Horn College on the Crow Indian Reservation announced the waiver last month, The Billings Gazette reports. Course registration closes in mid-September. The college plans to offer a mix of online-only and hybrid courses to limit the number of students on campus, President David Yarlott said. The college is using federal coronavirus relief funding to offset the loss of tuition, Yarlott said. Big Horn County, where the college is located, has been hit hard by COVID-19, with 735 cases and 19 deaths, two of which were announced by the county health department Wednesday. Montana reported 90 new cases of COVID-19 Wednesday, as the total number of known cases since mid-March neared 8,500.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has suspended six sorority and fraternity chapters on its campus after photos and videos showed students in those organizations violating local public health guidelines and university policies. The suspensions were handed down Tuesday, the Lincoln Journal Star reports, to Alpha Omicron Phi, Alpha Xi Delta, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Phi Delta Thea and Sigma Phi Epsilon. During the suspensions, the Greek chapters may not host or participate in any activities or events, nor participate in universitywide events as an organization. UNL administrators learned several Greek houses had hosted large gatherings Monday, which was bid day for several sororities. Attendees were not wearing face coverings or observing social distancing guidelines, officials said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Area health officials said Tuesday that eight children under age 14 who tested positive for COVID-19 since March were also diagnosed with a rare inflammatory condition linked with the coronavirus. The Southern Nevada Health District said all eight children were hospitalized and released, and the district has begun adding daily tallies of confirmed cases of the illness dubbed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children to its daily online coronavirus response report. While there isn’t a known cause, many children with the illness had COVID-19 or had close contact with someone who did. Not all children exhibit the same symptoms. They can include fever, stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes and fatigue. Researchers say the illness can cause inflammation of the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The pandemic changed not just how candidates campaigned leading up to Tuesday’s state primary but the act of voting itself. Temporary changes to state law allowed anyone with concerns about the virus to vote by absentee ballot. Those who voted in person stood 6 feet apart in line and were greeted by volunteers sitting behind Plexiglas shields. Some communities required voters to wear masks, while setting aside separate areas for those who declined to wear a mask or couldn’t do so for health reasons. “It was as smooth as silk,” said Reed Cotton, of Concord, who wore a mask and gloves and was carrying her toddler grandson. She considered getting an absentee ballot but decided to go vote, instead, since the number of coronavirus cases was so low. “I’m free!” Mick Swanwick exclaimed to his wife, Susan, as they removed their masks after leaving the polling place. “It was needlessly elaborate, but it seemed safe enough.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Students across the state started school Tuesday, with most returning to hybrid in-person and remote lessons, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said. The school-year shake-up stems from the state’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak, which has resulted in nearly 195,000 positive cases and more than 14,000 deaths. Murphy said 388 school districts opted for a hybrid model, which entails classroom and remote learning. There were 69 districts with all in-person learning and 238 with all-remote starts. Some 28 districts contain schools that went with a combination of those models, Murphy said. There were about 280 new positive cases reported overnight, the governor said, putting the total at about 195,000. There were five deaths reported, leaving the death toll at 14,213. The rate of transmission ticked up to 1.10 from 1.09 on Monday. The rate reflects the number of people to whom an infected person passes the virus.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State officials clarified Tuesday that teachers won’t be on the hook for lawsuits that might stem from COVID-19 outbreaks. “In no way will teachers or school employees be held personally liable for litigation arising out of COVID-19,” said Richard Valerio, executive director of New Mexico Public Schools Insurance Authority. School districts can be on the hook for negligence that leads to students getting sick, however. The insurance agency sent a letter last week to districts urging them to follow safe COVID-19 practices to avoid getting sued. Valerio said it’s “wait and see” as to how much legal risk schools will face. No lawsuits have been filed in New Mexico, which has had some in-person learning for certain at-risk students. Teachers are immune from personal liability for virtually all lawsuits, such as a personal injury claim from a student who contracts a virus at school.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants in the city can resume indoor dining Sept. 30 at 25% capacity with other restrictions, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday. Cuomo said all customers will undergo temperature checks at the door, and one member of each party will have to provide information for contact tracing if needed. Customers will not be served drinks at bars, which will be used only to provide drinks for table service, and restaurants must close at midnight. Tables will be required to be 6 feet apart, and customers must wear masks while not at the table. Indoor dining is already allowed in restaurants elsewhere in New York state. “We knew that compliance was lacking in New York City. That was a reason for caution,” Cuomo said. He said the state could halt indoor dining if infection rates go up. But if it remains steady, New York City could lift more restrictions on indoor dining starting Nov. 1.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: At least 1,000 East Carolina University students have tested positive for the coronavirus since fall classes began Aug. 10, according to the college’s COVID-19 case count. ECU’s COVID-19 dashboard, updated Tuesday afternoon, showed 1,084 students tested positive for the virus between Aug. 9 and Sept. 5, thus making ECU the first college in the state to eclipse 1,000 cases since classes restarted. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University, which started in-person classes the same day as ECU, are also approaching 1,000 student coronavirus cases. UNC had more than 900 student cases through Sept. 3, while N.C. State reported nearly 800 through Aug. 29, according to their university dashboards. Police shut down several parties during ECU’s opening weekend, including one with about 400 attendees.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Several groups in the state are working to increase tribal participation in the 2020 U.S. census to ensure they are not undercounted or underfunded. Overall, North Dakota has an 86% response rate and about a 64% self-response rate. But participation of the state’s five tribal nations ranges from 21% to 40% for self-response, U.S. Census Bureau data shows. Census advocates credit many factors to the low response, most notably the coronavirus pandemic, the Bismarck Tribune reports. “The ability for workers going door to door, social distancing – that’s been a big, big part of it,” North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission Executive Director Scott Davis said. “That’s probably been the biggest factor that I’ve seen experienced.” Davis also pointed out that reservations can be harder to count because of rural settings and a lack of housing.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: About 48,000 Ohioans have been notified they received an overpayment of unemployment benefits during the coronavirus pandemic, the state human services agency said. That’s about 6% of the nearly 800,000 Ohioans who have been paid regular unemployment benefits since the start of the pandemic in March, according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. About 1.7 million Ohioans filed jobless claims during the pandemic. The state has paid out $6.2 billion in state unemployment compensation to almost 800,000 people and distributed more than $5.4 billion in federal payments. In most cases, the overpayments are the result of individuals not reporting or underreporting money they made during weeks for which they filed claims, said Bret Crow, a Job and Family services spokesperson. Overpayments as the result of a state error don’t have to be repaid.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: City Council members, torn between slowing the spread of COVID-19 and restricting struggling businesses, backed away from a plan Tuesday night to reduce Campus Corner bar and restaurant capacity by 50% on days when the University of Oklahoma football team plays at home. Instead, the council voted 7-1 to amend the city’s existing mask and social ordinance by allowing bars and restaurants to operate at 75% of capacity inside and outside, including patios and blocked-off streets, where patrons will gather Saturday for OU’s season opener against Missouri State. Mayor Breea Clark supported the amendment but expressed concerns about Norman’s rising infection rate, which she called “concerning.” The existing ordinance already limits most bars and restaurants to 50% capacity, but some that operate near the OU campus have struggled to meet those requirements, council member Kate Bierman said.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The positivity rate of COVID-19 tests in the state dropped for the sixth consecutive week, according to a new report from the Oregon Health Authority. The positivity rate was 4.3% the week of Aug. 30 to Sept. 5, when there were a reported 1,163 positive tests out of 25,855 tests administered. It was the lowest Oregon had been since the week of June 21-27, when the positivity rate was 4.8%. The rate was a drop from 4.4% the week before and 6.2% the week of July 26 to Aug. 1. The number of tests administered has dropped steadily since mid-July, when 40,887 were administered the week of July 12-18.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nLancaster: Gov. Tom Wolf is urging the Legislature to extend the statewide moratorium on evictions to avoid the ouster of thousands of tenants who have lost jobs because of coronavirus shutdowns. The commonwealth’s moratorium, which ended last week, legally cannot be extended by the governor alone. “Pennsylvania is still racing toward an eviction cliff when thousands of families will face months of unpaid rent and fees,” Wolf said at a press conference in Lancaster on Tuesday. Last week the Trump administration implemented a national four-month moratorium on residential evictions, but Wolf said that alone would not do enough for Pennsylvanians at risk of losing their homes. “It only helps some renters, not all,” Wolf said. “It doesn’t stop mortgage foreclosures at all, and it doesn’t assist landlords who are struggling to pay their mortgages and pay their taxes. So I am continuing to ask our General Assembly to act.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A British company with a factory in the state has started manufacturing recyclable paper masks it says address two problems brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. MOO Inc.’s masks, made of heavy gauge cotton paper, can affordably help protect workers at businesses when customers forget to bring a mask, and they cut down on trash. “It’s a single sheet of paper with no plastic, no elastic, so it’s completely recyclable,” the company’s chief operating officer, Nicholas Ruotolo, told The Providence Journal. “It’s a great solution to the challenges that we face, both the health challenges and the environmental ones.” MOO, which prints business cards, letterhead, fliers and other business products at its Lincoln facility, can even customize the masks with a company logo. The company, which began production last week, is donating 5,000 masks to Crossroads Rhode Island, an agency that works with the homeless.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The University of South Carolina says it has drawn among its largest freshman classes in history, along with increases in enrollment at its flagship campus for the fall semester, beginning amid the coronavirus pandemic. The state’s largest four-year college reported welcoming its second-largest freshman class, among more than 35,400 total undergraduate and graduate students, for the fall semester, The Post and Courier reports, citing preliminary data released this week. About 7,750 new students are on the Columbia campus, and more than half of the new students are South Carolina residents, according to the university’s data. While the flagship campus reported a slight increase in overall enrollment, most of its seven satellite campuses did see slight decreases compared to October 2019 data, according to the preliminary numbers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem’s administration announced Tuesday that it is using federal coronavirus relief funds to pay for a $5 million tourism ad campaign aimed at drawing people to the state, even as it emerges as one of the nation’s top hot spots for COVID-19 infections. The 30-second spot, which premiered on Fox News alongside Noem’s speech at the Republican National Convention last month, features the governor saying that “with our breathtaking landscapes and wide-open spaces, we’re a place to safely explore.” But the state currently ranks second in the country for new cases per capita over the past two weeks, with 439 new cases per 100,000 people. The ad, narrated by Noem, offers dramatic footage of South Dakota scenery such as Mount Rushmore and Badlands National Park, then concludes with the governor introducing herself and pitching a visit to South Dakota.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: The chancellor of the University of Tennessee said Tuesday that COVID-19 cases are increasing “way too fast” and that specific actions to address the jump will be announced in the coming days. In an online message, Chancellor Donde Plowman said there are 600 active cases at the Knoxville campus. She said more than 2,100 people are in quarantine or self-isolation, the vast majority of whom are students split about evenly on and off campus. She said the university has added a hotel to isolate on-campus students who test positive and is doubling its number of contact tracers. Plowman cited reports of fraternity leaders communicating to houses how to have parties, avoid getting caught and avoid the police; stories of a fraternity renting space off-campus to have a party crammed with people in close quarters; and of frat members being told not to get tested or how to get tested so the results aren’t shared with the school.\n\nTexas\n\nArlington: The marquee National Finals Rodeo is moving this year from Las Vegas to Texas due to coronavirus restrictions, event officials announced Wednesday. Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association and Texas Rangers officials said the Western horse sports championship will be held Dec. 3-12 at Globe Life Field, a retractable-roof stadium in Arlington that opened this year and seats more than 40,000 people. Texas has 50% occupancy guidelines due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and rodeo officials project up to 17,000 ticket-buyers daily – with some seats empty, masks required and hand-sanitizing stations added. Arlington Mayor Jeff Williams called the event the Super Bowl of rodeo. Betsy Price, mayor of nearby Fort Worth, said Texas knows rodeo, and officials have roped a big one. Las Vegas Events President Pat Christenson said no single event has a bigger impact on Las Vegas than the National Finals Rodeo.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Great Salt Lake is shrinking every year, but experts are implementing measures to slow the water loss, according to a new report. The Great Salt Lake Advisory Council says the water depth has dropped about 11 feet over the past 10 years, KSTU-TV reports. “It will continue to decrease at about the same amount over the next couple of decades if more is not done to bring water to the lake,” Great Salt Lake coordinator Laura Vernon said. The lake is crucial to the region’s recreation, migratory birds and billion-dollar economy. The advisory council said the shrinking water level left unchecked could also cause increased air pollution from the wind blowing minerals out of the exposed lake bed. The council narrowed a list of 70 strategies to 12 “actionable” measures that could keep the lake from evaporating, Vernon said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state House has given preliminary approval to $5 million in stimulus payments amid the coronavirus pandemic for residents who did not receive stimulus checks from the federal government based on their immigrant status. Under the Vermont Coronavirus Economic Stimulus Equity Program approved Tuesday, eligible adults would receive $1,200 and $500 for each eligible child. They must have had adjusted gross income of less than $99,000 last year or, if filing jointly, an adjusted gross income of less than $198,000. The proposal was up for a final reading in the House on Wednesday before heading to the Senate. Vermont reported two new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday for a total of 1,656 cases since the pandemic began. One person was hospitalized with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, according to the Health Department. The total number of deaths has remained at 58 since July 28.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A regional jail is on lockdown after approximately 70% of its inmates recently tested positive for COVID-19, officials said Wednesday. James Willett, the superintendent of the Pamunkey Regional Jail, said there have been no deaths or hospitalizations as a result of the positive tests, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. Willett said officials found out Monday that 124 of the 178 offenders tested were positive, and 20 of the 129 staff members tested were positive for the virus. Willett also said the “vast majority” of those who tested positive showed either mild symptoms or no symptoms. The virus made its impact on the jail despite precautions instituted in March that included isolation areas for the newly arrested, screening, temperature checks, enhanced cleaning, and the cancellation of all unnecessary visits and programs as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Willett said.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: School districts in the state have distributed thousands of computers and other devices to students to assist them with remote learning during the pandemic, but many families are still facing connectivity issues in rural areas. Families in Kitsap County raised concerns about digital access as schools reopened online for the year to limit the spread of COVID-19 and minimize the risk of in-person schooling. “Supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly delayed a shipment we placed last spring,” the Central Kitsap School District said on its website Aug. 28 regarding delays in delivered devices. “Until we receive that shipment, we ask families who already have devices in their homes to wait before requesting a district Chromebook.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Children returned to classes for the start of the school year throughout the state Tuesday. In nine of 55 counties, students began the year with remote learning due to the coronavirus pandemic. The state issued an updated color-coded map Saturday night showing the nine counties in either orange or red, meaning public schools were prohibited from conducting face-to-face instruction. Meanwhile, in Huntington, Marshall University announced it will start picking about 60 students, faculty and staff at random daily to test for the coronavirus. The university is also testing more than 175 football players and staff several times a week. The school has contact tracers on staff to follow up with positive cases. Testing data is set to be posted on the university’s website.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: Carroll University suspended three students for hosting an off-campus party with at least 20 guests. The three hosts are suspended for the duration of the fall semester. They were notified Aug. 26, and their appeal was denied Sept. 3. They will be refunded 80% of their tuition. The party occurred Aug. 22, two days before the start of classes. The 20 students found to have attended the party are in quarantine. As of Sept. 3, the university had 13 active cases of COVID-19. In total, 14 students have tested positive. University President Cindy Gnadinger said she does not know if any of the students who attended the party tested positive. The university’s COVID-19 rules – which Gnadinger said were communicated to students “extensively” and apply to off-campus settings – limit gatherings to 10 people and require social distancing and masks.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The beginning of the fall semester at local schools has been a masked, socially distanced affair still teeming with excitement, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. How long schools stay open is the open question. Most officials accept that it’s a matter of when, not if, the coronavirus makes its way into Casper schools. At Park Elementary, parents sent their kids through the gate into the playground, where they hung around or ran off to play, masks on. Parents weren’t allowed into the playground or the building itself – not without an appointment. Teachers handed out heart stickers for kindergartners and their parents to wear on their hands, so they could look down and think of each other throughout the bizarre first day.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/29/atari-hotel-wienermobile-warning-goat-mayors-rival-news-around-states/41104037/", "title": "Atari hotel, Wienermobile warning, goat mayor's K-9 rival: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nOpelika: The city is developing a new a system of pedestrian and bicycle paths. The Opelika City Council recently voted to hire a Birmingham firm to develop a master plan for the path system, The Opelika-Auburn News reports. The aim is to create a network of paths that get people where they want to go, City Planning Director Matt Mosley said. Sain Associates will be paid $150,000 by the city, which will recoup 80% of that cost through a state transportation grant, the newspaper reports. By using a map of the city, the firm will be able to identify potential paths, while also taking into account other infrastructure plans the city may have in mind for those areas, City Engineer Scott Parker said. The project is separate from the Creekline Trails multipurpose path plan, Parker said.\n\nAlaska\n\nBethel: Two animal groups plan to help a small village clear out all its stray dogs, officials said. Bethel Friends of Canines and Alaskan Animal Rescue Friends hope to catch and remove the wandering animals from Tuntutuliak on Friday, Alaska’s Energy Desk reports. After volunteers vaccinate the dogs, some will be given to homes in Bethel, while most will be transported to animal rescues in Anchorage, officials said. Tuntutuliak residents should keep their pets inside during the sweep so they are not mistaken for strays, coordinator Jesslyn Elliott said. The organizations said the village’s traditional council contacted them with a request to help remove the dogs. Ravn Air Group, Grant Aviation Inc. and Northern Air Cargo LLC are expected to transport dog kennels to the area and donate space to fly the dogs to Anchorage, while a website has been set up to help collect funding for the effort.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Atari is bringing its virtual experience to life with video game-themed hotels, and the first location will be in the Valley of the Sun. The first Atari Hotel is slated to break ground this year. The gaming pioneer, known for classic arcade games such as Asteroids and Pong as well as the Atari 2600 console, plans to build in downtown Phoenix, says Shelly Murphy of GSD Group. Phoenix is ideal because it’s close to Los Angeles, Las Vegas and San Francisco, and it’s where the hotels’ developers, GSD Group and Truth North Studio, are located, Murphy says. Fans of gaming can sign up online to become Atari Hotel members and get discounts on hotel stays, apparel and events. The site will host national esports competitions and local tournaments and offer spaces for private parties. Local visitors won’t need to have a hotel reservation to play games there, Murphy says.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal appeals court on Monday ruled against Arkansas preventing candidates for state office from accepting campaign contributions more than two years before an election, blocking the restriction from being enforced. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a judge’s decision to grant a preliminary injunction against the state’s “blackout period.” A Pulaski County woman had sued over the restriction, and her attorneys argued it prevented her from exercising her First Amendment right to contribute money to candidates she wants to support in the 2022 election. The court questioned the state’s argument that the blackout period helps prevent corruption or the appearance of corruption.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A billionaire who has been fighting for more than a decade to keep a secluded beach to himself has filed a new complaint in his lawsuit against the state and San Mateo County for allegedly harassing him and violating his property rights. In his new complaint filed Friday in San Francisco, Venture capitalist Vinod Khosla accuses top officials with the California Coastal Commission and State Lands Commission of trying to force the billionaire to let the public onto his property to use Martins Beach, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The complaint also names San Mateo County Sheriff Carlos Bolanos and Steve Monowitz, the director of the San Mateo County Planning and Building Department, alleging they all engaged in “a concerted effort … to single out, coerce, and harass one coastal property owner for refusing to cede its private property rights.”\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Wolves are officially back in the Centennial State. Though Colorado Parks and Wildlife recently announced that a likely wolf pack had been confirmed in the state following a late October sighting in Moffat County in northwestern Colorado, the agency now has further evidence bolstering wolves’ return. Wildlife officers spotted about six wolves Jan. 19 while investigating an animal carcass surrounded by large, wolflike tracks in the northwest corner of Moffat County, according to a news release. During the investigation, the officers “were surprised when they heard distinct howls within the area,” according to the release. Using binoculars, they spotted the wolves about 2 miles away from the carcass. By the time they got to the site, the animals were gone, but the officers found large tracks from what appeared to be at least six animals. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis called the officers’ sighting “historic.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nMontville: For decades the Montville High School athletic teams have competed as the “Indians” with the blessing of the Mohegans, the Native American tribe that traces its local history back centuries and today operates one of the world’s biggest casinos. But last week, the Mohegan Tribe announced it no longer supports the use of Indian-related team names. The reversal has unsettled many in the town, which has considered itself immune to controversies stirred by Native American mascots elsewhere because of its close ties to the federally recognized tribe. Not only is the tribe behind Mohegan Sun a major presence in town and a booster of its athletic programs, but many tribal members have been among the students to wear the black and orange of the Montville Indians. Mayor Ronald McDaniel said the school system will follow up with the tribe, but the name has never been a source of friction.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: Frontier Airlines will soon end the state’s status as the only one in the country without commercial air service. Frontier announced Tuesday that it will begin offering nonstop flights from Wilmington-New Castle Airport to Orlando, Florida, starting May 14. The flights will be offered during the summer on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. Delaware has been the only state without commercial airline service since Frontier left in June 2015 after a two-year run. Denver-based Frontier, an ultra-low-cost airline, first began service in Delaware in July 2013. It once offered flights from Wilmington-New Castle to Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Houston and three Florida destinations. It later limited its Delaware flights to Orlando and Tampa before ceasing operations completely in June 2015.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Metropolitan Police Department has announced a new policy that will prohibit the arrest of children 12 and under as part of an effort to limit juvenile arrests in the city, WUSA-TV reports. The department says it has recognized that juveniles and adults are physically and psychologically different, and cases involving an interaction between an officer and a child can have a lasting impact. MPD officials say they want to make sure that juvenile encounters with police are respectful and that officers are aware of the developmental differences in young people. MPD plans to provide officer training such as de-escalation, adolescent brain development, and trauma-informed policing to better protect and serve the residents and young people in the district.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state could turn to the sky to fight Burmese pythons on the ground under a bill a Senate committee unanimously approved Monday to allow two state agencies to use drones in the effort to eradicate invasive plants and animals. The bill would create an exception to a current law that prohibits law enforcement from using drones to gather information and bans state agencies from using drones to gather images on private land. It would allow the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Florida Forest Service to fly drones to manage and eradicate invasion species on public lands. Sen. Ben Albritton said drones would also help the agencies spot lygodium, a fern native to Asia that’s destroying Florida’s natural vegetation. The wildlife agency’s website warns that lygodium spreads rapidly and is a “severe threat” to Everglades tree islands and puts other forests at greater risk for wildfires because it serves as a fire ladder.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: High school students would face a cap on the number of college courses the state would pay for under a bill that passed the state Senate on Tuesday. House Bill 444 passed on a 34-18 vote and now moves to the House for more debate. Gov. Brian Kemp and a number of lawmakers say the cost of Georgia’s dual enrollment program, which pays for college courses for high schoolers, is growing too quickly. Most students would be limited to 30 hours of college credit, what a student typically has to take to reach college sophomore status. Most Democrats opposed the bill, saying that there are better ways to control costs than an arbitrary cap and that reducing funding could burden students. The state would pay for only regular academic courses in English and language arts, mathematics, science, social studies and foreign languages. It also would pay for technical courses in one of 17 state-designated career pathways.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Scientists will decide whether to establish a captive breeding program on the U.S. mainland in an attempt to prevent the extinction of a bird species only found on Maui, officials say. A decision about the plan to save the endangered kiwikiu is expected at a meeting of project partners Thursday, The Hawaii Star-Advertiser reports. A nonprofit bird facility on the mainland has expressed interest in a kiwikiu captive-breeding program, officials say. Also known as the Maui parrotbill, the population of yellow and olive-green forest birds has dwindled to fewer than 300. The Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project halted a program to establish a population on the windward slopes of Maui’s Haleakala volcano after mosquito-borne avian malaria killed 10 of 13 birds set to be released in October, including one that died before it was set free. The final three are missing and presumed dead.\n\nIdaho\n\nDonnelly: Authorities say 25 people were hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning while staying at a vacation rental home in this mountain town. Donnelly Rural Fire Protection Chief Juan Bonilla says firefighters were called to the vacation home about 6:30 a.m. Monday and found the occupants complaining of headaches and nausea. Two adults and two children were initially taken by ambulance to a hospital in McCall. Once health care workers realized they had symptoms consistent with carbon monoxide poisoning, fire crews tested the air in the home and found above-normal levels, Bonilla said. That’s when the other 21 residents were taken to the hospital as well. Officials say 21 of the people staying at the home have since been treated and released. “We averted a horrific tragedy,” St. Luke’s Hospital spokeswoman Laura Crawford said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Underprivileged areas in the city will receive an estimated $20 million investment for revitalization efforts that prioritize affordable housing and economic development, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Monday. Fifth Third Bank is putting money into “Opportunity Zone” neighborhoods in the city’s South and West sides. The bank’s commitment is part of the federal program that uses tax incentives to encourage private investment in financially destitute communities. “It’s designed to help transform some of our nation’s most challenged communities,” Mitchell Feiger, chairman and CEO of Fifth Third, said at a news conference on the South Side. “I’m confident it will have that impact here.” Feiger said the funding is intended for projects that can “transform affordable housing, revitalize the local retail economy and create jobs.” Specific projects will be unveiled in the coming months, officials said.\n\nIndiana\n\nGary: A man fishing from a northwestern Indiana bridge reeled in an apparent live grenade, prompting a road closure until the device was removed by a bomb squad. A Gary police officer who was called to the Little Calumet River bridge Monday evening to investigate learned that a man who had been fishing from the bridge pulled up what seemed to be a live grenade, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. The road that traverses the bridge was temporarily closed off, and the Porter County Bomb Squad was called for assistance. The bomb squad took possession of the grenade without incident, Gary Police Lt. Dawn Westerfield said. Authorities were investigating how and when the grenade ended up in the river in the city located about 30 miles southeast of Chicago.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Angered by a flag observing Transgender Day that briefly flew over the state Capitol, Republican lawmakers moved forward Monday with a bill that would limit the types of flags state and local governments can display. Republicans moved the bill from a subcommittee to a full committee for consideration. It would allow only the flag of the United States, the state flag, a prisoner of war/missing in action flag, and a flag of the city, county or school district from being flown at government buildings. A flag observing Transgender Day flew over the Capitol for less than five minutes in November at the request of Iowa Safe Schools, a group advocating for a safer environment for LGBTQ youth. Some Republican lawmakers objected and promised to introduce legislation. Republican Sen. Jake Chapman said there must be limits, raising the possibility of a KKK or Nazi flag being flown above the Capitol.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The University of Kansas Medical Center is testing a male contraceptive gel that men apply to their shoulders. The school’s research institution is conducting a clinical trial for the contraceptive and searching for couples to participate. Dr. Ajay Nangia, the center’s vice chair of urology, is a collaborating investigator of the study. “I think what we’re finding is in the big picture there’s a big need for a male contraceptive,” Nangia told the Lawrence Journal-World. The gel is a mixture of Nestorone and testosterone. Nestorone is a synthetic progestin that blocks the production of male hormones needed to generate sperm. The testosterone in the gel replaces testosterone usually produced in the male body. A nonprofit called The Population Council and the National Institute of Health are partnering to create the gel.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A bill that would require doctors and other health workers to provide life-sustaining care for an infant born alive after a failed abortion attempt was approved by the state Senate on Monday. The measure sailed through the Senate on a 32-0 vote and heads to the House next. It’s the latest in a series of abortion-related bills to surface in the Republican-dominated Legislature in recent years. The bill would require health care workers to give “medically appropriate and reasonable life-saving and life-sustaining medical care and treatment” to protect the lives of newborns, including any infant born after a failed abortion. Sen. Whitney Westerfield, the bill’s lead sponsor, said last week that he wasn’t aware of any instances in which an infant was born alive in Kentucky from a failed abortion. The American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky has said the legislation is based on “false claims” and has “nothing to do with how abortion care actually works.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Bayou Country Superfest is hanging up its cowboy boots and spurs. In a tweet Monday, organizers of the 10-year-old country music festival announced that the Memorial Day weekend event “will be on hiatus until further notice.” The festival began in Baton Rouge, briefly switched to New Orleans, then returned to Baton Rouge over its decadelong tenure. Last year’s event drew about 50,000 people to Tiger Stadium in Louisiana’s capital city – but that was a smaller crowd than in previous years. At its peak, 135,000 people attended Bayou Country Superfest in 2014. “We thank the fans who came for the party, and the event sponsors who helped make the Festival a Memorial Day Weekend tradition,” the organizers posted on Twitter. Some of the biggest names in country music played the festival over the years, such as George Strait, Tim McGraw, Miranda Lambert and Carrie Underwood.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: The University of Maine System board of trustees has voted for the University of Southern Maine to enter negotiations for a proposed $100 million career center and residence hall. The trustees on Monday unanimously approved “the largest single investment” in the University of Southern Maine’s history, university president Glenn Cummings said. The proposed 577-bed dormitory includes single-occupancy rooms, studios and larger apartments with multiple bedrooms. The proposal estimates students would pay $800 to $1,200 per room per month. Construction would begin at the university’s Portland campus this summer and be completed by the fall of 2022, the Portland Press Herald reports. The board of trustees also approved a $1.7 million project to expand the Wishcamper parking lot and help replace the approximately 160 parking spots that will be lost because of the construction.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Emergency operators in Anne Arundel County are switching to a 24-hour shift schedule in hopes the change will ease fatigue. Starting Thursday, operators will work 24 hours and then have 72 hours off, Fire Chief Trisha Wolford told the Capital Gazette. She said operators were looking for new shifts because working two 10-hour shifts during the day followed by two 14-hour shifts at night made it difficult to maintain proper sleep schedules. “The operators said (they) want to come off of 10s and 14s. They said they can’t get a sleep pattern and are exhausted,” Wolford said. Wolford said the move could help with operator retention. The change was put to a vote and was “passed overwhelmingly,” said Mike Akers, president of AFSCME Local 582. The new shift structure would give workers an hour break during the day and a five-hour break at night. In addition to a lounge area and a workout room, there are beds available for operators to take a nap.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Emerson College is investigating racist graffiti directed at Asian students that was found in a dormitory, administrators said. Employees at the Little Building found derogatory words written on multiple doors Friday, according to an email sent by Emerson’s president, Lee Pelton, on Sunday. He did not specify what words were written. Pelton said the graffiti is the second report of offensive language being directed at Asian students in that dorm. Four swastikas were found drawn in stairwells in another dormitory Tuesday. The students directly affected in the Little Building have been offered support, Pelton said. Other students in the residence hall are also receiving guidance on community standards and bias. “Such cowardly acts will not change who we are,” Pelton wrote in the email. “Emerson will remain a welcoming place for all, not only in theory but in practice.”\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: Volunteers and local groups plan to install a new monument at a cemetery that will carry the names of people who died in state asylums and whose graves are currently marked by small, numbered stones. The monument will include the names of 283 patients and be installed this spring at the historic Oak Hill Cemetery in the southeastern Michigan city of Pontiac, The Oakland Press reports. Volunteers and the Better Pontiac Community Development Corporation have spent four years raising the $5,000 needed for the monument. The Oakland County Pioneer and Historical Society also raised $2,650 during last year’s Oak Hill Cemetery Walk for the project. The graves date back to the late 1800s. The monument will have a decorative front, and the names of those buried there will be on the back. The original stone graves will remain in place as volunteers work on new landscaping for the area. The groups hope to install the monument before Memorial Day.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCloquet: The Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa will now require permits for most people to access its lands. The band said Monday that the policy is a way to “better manage and conserve” resources on about 41,000 acres of land on the Fond du Lac Reservation in northeastern Minnesota. “Over the years, we have seen an enormous amount of stress placed on these fragile ecosystems,” Thomas Howes, the band’s natural resources program manager, said in a statement. “Issues such as illegal garbage dumping, ATV traffic and overall growth in population have the potential to take their toll on wildlife and vegetation.” Permits will cost $25 for 30-day access and $100 per year. Access was previously allowed without a permit, the Star Tribune reports. Band members, their spouses and descendants, and reservation allotment owners will be granted permits at no charge.\n\nMississippi\n\nFulton: For 32 hours, 10-year-old Mikylah Blackburn was held hostage over a year ago by the man who authorities said killed her father. She has now been recognized for using her cellphone to communicate with officials, which a sheriff’s office says saved the lives of two deputies. Blackburn, now 11, received a certificate of bravery, a police badge and other items Monday from the Itawamba County Sheriff’s Office, WTVA-TV reports. In December 2018, Nathan Shepard killed the girl’s father, Paul Blackburn, then held the girl hostage, the sheriff’s office said. The girl used her phone to tell authorities what was going on in the house, including that Shepard had a gun. “If you hadn’t have called dispatch and told the two people out there not to come in, he would have went in,” Itawamba County Sheriff Chris Dickinson said Monday, gesturing to a deputy. A SWAT team entered the home, and Shepard was killed, ending the standoff. Blackburn was rescued safely.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The state plans to cut more than 1,700 beds at prisons as a result of a drop in inmates. Department of Corrections spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said the number of prisoners has dropped from more than 33,000 in 2017 to about 26,000 as of Friday. She attributed the drop to changes in Missouri criminal laws that led judges to sentence more people to probation instead of prison time. Beds are being eliminated at the Algoa, Boonville, Tipton, Farmington and Northeast correctional centers, as well as the Western Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center. Pojmann said the cuts mean the agency no longer needs to fill about 130 vacant full-time staff jobs. She said reducing beds is expected to save about $6.5 million and will allow the agency to avoid another $6.6 million in needed maintenance projects. Pojmann says the department wants to reinvest that money into building repairs and other projects aimed at increasing safety.\n\nMontana\n\nButte: Atlantic Richfield has scrapped a proposal to build a second water treatment plant to lower the level of acidic, metal-laden water that has collected in a former copper mining pit. There were concerns that reducing the water levels in Berkeley Pit could destabilize portions of the walls of the pit, Cameron Nazminia, director of state and local affairs for Atlantic Richfield, told The Montana Standard. Atlantic Richfield, which is owned by BP, suggested the additional water treatment last summer after after a tailings dam failed in Brazil in January 2019, killing 270 people. The idea was that if the tailings dam at Berkeley Pit failed, the pit would have enough room to hold the additional water. Berkeley Pit began filling with water after Atlantic Richfield turned off underground pumps in 1982. Atlantic Richfield/BP and Montana Resources are responsible to maintain the water level in the pit below the level at which it would enter Butte’s groundwater.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission has scheduled workshops for youth fishing instructors. Instructors are part of the Youth Fishing Program, a statewide team of volunteers and Game and Parks staffers who host educational fishing events. The volunteers will have access to Game and Parks’ loaner fishing equipment and educational materials for events. They also will receive program incentives. Training will take place in Lincoln at the Nebraska Game and Parks Outdoor Education Center on Feb. 2, March 29 and April 26, from 2 to 6 p.m. A workshop is scheduled to run from 6 to 9 p.m. May 6 at the Fort Kearny State Historical Park Visitors Center. Contact Larry Pape online to register.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Airbnb says stays in and around the city increased 19% last year compared with a year earlier, even though residential short-term rentals are illegal in much of the area. The Las Vegas Sun reports company figures showed 882,000 guest arrivals in Clark County in 2019, with more than $138 million collected by Airbnb hosts. That was up from about $100 million in 2018. The most lucrative weekend was during the Electric Daisy Carnival music festival in mid-May. Residential short-term rentals are illegal in unincorporated Clark County and North Las Vegas, while Henderson and Las Vegas allow them with restrictions. The Sun said county officials investigated more than 1,000 short-term rental violation cases last year, levied nearly $900,000 in fines and placed liens on 68 properties deemed to be in violation county short-term rental rules.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNorth Woodstock: A woman says the operators of a seasonal attraction of ice structures failed to control runoff and flooded her basement with more than 15,000 gallons of water – and she worries it will happen again this spring. Kelly Trinkle alleges in a lawsuit against Ice Castles that last April, snow and ice melt from the attraction pooled in her backyard in North Woodstock and flooded her basement with 16 inches of water, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. Trinkle is seeking $100,000 in damages but says her largest concern is not the lawsuit or the flooding but what will happen this spring. A lawyer for Ice Castles denied that the structures flooded Trinkle’s basement, writing to NHPR that they were “largely still in ice form” when the flooding happened. “Due to the topography of the land, the water that flooded the Trinkles’ basement came from a large watershed,” the lawyer wrote.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s residents could see their water bills go up under a plan advanced by lawmakers Monday that calls for replacing all underground lead pipes that taint water before it flows into schools, businesses and homes across the state. The legislation would require water providers to identify lead pipes in their systems and to share the cost of replacing the entire pipe, even the portion on private property, with customers. Who should fund the pipe replacement was debated in a Senate committee Monday, even among supporters of the bill who called it a solution to a public health crisis. Lead is an invisible metal that can leach from pipes, typically found in older homes, and cause permanent brain damage and developmental delays in children. Lawmakers have promised action to remove lead after water filters in Newark failed to remove it from water in three homes last summer and following a USA TODAY Network report that identified 250,000 children exposed to lead in their schools.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state is considering new funding for research into treating addiction with injectable opioids to help address long-term dependency on heroin and other opioids. A bill from Democratic state Rep. Miguel Garcia would provide $150,000 to the University of New Mexico for a demonstration project focused on injectable opioids including pharmaceutical-grade heroin or the drug hydromorphone that is routinely prescribed for pain. Opioid and heroin use has plagued some New Mexico communities for generations. The state has pioneered a series of policies aimed at combating opioid addiction, including becoming the first state to require law enforcement agencies to provide officers with overdose antidote kits. The state has a prescription monitoring database to prevent overlapping drug sales and has expanded access to naloxone, a drug that can reverse overdoses.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state could have one of the most lenient marijuana possession thresholds in the nation if an alternative legalization proposal is passed this session. The bill, sponsored by state Sen. Liz Krueger and Assemblymember Crystal Peoples-Stokes, both Democrats, would allow people over 21 years old to have 3 ounces of marijuana. Supporters of the proposal say higher possession thresholds would help prevent people from getting wrapped up in the criminal justice system. A competing proposal from Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, which lawmakers are debating, would only allow dispensaries to sell 1 ounce of marijuana per person on a daily basis. The governor’s office says the 1 ounce threshold is largely the status quo among other states that have legalized the drug. Under the plan included in Cuomo’s budget, people caught smoking marijuana in public could face a $125 fine.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A new book by the founding director of North Carolina African American Heritage Commission teaches children about the history of African Americans’ contributions to the state. “My N.C. from A to Z” was written by Michelle Lanier, who advocated for legislation that created the commission, according to a news release from the state Department of Natural and Cultural Releases. She then served as its founding executive director. In 2018 Lanier became the first African American director of North Carolina’s Division of State Historic Sites. Each letter of the alphabet represents African American people and places rooted in North Carolina. For example, “B” stands for Black Wall Street, which was a four-block area in Durham where African American enterprise thrived in the late 1800s and early 1900s. “T” stands for Thomas Day of Milton, a furniture maker in the 1800s whose pieces are still collected today.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The North Dakota State football team will be returning to the White House for a second year in a row after winning another FCS national championship. Sen. Kevin Cramer tweeted over the weekend that President Donald Trump invited the team for a return visit after its perfect 16-0 season. The Bison are the FCS national champion for a record eighth time after defeating James Madison 28-20 to close out the season earlier this month in Texas. It’s the team’s third straight national championship. Cramer says details of the visit are still being worked out.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Individuals convicted of trying to buy sex or trafficking women for sex would be placed on a publicly accessible database for five years, under legislation introduced in the state House. The legislation backed by Attorney General David Yost is aimed at the demand side of prostitution, according to supporters of the bill. “Under current law, it is not difficult for someone caught soliciting a prostitute to keep that information hidden from friends, family and their employer,” said Rep. Cindy Abrams, a Republican from Harrison in suburban Cincinnati. Co-sponsor Rep. Rick Carfagna, a Republican from Genoa Township in suburban Columbus, said the bill could provide the deterrent needed to stop people from soliciting sex. Individuals would automatically drop off the database if five years pass without another conviction.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Legislature will consider new rules that would raise the student performance standards for schools to operate on a four-day workweek. The Oklahoma State Board of Education voted Thursday in favor of adopting the new standards starting in the 2021-22 school year. The rules would still need the approval of the Legislature, which opens its session Monday, The Oklahoman reports. To qualify for a four-day week, elementary and middle schools would have to score at least a C in academic growth for math and English language arts on annual Oklahoma State Report Cards. The report cards measure school performance across several indicators that include academic achievement and growth, chronic absenteeism, progress in English language proficiency evaluations, post-secondary opportunities and graduation.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The City Council is reconsidering its homeless camping ban. Since the ban took effect in mid-December, the city has been scrambling to find options for where to put the roughly 300 homeless people who have been living on downtown sidewalks. Councilor Tom Anderson moved to have the council consider limiting its camping ban to downtown, city parks and residentially zoned neighborhoods at its Feb. 10 meeting. Anderson said he also isn’t opposed to looking at the tabled sit-lie ordinance, which would prohibit people from gathering on sidewalks in downtown as they have been. But altering the camping ban wouldn’t set up a tent city in Salem, either. The city looked at possible locations for a temporary shelter.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A monument honoring voting rights for African American men and women will soon be built on the state Capitol grounds. The monument will also commemorate former residents of the Old Eighth Ward, a black community in Harrisburg that was demolished to make way for the state Capitol Complex. The monument will be located on the Capitol grounds outside the K. Leroy Irvis Office Building, PennLive.com reports. The multipurpose monument, called “A Gathering at the Crossroads,” will feature four bronze, life-size statues of abolitionists and orators who fought for equal rights. The orators – William Howard Day, Thomas Morris Chester, Jacob T. Compton, and Francis Ellen Walker Harper – will be gathered around a pedestal inscribed with the names of 100 leaders of the Old Eighth Ward. Groundbreaking for the $400,000 monument will be held March 25, and the dedication is scheduled for June 15.\n\nRhode Island\n\nJamestown: A loop road that goes around a lighthouse at a state park has become so dangerously eroded that is it being closed to vehicular traffic, state environmental officials announced Tuesday. The road surrounding the lighthouse at Beavertail State Park in Jamestown will be closed to vehicles starting Monday, although it will remain accessible to pedestrians, the Department of Environmental Management said in a statement. “Residual damage from Superstorm Sandy along with erosion and storm surge intensified by climate change-driven sea level rise have caused dangerous washouts along the perimeter road and the surrounding pedestrian path” at the waterfront park at the southern tip of Jamestown, the department said. Posts and chains have been installed at the closure area, along with signs directing pedestrian traffic to continue to access the loop.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A bill allowing people to use a shopping service to buy beer and wine as well as groceries and have them delivered to their car is a step closer to being passed. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill Tuesday after agreeing to changes including prohibiting the sale of chilled beer or wine that might be more tempting to drink on the way home. The bill also requires employees to check the identification of the person picking up the alcohol and record the ID and the time and date of the purchase. Supporters of the bill said a number of other Southern states already allow beer and wine with online grocery buying, and it is inconvenient to force a customer to have all their food delivered but then go inside for beer and wine. The bill now heads to the full state Senate.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Officials say more than 14 million people visited the state last year, marking the tenth consecutive year of growth for its tourism industry. The Department of Tourism said 2019 saw a record level of visitors, spending and economic impact. The number of visitors increased by about 3% from the prior year. Visitors spent about $4 billion, accounting for 5.2% of the state’s economy, according to the department’s annual report. Officials say more than 55,000 jobs are supported by the tourism industry, or 8.8% of all South Dakota jobs. The majority of tourists, or 10.7 million, visited South Dakota’s state and national parks, which include the Black Hills National Forest.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Newly revealed police records show a white officer charged with fatally shooting an armed black man who was running away had been reprimanded by supervisors months earlier for not shooting another armed suspect in a similar case. Officer Andrew Delke, 25, had been on the city’s police force for about a year when he used a stun gun to arrest an armed suspect, Terry Crowell, who ran from him in November 2017, WPLN News reports. Sgt. Matthew Boguskie later held an “informal counseling session” with him, telling Delke he should have used his firearm, the records state. Delke told the sergeant he didn’t pull his service weapon because of what he called “the hostile climate towards police use of force throughout the country.” He also told Boguskie that at the time he was thinking of Officer Josh Lippert, the former Nashville officer who shot Jocques Clemmons, a black man, after a traffic stop.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A mother who says her 2-year-old son was seriously injured when a glass ketchup bottle fell on his head from a fifth-floor balcony of a hotel is suing the establishment for at least $1 million. Cassandra DeLa Cruz’s lawsuit says her son, Jacob Francisco, suffered serious injuries to his neck, brain and other parts of his body Aug. 18, 2018, when he was struck by the bottle as she pushed him past the Omni La Mansion Del Rio hotel in a stroller. The lawsuit names the hotel; its Dallas-based parent, Omni Hotels & Resorts; and its owner, TRT Holdings of Irving, as defendants. The suit says Jacob has received medical treatment since the bottle fell on him, and his “injuries may be permanent in nature.” The San Antonio Police Department says two people in a hotel room said they had been eating burgers on the balcony, and one of them said he may have accidentally knocked the 2.25-ounce Heinz ketchup bottle over the edge.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State leaders repealed a tax reform package Tuesday that had come under widespread criticism. The Legislature approved and Republican Gov. Gary Herbert signed the repeal shortly after state elections officials reported that enough voter signatures had been verified to put a citizen referendum seeking to repeal the tax reform on the November ballot, the Deseret News reports. The House voted 70-1 and the Senate voted 27-0 on the repeal bill sponsored by Republican House Majority Leader Francis Gibson. Herbert signed it soon after. The tax reform package included reducing income taxes while raising sales taxes on food, gas and some services. Gibson acknowledged that many residents opposed the move. More than 117,000 verified referendum signatures were published, surpassing the required amount by about 1,000, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nFair Haven: It’s Lincoln the goat versus Sammy the dog in the race for the town’s honorary mayor. The Nubian goat had won the post last year after the town manager came up with the pet mayor election to raise money to rehabilitate a community playground and get kids civically involved. “In Fair Haven, just like everywhere else, voter participation is not always as high as we want it,” Town Manager Joe Gunter says. Resident Cheryl Daviau says the race has gotten children involved in the election process. Her granddaughter got her picture taken with the goat mayor and loved it, she says. To up the ante, this year the police chief nominated K-9 Sammy, a German shepherd who visits local schools daily with a resource officer, attends concerts in the park and is beloved around town. Both Lincoln and Sammy are popular, so it could be a tight race. The election will be held March 3.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: A local commission is recommending that a Confederate monument in the city shouldn’t be removed but instead that historical context should be added in a new park and a second statue erected to honor African American heritage. The Virginia Beach Historic Preservation Commission planned to make its recommendation to the City Council on Tuesday, The Virginian-Pilot reports. The plan also suggests looking into whether a museum could be built nearby to tell a more “inclusive story” of the community’s history. The committee estimated the park and a second statue could cost up to $320,000, but the group will ask the council for an initial $50,000 for the project, the newspaper reports. Virginia prohibits local governments from removing memorials for war veterans, but Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring has questioned the law, and Gov. Ralph Northam also said he supports amending it.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Bills to allow sports betting at Indian casinos in the state, including events like the Super Bowl and the World Series, have been introduced in the Legislature. The bills would allow owners of the 29 Indian casinos in the state to open Las Vegas-style sports books. However, a company that operates 19 private card rooms in Washington is crying foul. Maverick Gaming owner Eric Persson says the company should also be allowed to provide sports betting, including electronic betting using cellphones or computers. “That’s what the consumer wants,” Persson told the House Commerce and Gaming Committee on Monday afternoon. The committee heard testimony about the proposal but did not take a vote. Another hearing on sports betting is scheduled for Thursday before a Senate committee.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: In what they acknowledged is a long-shot bid, Gov. Jim Justice and Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. urged unhappy Virginia counties Tuesday to secede and join a neighboring state where Democrats aren’t in charge. Both Justice, a Republican in a state where the GOP dominates the Legislature, and Falwell, whose university is in Lynchburg, Virginia, said the invitation to join West Virginia sends a valid message. “If you’re not truly happy where you are, we stand with open arms to take you from Virginia or anywhere where you may be,” Justice said. “We stand strongly behind the Second Amendment, and we stand strongly for the unborn.” This month, the West Virginia House of Delegates and Senate introduced resolutions inviting parts of Virginia to join West Virginia.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: Oscar Mayer’s iconic Wienermobile got a grilling from a sheriff’s deputy because the driver of the giant hot dog failed to give enough room to another car on the road with emergency lights. The deputy pulled over the Wienermobile and gave the driver a verbal warning for not following the law, the Waukesha Sheriff’s Office said in a tweet posted Monday. It showed a picture of the sheriff’s deputy’s SUV parked behind the Wienermobile with the hashtags #MoveOver #SlowDown #Wienermobile. Traffic laws require vehicles to move out of the lane closest to another car that is on the side of the road with emergency lights flashing. The first Weinermobile was created in 1936, and it has gone through several iterations since then.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The governor is reiterating his support for a statewide lodging tax to boost revenue. A lodging tax is the only new tax he would support, Gov. Mark Gordon said Friday. It would make Wyoming’s tourism promotion efforts more self-sufficient, Gordon told reporters at the Wyoming Press Association’s winter convention in Casper. A 5% statewide lodging tax passed the Wyoming House but failed in the Senate in 2019, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. The tax would have generated about $20 million a year. A four-week legislative session devoted primarily to the state budget begins Feb. 10.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/16/baby-sharks-broadways-back-rice-filtration-news-around-states/118827082/", "title": "Baby sharks, Broadway's back: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Facebook briefly took down Gov. Kay Ivey’s campaign page Tuesday morning, indicating it had been mistakenly flagged as an imposter account, though the governor suggested the move was prompted by her criticism of President Joe Biden’s vaccination-or-testing mandate. Ivey, a Republican, cited her staunch opposition to the Democratic president’s vaccine push. But Facebook indicated that was not the case. “We fought back and won. Evidently, they’re upset that I said I’m standing in the way of President Biden to protect Alabamians from this outrageous overreach by the federal government,” Ivey said in a statement posted on social media. The dispute involved Ivey’s campaign page and not her gubernatorial account. Ivey is running for reelection in 2022. However, Facebook indicated the content on Ivey’s page played no role. Her campaign called the tech giant’s statement about the page being incorrectly marked as an imposter account a “nonsense excuse.” It said Facebook first said it was unpublishing the page because of “harassment and bullying,” and the campaign fought to get it restored. Ivey has strongly encouraged peopled to get vaccinated against COVID-19, even going as far to say that “it’s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks” for a spike in cases. But she has vowed resistance to Biden’s mandate.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Overwhelmed by a surge in COVID-19 patients, Alaska’s largest hospital on Tuesday implemented crisis standards of care, prioritizing resources and treatments to those patients who have the potential to benefit the most. “While we are doing our utmost, we are no longer able to provide the standard of care to each and every patient who needs our help,” Dr. Kristen Solana Walkinshaw, chief of staff at Providence Alaska Medical Center, wrote in a letter addressed to Alaskans and distributed Tuesday. “The acuity and number of patients now exceeds our resources and our ability to staff beds with skilled caregivers, like nurses and respiratory therapists. We have been forced within our hospital to implement crisis standards of care.” Alaska, like other places, has seen a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the highly contagious delta variant. State health officials said Tuesday that there were 691 new cases and six recent deaths, all Anchorage men in their 50s to 70s. A woman in her 60s from out of state also recently died in Juneau, the department said. Health officials said statewide there are 202 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who are hospitalized, and nine additional patients are under investigation. Officials said 33 of those people are on ventilators.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an effort by the Arizona Senate to keep secret records of its ongoing review of the 2020 election in Maricopa County that are in the possession of the contractors conducting the recount. The high court, without comment, rejected the appeal filed after an appeals court and trial court both ruled the documents are public records that must be released. The court also dissolved a stay on the appeals court ruling it put in place Aug. 24 so it could review the record and decide whether to accept the appeal. The Arizona Court of Appeals had ruled that the documents sought by the watchdog group American Oversight detailing how the recount and audit are being conducted are public and must be turned over. Republicans who control the Senate have tried for months to keep secret how their contractors are conducting the recount. They argued that because the records are maintained by Senate contractors, they were not subject to public records law, and legislative immunity applies. But the appeals court in its Aug. 19 ruling rejected that argument. The court said the main contractor, Florida company Cyber Ninjas, was subject to the records law because it was performing a core government function that the Senate farmed out.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 36 new COVID-19 deaths and more than 1,500 new coronavirus cases Tuesday. The Department of Health said Arkansas’ death toll from COVID-19 now totals 7,334 since the pandemic began. The state’s coronavirus cases rose by 1,544 to 477,191 total. Arkansas ranks 15th nationally for new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University research data. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said 11 of the deaths announced Tuesday were delayed reports, with two occurring as far back as June. The number of COVID-19 patients in hospitals across the state dropped by 16 to 1,097. There were 432 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units and 281 on ventilators. There were 33 ICU beds available in the state, and Hutchinson said at least 14 were equipped for COVID-19 patients.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOlympic Valley: A popular ski resort whose name included a derogatory term for Native American women changed its name to Palisades Tahoe on Monday. The renaming of Squaw Valley Ski Resort is one of many efforts nationally to address a history of colonialism and oppression against Native Americans and other people of color. The word “squaw,” derived from the Algonquin language, may have once simply meant “woman,” but over generations, the word morphed into a misogynist and racist term to disparage Indigenous women, according to experts. “It was the right thing to do, and I think it’s going to make a difference. I think we’re going to be seen as a more welcoming, inclusive resort and community,” said Palisades Tahoe President and COO Dee Byrne. Byrne said that after studying the issue for the past year, the resort’s research concluded the word is very offensive “not just to Indigenous women but to all women.” The resort is in Olympic Valley, which was known as Squaw Valley until it hosted the 1960 Winter Olympics. Tribes in the region had been asking the resort for a name change for decades. The valley, in the Lake Tahoe area, is within the ancestral homeland of the Washoe people, Darrel Cruz of the Washoe Tribe Historic Preservation Office said in a statement. He said the word is a “term that was inflicted upon us by somebody else, and we don’t agree with it.” Washoe Tribal Chairman Serrell Smokey said the tribal council expressed “its great appreciation for this positive step forward.”\n\nColorado\n\nArvada: Visiting the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Flatirons Campus outside Denver on Tuesday, President Joe Biden tried to advance his domestic spending plans by warning about climate change’s dangers while highlighting how his clean-energy proposals would also create well-paying jobs. “Here’s the good news: Something that is caused by humans can be solved by humans,” Biden said. He deemed the need for a clean-energy future an “economic imperative and a national security imperative” and said there was no time to waste, as the impact of climate change seems to grow more severe by the year. Biden said extreme weather events will cost more than $100 billion in damages this year and underscored his goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 while using solely carbon pollution-free power 15 years earlier. “We can do that; we can do all of this in a way that creates good jobs, lowers costs to consumers and businesses, and makes us global leaders,” the Democratic president said. Biden spoke about “more jobs for the economy” on an earlier tour as he checked out a giant windmill blade on the ground outside the lab and got a demonstration of wind turbine technology.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont said Tuesday that he wants to extend the state’s mask mandate for public schools beyond the end of this month, when his pandemic-related emergency powers are set to expire. Lamont, a Democrat, said another 90-day extension of his powers is warranted. State lawmakers have extended his emergency declarations in the past, although Republicans and some Democrats have argued it’s time to get back to normal. “I just think it should continue a little bit longer,” Lamont told reporters following an event in Hartford, referring to the mask mandate and new coronavirus variants. “We’ve got not just delta but mu. We’ve got flu season.” Lamont’s general counsel has a list of 10 executive orders, including the mask mandate, that he believes should continue beyond the end of this month, the governor said. Officials from his administration were slated to meet Tuesday with legislative leaders about extending them. “What I want is legislative input on the executive orders. I’d like to know where they stand. I’d like to have their fingerprints on some of the decisions,” he said. Lamont said he believes a requirement for masks in public schools should remain in effect for “a little bit longer.”\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: Faculty and students are split over a University of Delaware policy that prevents instructors from informing students if someone in their class has tested positive for the coronavirus. While the school says it’s concerned about student privacy, wants to prevent panic and has formal contact tracing mechanisms in place, some worry that system may be inadequate. Nada Abuasi, a student at the university, called the policy “harmful” and worried many people on campus might not be aware they’ve been exposed. “I would rather you be upfront with me that someone in my class has COVID, and maybe I was sitting next to them, because I might have immunocompromised people at home,” Abuasi said. Andrea Boyle-Tippett, the university’s director of external relations for the Office of Communications and Marketing, said the idea of faculty passing on exposure information, even without naming the student, “was causing privacy problems because if the class size is small, then by a possible elimination, you can figure out who the student is.” Some instructors, including ethics professor Mark Greene, agreed with the new protocol, saying they shouldn’t have to inform students and face questions that “most of us aren’t qualified to answer.” Others worried they were wrongly “withholding public health information.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: For the second year in a row, the Broccoli City music festival has been canceled over COVID-19 concerns, WUSA-TV reports. The 2021 performance lineup included Lil Baby, Snoh Aalegra, Moneybagg Yo, Lucky Dave, Rubi Rose and more. The hip-hop concert, which was scheduled this year for Oct. 2 at RFK Stadium, typically draws about 30,000 attendees. “At the heart of Broccoli City is the belief that our people deserve the best of everything – including safe spaces to gather in celebration of our culture,” festival organizers said in a statement. “In that spirit, we have decided to cancel the Broccoli City Festival 2021 this October to reduce the likelihood of exposure to COVID-19 and do our part to slow the spread in the communities of color we serve.” The official festival statement also made a plug for vaccines. “In the meantime, please continue to take COVID-19 seriously,” organizers said. “Get vaccinated, get tested and take care of yourselves (and each other) so that we can all gather next year in 2022 to celebrate 10 years of Broccoli City building better communities, Black change and Black culture.” The festival has been postponed until May 2022. Organizers said tickets would be automatically refunded within 14 business days.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that people who decide not to get a COVID-19 vaccine might be making the wrong choice but defended their right to make that choice. Speaking a day after holding a news conference to condemn vaccine mandates, DeSantis agreed that the shots save lives. “There are some of those folks who may make a decision that’s not ultimately the right decision for them,” DeSantis said at a news conference Tuesday in Miami-Dade County. “There’s obviously probably people that have been hospitalized who probably wouldn’t have been if they had done that.” The discussion was a follow-up to a campaign-like event Monday, when DeSantis and the two independently elected Republican Cabinet members criticized mandates. Several Gainesville city employees spoke at the event, saying government shouldn’t force them to get inoculated. One speaker said vaccines change people’s RNA, which has led critics to say DeSantis is spreading anti-vaccine theories. But the Republican governor said he doesn’t share the opinion. “Honestly I don’t even remember him saying that. So, it’s not anything I’ve said,” he said. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines deliver a synthetic form of messenger RNA into the body, but that material is short-lived and doesn’t affect a body’s genetic material.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: At least 18 of the 20 gorillas at the city’s zoo have now tested positive for the coronavirus in an outbreak that began just days before the facility had hoped to obtain a veterinary COVID-19 vaccine for the primates, officials said Tuesday. Zoo Atlanta had announced the first positive tests among the western lowland gorillas Friday after employees noticed the gorillas had been coughing, had runny noses and showed changes in appetite. A veterinary lab at the University of Georgia returned positive tests for virus that causes the respiratory illness. Zoo Atlanta said the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, confirmed that at least four of the samples from the gorillas so far have tested positive for the delta variant of the virus. The zoo said it was using monoclonal antibodies to treat the gorillas at risk of developing complications from the virus. Officials said there’s no evidence the gorillas can pass the virus back to humans, and visitors are too far away to be infected by the animals. Because the gorillas live close together in four troops, zoo officials said it’s impossible to keep infected animals isolated. Officials said they believe an asymptomatic employee who cares for the gorillas passed on the virus. The employee had been fully vaccinated and was wearing protective equipment such as a mask and gloves.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Citing the high vaccination rate among residents, Gov. David Ige said there would not be another “full-scale shutdown” in the state despite the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. Instead, if further restrictions are needed, they would likely be in the form of curfews or reducing the size of social gatherings, Ige told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. There are signs the rapid rise in cases in abating, and hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients have remained stable. The seven-day average for new cases is 567, a 37% drop from two weeks ago, and the number of coronavirus tests coming back positive has declined to 6.9% from 7.8% over that same time period. As of Monday, 392 people were hospitalized in Hawaii, down from 435 a week ago. Those in intensive care units also fell, from about 100 more than a week ago to 79 on Monday. “It is getting a little better, but I think it is still too early to call it a definite trend that would provide relief,” Ige said. Any increase in hospitalization rates or those admitted to ICU units would trigger new restrictions, he said. He said curfews could reduce the number of people coming into emergency rooms because of accidents. Social gatherings could also be reduced. Currently 10 people can gather inside, and that could be cut in half. The 25-person limit for congregating outdoors could be reduced to 10.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Public health officials say crisis standards of care are imminent for the state’s most populated region as hospitals continue to be overrun with unvaccinated COVID-19 patients. The southwestern and southern Idaho regions that include Boise and Twin Falls may get official authorization to begin rationing health care – a step intended to ensure the patients most likely to survive are given access to scarce resources like intensive care unit beds – any day now, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen said Tuesday. “We continue to set new records each week,” he said of coronavirus hospitalizations. “We do not see a peak in sight.” Hospitals in the northern half of the state were given permission to begin rationing care last week. “Nearly all the metrics we track are trending in the wrong direction” when it comes to the virus, deputy state epidemiologist Dr. Kathryn Turner said. But even as the state continues to see new records in the number of people hospitalized or on ventilators with COVID-19, weekly vaccination rates are dropping. And Gov. Brad Little, who has never issued a statewide mask mandate, said he’s working with Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden to see if they could use the courts to stop President Joe Biden from requiring large employers to mandate vaccines or implement routine coronavirus testing.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The City Council agreed Tuesday to pay a total of $20.5 million to two of at least a dozen men who have had murder convictions dismissed after being allegedly framed by the same police detective. With the vote to settle the lawsuits of Armando Serrano and Jose Montanez, the council avoided the possibility of a larger payout had the suits gone to trial. That happened in 2009, when a former prison inmate who accused Reynaldo Guevara of framing him won a $21 million jury verdict, and in 2018 when another jury awarded $17 million to a man who made similar allegations. Russell Ainsworth, an attorney representing Montanez, said he hoped the city would take what happened in this case – a four-year legal fight that culminated with a judge ruling against the city by determining the case could go to trial – that it should settle the 11 pending lawsuits that involve Guevara. “I hope they settle these before running up millions of dollars in legal fees,” he said. “The city needs to resolve these cases, or they will face trial after trial.” Chicago’s police department has been dogged by decades of scandal, cover-ups and brutality. Serrano and Montanez spent 23 years in prison. A key witness in their case admitted he’d lied about hearing them confess because Guevara had threatened to beat him if he didn’t.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A nine-member task force created by the Indiana Supreme Court will help landlords and tenants resolve their disputes and access federal rental assistance resources. The Indiana Eviction Task Force will review the state’s eviction process and make recommendations for implementing a pre-eviction diversion program, including ways to more quickly and effectively distribute federal emergency rental assistance funds to landlords and tenants. Members of the task force, who include local judges and representatives from nonprofits, will submit recommendations to the high court on how the program should work by Jan. 17. “Our courts are both the front line in providing parties a fair chance to resolve their disputes and the last line of defense in getting resources … to the people who need them,” Chief Justice Loretta H. Rush wrote in her Monday order. “And that money must move quickly.” Since the federal COVID-19 eviction moratorium ended Aug. 26, Indiana has seen a surge of residential evictions. An estimated 93,000 Indiana households are behind on rent and at risk of eviction, according to National Equity Atlas’ Rent Debt Dashboard. Yet 83% of those Hoosiers haven’t applied for assistance. Since early September, Indiana’s eviction filings have risen 22% above the pre-pandemic average, state data shows.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state lost an estimated 7.2million trees in cities and farms when last year’s hurricane-force derecho swept across the state, a new Iowa Department of Natural Resources report shows. Cedar Rapids, Des Moines and Davenport suffered the largest tree losses in the Aug. 10, 2020, storm, according to the DNR report, as winds surged up to 140 mph in some counties. The storm damaged thousands of homes, business and vehicles, along with a millions of acres of cropland. Overall, Iowa cities lost about 4.5 million trees, or 13% of the state’s 34 million urban trees, the report says. The storm damaged an estimate 32,773 acres of urban tree canopy. Iowa’s rural lands lost 2.7 million trees, the state reported. The state puts the costs to Iowa at $20 million annually, with the trees no longer able to capture and store carbon that contributes to climate change, reduce air pollution, or provide windbreaks and shade that cut energy use. The state cumulatively sustained $11.5 billion in damage, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has called the derecho “the costliest thunderstorm in U.S. history.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A state legislator accused of kicking a high school student in the testicles pleaded guilty Monday to three lesser misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct and was placed on a year’s probation under a deal with the local prosecutor. Republican Rep. Mark Samsel also agreed not to use social media for personal purposes or have any contact with the high school student who said he was kicked or another another student who complained of an interaction with Samsel. The lawmaker also agreed to write letters of apology to both students. Samsel had faced three misdemeanor criminal charges of battery following what the local prosecutor described as “rude, insulting or angry” interactions with two students, as a substitute teacher during an April 28 art class at the high school in Wellsville. One student told a sheriff’s deputy that Samsel had manhandled him and kicked him, according to an affidavit from the deputy. The lawmaker said in a Facebook post last month that “extreme” stress caused him to have “an isolated episode of mania with psychotic features” in a classroom. He disclosed he was undergoing mental health treatment and surrendered his state substitute teacher’s license. But Mary Woods, whose niece had a class with Samsel the same day, said he should have received time in jail.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Citing a national shortage of a drug increasingly used to treat COVID-19 patients, Gov. Andy Beshear announced Tuesday that the federal government is going to cap the supply to states. The drug company Regeneron makes the treatment, a “monoclonal antibody” approved for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 patients. “Health care providers will no longer be able to order the treatments directly,” Beshear said in a news release. “Instead, state governments will supervise the distribution of a capped number of treatments delivered to them each week.” The shortage comes amid an “extraordinary demand” for the treatment, Beshear said. Generally administered intravenously, it has been shown to be successful at limiting the severity of illness in some patients and keeping them out of the hospital. But demand has skyrocketed as COVID-19 cases soared in recent weeks. Beshear said he worries too many Kentuckians will hear about the antibody treatment and rely on getting it instead of a COVID-19 shot. “What this shortage ought to tell you is that if you’re unvaccinated, and you get really sick, not only might there not be a bed in the hospital for you because they are so full, but that monoclonal antibody treatment might not be there for you, either,” Beshear said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Louisiana Department of Revenue is granting filing extensions to taxpayers in 25 parishes whose homes and businesses were affected by the impacts of Hurricane Ida. The automatic extension due date is Jan. 3, 2022, for excise, franchise, income, severance and withholding taxes with original or extended due dates on or after Aug. 26 and before Jan. 3 eligible. This is an extension to file the applicable tax returns, not to pay any taxes due, the department said in a news release. Payments submitted after the original deadlines are subject to penalties and interest. The extension applies to those in Ascension, Assumption, East Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, Iberia, Iberville, Jefferson, Lafourche, Livingston, Orleans, Plaquemines, Pointe Coupee, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. Helena, St. James, St. John the Baptist, St. Martin, St. Mary, St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Terrebonne, Washington, West Baton Rouge and West Feliciana parishes. In addition, the department said people may be eligible for state sales tax refunds for personal property destroyed in a natural disaster, such as clothing, furniture, electronics, recreational equipment and appliances not permanently attached to a house or building. Refunds are limited to items not covered by insurance or any other type of reimbursement.\n\nMaine\n\nYork: The state has a new high-speed toll plaza near its southern border. The Maine Turnpike plaza in York opened early Wednesday, just as the old one located to its south was deactivated. The new plaza has six high-speed toll lanes that don’t require drivers to stop, WMTW-TV reports. The demolition of the old plaza is expected to take a little more than a year. State officials have said drivers will continue to pass through the old toll booth lanes during the dismantling. The speed limit will be 10 mph. Maine Turnpike Authority has said the old plaza “does not provide the modern, open, highway speed electronic tolling that travelers now expect and deserve.” It has also said the new plaza will be safer and much more efficient.\n\nMaryland\n\nEaston: A Confederate monument is set to be moved from a courthouse lawn on the Eastern Shore after local officials voted Tuesday night to relocate it to a Virginia battleground. The Talbot County Council voted 3-2 to approve a resolution to move the “Talbot Boys” statue that commemorates more than 80 soldiers who fought for the Confederacy. The statue dedicated in 1916 is thought to be the last Confederate monument still standing on public property in Maryland besides cemeteries and battlefields. For years, local activists have fought for the removal of the Jim Crow-era statue on the lawn adjacent to a former slave market site in Easton. In May, civil rights advocates sued the county seeking the court-ordered removal of the statue depicting a soldier with a Confederate flag draped over one shoulder, calling it a racist symbol of oppression and claiming it is unconstitutional and illegal. Singer Maggie Rogers, an Easton native, has been among those pushing for its removal, taking to social media to drum up support and posting videos about the County Council meeting. Private funds will cover the cost of relocating the statue to the private Cross Keys Battlefield in Harrisonburg, Virginia.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: For the first time, the city’s voters have narrowed the field of mayoral candidates to two women of color who will face off against each other in November. City Councilors Michelle Wu and Annissa Essaibi George topped the five-person race in Tuesday’s preliminary runoff. They bested acting Mayor Kim Janey, City Councilor Andrea Campbell and John Barros, the city’s former economic development chief. All five were candidates of color – a major shift away from two centuries of Boston politics dominated by white men. Wu’s parents immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan. Essaibi George describes herself as a first-generation Arab Polish American. Whoever wins Nov. 2 will make history in a city where, for the past 200 years, the office has been held exclusively by white men. Earlier this year, Janey became the first Black Bostonian and first woman to occupy the city’s top office in an acting capacity after former Mayor Marty Walsh stepped down to become President Joe Biden’s labor secretary. Wu and Essaibi George’s advancement to the general election ushers in a new era for the city that has wrestled with racial and ethnic strife. All the candidates in Tuesday’s primary were Democrats. Mayoral races in Boston do not include party primaries.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: Provocative pro-Palestinian protests outside a Jewish synagogue are protected by the Constitution’s First Amendment, a federal court appeals said Wednesday. The court declined to stop the demonstrations or set restrictions in Ann Arbor. The protests have occurred on a weekly basis since 2003, with people holding signs that say “Jewish Power Corrupts,” “Stop Funding Israel” and “End the Palestinian Holocaust.” Members of Beth Israel Synagogue, including some Holocaust survivors, said the protests have interfered with their Saturday worship and caused emotional distress. “But the congregants have not alleged that the protesters ever blocked them from using their synagogue or that the protests were even audible from inside the building,” Judge Jeffrey Sutton said. He said a proposed remedy – a 1,000-foot buffer and limits on signs – would likely violate the First Amendment. “The key obstacle is the robust protections that the First Amendment affords to nonviolent protests on matters of public concern,” Sutton said in summarizing the case, joined by Judge David McKeague. Judge Eric Clay agreed with the result but on different grounds. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a brief in support of the activists, saying the protests are entitled to protection even if “offensive, upsetting and distasteful.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Attorneys asked a judge Wednesday to dismiss a new manslaughter charge against the former suburban Minneapolis police officer who shot and killed Daunte Wright during a traffic stop this spring. Former Brooklyn Center Officer Kim Potter has said she mistakenly drew her firearm instead of her stun gun as Wright was trying to drive away from officers during the stop in April. Potter is recorded on body-camera video an instant after the shooting saying she drew the wrong weapon. Potter is white. Wright was Black. His death sparked several nights of protests. Prosecutors charged Potter with second-degree manslaughter. Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office later took over the case, added a count of first-degree manslaughter earlier this month. Potter is scheduled to stand trial in December. The second-degree manslaughter charge is punishable by up to 10 years in prison; first-degree has a maximum 15-year sentence. Potter’s attorneys, Paul Engh and Earl Gray, filed a motion Wednesday seeking to dismiss the new charge. They argued that Minnesota statutes define first-degree manslaughter as endangering someone by recklessly handling a gun or other dangerous weapon and that Potter didn’t consciously realize she was holding a gun or was about to fire it.\n\nMississippi\n\nOlive Branch: A local startup is trying to turn a rice-production byproduct into a way to avoid water shortages and reduce carbon emissions. Glanris President and CEO Bryan Eagle said he knows it’s a big goal, but everyone needs to do something to try to change the world. “We’re running out of water ... we’re past the tipping point where there are too many people and not enough fresh water,” Eagle said. While water is a renewable resource, global demand is quickly outpacing the rate at which aquifers and other fresh water sources renew. So Glanris buys rice hulls – they make up 20% of the weight of a rice harvest and have to be removed before the rice is eaten – and turns it into a water-filtrating activated carbon. The company’s patented process is relatively simple, Eagle said. The rice hulls are put into a rotary kiln and roasted at 400 degrees Celsius for about 8 minutes. Coconut shells, which have been previously used for water purification, need to be roasted at 1,000 degrees Celsius for about 12 to 18 hours. After roasting, the rice hulls are cooled and put back into the containers in which they were delivered. In most other cases, rice hulls are burned, releasing greenhouse gases. “We’re stopping that burning and creating a stable carbon,” Eagle said. “What we’re really addressing is climate change.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The state’s new health czar lamented that the pandemic has become so embroiled in politics as another child died of COVID-19 and as the coronavirus sickened record numbers of youths. Donald Kauerauf, who began serving three weeks ago as the director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, told lawmakers Tuesday that “we failed, as a nation, public health because we got to this point.” In emergency planning, Kauerauf said, you plan for the “absolutely worst” scenario – but “we didn’t plan for this reaction from the public.” And he said it was crucial to retool the public message as he works toward a goal of getting about 80% of the state’s residents vaccinated. Currently, 52.8% have gotten at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, state data shows. “We’ve got to start something new,” Kauerauf said. The state just ended what is shaping up to be one of the deadliest months of the pandemic. Data lags by several weeks, but COVID-19 deaths in Missouri have already reached 878 in the five weeks that span August – more than triple the numbers seen this past spring, before the highly infections delta variant of the virus took hold, according to state data analyzed by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. A child died last week in the St. Louis area, the Post-Dispatch reports.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A group advocating for “right-to-work” policies is suing to strike down the state’s Clean Campaign Act, arguing it contains a provision that violates political speech protections. Montana Citizens for Right to Work filed the lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court in Helena against Montana Commissioner of Political Practices Jeff Mangan, the Montana State News Bureau reports. A “right-to-work” law prohibits a company and a union from signing a contract that would require workers to pay dues or fees to the union that represents them. The lawsuit argues that a provision in the Clean Campaign Act is unconstitutional because it requires political committees to notify candidates of negative mailers, but mailers endorsing candidates are not subject to the same requirement. The lawsuit asks a judge to strike down the entire Clean Campaign Act and prohibit Mangan from following through on prosecuting Montana Citizens for Right to Work over a previous alleged violation. The filing appears to be a preemptive strike at the state’s top political cop, claiming Mangan is preparing a civil prosecution against the group for violating laws on notifying candidates if a negative mailer is sent out within 10 days of Election Day.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Creighton University plans to invest $37 million in a new residence hall for freshmen that will be the institution’s first new dormitory since 2006. Most of the 400-student dormitory will be divided into four-person suites that will each have two bedrooms, two living spaces and a shared bathroom. Each floor will also have kitchenettes, and there will be a larger kitchen on the second floor, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The hall will include an interfaith prayer space and two prayer rooms for Muslim students. It will also have an elevated outdoor courtyard capable of hosting gatherings and events. The new residence hall will be built a few blocks east of the new $75 million CL Werner Center for Health Sciences Education that will house Creighton’s School of Medicine. Both new buildings are slated to open in the fall of 2023. Currently, Creighton has eight dorms. All unmarried undergraduate students from outside the Omaha area are required to live in a residence hall for their first two years.\n\nNevada\n\nHenderson: The city and Las Vegas Valley Water District say they’re joining forces for enforcement patrols to identify water wasters in suburban southern Nevada. On Wednesday and Thursday, Henderson Conservation Awareness Assistants and LVVWD’s Water Waste Investigators will tour commercial and residential areas known for high water use to make sure people are following watering rules. Fall seasonal water schedule rules changed Sept. 1, and officials say water conservation is more crucial following the first-ever Colorado River water shortage declaration in August. Climate change, drought and high demand combined to trigger mandatory delivery restrictions to states, farmers and tribes that rely on the parched river and its shrinking reservoirs. Watering is now limited throughout southern Nevada to no more than three days per week based on a property owner’s regional assignment. Sunday watering is prohibited. Customers violating watering restrictions or found letting water spray or flow off their property can face city administrative water waste fines. Henderson conservation and customer official Tina Chen told KTNV-TV the water waste patrols show that everyone is striving toward a common goal of eliminating as much water waste as possible.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Two agencies in the state are working on resettlement plans for Afghan refugees. The refugees are currently being screened at military bases before they arrive in New Hampshire. Jeff Thielman, president and CEO of the International Institute of New England, said the Manchester agency has agreed to receive 50 evacuees from Afghanistan. “We’re all going to work together to provide people with the basic needs, food, clothing, shelter,” Thielman told WMUR-TV. The agency will also work to help refugees with long-term needs such as education and employment. Another agency, Ascentria Care Alliance in Concord, has proposed resettling 100 Afghan refugees. Both agencies have submitted proposals to the U.S. State Department. Under a program called “Operation Allies Welcome,” some 50,000 Afghans are expected to be admitted to the United States, including translators, drivers and others who helped the U.S. military during the 20-year war and who feared reprisals by the Taliban after they quickly seized power last month.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state intends to divest assets from the parent company of Ben & Jerry’s after a preliminary review found the ice cream maker engaged in a boycott of Israel or Israeli-controlled territories, the Division of Investment announced Tuesday. Officials warned Bergen County-based Unilever in a letter that its subsidiary’s actions had triggered New Jersey’s 5-year-old law requiring state pension funds to divest from pro-boycott businesses. New Jersey holdings in Unilever total approximately $182 million in stocks, bonds and short-term paper, according to the Treasury Department. British conglomerate Unilever plc, a multinational consumer goods company that employs 1,600 people in Englewood Cliffs, has 90 days to appeal the decision. Unilever acquired the ice cream company, known for embracing progressive causes, in 2000. The contract grants the Ben & Jerry’s board independence to make decisions about its social mission, Unilever has said. Ben & Jerry’s, a Vermont company founded by two Jewish Americans, said in July that it would continue operating in Israel but stop sales in controversial settlements located in Palestinian territory in the West Bank and Jerusalem. It is not a boycott of Israel, the company said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The New Mexico Supreme Court has ruled state law doesn’t require that vehicle taillights all be working perfectly – only that they work well enough for their intended use. A ruling Monday by the state’s highest court stems from a man’s conviction for violating a state law requiring that certain vehicle equipment be in “good working order.” To conclude that “good working order” means free from flaws or defects “would impose an absurd standard for vehicles on New Mexico roads and highways because it would require that equipment be in perfect condition, beyond a more reasonable expectation that equipment functions for its intended use,” Justice S. Shannon Bacon wrote for the court. The case began when a Bernalillo County sheriff’s deputy pulled the man over because one bulb in a tail lamp didn’t work despite the rest of the lamp being illuminated. The man was convicted both for driving a vehicle with defective equipment and for driving under the influence, and his appeals argued there weren’t grounds to pull him over because his tail lamp was operating well enough. The Supreme Court’s ruling sends the case back to district court for further proceedings.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Theater royalty welcomed back boisterous audiences to “Wicked,” “The Lion King” and “Hamilton” for the first time since the start of the pandemic, marking Tuesday as the unofficial return of Broadway. Kristin Chenoweth surprised the crowd at “Wicked” by appearing onstage for a speech on the same stage where she became a star years ago. “There’s no place like home,” she said, lifting a line from the musical. The crowd hooted, hollered and gave her a standing ovation. Julie Taymor, the director and costume designer of “The Lion King,” congratulated her audience for the courage and enthusiasm to lead the way. “Theater, as we know, is the lifeblood and soul of the city,” she said. “It’s time for us to live again.” And Lin-Manuel Miranda at “Hamilton” summed up the feeling of a lot of people when he said: “I don’t ever want to take live theater for granted.” The trio of shows were beaten by Bruce Springsteen’s concert show in June and the opening of the new play “Pass Over” on Aug. 22, as well as the reopening of two other big musicals, “Hadestown” and “Waitress.” But the return of the three mega-musicals – the spiritual anchors of modern Broadway’s success – is an important signal that Broadway is back, despite pressure and uncertainty from the spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The flap over absentee ballots in the 2020 election resurfaced Wednesday at the General Assembly as Republicans gave final approval to legislation that would limit Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein’s ability to enter future legal settlements. The bill, now headed to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s desk following a party-line House vote, was introduced by GOP lawmakers angry about being left out of negotiations last year between Stein’s office and a labor-affiliated group that sued state election officials. Republican legislative leaders had already intervened to become defendants in the lawsuit. The enforced settlement, which ultimately was challenged all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, increased from three to nine the number of days mailed absentee ballots could be received after Election Day and still count. To prevent what they call “collusive settlements” in the future, GOP members passed the bill stating legal settlements challenging state law or the constitution must be backed by the Senate leader and House speaker when they are named parties. The 2020 settlement broke up bipartisan legislation approved to carry out the fall elections during the pandemic that had kept the ballot grace period at three days, GOP Rep. Destin Hall of Caldwell County said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A state official told a legislative committee Tuesday that the state’s largest and most expensive leased office space is now mostly utilized, after it sat nearly vacant for months when an agency allowed its more than 400 employees to work from home indefinitely. The Associated Press reported in May that taxpayers are on the hook for nearly $3 million in rent over the next two years for the North Dakota Information Technology Department’s unused office space in Bismarck. The report spurred a legislative review of all state leases. Greg Hoffman, the Information Technology Department’s director of administration, told the interim Government Administration Committee that about 90% of the 85,000-square-foot leased space in a newly remodeled, privately owned office building in north Bismarck is now being used. The Department of Environmental Quality last month moved about 140 of its employees from a leased office building just north of the state Capitol to the IT department’s space. Hoffman said the environmental agency is subleasing two floors of the building at $12 a square foot; the IT agency pays $15 a square foot to lease the building. Other agencies also are using the building’s meeting spaces, he said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Three of the prison guards involved in the February death of inmate Michael McDaniel were previously disciplined for excessive use of force or not intervening when inmates were in danger or when guards used unjustified force, records show. The disciplinary documents, obtained by the Associated Press, show a number of past incidents in which Lt. Bruce Brown and correctional officers Adam Causey and Jerry Perkins were reprimanded for actions similar to those made in connection with McDaniel’s in-custody death. The three men were among the seven employees at the Correctional Reception Center in Orient who were fired last month after a state investigation into the death of the Black inmate found guards used unjustified force, and a supervisor failed to intervene. The Franklin County Coroner’s office had declared McDaniel’s death a homicide and ruled the cause as a “stress-induced sudden cardiac death.” The autopsy detailed injuries to his head, face, shoulders, wrists, hands, knees, feet, toes and abdomen. He also had multiple rib fractures, and the coroner found evidence of heart disease. Security footage released by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction in July showed McDaniel, 55, collapsing on his own and being taken down to the floor by guards at least 16 times before he died Feb. 6.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Southeastern Oklahoma State University, which was found to have discriminated against a transgender English professor, must reinstate her with tenure, a federal appeals court ruled. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver on Monday ordered professor Rachel Tudor to be reinstated with tenure and ordered a lower court to recalculate how much pay and attorney fees she is entitled to receive. A federal jury in Oklahoma City previously awarded Tudor more than $1 million after finding the university discriminated against her and wrongfully denied her tenure. But the trial court later reduced that award because of a $300,000 state cap on non-economic damages. Both parties appealed. Tudor began working at Southeastern in 2004. She began presenting as a woman in 2007 by wearing women’s clothing, styling her hair in a feminine way and going by the name Rachel, according to her lawsuit against the university. After she was denied tenure in 2010, Tudor filed a discrimination complaint. She was fired the following year. The U.S. Department of Justice also sued the university, leading to a settlement with Southeastern agreeing to hold mandatory anti-discrimination training and to implement policy changes to reduce discrimination.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Silver Falls State Park officials are planning to log about 100 acres in the park’s backcountry beginning this month in forest that was partially burned by the Beachie Creek Fire last September. The plan sparked concern from advocates and scientists who feel that the park should let the forest regenerate naturally and that the project is more about earning money than sound forest practice. The timber being removed has an estimated value of more than $1 million, and the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department estimates the project will fetch a $300,000 profit that will be used for future “forest health programs,” parks officials said. The plan includes two projects: a logging operation in the backcountry and the removal of about 200 hazard trees from around historic buildings. Both projects are far from the waterfalls most people visit at Silver Falls but are close to and along some popular backcountry mountain bike and hiking trails, including the upper section of the popular Catamount Trail. The larger backcountry project, called the “Beachie Creek Salvage,” could begin this month and would produce 2.2 million board feet of timber. Trees logged would come from forest that’s fully burned, partially burned and green trees, interim park manager Chris Gilliand said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Police announced a new three-year contract with the city Tuesday that offers raises, along with a $1,500 bonus, but lets the city make some of the disciplinary reforms it sought. The Philadelphia Police Department’s more than 6,000 officers will see raises of 2.75% this year and 3.5% in each of the next two years. City officials, meanwhile, promised more transparency in the disciplinary process a year after protests against police brutality rocked Philadelphia and the nation. They said the reforms increase penalties for wrongdoing, add a civilian to the three-person review panel and ban officers from fraternizing with hate groups. There were no changes to the residency rule, which allows officers to move outside the city after five years on the force. Mayor Jim Kenney, at a news conference Tuesday, called that disappointing, saying he believes they should remain city residents. The contract, handed down by an arbiter, also lets the police union know when any personnel files are requested by city prosecutors, the local Fraternal Order of Police said. The office is currently led by District Attorney Larry Krasner, who has feuded with the union and this year charged three former homicide detectives with perjury in an exoneration case that cost the city a nearly $10 million settlement.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWakefield: Researchers are hoping eight recently released young great white sharks will yield insights into some of the questions scientists still have about the famous species. The sharks were released after being tagged with tracking devices by researchers this summer at the Atlantic Shark Institute of Wakefield, officials announced Tuesday. The devices will allow the scientists to locate the fish for 10 years and learn more about their movement and patterns. “It’s the most white sharks that have been tagged in this study to date and will aid considerably in filling in some of the missing pieces for this iconic species of shark,” said Jon F. Dodd, executive director of the institute, which has been working with the O’Seas Conservation Foundation. “In several parts of the world, the great white shark is determined to be critically endangered, and that makes this research all the more vital.” The most important part of the tagging was that most of the sharks were young, Dodd said. In the past few years, about 300 sharks have been tagged, but most were older. This time around, the youngest shark is a few weeks old, Dodd said. “Largely absent from the majority of those tags have been the much younger white sharks, and much about their behavior and habits is still largely unknown,” Dodd said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCamden: Gov. Henry McMaster toured an elementary school Wednesday that he said is an excellent example of how to fight COVID-19 in schools without requiring everyone to wear masks. Camden Elementary School starts with a thermal scanner that takes the temperature of every student as they walk in without them having to stop. Any student warmer than normal is pulled aside and checked more carefully. The school and others in the Kershaw County School District have isolation rooms set up where any students who might have COVID-19 can be placed. When a possible case is identified, school nurses and others do a careful tracing to figure out whether any students were within 3 feet of an infected person for more than 15 minutes, the federal guideline for having to quarantine. They review classroom seating charts, video from school buses and even game film from football games to try to pull out only students who are considered close contacts. Classes are carefully measured to keep students the right distance apart, and while half the students in a grade go to the cafeteria for lunch – sitting three students at an eight-student table – the other half stay in their classrooms. “This is how you do it,” McMaster said. “This is how you win in South Carolina.” Kershaw County schools do not have a mask mandate this school year, following the wishes of Republican legislators who put a one-year provision in the state budget meant to prevent school districts from requiring masks.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Within days after authorities began investigating allegations of a guard sexually abusing prisoners at the South Dakota State Penitentiary, two of the alleged victims were dead. But with officials being tight-lipped about both a criminal investigation into the matter and an ongoing probe by the state into workplace misconduct at the prison, it’s unclear if the deaths played a part in Gov. Kristi Noem’s firing of prison administrators earlier this summer. Michael Noland, 23, died March 27, and Michael Hand, 25, died April 3. Both men were serving prison sentences at the Sioux Falls prison and were found unresponsive in their cells. The Department of Corrections announced the deaths as suicides, while the Division of Criminal Investigation and the Attorney General’s Office began a months­long criminal investigation into former penitentiary guard Rian Fitzpatrick, who last week was formally indicted and charged with engaging in sexual acts with prisoners. The indictment file says the crimes began in early February and went on until mid-March, while a public advocate representing Fitzpatrick said last week in court that he was employed with the state until only recently.\n\nTennessee\n\nFranklin: An alderman says he was “appalled” to see the state make national headlines in the past several weeks due to unruly school board meetings that devolved into chaos, threats and heckling over coronavirus protocols. The first recent meeting to gain national attention was an August Williamson County school board meeting at which hundreds of unruly anti-mask parents interrupted the meeting, screamed at parents who supported pandemic safety protocols, and ended the meeting with threatening health care workers. The viral meeting garnered attention and public remarks from President Joe Biden, who condemned the attack. “I was appalled,” said John Schroer, an at-large alderman for Franklin. “We have parents fighting parents.” At a Rutherford County meeting, adults heckled a high school student who shared that his grandmother died from COVID-19. One man shouted at him to shut up. Others laughed at the teen. “He was mocked by adults in the crowd,” Schroer said. “I’ve never in my life been embarrassed to be a Tennessean, but I was embarrassed to be a part of that group known as Tennesseans treating other Tennesseans that way.” Schroer likened COVID-19 protections to prohibiting smoking indoors because of secondhand smoke and asked Volunteers to care for one another.\n\nTexas\n\nMidland: Federal officials have cleared the way for construction of a dump in West Texas that could hold spent nuclear fuel for up to 40 years. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted a license to Interim Storage Partners LLC to build and run a facility that could take up to 5,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel rods from power plants and 231 million tons of other radioactive waste. The decision puts the federal agency on a collision course with state officials in Texas, where opposition to nuclear waste storage has been building for years. Last week, Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill that purports to prohibit the storage or transportation of high-level nuclear waste such as spent fuel rods through the state. “Texas will not become America’s nuclear waste dumping ground,” Abbott tweeted Tuesday. Environmental groups including the Sierra Club have filed federal lawsuits to block the project, arguing that the discovery of groundwater under the site makes it unsafe to store radioactive waste there. Interim Storage Partners plan to build the facility next to an existing dump site in Andrews County, near the Texas-New Mexico state line, for low-level waste such as protective clothing and other material that has been exposed to radioactivity.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A judge tossed out a lawsuit filed by James Huntsman, a member of one of the state’s most prominent families and brother of a former governor, against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in a ruling issued Tuesday. Huntsman had accused the Utah-based faith known widely as the Mormon church of fraud and sought to recover millions of dollars in contributions, saying the church spent donations solicited for charity on commercial purposes. Judge Stephen Wilson rejected Huntsman’s claims and said no reasonable juror would believe that Latter-day Saint leaders made false statements about how tithing funds would be used. In a lawsuit filed in March, Huntsman said he was defrauded out of millions during the 24 years he gave 10% of his annual income to the church. He is the brother of former U.S. diplomat and ex-Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. and son of late billionaire philanthropist Jon Huntsman Sr. He alleged that the church has “repeatedly and publicly lied” about the use of billions of dollars in contributions meant to pay for missionary work, temples and other educational and charitable work. Church spokesperson Eric Hawkins said the church is “grateful” the judge granted its motion for summary judgment in a statement Tuesday.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The University of Vermont is planning to freeze tuition for the fourth straight year, University President Suresh Garimella said Wednesday. In a statement, Garimella said he would ask the university’s trustees to approve his proposal not to increase tuition next year for any students, regardless of their degree level or residency status. Room and board charges will remain flat for the third consecutive year. Comprehensive fees for undergraduates will also remain frozen. “Students graduating in UVM’s Class of 2023 will complete four years of study at the state’s flagship paying the same for tuition as they did when they started,” Garimella wrote. “We are intensely focused on reducing student debt so Catamounts can build their lives and careers without the burden of large loan payments.” Undergraduate tuition, room and board, and fees for Vermont students currently total about $32,350. For nonresidents, the cost is about $57,250. Garimella first froze tuition in November 2019, during his first six months as president. He has continued the freeze since then. Garimella said the school is committed to maintaining affordability for a college education for UVM students and their families.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A global conservation nonprofit and the state’s largest electricity utility have announced plans to develop what they say will be a large-scale solar project on former surface mines in the southwest Virginia coal fields. Dominion Energy Virginia plans to repurpose about 1,200 acres of the former Red Onion surface mine and surrounding properties for the 50-megawatt Highlands Solar project in Wise and Dickenson County, the company said in a news release with its project partner, The Nature Conservancy. The project will be developed within The Nature Conservancy’s Cumberland Forest Project, a land conservation initiative launched in 2019, and adjacent areas. Brad Kreps, director of The Nature Conservancy’s Clinch Valley Program, said in a statement that the hope is for the project to develop a model that can be replicated in other coal mining regions across the U.S. Construction would tentatively begin in 2024 or 2025, subject to review and approval from state regulators. The Nature Conservancy announced a similar initiative two months ago with two solar energy firms. Taken together, the utility-scale solar projects within the Cumberland Forest Project will cover nearly 1,700 acres and generate an estimated 120 megawatts of solar energy, according to the news release.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Washington Department of Natural Resources lands east of the Cascades will reopen to public access Thursday. The department closed those lands July 23 because of extreme heat, drought and wildfire danger and large fires burning across the West that had stretched wildfire resources. At the time of the closure, the number of fire ignitions in the state was about double the 10-year average, state Commissioner of Public Lands Hilary Franz said in a news release. Franz said conditions have improved dramatically thanks to the tireless efforts of firefighters, an expanded air fleet, and a focus on attacking fires quickly to limit spread. Firefighters have worked on approximately 1,750 fires that burned more than 650,000 acres, which is significantly less acreage burned than last year, she said. More than 98% of DNR fires were caught during the initial attack this fire season, she said. “After months of moving from fire to fire, we are optimistic that we have turned a corner,” Franz said. “I am extraordinarily grateful to everyone who complied with this closure for sharing in the sacrifice necessary to prevent wildfires.” A statewide burn ban remains in effect and is set to expire Sept. 30. More than three-quarters of Washington state remains in drought conditions, Franz said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Tests show a type of bacteria that causes the severe form of pneumonia known as Legionnaires’ disease has resurfaced at a state-run hospital, health officials said. Routine screening found Legionella bacteria at the Mildred Mitchell-Bateman Hospital in Huntington. The hospital is operated by the state Department of Health and Human Resources. The building where the bacteria was detected did not house patients. In April the hospital replaced all faucets and a hot water heater and installed a recirculation pump after the bacteria first was detected in two sinks in the hospital’s administration building. The bacteria in the latest tests was found in the same places as in April: a CEO restroom and a former human resources break room in a basement, the DHHR said in a news release. Legionnaire’s disease can be dangerous to people with lung or immune system problems. It is spread by inhaling droplets from contaminated water sources. The disease can be treated with antibiotics.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Election clerks are reacting with a mixture of concern and confusion to the first inquiry made by a special investigator hired by Republicans to examine how the 2020 presidential election was run in the battleground state. Based on an Associated Press survey of all 72 county election clerks, the email Monday from the lead investigator landed in the junk folders of at least seven counties and wasn’t received by at least 11 others. Several that did get it flagged it as a security risk. Clerks for at least six counties said they would not be forwarding the email to municipalities in their jurisdiction as requested by the investigator, former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, a conservative who last year told a group of Trump supporters that the election had been stolen. “If there was fraud, it wasn’t in my county,” Christopher Marlow, the Lincoln County clerk, told the AP. “We keep very accurate voter lists and we are diligent in our work. All our voters are alive and received one vote each!” Former President Donald Trump won Lincoln County with 61% of the vote in 2020. The pushback and confusion from clerks is just the latest twist in Wisconsin, where conservatives at Trump’s encouragement are ordering investigations into the 2020 election. President Joe Biden carried the state by nearly 21,000 votes.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A state legislator is no longer among the Republicans challenging Liz Cheney for a U.S. House seat in 2022. Republicans should unite to defeat Cheney, state Rep. Chuck Gray, of Casper, said in a statement suspending his campaign Tuesday. Former President Donald Trump last week endorsed Cheyenne lawyer Harriet Hageman in the Republican U.S. House primary. Cheney, also a member of the GOP, reacted to the endorsement by saying: “Bring it.” Gray was among more than half a dozen Republicans to challenge Cheney for her vote to impeach Trump for the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Gray is the third candidate, after Cheyenne attorney Darin Smith and Sheridan County Republican Party Chairman Bryan Miller, to suspend or end a campaign after Trump’s endorsement of Hageman, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Those still in the race include state Sen. Anthony Bouchard, of Cheyenne, and retired U.S. Army Col. Denton Knapp, of Gillette.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/03/balloon-fiesta-yard-shark-street-stunts-news-around-states/50798083/", "title": "Injured musher, yard shark: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A state appeals court has upheld the felony convictions of a man who served 38 years as sheriff in a northern Alabama county. In the unanimous ruling Friday, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals also denied former Limestone County Sheriff Mike Blakely’s request for a new trial, AL.com reports. “This evidence was sufficient for the jury to have concluded that Blakely acted with intent to use his public office to obtain personal gain,” Presiding Judge Mary B. Windom wrote. Blakely was removed from office in August 2021 after a jury convicted him of theft and abuse of power. Prosecutors said the theft charge was tied to accusations that he deposited $4,000 of campaign funds into his personal account. The abuse of power charge was tied to Blakely borrowing money from a jail safe that held inmates’ money. Prosecutors said Blakely received $29,050 in interest-free loans from the safe. Blakely’s attorneys argued that no inmate was ever deprived of money. The trial judge gave him a three-year sentence. Blakely remains out on bond and can ask the Alabama Supreme Court to review the case. Blakely’s attorneys argued to the appeals court that the state failed to show sufficient evidence that he intentionally used his office for personal gain.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A reality television star and Iditarod musher was injured last week while helping to clean up storm damage along the state’s western coast. Jessie Holmes, who since 2015 has starred in “Life Below Zero,” a show about life in rural Alaska produced by National Geographic TV, was injured by falling debris in a building in the community of Golovin on Wednesday, the Anchorage Daily News reports. He was flown for treatment to Nome and then sent to an Anchorage hospital, where officials said he was treated and released. “I wanted to take a moment to let everyone know how much I appreciate all the love, support, and prayers,” Holmes wrote in a post on his kennel’s Facebook page Thursday. Parts of Alaska’s Bering Sea coast were left with severe damage beginning Sept. 16 when the remnants of Typhoon Merbok traveled north through the Bering Strait. Holmes had reached out to defending Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race champion Brent Sass and two other mushers, Jeff Deeter and Richie Beattie, to travel to hard-hit Golovin to volunteer in the cleanup effort, Sass told the Anchorage newspaper. On Wednesday, they were pulling waterlogged plywood and insulation to help them dry out, Sass said. They were standing underneath the plywood when Holmes pulled down a board, and the entire area collapsed on top of them. Holmes, who finished third in this year’s Iditarod, was trapped underneath the pile of plywood, insulation and other building materials.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: All Arizona parents now can use state tax money to send their children to private or religious schools or pay home-schooling costs after an effort by public school advocates to block a massive expansion of the state’s private school voucher law failed to collect enough signatures to block it. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs announced Friday that her office’s review of signatures turned in a week ago to refer the expansion to the ballot came up short of the nearly 119,000 that were needed. Hobbs is a Democrat running for governor who opposed the plan. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey championed the plan and signed it into law in July. He celebrated on Twitter, saying “Let’s Roll!” and “Parents Prevail.” Arizona now has the nation’s most expansive private school voucher law. It allows parents of the state’s more than 1.2 million school-age children to get 90% of the state money that would normally go to their local public schools and use it for private or other school costs. That’s typically about $7,000 per student. The effort to block the expansion passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature over Democratic opposition was organized by Save Our Schools Arizona, a grassroots group of teachers, parents and public education advocates who blocked a similar expansion in 2017. Voters then overwhelmingly rejected the law in the 2018 election.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Voters will decide next month whether recreational marijuana will be legal in the state. Issue 4, to legalize cannabis for residents 21 and older, will be on the Nov. 8 ballots. And the votes will count, the state’s high court has ruled. The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the petition submitted by Responsible Growth Arkansas is sufficient. “Accordingly, we grant the petition and order the Secretary of State to certify the proposed amendment for inclusion on the Nov. 8 general election ballot,” the court said in its opinion. Steve Lancaster, an attorney for Responsible Growth Arkansas, the group that gathered the petition signatures, said he learned of the ruling late Thursday afternoon. “It was a surprise to all of us,” Lancaster said. About 193,000 signature were submitted – over 100,000 signatures more than required to make the ballot. “We were well above what we needed,” Lancaster said. “The result is what we expected from the very beginning. We put a lot of work into a good ballot title, and the court agreed this is good to go to let the voters in Arkansas make their own decision on this. And we’re very grateful to the court for giving the people the right to make this decision.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday announced that oil refineries could start selling more polluting winter-blend gasoline ahead of schedule to ease soaring fuel prices, directly contradicting his own goals for reducing climate emissions. The average cost of a gallon of gas was $6.30 in California on Friday, far above the national average of $3.80, according to AAA. Newsom administration officials said the difference between state prices and the national average has never been larger. The Democratic governor also called on state lawmakers to pass a new tax on oil company profits and return the money to California taxpayers. Lawmakers don’t return to the Capitol until January, and Newsom’s office provided few details on the proposal. “They’re ripping you off,” he said of the oil industry in a video posted to Twitter. Oil industry representatives said it is state regulations that cause higher prices in California than the rest of the country. The summer blend of gasoline that refineries are required by law to produce in the hotter months costs more money to make but is designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions and smog during summer months. Most refineries can’t switch to the winter blend until November.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: When people who had been homeless for years moved off the city’s streets and into apartments, they were far less likely to end up in hospital emergency rooms or get locked up in jail. But they still died at the same rate as those who lived outside, the Colorado Sun reports. That’s the grim finding from a new study of Denver’s social impact bond program, which sends outreach workers to find the highest users of taxpayer-funded services including hospitals, detox centers and the jail. Hundreds of people who were chronically homeless have been housed through the program, which began seven years ago. Previous research showed that the first 250 participants had cost the government a total of $7.3 million per year when they lived outside and in shelters and cycled through the health care and criminal justice systems. After they were housed, researchers found a 40% reduction in arrests, a 30% reduction in jail stays, a 65% decrease in detox services and a 40% drop in emergency department visits. The reductions made up for half of the cost of the program, which was started with $8.6 million from eight private investors as well as local housing resources. The researchers, from the Urban Institute based in Washington, D.C., noticed high levels of mortality among those who were living in supportive housing. A second study confirmed the death rate among those in apartments was the same as those living outside.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision earlier this year, gun rights groups and firearms owners have launched another attempt to overturn the state’s ban on certain semi-automatic rifles that was enacted in response to the Sandy Hook School shooting. A new lawsuit was filed Thursday in federal court by three gun owners, the Connecticut Citizens Defense League and the Second Amendment Foundation seeking to overturn the state prohibition on what they call “modern sporting arms” such as AR-15-style rifles like the one used to kill 20 first graders and six educators at the Newtown school in 2012. “We all deserve to live in safe communities, but denying ownership of the most commonly owned firearms in the country is not the way to achieve it,” Holly Sullivan, president of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, said in a statement. “The recent U.S. Supreme Court decision … has opened the door to this challenge, and we believe Connecticut will be hard pressed to prove its statutes are constitutional.” State officials vowed to defend the 2013 gun laws. “Connecticut’s gun laws save lives, and we are not going back,” state Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. “We will not allow weapons of war back into our schools, our houses of worship, our grocery stores, and our communities.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Perfect attendance isn’t just for bragging rights anymore – for one University of Delaware student, it’s going to mean money, too. This year the University of Delaware athletics department has unveiled the Cockpit HENergy Challenge, a high-stakes contest to incentivize football game attendance. At the end of the season, one UD student who attended all six home football games will be randomly chosen to win $10,000 in financial aid. “Student engagement is really important to us, and it’s important to the program, in terms of the support and stance and making that atmosphere on game day feel really positive, not just for the team but for the students as well,” said Nick LaMarca, who oversees marketing and engagement for the UD athletics department. LaMarca said the department chose to give out financial aid as the prize after “thinking about what’s important to the students.” He said the money comes from the athletics department specifically, not the university overall. To win the competition, UD students must scan their student football tickets before halftime at every home game. Students who participate in the games – including players, marching band members and people in the UD spirit program – are not eligible.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Two bills introduced in Congress on Thursday aim to begin the process of creating a national museum for American LGBTQ+ history and culture in D.C., WUSA-TV reports. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., a co-chair of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, introduced the pair of bills ahead of the nation preparing to celebrate LGBTQ+ History Month in October. “As our community faces unprecedented attacks and attempts to erase our history, we must preserve and protect our stories for future generations,” Pocan said. The bills would establish an eight-member commission to study the potential creation of the national museum and to establish it within the Smithsonian Institution. The bills would be required to be signed into law to become the newest Smithsonian. Pocan said it is vital to remember the nation’s collective past, especially as certain states seek to constrain and repeal existing rights by passing bills that are harmful to LGBTQ+ youth and the community as a whole. During the process, the developed commission would look into the success of the potential Smithsonian museum by creating a plan of action for the establishment, proposing a fundraising path, identifying potential locations within the District to house the facility and more.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: Photos and videos of sharks and other marine life swimming in suburban floodwaters make for popular hoaxes during massive storms. But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian’s assault on southwest Florida isn’t just another fish story. The eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the “Sharknado” film series. Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something “flopping around” in his neighbor’s flooded yard. “I didn’t know what it was – it just looked like a fish or something,” he said. “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like, ‘It’s like a shark, man!’ ” He guessed the fish was about 4 feet long. Experts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish, likely a swordfish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, said in an email that it “appears to be a juvenile shark,” while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, wrote that “it’s pretty hard to tell.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Friday found that Georgia election practices challenged by a group associated with Democrat Stacey Abrams do not violate the constitutional rights of voters, ruling in favor of the state on all remaining issues in a lawsuit filed nearly four years ago. “Although Georgia’s election system is not perfect, the challenged practices violate neither the constitution nor the VRA,” U.S. District Judge Steve Jones in Atlanta wrote, referring to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He detailed his reasoning in a 288-page order. The lawsuit was filed in November 2018, just weeks after Abrams narrowly lost the governor’s race to Republican Brian Kemp. Throughout that contest, Abrams had accused Kemp, then secretary of state, of using his position as the state’s top elections official to promote voter suppression. Kemp vehemently denied the allegations. Kemp on Friday applauded the ruling, calling it a loss for Abrams. “Judge Jones’ ruling exposes this legal effort for what it really is: a tool wielded by a politician hoping to wrongfully weaponize the legal system to further her own political goals,” Kemp said in a statement. Abrams and Fair Fight expressed disappointment in the decision but said the lawsuit helped bring about positive change in Georgia.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visited the state last week amid lingering community frustration and distrust after jet fuel from a military storage facility last year spilled into Pearl Harbor’s drinking water, poisoned thousands of military families and threatened the purity of Honolulu’s water supply. Austin traveled to the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in the hills above Pearl Harbor on Friday and met the commander of the joint task force in charge of draining its tanks so it can be shut down. He also met with several families affected by the fuel spill and Hawaii state officials, the military said in a news release. The meetings were closed to the media, and Austin didn’t hold a news conference afterward. Outside Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam, several dozen protesters held signs saying “Navy Lies” and “Shut Down Red Hill.” People driving by – including many exiting the base – honked in support. Samantha McCoy, whose husband is in the Air Force, said her family suffered migraines, rashes, skin sores and gastrointestinal problems that only subsided when they moved out of military housing last month. She called on Austin to make more medical care available to families. “It took four months of daily migraines to even get a referral to a neurologist. And that’s really unacceptable,” she said at the protest.\n\nIdaho\n\nMoscow: A box truck equipped with a bright LED billboard began circling around the University of Idaho campus Friday. “Pregnant? You still have a choice,” said one of the bright blue-and-white messages flashing across the side. “You can still get abortion pills by mail,” read another message. The moving billboard was a salvo by Mayday Health against Idaho’s anti-abortion laws, including some that prohibit state employees from promoting or endorsing abortion or emergency contraception. The organization seeks to inform people in anti-abortion states how to access abortion and contraception. Mayday Health chose Moscow for the action after the university warned employees not to refer students to abortion or birth control providers lest they run afoul of the state laws. “This effort is part of protecting free speech and the First Amendment,” said Kaori Sueyoshi, Mayday Health ‘s head of strategy. “We want to make sure that students at the University of Idaho and surrounding area have accurate information about how to get birth control pills, Plan B (emergency contraception) as well as how to get safe abortion access.” University of Idaho Provost Torrey Lawrence said the legal guidance simply was intended to protect staffers. Boise State University recently issued similar, albeit less strict, advice.\n\nIllinois\n\nZion: Millions of Ahmadi Muslims around the world believe holy miracle happened in Zion 115 years ago. The Ahmadis view this small city, 40 miles north of Chicago on the shores of Lake Michigan, as a place of special religious significance for their global messianic faith. Their reverence for the community began more than a century ago – with fighting words, a prayer duel and a prophecy. Zion was founded in 1900 as a Christian theocracy by John Alexander Dowie, an evangelical and early Pentecostal preacher who drew thousands to the city with his faith healing ministry. The Ahmadis believe their founder, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, defended the faith from Dowie’s verbal attacks against Islam and defeated him in a sensational faceoff armed only with prayers. Most current residents may not have an inkling of that high-stakes holy fight of a bygone era. But for the Ahmadis, it is one that has created an eternal bond with the city of Zion. Over the weekend, thousands of Ahmadi Muslims from around the world congregated in the city to celebrate that century-old miracle and a significant milestone in the life of Zion and of their faith: the building of the city’s first mosque.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: All tax rebate payments from the state’s budget surplus have been printed and mailed, Indiana State Auditor Tera Klutz said. “We successfully completed printing on September 21 and sent the last batch of automatic taxpayer refund checks to the postal service on September 22,” Klutz said in a statement Thursday. “Most Hoosiers who filed a 2020 tax return in 2021 should have received their automatic taxpayer refund via direct deposit or mailed check by now.” More than 1.5 million checks with the $125 refund were mailed, Klutz’s office said. Eligible Hoosiers will also receive additional payments for $200 for individuals or $400 for couples filing jointly. The Indiana Department of Revenue noted that the eligibility requirements for the two refunds are different. Although all who were eligible for the initial $125 payment qualify for the subsequent $200 refund, some who were not eligible for the first do qualify for the second. Direct deposit payments for the first round of rebates were sent starting in May.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Nearly two years after a federal policy required the nation’s hospitals to unveil the hidden costs of medical care, a tiny fraction of Iowa facilities are in compliance, according to a new report. And patients are paying the price. Only six of the state’s 61 hospitals in Iowa reviewed by researchers – 10% – have complied with the federal rule intended to bring more transparency to health care costs, according to the audit by PatientRightsAdvocate.org published in August. Iowa’s compliance rate is even worse than the national rate. The audit of 2,000 hospitals nationwide found that 319 hospitals, or 16%, complied with the rule. Noncompliant hospitals ranged from small, independent hospitals to some of the largest health care systems in the country, according to PatientRightsAdvocate.org. Iowa health care officials contend their noncompliance is not for lack of trying. Hospitals face significant barriers to publishing the massive amounts of data required under the federal rule, they say. “If you don’t have the knowledge, tools, resources or financial availability to get it done, I’m sure hospitals are not compliant for those reasons,” said Heather Vandewater, business office and patient access director for Mary Greeley Medical Center in Ames.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Three months after the National Park Service announced James Williams as the new superintendent of Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Park, the site opened its doors Friday in celebration of the 30th anniversary of its designation. The symposium at the Brown v. Board of Education site also welcomed leaders from five new affiliated areas and an additional National Park Service site. “It’s just interesting to me to get to know the people, get to know their stories, and see the potential for us as an agency to help the American people understand the complexity of the Brown decision and all the history that went into it,” Williams said. Last week’s symposium is historic because it brought together – for the first time – people from each of the sites that are part of Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park, said Sean Dixon, president of Visit Topeka. He noted that President Joe Biden last May signed the Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park Expansion and Redesignation Act. That act continues federal government efforts to recognize the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, which banned racial segregation in schools in 1954.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: An advisory committee set up this year by Gov. Andy Beshear reported that many Kentucky adults favor legalizing medical marijuana, Beshear’s office said Friday. The Democratic governor formed the Medical Cannabis Advisory Committee after a bill to legalize medical marijuana died in the state Senate this year. The committee found that Kentuckians who suffer from chronic conditions are not getting relief from painkillers and opioids and fear their addictive properties, Beshear said. The committee also reported that residents are crossing state lines to obtain medical cannabis where it is legal and want to return to Kentucky without breaking the law. The panel found that military veterans from Kentucky reported that cannabis use eased post-traumatic stress disorder, Beshear’s office said in a news release. Justice and Public Safety Secretary Kerry Harvey, the committee co-chair, said the panel did not hear any opposition at town hall meetings on the topic. “Everyone who spoke supported legalizing medical cannabis in Kentucky,” Harvey said. “We heard from many Kentuckians that use cannabis for its beneficial medical effects but can only do so by breaking the law as it now exists.” Beshear said he is considering the information while he decides what steps to take next to legalize medical marijuana, which he supports.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Rule No. 1 for this week’s animal blessing at a Catholic university: “Please leave venomous animals at home.” Rule No. 2: Be prepared to clean up after your pet. “We will provide a pet station with complimentary water and waste bags,” said a news release Thursday. The group blessing of the animals – all comers welcome – will be the first since 1999 at Loyola University New Orleans. The Rev. Justin Daffron, Loyola’s interim president, and Parleaux, a black cockapoo he trained as the university’s therapy dog, will attend, university spokeswoman Patricia Murret said Thursday. The service is scheduled for Tuesday evening on the lawn next to the university’s church. Oct. 4 is the feast day of St. Francis of Assisi, patron saint of animals, ecology, merchants and Italy. Churches and schools from the East Coast to the West Coast hold Blessing of the Animals services. Murret said they were popular at Loyola during the 1990s but apparently fell by the wayside for the next two decades. She doesn’t know why. She said someone suggested resuming the tradition at a late August or early September meeting “about alumni events, bringing people together, reconnecting in this post-pandemic world as we return to life and joy and connections with each other.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state housing authority has halted new applications for emergency rental assistance while it waits to find out if a request for more federal money will be approved. MaineHousing said in a statement that an “unanticipated uptick in demand” and uncertainty about new revenue prompted the decision to pause applications. The program started in March 2021 and stopped taking applications at the end of the day Thursday. The housing authority described the program as a temporary support that is funded via federal money through COVID-19 relief laws. The authority said the pause will allow more than 11,000 pending requests to be processed. The program has helped more than 33,000 households and spent more than $275 million, MaineHousing officials said. The program is mostly used to pay rent directly to landlords. MaineHousing spokesperson Scott Thistle said the pause in applications “a fiscally responsible and reasonable move that will allow us to ensure all who have already applied to this program get a fair opportunity to receive help.” Dozens of other states have paused or ended similar programs.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Aging infrastructure contributed to an E. coli contamination of the city of Baltimore’s water system in early September, officials said last week. A confluence of events in several parts of the water system reduced chlorine levels, which led to three positive tests for E. coli, a Department of Public Works official told The Washington Post. City officials also detailed their findings during a City Council hearing Thursday. The contamination led to a boil-water advisory for a wide swath of the city and into Baltimore County, which is served by the city system, The Baltimore Sun reports. No illnesses were linked to the contaminated water, a city spokeswoman said Friday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A former tenant charged with setting a fire at an apartment building that claimed the lives of four people pleaded not guilty at her arraignment Friday and was held without bail. Yvonne Ngoiri, 36, faces four counts of second-degree murder as well as arson and assault charges in connection with the May 14 blaze in Worcester. Among the victims was a man who in 2018 had sued right-wing radio host Alex Jones’ Infowars website. Ngoiri, who once lived in the building, was taken into custody Thursday, the office of Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said in a statement. The cause of the early-morning fire at the three-story, six-unit building was determined to be “incendiary,” according to the district attorney’s office, but no motive was disclosed in court. Ngoiri is scheduled back in court Nov. 29. The victims have previously been identified as Joseph Garchali, 47; Christopher Lozeau, 53; Vincent Page, 41; and Marcel Fontaine, 29. In addition, several residents were injured, including one who jumped from a third-story window and two who suffered from smoke inhalation. The building had about 20 tenants. Two nearby buildings were also damaged. Fontaine sued Infowars in 2018, saying it posted his photograph on its website the day of a mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, depicting him as the gunman.\n\nMichigan\n\nOdessa Township: A homeowner has been charged with shooting and wounding an 84-year-old woman who was canvassing door-to-door against a proposed constitutional amendment that would guarantee the right to abortion in the state. Richard Harvey was charged Friday on charges of felonious assault and reckless discharge of a firearm causing injury charges, Ionia County Prosecutor Kyle Butler said in a statement. Harvey surrendered to authorities Friday morning and was being held in the county jail. The State Police investigated the Sept. 20 shooting at Harvey’s home in Odessa Township and submitted charging recommendations to the prosecutor’s office, Butler said. The canvasser, Joan Jacobson, told investigators she was asking a woman at the home to vote against Proposal 3 in November when she was told to leave. Jacobson told The Detroit News that she was headed to her car when she “heard a shot” and “felt some pain.” Jacobson said she then drove to a local police station and was later treated at a hospital. Harvey, 74, told WOOD-TV he shot Jacobson accidentally while she was arguing with his wife, and he told Jacobson numerous times to leave their property. Harvey said he fired a warning shot at a tree, and the woman continued “ranting and raving” and waving a clipboard.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Mayor Jacob Frey said Thursday that he is nominating a former public safety director from New Jersey as his top pick for the city’s next police chief, at a time when the department is struggling with depleted staffing and the uncertainty of an ongoing federal investigation following the killing of George Floyd. If confirmed by the City Council, Brian O’Hara, deputy mayor of Newark, would be taking over a department that some city leaders and community members had sought to abolish in recent years, and he would lead the agency through court-ordered changes that are expected as the result of the U.S. Department of Justice’s ongoing probe into policing practices. “What we heard loud and clear is that people wanted a changemaker,” Frey said. “They wanted a reform-minded candidate that would both be accountable to the city of Minneapolis and our residents and also able to drive down crime in a serious way. … Minneapolis has been asking for change, and Brian O’Hara, the deputy mayor, is answering that call.” O’Hara said Thursday that he will work toward driving down gun violence, building up ranks in the police department, and working with the community “to heal the heart of this great city,” and he plans to build a department so good that people of all races and backgrounds will want to be part of it.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The University of Mississippi is paying tribute to 89-year-old James Meredith 60 years after white protesters erupted into violence as he became the first Black student to enroll in what was then a bastion of Deep South segregation. Meredith was honored Saturday during the Ole Miss-Kentucky football game, receiving a framed Ole Miss jersey with the number 62 – for 1962, the year he integrated the university. The ceremony happened two days after he attended the Rebels’ practice to speak to players. “He came and revolutionized our thinking. He came to open our closed society,” Donald Cole, who retired in 2018 as the university’s assistant provost and head of multicultural affairs, said during a celebration Wednesday night. The enigmatic Meredith, who lives in Jackson, has long resisted the label of “civil rights leader,” as if civil rights are separate from other human rights. He has said his effort to enter Ole Miss was his own battle to conquer white supremacy. Meredith’s being honored at the Ole Miss-Kentucky game was an ironic echo of history. Two days before he enrolled on the Oxford campus in 1962, race-baiting Gov. Ross Barnett worked a white crowd into a frenzy at a football stadium in Jackson. Ole Miss fans waved Confederate flags to support their Rebels over the Kentucky Wildcats and to defy any move toward racial integration.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Lawmakers on Thursday gave final approval to an income tax cut that Gov. Mike Parson requested and ditched a last-minute proposal to cut corporate taxes. The Republican-led Missouri House voted 98-32 in favor of the bill, which would cut income taxes from 5.3% to 4.95% beginning next year and phase in additional cuts until the rate hits 4.5%. The bill applies to the top income tax rate, which covers those who make more than about $8,700 a year in taxable income. The additional cuts would be triggered by revenue growth benchmarks tied to inflation. The roughly $1 billion measure also eliminates the lowest tax bracket, meaning earners who bring in less than about $1,000 a year no longer will have to pay state income taxes. The measure now heads to Parson, who is expected to sign it. The Republican governor called lawmakers back to work to spend some of the state’s record revenue surplus on tax cuts. “We are thrilled that the General Assembly has answered our call to cut Missourians’ taxes and return some of their hard-earned dollars,” he said in a statement. If Parson signs the bill into law, taxpayers who make between $22,000 and $66,000 a year would on average see savings of $10 to $50 next year because of the income tax cut, according to an analysis by the Missouri Budget Project.\n\nMontana\n\nBridger: An evacuation warning was put in place for residents near the town after a train derailed, and two fuel cars ruptured and leaked an estimated 31,000 gallons of gasoline, authorities said Saturday. BNSF Railway Co. said there were no injuries, and crews were working with local officials and hazardous-materials responders to safely clear the site. The derailment of the southbound train occurred on a curving portion of the track about half a mile east of the small south-central Montana town of Bridger, population of about 660, about 45 miles southwest of Billings. “Two of the derailed cars were compromised and leaked gasoline,” BNSF spokesman Ben Wilemon said in an email to the Associated Press. “The cause of the derailment is under investigation.” A 30,000-gallon tank emptied completely, and a second damaged tank leaked about 1,000 gallons before BNSF workers repaired the tank, The Billings Gazette reports. There was no immediate information on whether the spill contaminated groundwater or the area’s irrigation systems. Authorities said about 15 cars derailed not long after midnight. Four of the derailed cars contained petroleum. Officials said the train was also moving coal, sorghum and particle board. The tracks in that area in some portions run near the meandering Clark’s Fork of the Yellowstone River.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A passenger’s cellphone automatically alerted responders after a car hit a tree early Sunday in a crash that killed all six of its young occupants, authorities said. Five men in the car died at the scene of the crash about 2:15 a.m. in Lincoln, about 3 miles east of the state Capitol, police said. A 24-year-old woman died later at a hospital where she was taken in critical condition. The five men who died included the 22-year-old driver. The other victims were one 21-year-old, one 23-year-old and two 22-year-olds. Police did not release any details on what caused the crash but said it was reported by an iPhone that detected the impact and called responders automatically when the phone’s owner didn’t respond.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Thousands of people in hundreds of cars took over northern Nevada parking lots and intersections Friday night and into Saturday, performing stunts in souped-up vehicles and leading to crashes and arrests, police said. Police beefed up nighttime staffing after social media posts urged people from San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, to come to the “sideshow” in Reno, Police Lt. Michael Browett said. The disturbances started late Friday as several hundred cars and their occupants met in the parking lot of a still-open Walmart store. Police tried to break up the crowds, and drivers sped off, meeting up again at several intersections and industrial parks into Saturday morning. A dozen people were arrested, 14 cars impounded and 33 people issued citations. Browett said Reno is just the latest city to see late-night takeovers by auto enthusiasts who ignore law enforcement efforts to stop the illegal and dangerous activity. “I don’t know what the underlying movement is with this group, but it goes a little beyond cars,” Browett said. “They’re very anti-authoritarian, and they basically just show up and do whatever they want.” In Reno, no one was seriously injured. But Browett said those arrested face charges including reckless driving, hit and run causing injury and weapons possession.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNashua: Investigators are trying to determine the cause of a fire that heavily damaged a strip mall, the fire department said in a Saturday news release. The fire in the building on Amherst Street that contained a number of businesses was reported about 7:30 p.m. Friday. People who were inside a pizza shop and an Asian market left the building before firefighters arrived. The fire was brought under control in about an hour. There were no injuries. The Nashua Fire Department says the structure was left unusable by the fire. The City of Nashua Fire Marshal’s office is trying to determine the cause of the fire.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The Democrat-led state Senate on Thursday confirmed Gov. Phil Murphy’s former chief counsel to be New Jersey’s attorney general. Attorney General Matt Platkin had been serving as the state’s acting top law enforcement official since earlier this year when Murphy nominated him. “I pledge to continue to work tirelessly to end the scourge of gun violence, to strengthen trust between law enforcement and the broader public, and to protect the rights of our residents,” he said. Platkin, 35, served as the Murphy administration’s top attorney overseeing pending bills and executive orders for the Democratic governor from the start of the administration in early 2018 until late 2020. He left to take a post at the firm Lowenstein Sandler where he handled white-collar cases and business disputes. Platkin was a fixture during Murphy’s regular news conferences during the COVID-19 pandemic and regularly fielded questions related to executive orders aimed at curbing the effects of the virus. He was also a lead negotiator for the governor for three annual budget bills and oversaw the vast appointment and nominations apparatus in the governor’s office. New Jersey’s governor is among the most powerful in the country because the state constitution provides for the executive to appoint many offices in the state.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Hundreds of hot air balloons lifted off Saturday morning, marking the start of an annual fiesta that has drawn pilots and spectators from across the globe to the high desert for 50 years. As one of the most photographed events in the world, the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta has become an economic driver for the state’s largest city and a rare – and colorful – opportunity for enthusiasts to be within arm’s reach as the giant balloons are unpacked and inflated. Three of the original pilots who participated in the first fiesta in 1972 and the family members of others are among this year’s attendees. That first year, 13 balloons launched from an open lot near a shopping center on what was then the edge of Albuquerque. It has since grown into a multimillion-dollar production. Pilot Gene Dennis, 78, remembers the snowstorm that almost caused him to miss the 1972 fiesta. He had to rearrange his flight plans from Michigan so he could make it to Albuquerque in time. The weather was perfect when he got to New Mexico, said Dennis, who flew under the alias “Captain Phairweather.” He was quoted at the time as saying he had brought good weather with him. He was on the hook again, as pilots hope predictions for the rest of opening weekend are fair. “Ballooning is infectious,” Dennis said, describing being aloft like drifting in a dream, quietly observing the countryside below.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Struggling taxi drivers have gotten $225 million in debt relief over the past two weeks, but thousands more loans have yet to be refinanced after a cabbie debt crisis, officials and advocates said Friday as the relief program deadline was extended. Over 1,000 loans have been refinanced in the first two weeks of the program. It was announced in August after drivers appealed for years for help with a crippling economic crunch surrounding the city’s famous yellow cabs. “Every time we raised our hands to hail a cab at a curb, they responded. Now it’s time for us to stand with them, and that’s what we’ve done,” Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, said at a news conference where scores of drivers lined the steps of City Hall. Still, the major lender participating in the program, Marblegate Asset Management, said it had yet to hear from the borrowers of roughly 2,000 eligible loans. An estimated 850 loans handled by other lenders haven’t been addressed, according to Bhairavi Desai of the Taxi Workers Alliance, a drivers’ union. Officials urged drivers with Marblegate loans to inquire by the program deadline – now extended by a week, to next Friday – and encouraged other lenders to participate.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: One week before election officials begin processing by-mail ballots in the closely watched Southern swing state, the GOP is pursuing its latest legal challenge to the electoral procedures established by the Democrat-led State Board of Elections. The North Carolina Republican Party filed two motions in Wake County Superior Court last week, asking the court to block the board from enforcing its prohibition of county election officials scrutinizing signatures on absentee voting documents. The legal challenge follows the state board’s July rejection of a Republican Party request to authorize county officials to compare signatures on absentee ballot request forms and container envelopes with the signatures included in voter registration records. Citing concerns that the proposal would create unequal voting access, the board denied the request in a 3-2 party-line vote, with three Democrats voting against signature checks and two Republicans voting in favor. “Why the Board of Elections continues to undermine the integrity of our elections is inexplicable,” North Carolina GOP Chairman Michael Whatley said. “The NCGOP is pursuing this lawsuit to ensure our elections remain secure and free from doubt.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMcHenry: A man accused in the fatal hit-and-run of a teenager after a small-town street dance is now charged with murder, after prosecutors say he intentionally ran over the 18-year-old, according to upgraded charges made public Friday. Shannon Brandt, 41, was initially charged with criminal vehicular homicide in the Sept. 18 killing of Cayler Ellingson, but that charge has been dropped. The new charge – murder with a dangerous weapon – is a felony that carries a maximum sentence of life in prison upon conviction. Brandt is also charged with leaving the scene of a crash that resulted in death. According to a probable cause affidavit released Friday, Brandt told a 911 dispatcher that if it had been a total accident, he wouldn’t be so scared, “but I know it was more than that.” Brandt initially told authorities that there had been a political argument and that Ellingson was part of a “Republican extremist group.” Many conservatives took to social media to decry the alleged motive in Ellingson’s death. But investigators have said that the case was not political in nature and that there is no evidence to support Brandt’s claim that Ellingson was a Republican extremist. Brandt’s attorney, Mark Friese, said Friday that he would not comment yet because the Ellingson family is grieving, the community is in mourning, and he hasn’t received all of the case background.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Medical marijuana patients are happier with the state’s program than they once were, but they continue to face high prices and a shortage of doctors who can recommend cannabis, according to a new study. The report from Ohio State University’s Drug Enforcement and Policy Center found more than half of survey respondents reported some level of satisfaction with the medical cannabis program, including 15.3% who were “extremely satisfied.” About 35% of people were dissatisfied with the program, an improvement from 55% last year. The center conducted its survey in April and March and received more than 2,500 responses. The high cost of medical marijuana in Ohio is the biggest problem, according to patients. While the price of plant product in the state declined 17% during the past year, costs in neighboring Michigan dropped even further, making a trip out of state more appealing than buying from an Ohio dispensary. During a 13-month period, an Ohio patient on average paid $4.08 more per gram than someone in Michigan. “They see a huge price difference between Michigan and Ohio, and I think that’s one of the things that might be driving dissatisfaction,” said Jana Hrdinova, the study’s author and administrative director of the Drug Enforcement and Policy Center.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A teenager was killed and another wounded in a shooting at a high school homecoming football game Friday night, police said. The victims, both 17, were shot during the event at McLain High School for Science and Technology shortly before 10 p.m., according to a statement by the Tulsa Police Department posted on Twitter and Facebook. “When Officers arrived, we found two victims amongst the crowd of hundreds. One 17-year-old male was pronounced dead at the scene,” the post said. The surviving victim was taken to a hospital in critical condition but has improved to stable condition, the statement said. Several officers and a K-9 unit searched nearby neighborhoods but were not immediately able to find the suspected shooter, who ran away from the scene, police said. Police said the suspect is believed to be another 17-year-old.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: State environmental regulators have issued a $2.7 million fine to an electric charging company over accusations it sold fraudulent credits through the agency’s clean fuels program. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality said Friday that it discovered Thompson Technical Services, or TTS Charging, sold more than $2 million in fraudulent credits, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. The program, implemented in 2016, is designed to help the state reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector by 37% by 2035. It provides credits as incentives to companies that produce transportation fuels like electricity or biofuels. Those companies can then sell credits to other companies in order for them to comply with state emissions rules. According to DEQ, TTS Charging falsely claimed more than 16,000 in credits in June, alleging it dispensed nearly 15 million kilowatt hours of electricity from three vehicle charging stations. “They hadn’t dispensed any electricity; they hadn’t even set up the charging stations,” said Harry Esteve, a spokesperson for the agency. The company then sold the credits for nearly $1.8 million to oil and natural gas transportation company, Elbow River Marketing, based in Canada. The state agency has revoked TTS Charging’s account with the clean fuels program.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Max Baer, the chief justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, has died only months before he was set to retire, the court confirmed Saturday. He was 74. Baer died overnight at his home near Pittsburgh, the court said in a news release. The court didn’t give a reason for his death but called his “sudden passing” a “tremendous loss for the court and all of Pennsylvania.” The court said Justice Debra Todd now becomes chief justice “as the justice of longest and continuous service on the court.” She is the first female chief justice in the commonwealth’s history, a court spokesperson confirmed. “Chief Justice Baer was an influential and intellectual jurist whose unwavering focus was on administering fair and balanced justice,” Todd said in the release. “He was a tireless champion for children, devoted to protecting and providing for our youngest and most vulnerable citizens.” Gov. Tom Wolf ordered state flags at commonwealth facilities, public buildings and grounds lowered to half-staff, saying he was “extremely saddened” by the death of such a “respected and esteemed jurist with decades of service to our courts and our commonwealth.” Baer, a Duquesne Law graduate, was an Allegheny County family court judge and an administrative judge in family court before he was elected to the high court in 2003 and became its chief justice last year. Baer also served as deputy attorney general for Pennsylvania from 1975 to 1980 and was in private practice before entering the judiciary.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The most closely guarded secret entrusted to the governor may be knowing what happens on the NBC singing competition “The Voice.” For several weeks, it was rumored that Gov. Dan McKee’s daughter, Kara McKee, was lined up for an on-screen audition for the show, which airs on Monday and Tuesday nights. Last week, the governor’s office confirmed that she would be on the show but declined to say more. The Democrat sidestepped direct questions about how well his daughter fares to talk about how wonderful she is. “We’re very proud of our family, and Kara in particular right now – she’s taken over from my mom ... in terms of being the star of the family,” he said. “We’re very proud of Kara and her move to spend the time on a music career that she’s left the corporate world to pursue.” McKee’s 94-year-old mother, Willa McKee, who moved back in with her son’s family, stars in a popular campaign ad whose punchline says that her son isn’t doing too bad “for a governor that lives with his mother.” His daughter, 37, most recently worked in digital operations for TJX, the corporate parent of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods. Why won’t the proud papa talk about how she does on the competition? “We signed all these agreements,” he said, referring to nondisclosure agreements.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Gov. Henry McMaster has temporarily suspended campaign activities as he leads the state’s response to Hurricane Ian. McMaster’s campaign said the Republican incumbent canceled a fundraiser scheduled for Friday night in Clemson, as well as an appearance for tailgating before the Clemson Tigers’ football game Saturday. McMaster had been talking with officials across the state and holding daily briefings last week as the state made preparations for the storm, which ravaged Florida and barreled onward to South Carolina’s coast. Politics and hurricanes often collide in the state, where the final months before the November general elections can turn into busy storm seasons. In 2018, both McMaster and his Democratic opponent, then-Rep. James Smith, pulled down their campaign events as Hurricane Florence approached the state. Smith, who was a major in the South Carolina National Guard, was activated during that storm response, tasked with coordinating the distribution of resources across the state.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem indicated Friday during her reelection campaign’s lone debate with her Democratic challenger, state lawmaker Jamie Smith, that if reelected she will uphold the state’s abortion ban that provides no exceptions for rape or incest. The Republican governor explained her position simply as “pro-life,” while pledging to push for expanded parental leave in the state and alleviate the toll of inflation on people’s budgets. Smith called Noem’s stance extreme and said it was endangering women’s lives and causing concern among physicians for its lack of clarity on when an abortion is allowed – only to save the life of a pregnant woman. “It’s clear to me that South Dakotans overwhelmingly support a woman’s right to an abortion,” Smith said. “We talk about freedom all the time, except the freedom to make this choice.” The gubernatorial race’s lone head-to-head meeting of the two candidates featured Noem touting her record of a hands-off approach to the COVID-19 pandemic. Smith, who is facing an uphill election in the heavily Republican state, cast himself as a moderate. He was quick to point out that the grocery-tax repeal Noem suddenly embraced last week was an initiative he has been pushing for years, and when the state House passed the proposal in March, support from Noem was lacking.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Problems with rape kit evidence testing keep haunting Memphis. A city long plagued by a heavy backlog of untested sexual assault kits was shaken by Cleotha Henderson’s arrest in the killing of Eliza Fletcher after she was abducted during a morning jog last month. So when authorities said his DNA was linked to a rape that occurred nearly a year earlier – charging him separately days after he was arrested in Fletcher’s killing – an outraged city turned to the obvious question: Why was he still on the streets? The case of Henderson, who already has served 20 years in prison for a kidnapping he committed at 16, has reignited criticism of Tennessee’s sexual assault testing process. That has included calls for shorter delays from the testing agency, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, and questions about why Memphis didn’t seek to fast-track a kit that could have been tested in days. Instead, it took nearly a year, unearthing key evidence too late to charge Henderson before Fletcher’s killing. The tragic outcome brings back memories from the early 2010s, when Memphis revealed a backlog of about 12,000 untested rape kits that took years to whittle down and led to a lawsuit that’s still ongoing. The new rape charges have spurred another lawsuit accusing the Memphis Police Department of negligence for the delay.\n\nTexas\n\nConroe: A deeply divided federal appeals court has ruled that a Texas judge may start the day with prayer, overturning a district court decision. Judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans split 2-1 in opinions handed down Thursday, reversing a ruling made without a trial by U.S. District Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt. Montgomery County Justice of the Peace Wayne Mack doesn’t force anyone to attend the prayers before court formally opens, Judge Jerry E. Smith wrote for himself and Judge Kurt D. Engelhardt. Mack “takes great pains to convince attendees that they need not watch the ceremony – and that doing so will not affect their cases,” he wrote. Judge E. Grady Jolly responded: “For the majority to find that there is no evidence of coercion, suggests, in my opinion, willful blindness and indisputable error.” He noted that Mack is a Pentecostal minister who made a campaign promise to establish prayer in his courtroom. “He has previously criticized opponents of his prayer ceremony and has acted hostile following a litigant’s noncooperation in the prayer,” Jolly wrote. The Freedom From Religion Foundation sued Mack in 2017 for itself and an anonymous lawyer who said he attended the sessions out of fear that not doing so would hurt his clients.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Russell M. Nelson, the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, told members of the faith Saturday that abuse was “a grievous sin” that shouldn’t be tolerated and would bring down the wrath of God on perpetrators. Though the leader of the nearly 17 million-member faith did not mention it directly, the remarks were the first on abuse from a senior church leader since the Associated Press published an investigation into how the church handles reports of sexual abuse when brought to its attention. “Let me be perfectly clear: Any kind of abuse of women, children or anyone is an abomination to the Lord,” Nelson, who members of the faith believe is a prophet, said in Salt Lake City at a church conference. The AP’s investigation found the hotline the church uses for abuse reporting can be misused by its leaders to divert accusations away from law enforcement and toward church attorneys. The story, based on sealed records and court cases filed in Arizona and West Virginia, uncovered a host of concerns, including how church officials have cited exemptions to mandatory reporting laws, known as clergy-penitent privilege, as a reason to not report abuse. Since its publication, the church has said the investigation mischaracterizes its policies.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Dispensaries began selling marijuana for legal recreational use over the weekend. FLORA Cannabis in Middlebury, Mountain Girl Cannabis in Rutland and CeresMED in Burlington were the only retailers ready to begin sales Saturday. A fourth business has been licensed to sell recreational pot but isn’t ready to do so yet. As happened with the rollout of recreational marijuana sales in other states and in Canada, Vermont’s inaugural weekend was “more of a soft opening,” as more product manufacturers and testing facilities come online and as more people harvest the plant, said James Pepper, chair of the state Cannabis Control Board. Vermont joins 14 other states with legal adult-use cannabis sales, according to the Marijuana Policy Project. Four others – Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island and Virginia – and Washington, D.C., have legalized the use of recreational marijuana, but sales haven’t started there yet. Vermont’s Cannabis Control Board prioritized review and waived licensing fees for social equity applicants. Such applicants are Black or Hispanic or from communities that historically have been disproportionately affected by cannabis being outlawed or who have been or had a family member who has been incarcerated for a cannabis-related offense.\n\nVirginia\n\nGala: He won in the dogfights of World War II, he won in the Olympic boxing ring, and he won in Virginia Supreme Court. Now a stretch of highway in Botetourt County is named in honor of Norvel LaFallette Ray Lee. Descendants of Lee recently traveled to his birthplace from as far as Alaska to unveil a placard along U.S. 220 that details his life and accomplishments, on what would have been his 98th birthday. “I hope this marker will inspire people to learn more about Norvel, his extraordinary achievements and his place in the history of our country,” said state Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt. “I want to acknowledge this man who overcame the adversities of segregation to become a Tuskegee Airmen and a gold medalist in the Olympics.” Born in Eagle Rock in 1924, Lee won fights by air and in the boxing ring, including Olympic gold in 1952, but is known also for taking a stand against segregation on his way home from the 1948 Olympics. “While returning from the 1948 Olympics, traveling by train, he was asked to give up his seat to a white person,” Austin said. “Mr. Lee declined to do so and was arrested. Eventually the Virginia Supreme Court did the right thing and ruled in Mr. Lee’s favor.” Undefeated in Virginia Supreme Court on what became a landmark civil rights case, Lee went on to retire from boxing with two Golden Glove titles and a 100-5 win-loss record, said the Rev. Nelson Harris of Heights Community Church in Roanoke.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A woman who was sexually assaulted by a police officer has filed a tort claim against the city. The woman is seeking $1 million in damages, alleging “red flags” related to now ex-police Officer Nathan Nash’s behavior were ignored, KREM-TV reports. Nash was convicted in August on one count of third-degree rape and one count of second-degree rape in two separate incidents in which he was on duty. The woman intending to sue says in the claim that the city’s hiring, training and supervision of Nash was inadequate and a proximate cause of her injuries. The city allowed Nash to use his power and police uniform to prey on women he encountered during the performance of his duties, according to the claim. The city has about two months to respond. Nash is in custody at the Spokane County Detention Center awaiting a mid-October sentencing for the rape convictions. Throughout his trial, Nash maintained his innocence. He was first charged in 2019 when a woman accused him of rape while investigating her case. Another woman in 2021 told police about a similar experience.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University is getting a $13.8 million funding boost from the state to help finish construction of a baseball stadium. Gov. Jim Justice announced the contribution Thursday from the state Water Development Authority’s Economic Enhancement Grant program. “This has been a long time coming, and I am so proud to play a small part in getting this project across the finish line,” Justice said. “They’ve been talking about building a baseball stadium since I was a brown-haired kid playing golf at Marshall back in the ’70s. Finally, it’s going to happen, and this community can get the monkey off its back.” Marshall has never had an on-campus baseball stadium. The new facility will be built across the street from Marshall’s football stadium. The stadium is expected to cost about $23 million. The city of Huntington and Marshall are contributing nearly $10 million, the governor’s office said in a statement. Construction is scheduled to begin this month, with a tentative completion date of March 2024.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Two lawsuits filed last week argue that election clerks should be allowed to accept absentee ballots that are missing portions of witness addresses – the next step in the ongoing legal battle that has pit conservatives against liberals in the battleground state. The lawsuits, filed three days apart on Tuesday and Friday, come after a judge in Waukesha County circuit court in September sided with Republicans and said election clerks are barred from filling in missing information on the form that serves as an envelope for absentee ballots. The judge struck down guidance issued by the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission, in place for six years, saying that clerks could fill in missing information. The judge agreed with Republicans that there is nothing in law allowing clerks to do that. The practice, known as ballot curing, was unchallenged until after Donald Trump’s narrow loss in 2020, when nearly 1.4 million voters cast absentee ballots, and COVID-19 vaccines weren’t available yet. Absent any guidance, there is confusion among election officials about how much of an address must be provided by the witness to allow for the ballot to be counted. Those with partial witness addresses should be accepted, not rejected, according to a lawsuit filed Friday by the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state doubled its wind-power generating capacity from 2019 to 2021 and is looking to add more wind farms in the next five years. The Casper Star Tribune reports researchers at the University of Wyoming say that boost in power generation is like adding another coal-fired power plant. The increase has pushed Wyoming’s wind-power generating capacity from about 1,600 to about 3,200 megawatts and from 17th to 14th in the nation in wind-power capacity. Enough future wind farms have been proposed to the Wyoming Industrial Siting Council to nearly triple the state’s wind-power capacity. The University of Wyoming report released in June sought to measure the economic impacts of wind projects in the state. It found that building another 6,000 megawatts of wind capacity would support close to 1,600 long-term jobs. It would also inject $1.2 billion into the state economy during construction and add another estimated $210 million annually. Researchers said that includes $89 million in government revenue. Additionally, if the turbines were built in Wyoming, the revenue produced in the state could be even more.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/04/03/broome-coronavirus-cases-updates-binghamton-southern-tier-ny/2940497001/", "title": "Broome coronavirus: Cases, updates for Binghamton, Southern Tier ...", "text": "Binghamton Press & Sun-Bulletin\n\nCoronavirus update:We've moved our daily COVID-19 to a new story.

Now, there are 13 positive cases, not including the two deaths. There have not yet been any recoveries yet.\n\nEight staff members have also tested positive for the virus.\n\nAll residents have been tested for COVID-19.\n\nIn an effort to curb the spread of the virus, the nursing home's negative pressure room will be doubled in size, Garnar said. This helps prevent airborne disease from the leaving room and is where residents who test positive for COVID-19 are being isolated. The room currently can hold 10 residents, but will be doubled in size.\n\nThe facility is also changing staff rotations so employees do not move between infected and not-infected areas. Since the COVID-19 crisis began, the nursing home was limiting visitors to only end of life residents and increased cleaning measures.\n\nBroome tries to cut spending\n\nIn an effort to cut spending and manage Broome County's budget, there are 56 county employees who are on voluntary furlough, Garnar said Monday.\n\nThe county has also enacted a hiring freeze, is not allowing staff to travel and have cut millions of dollars of capital projects slated to begin this year.\n\nCloth masks to be distributed to senior centers\n\nCloth masks will be distributed to area senior centers from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays, Garnar said Monday.\n\nThis is for Broome County residents who are ages 70 and older and do not already have masks.\n\nChenango Blues Festival canceled\n\nThe Chenango Blues Festival is among the Chenango Blues Association events that have been canceled this year.\n\n\"We agonized over this, and we held out as long as we could, but we have arrived at the conclusion that there is no responsible way to move forward with any of our planned events for 2020,\" the CBA wrote in a Facebook post Sunday. \"We are all as disappointed as we know you are, and it was difficult to contact all our artists and break the news.\"\n\nAll CBA summer events are canceled.

Andrew Cuomo's reopening plan Friday, which includes construction, manufacturing, wholesale supply chain, and select retail — mainly curbside pickup.\n\n\"That is extremely worrisome,\" Garnar said. \"We are going to have make some very tough decisions.\"\n\nBroome has a $15 million fund balance, Garnar said, and a stimulus package passed by the House of Representatives may offer some relief.\n\nBroome reports three additional coronavirus-related deaths\n\nBINGHAMTON - Broome County reported three additional coronavirus-related deaths Wednesday, bringing the total number of deaths to 28.\n\nBroome County Executive Jason Garnar said two men in their 80s and a woman in her 90s have died.\n\nTo date, 377 people have tested positive for COVID-19 in Broome County.

He cautioned that residents must continue to follow the state and CDC guidelines of social distancing and wearing masks in public.\n\nNew York has extended some executive orders due to the coronavirus in recent days, but still hasn't decided on how long it would extend the stay-at-home order, Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office said Saturday afternoon.\n\nInitially, two orders signed by Cuomo on Thursday and Friday seemed to indicate the governor had extended the order that limits New York's economy only to essential businesses from May 15 to June 6. And the governor's office initially confirmed the change to news outlets.\n\nBut Cuomo's office clarified later in the day that only certain orders pertaining to coronavirus, such as eviction protections, have been extended into June.\n\nThe \"New York State on Pause\" order is still set to expire May 15.\n\n\"NY ON PAUSE was not extended to June 6,\" Cuomo's secretary Melissa DeRosa said in a statement.\n\n\"Yesterday's Executive Order extended the underlying legal authority for the Emergency Order, but did not change the text of any of the directives in NY ON PAUSE and so the expiration date of May 15 still stands until further notice,\" she continued.\n\n\"At that time, new guidance will be issued for regions based on the metrics outlined by Governor Cuomo earlier this week.\"\n\nThe closure of businesses, regardless of the time frame set statewide, will remain unless regions of the state can meet seven criteria related to the coronavirus to reopen.\n\nEach area will need to meet seven benchmarks for the state to consider its reopening in four phases.\n\nIf those criteria are met, the state would issue an executive order allowing that region to start the reopening process, state officials said.\n\nThe criteria includes at least 14 days of decline in total net hospitalizations or under 15 new hospitalizations in a three-day average.\n\nA region would also have to show a decline in hospital deaths and new hospitalizations and ensure it keeps 30% of its total hospital capacity available for a possible spike in cases.\n\nIt would also have to document it has at least 90 days of personal protective equipment stockpiled and have the capacity to conduct 30 diagnostic tests per month for every 1,000 residents — which so far has been the most difficult obstacle to overcome.\n\nIf all the conditions are met, then the plan calls for four phases of a reopening among various sectors at two-week intervals:\n\nPhase 1: Construction, manufacturing; wholesale supply chain; and select retail, mainly curbside pickup\n\nConstruction, manufacturing; wholesale supply chain; and select retail, mainly curbside pickup Phase 2: Professional services; finance and insurance; retail; administrative support; real estate/rental leasing.\n\nProfessional services; finance and insurance; retail; administrative support; real estate/rental leasing. Phase 3: Restaurants/food services; hotels/accommodations.\n\nRestaurants/food services; hotels/accommodations. Phase 4: Arts/entertainment/recreation; education.\n\nSome upstate regions will be able to open before downstate ones because they have had few cases and deaths.\n\nThe Rochester-Finger Lakes region, as well as central New York, the Mohawk Valley, the Southern Tier and the North Country were the closest to meeting all the criteria, meeting five of the seven benchmarks.\n\nBut the Buffalo area, the Capital Region, the Hudson Valley, New York City and Long Island were all meeting fewer of the goals.\n\nThe number of deaths in New York reached 21,271 on Saturday, up 226 from the day before and by far the most in the nation. About 90% of the deaths have been in New York City and its suburbs.\n\nVestal Sam's Club employee tests positive for COVID-19\n\nVestal -An employee of Sam's Club in Vestal has tested positive for COVID-19, according to a statement released Friday by the Broome County Health Department.\n\nThe Broome County Health department said that if you were in the store at 2441 Vestal Pkwy E., on May 4, from 9 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., May 5 from 9 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. or May 7 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and develop symptoms of COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider.\n\nSymptoms of COVID-19 include cough, fever and shortness of breath.\n\nThe 14-day incubation period will be over on May 21.

The measures continue through May 1.\n\nParking fees are also waived at the city's Collier Street surface lot and the two parking garages on Water and State streets. Pre-paid monthly parking payment plans will receive an automatic one month extension at no cost, and the city will also temporarily suspend booting vehicles for unpaid parking tickets.\n\nBinghamton Mayor Richard David said parking tickets will still be issued for violations that affect road and pedestrian safety: parking in handicap spaces without a handicapped tag, blocking a fire hydrant, no-parking areas, official vehicles only and blocking driveways.\n\nThe suspended parking meter enforcement means on-street parking will temporarily be free, David said, and residents or visitors to the city will not have to use the parking kiosks during the time period.\n\nFor garbage disposal, city residents can use standard garbage bags instead of the required blue bags that are purchased. It's expected this will save residents about $130,000 total during the six-week suspension, David said.\n\nThe City of Binghamton’s 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew, implemented March 17, is still in effect.\n\nNo more visitors at Broome jail\n\nDICKINSON, NY - Visitation to the Broome County jail has been suspended until further notice, the sheriff's office announced Monday.\n\nAttorneys were asked to contact the jail's visitation office for assistance, if needed.\n\nThe sheriff's pistol permit office will close at 4 p.m. Monday until further notice.\n\nFree rides on BC Transit buses\n\nBINGHAMTON, NY - Broome County Transit began offering free rides to all passengers.\n\nThe following other changes with BC Transit were announced as part of Broome County's coronavirus response:\n\nNew partitioning added between interior seating and the drivers’ compartment to help with following social distancing guidelines.\n\nLimited seating per bus to reduce virus transmission.\n\nAll access to the buses will be through the rear doors, expect for people using wheelchairs or who have impaired mobility.\n\nIn addition to elevated daily cleaning and disinfecting, throughout the day, staff will spot disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as handrails, seat backs and doors.\n\nUHS, Lourdes hospital precautions\n\nBINGHAMTON, NY - Lourdes and UHS facilities are prohibiting all visitors except those related to beginning of life, end of life and pediatric care. Elective surgeries and other elective procedures will be limited and postponed, then reevaluated weekly.\n\nCOVID-19 testing will also be limited to only \"the most acutely ill patients,\" said Lourdes CEO Kathy Connerton, such as those with significant respiratory illness or serious preexisting conditions.\n\n\"Regardless of testing, the treatment is the same,\" Connerton said.\n\nUHS, Lourdes offers virtual COVID-19 screenings\n\nBINGHAMTON, NY - United Health Services and Ascension Lourdes have developed online COVID-19 screening to be accessed through their virtual walk-in centers.\n\nAt UHS, if the results of the questionnaire suggest further treatment, cost of a virtual visit with a healthcare provider is $39.

The statues of Anarcha, Lucy and Betsey – three of numerous Black women Dr. J. Marion Sims operated on while in Montgomery – were unveiled Friday, al.com reported. Entitled “Mothers of Gynecology,” the three statues stand almost 15 feet high and were welded from common metal items donated for the project, including tools, bicycle parts, and surgical and gynecological instruments, according to the news site. “The endeavor is to change the narrative as it relates to the history and how it’s portrayed regarding Sims and the women that were used as experiments,” said Michelle Browder, the artist who created the monument. “They’re not mentioned in any of the iconography or the information, the markers.” Sims is held up as a pioneer in the field of gynecology, credited with developing new medical devices and a surgical technique to treat a complication of childbirth. But he also conducted experimental surgery without anesthesia on enslaved African-American women between 1845 and 1849. Anesthesia was still new at the time – the first public demonstration, using ether was in Boston in 1846. A statue of Sims still stands at the State House in Montgomery.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Residents of Alaska’s largest city often contend with bears and moose, but state officials are warning of another wild animal that has been causing problems: river otters. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game said river otters have attacked people and pets in some of the city’s most popular outdoor areas, the Anchorage Daily News reported. Officials are asking people to be extra careful when they are around rivers, creeks and lakes along the city’s greenbelt. Earlier this month, a 9-year-old boy was taken to an emergency room for a rabies shot after being bitten several times near a duck pond. River otter attacks do happen, but are not considered commonplace, Fish and Game said. It’s not known if the attacks came from the same group of otters, which can range over large swaths of land. “Because of the risk to public safety, efforts will be made to locate this group of river otters and remove them,” Fish and Game said. “Care will be taken to only remove the animals exhibiting these unusual behaviors.”\n\nArizona\n\nTempe: A man who refused to wear a mask and was asked to leave during a performance at Arizona State University’s Gammage Auditorium has been arrested after he allegedly assaulted two staff members, according to campus police. Police said the man was asked to leave the venue during a performance of “Hamilton.” Witnesses said those who were attending Saturday’s show began cheering when the man was removed. Campus police said the man was being held on suspicion of assault, trespassing and disorderly conduct. Police said there were no reported injuries.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A Democrat running for attorney general in Arkansas, where health officials have struggled with resistance to the coronavirus vaccine, on Monday vowed if elected to take social media companies to court for spreading COVID-19 misinformation. Jesse Gibson focused on COVID-19 misinformation in his first 30-second ad, which he said began airing online and on cable stations over the weekend. “Big corporations and big tech are profiting off the very spread of misinformation that puts Arkansas families and communities at risk, hurts our small businesses, and costs our economy,” Gibson said in the ad. Gibson said he was concerned about misinformation about the vaccine’s effectiveness as well as ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug that health officials have warned against using as a COVID-19 treatment. He said he believed the social media companies could be targeted under the state’s deceptive trade practices and false advertising laws. Gibson’s proposal follows concerns raised by health officials about the spread of false information about the virus and vaccines. U.S. Surgeon General General Vivek Murthy earlier this year declared misinformation about vaccines a threat to public health.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Thousands of families sickened and forced from their Los Angeles homes after the nation’s largest-known natural gas leak have reached a settlement of up to $1.8 billion with a utility, attorneys said Monday. The settlement with Southern California Gas Co. and its parent company, Sempra Energy, will compensate 35,000 plaintiffs from the 2015 blowout that took nearly four months to control. The Aliso Canyon blowout led to the largest-known release of methane in U.S. history and was blamed for sickening thousands of residents who moved out of homes near the San Fernando Valley to escape a sulfurous stench and maladies including headaches, nausea and nose bleeds. The plaintiffs alleged personal injury for their illnesses and property damage to their homes. SoCalGas spent more than $1 billion on the blowout – with most going to temporarily relocate 8,000 families. The utility has faced more than 385 lawsuits on behalf of 48,000 people.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Kechter Road, which crosses Interstate 25 south of Harmony Road and connects Larimer County Road 5 to the west frontage road and into Fort Collins, will be fully closed starting Friday. The closure is part of the North I-25 Express Lanes project. Reopening is expected in May. Initially, the road was expected to close in September and reopen in April. Local traffic will be able to access Island Lake Marine & Sports on the west and Colorado Youth Outdoors on the east. Detours will be in place during the closure. Work includes the addition of a roundabout on the west side of I-25 at the intersection of Kechter Road and the west frontage road. In addition, the Kechter Bridge will be lengthened to accommodate the additional toll lanes below it for each direction of I-25. Kechter Road will remain as a single lane in both directions and include sidewalks, pedestrian crossings and bike lanes in both directions across the new bridge, which also will have its barriers on both sides heightened for safety purposes. I-25 will be raised in this area, and culverts will be added under the interstate to prevent flooding during a 100-year event. Upgrading this bridge was not in the original North I-25 Express Lanes project that started in 2018 but it was added last year when an additional $250 million was secured. That funding also allowed CDOT to completely reconfigure the U.S. Highway 34 and I-25 interchange.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A retired judge who also has served as a prosecutor and public defender was picked Monday to become Connecticut’s first inspector general, a position created to investigate any use of deadly force by police. Robert Devlin, 71, was chosen from among four finalists after interviews before the Connecticut Criminal Justice Commission. The commission voted 5-0 to appoint Devlin to the $180,000-a year position. Devlin told the commission that because of his age and experience, he would not be using the job as a steppingstone and plans to give everyone involved in each investigation “a fair shake.” “There are people in our society who think the police can do no wrong and there are people in our society who think the police can do no right,” Devlin told the commission. “It’s in that space in between that the inspector general has to work, and let the results speak for themselves.” Devlin, who was appointed as a Superior Court judge in 1992, served as the state’s chief administrative judge for that court from 2010 to 2017. He is the chairman of the Connecticut Sentencing Commission.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark:ChristianaCare has fired 150 employees for not complying with its COVID-19 vaccine requirement, the health system announced Monday. Dr. Janice Nevin, CEO of ChristianaCare, wrote in a blog post for the hospital’s website that the 150 people equated to roughly 90 full-time positions. Many of the terminated workers were “part-time or casual employees,” according to a hospital spokeswoman. Of the 90 full-time equivalents, 48 were jobs involving patient care and less than a dozen related to nursing. ChristianaCare, which is the largest private employer in Delaware, employs more than 14,000 people. In July, it announced that all employees would be required to receive the COVID-19 vaccine or be fired if they did not meet the requirements for an exemption. About 200 employees were given religious or medical accommodations, Nevin said. Those people will be required to undergo regular COVID-19 testing in addition to wearing a mask at work.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:An entire middle school at the Leckie Education Campus is in quarantine, WUSA-TV reported. Leckie, located on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SW in Ward 8, is a school that holds classes from kindergarten through eighth grade. The elementary classes are in the main building, but the middle school students attend classes in trailers behind the school. D.C. Public Schools reported an individual, who was last in the building on Sept. 16, tested positive for the coronavirus. A DCPS spokesperson said contact tracers deemed all 95 students in grades six through eight as close contacts of the individual. After students were sent home, a second person tested positive, so the quarantine was extended until Friday. DCPS said the students are home learning virtually.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: City of Miami commissioners held a special meeting in which they attacked the chief of police less than six months into his post, and voted to further investigate him and his appointment. Police chief Art Acevedo had been criticized after firing two high-level police officials and relieving of duty a sergeant-at-arms. Acevedo also angered Cuban exiles earlier this month when reports emerged of remarks made by him saying the “Cuban mafia” ran Miami. The Cuban-born chief apologized for the comments made to officers and said he didn’t know that was a term former Cuban leader Fidel Castro used to refer to exiles, arguing he was raised in California. Three of the five city commissioners are Cuban-American. On Friday, Acevedo sent an accusatory eight-page memo to the mayor and city manager saying those commissioners were hampering his efforts to reform the police department by eliminating positions and interfering with internal affairs investigations. Commissioners on Monday said these allegations would also be investigated by the committee they were forming. Acevedo, 57, came to Miami after serving more than four years as police chief in Houston, where he gained national prominence by calling for gun control, marching with protesters after George Floyd’s death and criticizing former President Donald Trump.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A herd of goats brought in to clear weeds got loose Monday, briefly becoming a thorn in the side of Atlanta’s tony Buckhead neighborhood. Atlanta police responded after a driver called to report the goats were wandering in the road, news outlets reported. They had been brought in to eat weeds at a nearby Kroger supermarket but got free, according to police. Television news footage showed them grazing outside a furniture store along a busy thoroughfare. They were caught and removed. Police said no one was injured.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Health officials said 23 Native Hawaiians died from COVID-19 last week, accounting for 20% of all fatalities among Hawaii’s Indigenous people since the start of the pandemic 18 months ago. Native Hawaiians made up 40% of all deaths in the state during the seven days through Friday, KITV reported. Hawaiians are one-fifth of the state’s population. “We’ve also seen a number of really, really tragic stories move very quickly throughout our community,” said Nā’ālehu Anthony, the director of COVID Pau, a collaborative of businesses and nonprofit organizations delivering public health messages during the pandemic. “And, you know, one death is too much. One person dying is too much when it’s preventable when you have the vaccine.” COVID-19 vaccination rates among Native Hawaiians have lagged in comparison to the rest of the state. To counter this, Anthony has started a series of public service announcements on the importance of inoculating Native Hawaiians. The advertisements also focus on the importance of testing, mask wearing and social distancing. Some of the ads that have resonated refer to past diseases that wiped out much of Hawaii’s native population in the 1800s.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: Cadaver dogs have found what are probably seven graves of mid-1880s migrants who died in south-central Idaho on the California Trail while crossing what is now the City of Rocks National Reserve. Experts with the Oregon-California Historic Trails and City of Rocks National Reserve identified two possible graves. The Post Register reported in a story last week that the cadaver dogs earlier this month confirmed the two sites as containing human remains and then found five more possible burial sites. “It wasn’t a surprise,” said Tara McClure-Cannon, assistant park manager at City of Rocks. “We had suspected some of these areas in the past based on what they looked like. The dogs were partly confirming our suspicions.” McClure-Cannon said the park has several options on how to handle the grave sites. It could bring in ground-penetrating radar to confirm they are graves containing bodies. In rare cases, potential graves are excavated. The locations of the potential grave sites will be marked with a GPS location, but not made public so they won’t be disturbed. About 200,000 migrants passed through the national reserve mainly heading to California on the California Trail that splits off of the nearby Oregon Trail, experts have said, adding that there are probably thousands of migrants buried along the California and Oregon trails.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: State officials are celebrating attendance at this year’s Illinois State Fair after it was canceled in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The state Department of Agriculture reported Tuesday that the Springfield-based festival in August attracted 472,390. Since 2014, when the agency started formally tracking attendance, that’s second only to the 508,900 who attended in 2019. Given the the turnstile count in 2019, State Fair Manager Kevin Gordon said “the bar was set pretty high” for attendance after a year’s layoff. “Being able to overcome the challenges brought on by the pandemic and safely bring back so many families to the fairgrounds is a great accomplishment,” Gordon said. Final numbers are not yet available, but officials are estimating revenue at $5 million, the ninth-highest in the past two decades. The 2022 Illinois State Fair is scheduled for Aug. 11-21.\n\nIndiana\n\nPortage: U.S. Steel temporarily shuttered operations at a northwest Indiana plant Monday after it leaked an orange substance into a Lake Michigan tributary, prompting the closure of a water treatment facility and several nearby beaches. The U.S. Steel Midwest plant in Portage was idled as a precaution “after experiencing an upset condition with the finishing line wastewater treatment plant,” U.S. Steel spokeswoman Amanda Malkowski said in a statement. “The plant operations will remain down until the condition is stabilized. This upset is currently believed to be the cause of the discolored water seen coming from one of our outfalls,” she said. Initial indications “show higher than normal suspended solids in the water” Malkowski said, adding that the the company is conducting additional sampling and working to determine the cause of the problem at the wastewater treatment facility. She did not describe the contents of the leaked substance. Portage Mayor Sue Lynch said she began receiving calls about 5:50 p.m. Sunday concerning an unknown substance pouring from a U.S. Steel Midwest plant outfall into the Burns Waterway that feeds into Lake Michigan. The plant is about 30 miles east of Chicago. Lynch told The (Northwest Indiana) Times she wasn’t sure what the substance could be, but that an employee from the Portage Marina had collected a sample for analysis. An Indiana Department of Environmental Management spokesman said Monday that the agency was investigating and would provide an update after it receives and analyzes sampling test results.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A federal judge on Monday extended a restraining order for 14 days that prohibits Iowa officials from enforcing a law that bans school districts from enacting mask mandates. The order issued by Judge Robert Pratt extends his initial order from Sept. 13 until Oct. 11, which means school districts might impose mask mandates and the state cannot stop them. Pratt concluded that enforcement of the law continues to pose a threat to the health of children. Documents filed in the case Monday claim that nearly a quarter of Iowa public school students are in districts that have experienced significant COVID-19 outbreaks this year. The information indicates 11 school districts, including Waterloo, Sioux City and Muscatine, reported more positive cases in the first month of the school year than during the entire previous year. The data was included in court documents made public Monday by attorneys for 11 parents and the disability rights group The Arc of Iowa who are suing the state. The documents said 16 other school districts, including Marshalltown, Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, have already recorded coronavirus cases equivalent to 50% of the tally for the last school year. The 27 school districts represent 24.5% of all Iowa public school students.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:The pastor of a Catholic parish in Topeka has been suspended from his public duties after being accused of sexually abusing a minor, the archdiocese for northeast Kansas announced Monday. The Rev. John Pilcher of Mater Dei parish denied the allegation and is fully cooperating, the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas said. He will remain on leave until an investigation is complete and an independent review board has made a recommendation to Archbishop Joseph Naumann, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported. The archdiocese said that law enforcement was notified and announcement about the allegation made at all weekend Masses. The parish includes two churches, Assumption across the street north of the Statehouse and Holy Name in central Topeka. They once were in separate parishes that merged in 2006. The archdiocese said anyone with knowledge about the case regarding Pilcher or about any other misconduct should contact civil authorities first, then make a report to its confidential report line.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A Kentucky safety and personal protective equipment developer is manufacturing a new respirator to help front-line health care workers during the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Demand for respirators skyrocketed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The machines provide clean, breathable air to workers treating patients with the virus. Cynthiana-based Bullard said the new respirator is designed to be more comfortable and make it easier for the workers to better communicate. The respirators were built with “all day use” in mind, to be worn around the shoulders instead of the waist, said Landon Borders, Bullard’s director of product development.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Deer hunters across Louisiana can qualify for a $1,000 drawing by having the head of a mature white-tailed buck tested for a slow but always fatal illness called chronic wasting disease. Taxidermists in the state can do the same for a chance in a $500 drawing – with permission from the hunter who harvested the buck, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries said in a news release. Chronic wasting disease is always fatal in deer, elk or moose, but it can take 16 months to four years for the first symptoms to show up. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said scientists don’t know whether it can infect people, but the agency recommended against eating venison from infected animals. The disease has not yet been found in Louisiana. But all three neighboring states – Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi – are among at least 26 where it has been found. The department wants to test deer taken statewide during Louisiana’s 2021-22 hunting seasons. The tests are free until a region meets its testing quota, said Dr. James LaCour, the state veterinarian. Heads – with or without antlers and skull cap, but with at least 5 inches of neck – can be brought to regional department offices in Hammond, Lafayette, Lake Charles, Minden, Monroe and Pineville, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.\n\nMaine\n\nFrenchboro: Regulators in Maine said they found no permit violations stemming from thousands of fish deaths at an aquaculture operation off the state’s coast. Cooke Aquaculture, a Canada-based fish farming giant, operates salmon farms that include ocean-based pens in Maine. The firm found thousands of fish deaths in August at sites it operates at Black Island and Black Island South. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection said the company reported more than 100,000 fish deaths between the sites. The company also told the state that it removed and disposed of the fish and cleaned equipment at the sites. The Maine DEP said on Monday that it inspected the sites in late August. The agency said it did not “identify any permit violations or violations of the Clean Water Act in relation to the reported fish kill.” Maine DEP said its investigation into the fish deaths is closed.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown:Renovation of the Nicodemus Building, which is being turned into housing for students attending classes at the University System of Maryland at Hagerstown, is progressing, according to Patrick Grace, owner of Trademark Investments, which purchased the former house and motel for $1,000 through the city’s competitive negotiated sale program. The program helps put city-owned properties into the private sector for redevelopment. The city council approved the sale in November. “We’re excited now,” Grace said. “There’s a lot of preplanning at the beginning, where things don’t move quickly. Now we’re in that phase where we’re moving really quickly, and it’s exciting to see how the units are going to shape up.” Grace said he hopes the work will be finished by January. Construction is happening from top to bottom at the building, which has a basement under three stories. The largest apartment is in the basement. The smallest is on the top floor. Historic features, such as a stairway, fireplaces and ornate trim work, are being preserved throughout.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The guitar played by Johnny Ramone on all 15 Ramones albums and at nearly 2,000 live performances by the rock band sold at auction over the weekend for more than $900,000, the auctioneer said Monday. The 1965 Mosrite Ventures II electric guitar was bought by a collector in the U.S. who wished to remain anonymous, Boston-based RR Auction said in a statement. Ramone, whose real name was John Cummings, bought the guitar to replace his original blue Ventures II, which was stolen, according to RR Auction. It was played at every Ramones performance from November 1977 until his retirement in August 1996, RR said. He died in 2004. The guitar, along with other Ramones memorabilia, came from the collection of Daniel Rey, a musician and producer who was also a longtime Ramones collaborator. Some of the other items sold included Johnny Ramone’s Mark-2 signature guitar for almost $50,000, and Joey Ramone’s Shure microphones from the final Ramones concert for more than $13,000. The auction began Aug. 24 and concluded Saturday.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Detroit Institute of Arts soon will be welcoming school field trips for the first time since the pandemic began in March 2020. Admission and bus transportation is free for all K-12 schools in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties. The Institute of Arts is supported by a property tax in the counties. School groups can sign up starting Oct. 12. Before the pandemic, more than 90,000 students a year visited the art museum on field trips. “It is hard to imagine that it has been 19 months since we’ve last heard the sounds of students and teachers exploring the galleries,” said Jason Gillespie, director of education programs. Masks are required. Lunch or snack space cannot be provided.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state is on the verge of selling a refrigerated warehouse that it bought in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in case it was needed as backup morgue. When the administration of Gov. Tim Walz announced the purchase of the former Bix produce building in St. Paul, it expressed worries, based on the experiences of New York City, that the state’s mortuaries could be swamped with pandemic victims. The state paid nearly $5.48 million for the facility, which could have held 5,100 bodies, but never stored corpses there, just personal protective equipment. Now, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported, the St. Paul Port Authority board is preparing to vote Tuesday on whether to take the warehouse off the state’s hands for $5.65 million, the property’s current appraised value, giving the state a slight profit. The Port Authority’s goal, according to board documents, is to flip the building as quickly as possible, with a goal of selling it by Dec. 1. “The idea is to find a buyer who will bring jobs to the city of St. Paul,” Andrea Novak, a Port Authority marketing manager, told the newspaper. “There is no specific buyer in the wings. We will market this aggressively.” The Democratic governor had come under criticism for the buying the facility from Republicans who saw it as wasteful spending.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state intends to appeal a federal judge’s ruling that it come up with a plan detailing how it will work to prevent unnecessary institutionalization of people with mental illness. Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves told the state it had 120 days to submit a plan to the U.S. Justice Department and a mental health expert. He ordered that the final plan, incorporating their feedback, be completed in 180 days. Attorneys for the state asked in court documents filed Monday if the deadline could be postponed because the state intends to appeal Reeves’ ruling. James Shelson, the state’s attorney, wrote that if the Department of Mental Health were required to complete its plan and other requirements of Reeves’ order in the allocated time frame, “Mississippi will suffer irreparable injuries from undue interference with its mental health system and a fundamental alteration of that system both in costs and structure.”\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The Missouri Department of Conservation plans to test hundreds of deer for COVID-19 this hunting season following a recent federal report. The U.S Department of Agriculture reported the results of a federal study testing white-tailed deer in Illinois, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania. Samples showed at least 7% of the population having antibodies for the virus that causes COVID-19. The highest population showed a whopping 67% in Michigan. The USDA report showed that although deer were carrying the antibodies, none actually fell ill. There is no evidence of deer dying or humans contracting the coronavirus from eating venison. “We want to be proactive,” said Jasmine Batten, wildlife health program supervisor for the Missouri Department of Conservation. “We’re paying attention to other states, and this is the first step to see what’s going on in our state.” Batten emphasized that the testing plan is still in the preliminary stage, the Columbia Missourian reported. As of now, the plan is to test the deer that will be killed this hunting season. Deer hunting season has begun for archery, and begins Oct. 30 for youth hunters and Nov. 13 for adult hunters with firearms.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Three gray wolves from a large pack in Yellowstone National Park that’s popular among tourists have been killed by Montana hunters, park officials said Monday. The two female pups and a female yearling from the Junction Butte pack were killed outside the park’s northern boundary in the first week after wolf season opened earlier this month, park officials said. The deaths follow the recent end to longstanding restrictions on how many wolves can be killed in areas of Montana bordering the park. That came after Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed laws intended to make it easier to kill wolves as a way to reduce their attacks on livestock and big game herds. Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly said the park is trying to convince Montana officials to reinstate wolf hunting and trapping quotas across the park to protect its wolves. Idaho, which borders Yellowstone to the west, also has lifted wolf hunting restrictions.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: An Omaha woman has been charged with felony counts after dozens of dead animals were found in her home rendered uninhabitable by filth, waste and rotting animal carcasses. The Nebraska Humane Society said in a court affidavit that the discovery was made last month in the home of 47-year-old Jaime Kimbrough. In a seven-page affidavit, a Humane Society officer detailed visits to Kimbrough’s home over several days in August following a complaint about rabbit hording. Various officers described speaking with Kimbrough, whom they described as physically disabled and said she crawled out of the house on her belly and appeared to have feces smeared on her clothing and bare feet. She denied having any rabbits and falsely told officers that her two dogs had been vaccinated, according to the affidavit. On Aug. 19, a Humane Society team executed a search warrant at the home and found the carcasses of at least 43 dead rabbits – most of them in Kimbrough’s garage – and two bird skeletons in cages in a bedroom. Two dogs and eight rabbits were found alive but suffering from neglect. Two of the rabbits had to be euthanized. Kimbrough’s attorney, Kaz Long, questioned why the situation was being handled as a criminal rather than civil matter. “My client was doing her best with her limited ability,” Long said. “This is a woman who needs help.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Mayor Carolyn Goodman and the head of the Nevada state Republican party are pitching the idea of the city playing host to the GOP National Convention ahead of the November 2024 presidential election. Goodman on Monday issued a statement saying she told the Republican National Committee in response to an inquiry that Las Vegas would be the best place for the three-day event in the summer of 2024. State Republican party Chairman Michael McDonald followed with a statement of support, calling the convention “a huge opportunity for our city and state to bring business back to the convention capital of the world.” The Republican National Committee did not immediately respond to an email asking how many cities were invited to bid to host the convention. Goodman, now in her third term as mayor, succeeded her husband, Oscar, after he served three terms in the nonpartisan office. She also is a member of the powerful regional tourism board, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. The mayor said formal bids to host the convention are due to the Republican National Committee by Dec. 1.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The newest addition to the New Hampshire Fallen Firefighters Memorial marks the first time the state is recognizing a death caused by occupational cancer. Newington Fire Chief Darin Sabine died of cancer in 2019. His name was one of four added to the state’s memorial to fallen firefighters in Concord on Saturday. Sabine’s wife, Jennifer, told WMUR-TV that the honor was a step in the right direction. Also honored were Dover Chief James Smith, who died in 1925 while investigating a gas leak; Dover Lt. Earnest Leblanc, who died while fighting a fire in 1959; and Goffstown Cpt. Steve Tower, who died in 2020 during a training test. With the new additions, the memorial now includes 95 names.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nDeal: A Jersey Shore town with a long history of trying to discourage outsiders from using its beaches is about to get millions of dollars worth of new sand, paid for by federal and New Jersey taxpayers. U.S. Rep Frank Pallone Jr., a Democrat, said Monday the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will conduct beach replenishment in three towns in November, including Deal. The federal government is paying 65%, or $17 million, of the $26 million project. Beach access advocates said Deal has one of the worst records of any Jersey Shore town when it comes to requirements that the state’s beaches be open and accessible to all. And there is an explicit requirement that towns that accept publicly paid-for sand as part of beach replenishment comply with public beach access rules, including providing adequate public parking within a reasonable distance. Deal has tried numerous times to enact laws that would allow only residents of some streets closest to the beach to park there during the summer, and it is being sued by a coastal advocacy group fighting its sale to a neighboring homeowner of a street end used by surfers and others to get onto the beach. As recently as June, Deal, located just north of Asbury Park, tried to enact an ordinance that would limit parking on several streets nearest the beach to residents only, but then backed off. That is one of several times it has proposed such a law only to abandon the effort.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The city’s struggle with violent crime and escalating homelessness took center stage Monday as the three candidates running for mayor in New Mexico’s largest city faced off during a forum sponsored by the New Mexico Black Voters Collaborative. Crime has been among the top issues for voters as the city deals with record homicides this year. Incumbent Tim Keller, a Democrat, has been facing heat for not being able to contain the problem during his tenure. Keller tried to defend his record during the forum, saying his administration is addressing the root causes – addiction and poverty – through community policing efforts, a new public safety office and other initiatives. He said the Albuquerque police force is adequately funded and that more money needs to be spent on social workers and support programs. He also took swipes at Bernalillo County Sheriff Manny Gonzales, saying that crime was his problem too. Gonzales, a Democrat, accused Keller of politicizing law enforcement and not supporting the city’s officers. He described the city at “a crossroads of total anarchy,” where people no longer feel safe and families are choosing to move away. Republican candidate Eddy Aragon, a radio station owner and talk show host, said the city is in crisis. “We need to do what we can to go ahead and turn this city around,” he said, pointing to growing economic insecurity, drug addiction and mental health issues.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The nation’s largest school district can immediately impose a vaccine mandate on its teachers and other workers, a federal appeals panel decided Monday, leading attorneys for teachers to say they will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. The city’s Department of Education said the mandate would now go into effect at the end of Friday, so that all teachers and staff would be vaccinated by Oct. 4, the following Monday. The three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan issued a brief order late in the day that lifted a block of the mandate that a single appeals judge had put in place on Friday. After an adverse ruling from a Brooklyn judge, a group of teachers had brought the case to the appeals court, which assigned a three-judge panel to hear oral arguments Wednesday. But the appeals panel issued its order Monday after written arguments were submitted by both sides. Attorney Mark Fonte, who brought the lawsuit on behalf of teachers and others, said in a statement that he and attorney Louis Gelormino were immediately petitioning the Supreme Court to intervene.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: Novant Health said Monday that more than 175 of its workers have been fired for failing to comply with its COVID-19 vaccination requirement. Last week, Novant Health announced 375 employees had been suspended and given five days to comply with the mandate. The deadline was Friday. Nearly 200 of those employees came into compliance, Spokesperson Megan Rivers said in an email Monday. Rivers didn’t provide specific numbers on how many out of the 375 were in compliance and how many lost their jobs. More than 99% of Novant Health’s 35,000-plus employees are now compliant with the vaccine mandate, including employees who have submitted an approved religious or medical vaccine exemption, according to a statement. The Winston-Salem-based system includes 15 hospitals, 800 clinics and hundreds of outpatient facilities.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: An explosion and fire has caused significant damage to a house in Minot, but no one has been injured, according to fire officials. Firefighters were dispatched to a home in southwest Minot about 1:30 a.m. Monday. Fire engulfed the rear of the house with flames spreading toward adjacent structures. Crews began search and rescue operations on all three floors of the house until they could account for all occupants. No one was injured. The cause of the explosion and fire is under investigation.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The newly drawn legislative district maps in Ohio were contested for the third time Monday, when state and national civic groups filed suit alleging the Republican-controlled redistricting process violated voters’ rights. The newest lawsuit, filed in the Ohio Supreme Court by three advocacy organizations and six individual Ohioans, seeks to block the maps of Ohio House and Senate districts passed Sept. 16 along party lines by the GOP-dominated Ohio Redistricting Commission and require the commission to draw new districts. The litigation follows in line with legal action taken by the National Democratic Redistricting Committee’s legal arm and the ACLU on behalf of the League of Women Voters, A. Philip Randolph Institute and individual voters, each alleging the maps violate Ohio’s constitution. In addition to Talley, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit include five individual voters, as well as the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Ohio, Ohio Organizing Collaborative and the Ohio Environmental Council. The plaintiffs are represented by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law and law firm Reed Smith. Republican Senate President Matt Huffman, who led the map-making effort, has defended the maps as fair and constitutionally compliant – criticizing Democrats and special interest groups for thwarting a bipartisan deal. John Fortney, a spokesman for Huffman, called the latest legal challenge an example of “another elitist D.C. think tank representing more far left groups attempts to lecture Ohioans about the liberal definition of fairness.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:The Goodholm Mansion, moved twice since it was constructed in 1901, was torn down over the weekend after sitting unoccupied for a dozen years in a field in eastern Oklahoma County. The mansion was one of the oldest surviving homes originally built in Oklahoma City and predated construction of the Harn home at the Harn Homestead and the Overholser Mansion in Heritage Hills. The owner, Christina Puckett, said her family tried for years to sell the home after her father, Richard Harris, bought it and moved it to Nicoma Park and died soon after. The home was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places and was historic for its architecture, age and original owner. The home marked the rise of Andrew Goodholm into the ranks of city fathers who shaped the prairie town into a city. Goodholm was born in Filipstad, Sweden, in 1861 and immigrated to Kansas in the 1880s. He moved to Oklahoma City in 1894 and opened Acme Milling Co., which quickly became the city’s largest flour mill. Construction on the home began in 1899 and was completed in 1901. The home was unique for central Oklahoma, featuring a Queen Anne Victorian styling topped with a round turret with a conical roof. The top floor included a ballroom. Around the outside a veranda, which included a “courting swing,” circled half the house.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: State Treasurer Tobias Read on Monday launched his campaign for governor. The Beaverton Democrat said he would focus on Oregon’s children as governor, making Pre-K more accessible, extending the school year, expanding career and technical training and investing in clean energy to fight climate change. The Statesman Journal reports Read was elected as Oregon’s treasurer in 2016 and re-elected to a second term in November 2020. Before that, he represented Beaverton in the Oregon House of Representatives for a decade. Read joins an expanding Democratic primary field. Five candidates have officially filed to run for governor, not including House Speaker Tina Kotek of Portland, who has also announced her intention to run. The Democratic field is crowded in part because Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, is unable to run again because of term limits.Four Republicans are also officially running for the office. A Republican hasn’t served as governor of Oregon since Vic Atiyeh left in 1987.The deadline to file with the secretary of state is March 8.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: William Hite Jr., the superintendent of the Philadelphia School District, said he will be leaving the post next summer. Hite said in a video released to staff that “after much reflection” he had decided not to seek renewal of his contract when it expires in August 2022. He said leading the district of 120,000 students in more than 200 schools had been a “tremendous honor and privilege” and vowed to support the board in its search for a new superintendent. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Hite said in an email to staff Monday night that he wanted to share the news now to allow “a full and complete search process for the next leader of the district, but I want to assure you all that I’m not going anywhere before August 2022.” The next year, he said, would see several critical initiatives focusing on equity, facilities planning, and environmental improvements. Hite was hired in June 2012 to take over a district in financial trouble and the following year recommended closing 37 schools, 23 of which were shut. He presided over the end of the 17-year state takeover and his contract was renewed in 2015.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence:A judge on Tuesday dismissed a legal challenge by firefighters to block a state requirement for health care workers to get a coronavirus vaccine by Oct. 1 or risk losing their licenses. The Rhode Island Association of Firefighters argued that the state Department of Health’s mandate violated state law that requires the negotiation of terms and conditions of employment, and violated the firefighters’ collective bargaining rights, The Providence Journal reported. They sought an injunction barring enforcement of the rule. The health care worker vaccine mandate applies to emergency medical technicians, and many firefighters are EMTs licensed through the health department. “In short, the court does not believe this regulation imposes a new working condition,” Judge Melissa Darigan wrote in her decision. An email seeking comment was left with the union.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Dylann Roof has lost the next phase of his appeal, with a federal court turning down his request for a new hearing to challenge his death sentence and conviction in the 2015 slayings of nine members of a Black congregation. In an order issued Monday, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that it was denying Roof’s request for a hearing before a full appellate court, as well as his petition that a court of substitute judges from other circuits be designated to consider his case. All of the judges from the 4th Circuit, which covers South Carolina, have recused themselves from hearing Roof’s case, thus adding an uncommon wrinkle to the flow his appeals process. One of their own, Judge Jay Richardson, prosecuted Roof’s case as an assistant U.S. attorney. Richardson led the case against Roof in 2017, when he became the first person in the U.S. sentenced to death for a federal hate crime. Authorities have said Roof opened fire during the closing prayer of a Bible study at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. He was 21 at the time.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux City:Sioux Area Metro continues to face a driver shortage affecting the city's bus service, officials said at a meeting of the Public Transit Advisory Board. All fixed routes have been moved to hourly service from the downtown bus depot since Aug. 16, except for Route 11, which continues half-hour service from the Southwest Transfer Facility. Night service remains unchanged, and Saturday service is operating through SAM On Demand. Robert Speeks, Sioux Area Metro's general manager, said they're at 32 fixed-route drivers, although three of them are out on medical leave. Another three drivers have been newly hired, bringing them to a total of 35. However, Speeks said, they will need between 36 and 38 drivers for full service, and although they have applicants, it takes time to train them and get them driving full shifts. Speeks said that when the service reduction began, they saw a slight drop in ridership that has slowly increased toward normal levels.\n\nTennessee\n\nJamestown: A nonprofit organization and two state agencies have expanded protection of conserved property in the Cumberland Plateau by more than 11,700 acres. The Conservation Fund, the Tennessee Department of Agriculture Division of Forestry and the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency announced the expansion, completing an effort to conserve more than 14,700 acres in the plateau. The new property is adjacent to the state’s Skinner Mountain Wildlife Management Area and will remain privately owned, the parties said in a news release. The addition will expand recreational access at Skinner Mountain WMA, protect vulnerable wildlife habitat and support local timber jobs, the release said. The area contains gorges, cliffs and waterfalls near the East Fork Obey River and provides habitat for endangered and threatened species of mussels, migratory songbirds and plants, the release said. The expansion fully conserves more than 50 caves, including the state’s fifth longest. The caves provide winter habitat for Tennessee’s most endangered mammal, the Indiana bat, and six additional species of concern, the release said.\n\nTexas\n\nSmithville:A Union Pacific train with hazardous cargo derailed at Texas 95 and Martin Luther King Boulevard in Smithville at 5 a.m. Sunday, leading to road closures and the evacuation of 20 to 25 nearby homes. No injuries were reported and the city posted updates throughout the day on its Facebook page. The city said just before 2 p.m. that residents were allowed to return to their homes. The tanker cars were empty but some contained residual hydrochloric acid that leaked, according to the city. The Union Pacific HazMat team decontaminated the scene and air samples were taken of the evacuation zone to confirm that it was safe for people to return to their homes. Sgt. Matthew Henderson with the Smithville Police Department said that the leaking tank was patched and treated with a neutralizing chemical that was then vacuumed out of the tank and transported off site. The cause of the derailment has not yet been made public, Henderson said, but federal investigators, as well as investigators from Union Pacific, were on the scene Sunday.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: Lawmakers are considering a crackdown on catalytic converter theft, in which criminals saw the emission control devices from cars and sell the precious metals found inside to a booming worldwide black market. State Rep. Ryan Wilcox, a Republican who represents House District 7, covering North Ogden, Pleasant View and a part of Ogden, is sponsoring a bill to create a statewide database of catalytic converter sales, the Standard-Examiner reported. “We want to force the (illegal) sales out of the legitimate areas, to lock down the legitimate ways to dispose of them,” Wilcox said. The usual proper channel is through metal recycling yards.” Candace Daly, a Utah recycling industry representative who testified last week at a hearing on the bill before the Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Interim Committee, said the going rate per ounce for rhodium this week was $9,950. Palladium is worth $1,967 per ounce, and platinum is $928, she said, listing three metals commonly found in catalytic converters. Thieves might try to sell stolen converters to recyclers and sometimes are successful because tracking and enforcement is lacking, hence the need for a database, said Chris Walden, a Utah Attorney General’s Office supervisory special agent.\n\nVermont\n\nMiddlebury: Middlebury College removed the name of former Vermont governor John Mead from the campus chapel on Monday because of his “instigating role” in eugenics policies of the early 1900s that “sought to isolate and prevent the procreation of so-called ‘delinquents, dependents, and defectives,’ ” the school announced. The move follows the Legislature’s apology last spring to all Vermonters and their families and descendants who were harmed by state-sanctioned eugenics policies and practices that led to sterilizations. Some Vermonters of mixed French Canadian and Native American heritage, as well as poor, rural white people, were placed on a state-sanctioned list of “mental defectives” and degenerates and sent to state institutions. Mead, a physician and industrialist who graduated from Middlebury in 1864, served as Vermont governor from 1910 to 1912, the school said. The college’s Mead Memorial Chapel was named after him and his wife when they gave $74,000 to the school in 1914 to create a new, prominent chapel on the highest point on campus, Middlebury President Laurie Patton and Trustees Chair George Lee said in email to the school community. Two years before that, Mead had strongly urged the legislature to adopt policies and create legislation premised on eugenics theory, they said.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: Some Democrats on a bipartisan redistricting commission said that new legislative districts will be fair only if they reflect the partisan success Democrats have had in the state for the past decade. The remarks came after Democratic and Republican map drawers for the first time submitted a joint map with proposed new boundaries for the 40-member state Senate, where Democrats hold a narrow 21-19 majority. The newly proposed map provides an even 20-20 split in terms of which party holds an advantage, using the vote in the 2016 presidential election as a guide. Although an even split sounds fair on the surface, Democrats on the commission said that would dilute Democratic influence, given that Democrats have won every statewide election since 2009. Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, said Democrats should hold an advantage in at least 22 districts, maybe more, to fairly respect the state’s Democratic tilt.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Landlords must soon provide six months’ notice of rent hikes and, in some cases, pay tenants who move following a large rent increase. The Seattle City Council approved two bills on Monday. They are the latest of new landlord-tenant regulations including bans on some evictions and the right to a lawyer for low-income tenants facing eviction, The Seattle Times reported. Councilmember Kshama Sawant sponsored the proposals, saying they will help “to mitigate the harm that is going to be experienced by renters because of skyrocketing rents.” Property owners argued the measures could push small-scale operators to sell their rentals. The council approved a bill requiring 180 days’ notice of rent increases with a 7-1 vote. Landlords are currently required to give 60 days’ notice for rent increases. Councilmember Alex Pedersen voted no, saying the bill should exempt landlords with a small number of properties. Councilmember Debora Juarez was absent.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Fall fire season gets underway this week in West Virginia, with limits set on outdoor burning through the end of the year. Starting Friday, burning vegetation and other naturally occurring material is limited to the hours of 5 p.m. to 7 a.m., the Division of Forestry said. A 10-foot safety area around the fire must be cleared to dirt level. Fires must be attended at all times, and open fires must be 50 feet away from structures, the division said. Violation of burning laws can result in a fine of up to $1,000. Commercial burning permits from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. are available from local Division of Forestry offices.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State Senate Republicans confirmed four of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ Cabinet appointments Tuesday after letting them languish for months but took no action on a key pick that would give the governor control of wildlife and pollution policies. The Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm Craig Thompson and Randy Romanski as transportation and agriculture secretaries; Missy Hughes as secretary of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp.; and Dawn Crim as secretary of the Department of Safety and Professional Services. The Senate also confirmed about 30 other appointments to various boards, commissions and committees, including Daniel Carlton Jr. as administrator of the Wisconsin Ethics Commission and Joaquin Altoro as executive director of the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority. Not on Tuesday’s docket was Sandra Naas, Evers’ choice to replace Natural Resources Board Chairman Fred Prehn. His term expired in May, prompting Evers to appoint Naas to fill his slot. The move would give Evers appointees majority control of the body that regulates hunting, pollution and other environmental policies. But Prehn, who was appointed by then-Republican Gov. Scott Walker, has refused to step down. He points to a 1964 state Supreme Court ruling that gubernatorial appointees don’t have to leave their posts until their replacements are confirmed.\n\nWyoming\n\nWilson: Republican U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, Wyoming’s lone House member, will be the featured speaker at a New Hampshire fundraising event celebrating the First Amendment. Cheney, a fierce critic of fellow Republican Donald Trump, will speak at the Nackey S. Loeb School of Communications’ First Amendment Awards on Nov. 9 at St. Anselm College’s Institute of Politics in Manchester.Cheney, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, was an ascendant Republican leader before the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol but has become increasingly defined by her public opposition to Trump and his hold on the GOP. She is serving as vice chair of the nine-person committee investigating the riot.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/12/28/sandhill-cranes-black-footed-ferrets-washington-crossing-delaware-news-around-states/115226628/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: In-person help for residents needing assistance with unemployment claims is coming to an end as a new phone appointment system will be established for the new year. The Department of Labor said it is ending in-person service at the Crump Senior Center because of health and safety concerns related to the coronavirus. The last dates for such service will be Monday and Tuesday. Appointments for those days will be available on the ADOL website www.labor.alabama.gov. Claimants can call (800) 361-4524 beginning Sunday after 5 p.m. until midnight on Sundays through Thursday to schedule a call-back for the next day to set up an appointment. Claimants are encouraged to keep their phones near them for their scheduled call-back, the department said. The calls will come from a Montgomery number. State officials have struggled to keep pace with a staggering number of unemployment claims spurred by the pandemic.\n\nAlaska\n\nHomer: A remote village has received its first delivery of the coronavirus vaccine by boat after it traveled through choppy waters during a storm that prevented air travel. The journey allowed first responders in the village of Seldovia (population 430) to receive the Pfizer vaccine for the virus, The Homer News reported. Usually, nurses and nurse practitioners from the SVT Health & Wellness Center in Homer travel weekly by air to Seldovia to help with health care in the village. But on Dec. 17, poor visibility meant a small boat was needed to transfer a crew of four medical personnel and the vaccines to the village about 250 miles south of Anchorage. Capt. Curtis Jackson, owner and operator of the boat, said conditions were rough with up to 4-foot waves and “pretty poor” visibility. The crew, which included a nurse, two nurse practitioners and a medical assistant, traveled for about an hour across Kachemak Bay, usually a 30-minute trip, said Jackson, a captain for Mako’s Water Taxi. “That little blue box was the best Christmas present a tired boat captain could ask for, my friends,” Jackson said in a post on Facebook. “This might be the start of what’s getting to be better and better news. It’s pretty emotional.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Arizona residents should show empathy and kindness to help ease each other’s burdens in the face of the pandemic and other troubles, the state’s top education official said. Economic and social hardships encountered by many people in 2020 left them exhausted, isolated and frustrated, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman wrote in a commentary published Saturday by the Arizona Republic. “Act as if the person you are speaking with just lost a job, a home, a loved one, a future. Act as if they are scared, or lonely, or tired to their bones,” Hoffman wrote. In education, teachers faced challenges getting the internet to work for their students and their own children, and school board members were worn down by painful decisions amid concerns about the well-being of students, Hoffman wrote. Meanwhile, she wrote, Arizona’s pandemic death toll has topped 8,000 people. “Each loss represents a valued member of our communities, and in some cases, our schools,” she wrote. Hoffman shared that the pandemic has affected her personal life, including when COVID-19 mitigation strategies meant she couldn’t be with her father when he was hospitalized for acute heart failure and then had a successful heart transplant. Also because of virus mitigation measures, her husband couldn’t be at her side when she heard that news, “I became one of the many Americans who learned to cope with loss in isolation, sharing our heartbreak over text messages and calls instead,” she said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Coronavirus hospitalizations in Arkansas fell Saturday but remained near their recent record high as state health officials reported more than 700 news cases and three more deaths linked to the disease. The Department of Health said there were 1,059 Arkansas residents hospitalized Saturday, a drop of three from the day before. The state record was set Wednesday, when there were 1,110 patients hospitalized with the disease. There were 660 newly confirmed coronavirus cases and 42 more probable cases Saturday, according to the department. Health officials have warned holiday gatherings and travel are likely to further spread the virus. Over the last seven days, more than 18% of coronavirus tests in Arkansas have come back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Health inspectors and authorities stepped up enforcement at restaurants and shopping malls over the post-Christmas weekend as they seek to curb a coronavirus surge that has filled some hospitals in California well beyond normal capacity. Crowding at Los Angeles County shopping malls came under scrutiny before the holiday. Several of them were cited and fined up to $500 for violating COVID-19 measures, which could include not keeping occupancy below 20% capacity and not prohibiting eating and drinking, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday. Health officials were waiting to see whether people followed their pleas and avoided Christmas and New Year’s festivities that could lead to a new round of infections and threaten to extend stay-at-home orders in several regions of the state. Beverly Hills police halted a plan for a secret New Year’s Eve dinner at La Scala after the Italian restaurant circulated invitations to a “discreet” meal that would violate the county’s ban on indoor dining. In Sonoma County in California’s wine country, a Native American casino announced it was canceling a planned private New Year’s Eve indoor event that could have drawn as many as 4,000 people. The Graton Resort and Casino is on sovereign native land that isn’t subject to state or county health orders, but it had come under scrutiny for the event.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: About 120 black-footed ferrets, among the most endangered mammals in North America, were injected with an experimental coronavirus vaccine aimed at protecting the small, weasel-like creatures rescued from the brink of extinction four decades ago. The effort came months before U.S. Department of Agriculture officials began accepting applications from veterinary drug makers for a commercial vaccine for minks, a close cousin of the ferrets. Farmed minks, raised for their valuable fur, have died by the tens of thousands in the U.S. and been culled by the millions in Europe after catching the coronavirus from infected humans. Vaccinating such vulnerable species against the disease is important not only for the animals’ sake, experts said, but potentially for the protection of people. Some of the most pernicious human diseases have originated in animals, including the new coronavirus, which is believed to have spread from bats to an intermediary species before jumping to humans and sparking the pandemic. For the newly vaccinated ferrets, the main risk is to the animals themselves. They’re part of a captive population at the National Black-footed Ferret Conservation Center outside Fort Collins, where there have been no cases of COVID-19 to date. But the slender, furry creatures – known for their distinctive black eye mask, legs and feet – are feared to be highly vulnerable to the ravages of the disease, said Tonie Rocke, a research scientist at the National Wildlife Health Center who is testing the ferret vaccine. They’re all genetically similar, having come from a narrow breeding pool, which weakens their immune systems. And they likely share many of the features that have made the disease so deadly to minks. “We don’t have direct evidence that black-footed ferrets are susceptible to COVID-19, but given their close relationship to minks, we wouldn’t want to find out,” Rocke said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Residents, businesses and landlords are getting a three-month grace period on taxes because of the COVID-19 pandemic – but how much they will end up paying will depend on where they live. In some towns, the tax deferment will be interest-free and in others it will come with a lowered interest rate. Whether taxpayers need to apply for the deferment also varies from town to town, the Hartford Courant reported. The tax deferments apply to real estate, motor vehicle and personal property taxes. Gov. Ned Lamont signed an executive order in the spring instructing towns to defer July tax payments for three months at zero interest or lower the interest to 0.25% monthly. He recently extended the order to cover tax payments due Friday. Taxpayers applying for the deferment must show their household had an income loss of at least 20% because of the pandemic. Businesses must show their expected revenue will decrease at least 30% during the deferment period. Hartford and numerous towns in Hartford County are offering interest-free deferment, the newspaper reported, while Berlin and Enfield are offering a lowered interest rate. Windsor will give the deferment automatically, town tax collector Cathleen Eliot told the Courant, and South Windsor will require an application. The state Office of Policy Management website contains a list of towns and their policies.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:For the first time in three months, the daily number of people hospitalized because of complications of COVID-19 in Delaware has dropped for three straight days – a welcomed development as officials in Delaware and elsewhere brace for what could come next following the end-of-year holidays. As of Friday night, 400 people statewide were being treated in a hospital for their coronavirus symptoms. That’s down from 454 on Dec. 22; 426 on Dec. 23; and 404 on Dec. 24 – an overall drop of 12% over three days. It’s the first time the daily number has dropped for three straight days since a four-day stretch ending on Sept. 24, when just 53 people in Delaware were hospitalized. The dip in hospitalizations comes while thousands might have spent the Christmas holiday traveling and at family gatherings and religious services. “Although we would like to be encouraged with the downward trend of hospitalizations, we are concerned that a similar increase after Thanksgiving can be seen with Christmas/New Year’s,” Division of Public Health spokeswoman Jen Brestel said in an email Saturday. “Hospitalization is also a lagging indicator, so we may see a change weeks after any trends in new positive cases.” Cases in Delaware were mounting before Thanksgiving, but the post-Thanksgiving surge saw the average seven-day daily case count climb from 469 cases on Thanksgiving to a peak of 823.7 three weeks later on Dec. 16. That number has decreased to 621.4 through Friday, a day when the state reported 798 new cases.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Because of the pandemic, the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception was forced to use tickets and advanced registration for the first time for its Mass on Christmas Day, WUSA-TV reported. The purpose of the ticketed admission was to limit the number of people attending. Attending Mass on Christmas is a tradition for many families in the D.C. area, and also acted as a tool for others to help fill a void this year. “My sons weren’t able – I asked them not to come out of safety. So, I came here to sort of fill myself up,” Trish Earnest told WUSA9. Parishioners believed it was necessary to be in church as they near the end of a trying year. “The spiritual part of it, it was really special because we could, even throughout everything, we were really grateful that we could still come out and to celebrate Jesus and Christmas,” Eve Muir said. With capacity limits and other COVID-19 restrictions, the ceremony was not one would typically expect. “They made sure everyone was far away from each other, and using hand sanitizer, and keeping their masks on,” Earnest said. “But it was a beautiful service.”\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Some South Florida counties have put into place a short-term curfew over the holidays to discourage the spread of the coronavirus. Broward County officials said last week that businesses would have to shut down from midnight to 5 a.m. over the holidays – with the exception of Christmas Day and New Year’s Day, when the curfew starts an hour later. “Christmas and New Year’s holidays are known for large gatherings,” Broward Mayor Steve Geller told mayors during a conference call. “We are expecting a spike in cases here.” The temporary curfew, from Christmas to Jan. 4, is meant to stop people from moving around and gathering for parties. Midnight Mass and travel to and from work are exempt, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. Miami-Dade County already has a curfew from midnight to 6 a.m. Key West, home to one of the nation’s most high-profile New Year’s Eve celebrations with its drop of a drag queen in a super-sized red high heel shoe, also has implemented a holiday curfew. Visitors and locals who are not working at an essential business must be home or in their hotel rooms or vacation rentals by 10:30 p.m. starting Thursday and ending at 6 a.m. Sunday. All nonessential businesses must close from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., according to the Miami Herald.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: With coronavirus infections spiking across the Sunbelt, the latest White House Coronavirus Task Force report warned that Georgia will soon see more fatalities as cases and hospitalizations climb. “This surge must be met with aggressive public mitigation inclusive of safe public options, like outdoor dining,” said the most recent report, dated Dec. 20. “And clear personal behavior change messages to ensure as many Americans as possible can survive to be immunized and protected from severe disease and fatalities over the ensuing weeks.” More than nine out of 10 Georgia counties have moderate to high rates of spread, and 83% of the state’s counties are in the red zone. The task force said Georgia ranked 26th, or in the middle nationally, for new cases, and 18th for test positivity. Two weeks ago, Georgia ranked 47th, or fifth-best out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, for new cases. In the previous week’s report, the state ranked 41st in new cases. Georgia’s worsening ranking appears to reflect not only a rise in infections but also the addition of cases detected by rapid antigen tests. The recent inclusion of antigen cases provides a clearer picture of Georgia’s status as more states add these “probable” cases to their official counts. But it’s unknown how many states still do not report antigen cases.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Roughly 20% of Honolulu’s 4,500 first responders have received the Moderna coronavirus vaccine, city officials said. Hiro Toiya, the city’s emergency management director, said that 936 first responders received their shots Tuesday and Wednesday. Honolulu Police Department officers represented 649 of the vaccines, 173 vaccines were given to firefighters with the Honolulu Fire Department and 114 vaccines were distributed to paramedics, emergency medical technicians and lifeguards with the Department of Emergency Services. Between 60% to 70% of first responders are expected to receive the voluntary coronavirus vaccine, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. “It’s the best Christmas present we could give to ourselves, to our island, to our state, to our country and to the world and this planet,” Mayor Kirk Caldwell said. “And the City and County of Honolulu has made a commitment to get all of its first responders vaccinated, if they want to be vaccinated.” Caldwell said he would not receive the vaccine with the state’s first responders. The mayor said he would wait his turn and stand in line with other seniors after his term runs out in a few weeks. Police Chief Susan Ballard, Fire Chief Manuel Neves and Emergency Services Director Jim Howe were were vaccinated last week.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Vaccinations for about 10,200 residents and staff at 75 Idaho long-term care facilities will begin Monday, officials said. Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokeswoman Niki Forbing-Orr told the Idaho Press that most of Idaho’s 315 long-term care facilities will receive the vaccine from CVS Health Care and Walgreens through the Pharmacy Partnership organized by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “What we have been hearing from residents is, ‘We just want our life back, we want our families to visit, to play cards with our friends,’ ” said Zendi Meharry, the director of clinical operations at Cascadia Healthcare, a group that runs several skilled nursing facilities in Idaho. Residents and workers at long-term care facilities are in the first group scheduled to get vaccines. That group also includes front-line health care workers. About 130,000 people are in that group.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new proposal filed earlier this month would allow state lawmakers to meet and vote remotely in emergency situations. Chicago Rep. Ann Williams and Sen. Robert Martwick, both Democrats, call it a launching point for discussions on how to meet going into 2021 amid the ongoing pandemic, according to a joint statement. The Legislature last met in person in May to approve a budget, taking social distancing measures. However, Martwick said he has a preexisting condition which puts his health at risk. Under the bill, members of the General Assembly could meet remotely for session and committees if a joint proclamation is made by the House speaker and Senate president. The plan calls for members of the public to be able to watch sessions and committee meetings in real time. “The intent of the legislation is to provide for the very rare circumstances where it is extremely dangerous or impossible to meet,” Williams said in a statement. “It’s clear that the Legislature operates most effectively in person, when we can all meet and interact with each other more easily.” Earlier this year, the Senate adopted rules that allowed lawmakers to participate remotely if there’s a quorum present. A similar plan failed in the House.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:A federal judge has denied a request from more than a dozen Indianapolis bars and nightclubs to overturn coronavirus restrictions they said disproportionately impact bars and other age-regulated establishments. In her ruling, U.S. Southern Indiana District Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson acknowledged the difficulties bars are facing during the pandemic but said the bars involved in the lawsuit \"have not presented a legal basis\" to overturn the orders restricting business. Bar owners in their complaint filed in September alleged Marion County's public health orders unfairly restrict bars because of the age of their patrons and the products they sell. The complaint said the county has imposed stringent closure times despite capacity restrictions, adding that Marion County's coronavirus regulations are stricter than elsewhere in the state. Bar owners involved in the suit called the court's decision a \"disappointing setback\" but said they plan to file an appeal Monday.\n\nIowa\n\nDubuque: Commercial flights will resume at the Dubuque airport next month. Airport officials recently announced that American Airlines plans to restore service to the airport on Jan. 6. The airline suspended flights out of Dubuque in October after cutting its flight schedule there several times in the spring as airline traffic plummeted because of the coronavirus pandemic. “The return of air service marks a significant milestone in the continued recovery from COVID-19,” said Molly Grover, CEO of the Dubuque Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: A northeast Kansas county is moving jury trials to a building on its fairgrounds to allow for better social distancing amid the pandemic. The Lawrence Journal-World reported that the plan is for jury trials in Douglas County to resume Jan. 11 at the Flory Meeting Hall. Chief Judge James McCabria said the jury selection room can safely seat up to 30 people at a time in addition to the judge, parties and court staff. Trials that need larger jury pools will bring in panels at staged intervals. Because court proceedings will be livestreamed on YouTube for public access for the time being, prospective jurors will not be addressed by name, but by number. Trials will be held on the other side of the collapsible wall that divides the meeting hall in half. The space is large enough that the 14 chairs of the jury box can be distanced from one another. Witnesses who testify will wear plastic face shields instead of masks so that jurors can see their faces. “We believe anyone who participates in the process should feel safe with the distancing and other protocols that are in place,” said George Diepenbrock, a spokesperson for Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:Kentucky reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Saturday, adding 14,999 new cases. That's down 24.6% from the previous week's total of 19,904. Kentucky ranked 24th among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data showed. In the latest week, the U.S. added 1,327,043 reported cases of coronavirus, a decrease of -12.3% from the week before. Across Kentucky, cases fell in 91 counties, with the best declines in Pulaski, Jefferson and Boone counties.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe: Mayor Friday Ellis has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to city spokesperson Michelli Martin. In a statement, Martin said Ellis self-quarantined at the onset of symptoms late Tuesday night. His rapid test came back positive Wednesday afternoon. Ellis described his symptoms as mild, and close contacts have been notified. The mayor was at the Tuesday meeting of the City Council, and people considered close contacts at the meeting were also notified. Social distancing guidelines were adhered to Tuesday night and have been practiced by the City Council throughout the pandemic. Ellis urged citizens to continue mitigation efforts and thanked front-line workers for their “unwavering efforts to help residents fight this virus.” Council Chair Doug Harvey previously tested positive for the coronavirus and returned to council meetings Tuesday. Harvey expressed appreciation for everyone who checked on him while he was sick.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Schools across Maine are reporting dips in academic performance during the coronavirus pandemic. Standardized test scores in Gorham dropped by 10 percentage points or more in some subjects, and Biddeford High School reported a nine-point increase in course failure rate in year’s first quarter, the Portland Press Herald reported. The lower scores in Maine schools reflect broader trends across the country. Maine educators are looking for strategies to help get students back on track during a difficult time for learning. “It doesn’t come as a shock,” Biddeford High School Principal Martha Jacques said. “Obviously we’re disappointed and we want all kids to succeed, but we’ve also had a group of students that have been out of traditional education for six-plus months by the time they came back to school this fall and the nature of a hybrid model is very different than what they’re used to with an in-classroom model.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: With the pandemic aggravating mental health concerns, Sean Driscoll, a peer support specialist at the University of Maryland Medical Center’s Department of Psychiatry, said he focuses on steering people to resources that can help. “It’s OK to talk about your problems,” said Driscoll, who also writes songs to raise awareness about mental health issues under his stage name, Driscoe. “It’s OK to confide in people and to trust, and it’s OK to feel.” With COVID-19 cases surging and a difficult winter expected, state and local officials as well as health care professionals are taking steps to raise awareness about getting help during a time of rising mental health concerns, particularly during the holiday season when the problem can become more acute. Dr. David Marcozzi, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who is a senior medical advisor for COVID-19 to Gov. Larry Hogan, heightened attention on mental health during the pandemic when he spoke about the suicide of a longtime friend during a news conference last month. “Let’s make sure we reach out,” he said. “Let’s make sure we support each other and talk to a professional if helpful.” Maryland has seen a 30% increase in calls so far this year to the state’s 211 crisis hotline, said Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, who chairs a state commission on mental health. The lieutenant governor has been leading the panel since early last year.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: New restrictions designed to limit the spread of the coronavirus took effect in the state on Saturday. The new rules state that most industries in Massachusetts are now subject to a 25% capacity limit. The new restrictions apply to restaurants, casinos, office spaces, houses of worship, retail businesses, libraries and many other kinds of businesses and public spaces. Indoor gatherings are also now limited to 10 people at private homes, public places and events. The administration of Republican Gov. Charlie Baker also said all hospitals are directed to postpone or cancel all nonessential inpatient elective invasive procedures. That restriction is intended to increase capacity at the hospitals.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Bridget McCormack wants judges and other court staff to be among the second wave of people to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the state, saying vaccinating them quickly would keep courts open and slow the spread of the virus. McCormack made the request in a Dec. 8 letter to Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive and chief deputy director of the Department of Health and Human Services. McCormack asked that judges and court workers who are still performing work in person at Michigan’s courthouses be among the “essential workers” to get the COVID-19 vaccine in the second tier of vaccinations. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has identified “workers supporting the operations of the judicial system, including judges, lawyers, and others providing legal assistance” as essential critical infrastructure workers, she noted. Michigan health officials expect to receive 120,900 doses of COVID-19 vaccines during each of the next two weeks. The FDA has authorized vaccines from pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna for emergency use.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:Minnesota reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Saturday, adding 11,910 new cases. That's down 38.1% from the previous week's total of 19,237. Minnesota ranked 43rd among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data showed. Sunday's report included 2,335 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 40 new deaths, including one in the tri-county area. Stearns County added 57 new cases Sunday and reported one death of a resident in their late 80s, Benton County added 16 cases and Sherburne County added 47 cases. Across Minnesota, cases fell in 83 counties, with the largest declines in Hennepin, Ramsey and Dakota counties.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Mayor Andrew “Fofo” Gilich told WLOX-TV this week that he’s “about 80%” sure he will cancel Mardi Gras parades in Biloxi in 2021 because of concerns about the coronavirus. “Right now, it’s not looking too promising,” he said. Gilich said he will make a call on the event before the new year. “We aren’t going to do another super-spreader event,” he said, noting that health professionals have attributed some of the current increase in cases to larger gatherings around Thanksgiving. One of the Mississippi Gulf Coast’s largest Mardi Gras parades is hosted by the St. Paul Carnival Association and is among those that have cancel for 2021. Also canceled is the North Bay Mardi Gras parade, which usually takes place in St. Martin and D’Iberville. The Krewe of Nereids and the cities of Bay St. Louis and Waveland announced earlier this month they were canceling the Nereids’ Parade. Biloxi’s Second Liners Marching Club also announced it would not hold its annual parade. “You’ve got until the 16th, and that’s when the parades will roll, and I just don’t see a trend where we’re below 1,000 hospitalizations in that number of days,” Gilich told WLOX. “I don’t think it’s going to break anyone’s heart that we would rather be safe than sorry.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Missouri set a record for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 on Christmas Day as the pandemic surges. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that there were 2,862 patients hospitalized statewide, eclipsing the record of 2,851 set on Nov. 18. Hospitalizations have remained high in the past month. Meanwhile, the seven-day average for new cases is 2,213 each day, according to data posted Saturday on the state health department website. With the virus present at such elevated levels, county officials are urging caution. “It is here, it is spread in the community, and we’ve got to make sure that that spread slows,” said St. Clair County Board Chairman Mark Kern. “Our fates are in our own hands, and really, it’s not difficult to wear that mask.”\n\nMontana\n\nWolf Point: In a typical year, Native American youth die by suicide at nearly twice the rate of their white peers in the U.S. Mental health experts worry that the isolation and shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could make things worse. “It has put a really heavy spirit on them, being isolated and depressed and at home with nothing to do,” said Carrie Manning, a project coordinator at the Fort Peck Tribes’ Spotted Bull Recovery Resource Center. It’s not known what connection the pandemic has to the youth suicides on the Fort Peck reservation. Tribal members typically lean on one another in times of crisis, but this time is different. The reservation is a COVID-19 hot spot. In remote Roosevelt County, which encompasses most of the reservation, more than 10% of the population has been infected with the coronavirus. The resulting social distancing has led tribal officials to worry the community will fail to see warning signs among at-risk youth. So tribal officials are focusing their suicide prevention efforts on finding ways to help those youth remotely. “Our people have been through hardships and they’re still here, and they’ll still be here after this one as well,” said Don Wetzel, tribal liaison for the Montana Office of Public Instruction and a member of the Blackfeet Nation. “I think if you want to look at resiliency in this country, you look at our Native Americans.”\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: Officials in central Nebraska are worried that next spring’s sandhill crane viewing season will be disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic just like this year’s was and hurt the area’s economy. The annual migration of sandhill cranes across central Nebraska usually draws thousands of visitors to the area who want to see the birds gather along the Platte River in the midst of their annual migration. Kearney Visitor Bureau Executive Director Roger Jasnoch told the Kearney Hub that there is little demand for the hotel rooms in the area that visitors usually fill. And the conferences, weddings and other events that help generate business for hotels and event centers have also disappeared. Jasnoch said the area is “still losing events as far out as next June. The first quarter (of 2021 business) has evaporated.” The pandemic has taken a toll on tourism in the area. Jasnoch said that revenue from lodging and occupation taxes is down 30% from July 1 to December, reflecting the drop in demand. Before the pandemic began, the 2019 crane viewing season was disrupted by significant flooding in the area, so next year could be the third year in a row of problems during the crane migration.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Unemployed Nevada residents were bracing for the end of some federal coronavirus relief benefits on Saturday. The Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation and Pandemic Unemployment Assistance programs were set to expire after President Donald Trump held off on signing a stimulus package presented to him by Congress. The new package would have extended the benefits for at least 11 more weeks for gig workers, self-employed people and those who have exhausted their regular unemployment claims.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Most of the recent confirmed cases of the coronavirus in New Hampshire are in Rockingham and Hillsborough counties, the state Department of Health and Human Services said. The department reported more than 1,000 new positive test results for the coronavirus on Saturday. “Community-based transmission continues to occur in the State and has been identified in all counties,” the department said in a statement. “Of those with complete risk information, most of the cases are either associated with an outbreak setting or have had close contact with a person with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Beginning this week, United Airlines travelers to Newark Liberty International Airport from the United Kingdom will have to show a negative coronavirus test. Gov. Phil Murphy and United Airlines announced Thursday that the restriction take effect Monday. United travelers with flights originating in the U.K. will have to present proof of a negative test obtained within 72 hours of departure. The restriction doesn’t apply to travelers originating from outside the U.K. who connect to a Newark-bound flight at London's Heathrow Airport. Passengers can take a same-day, rapid test at Heathrow. The measure is being taken to curb the spread of a new strain of the coronavirus that has surfaced in the U.K. “As we continue to experience a second wave of COVID-19 cases, it’s critical that we take any and all precautions to mitigate the potential for further transmission,” Murphy said in a statement. United said it is operating four daily flights this month from Heathrow to Chicago, Newark, Washington and San Francisco. Next month, it will operate two daily flights to Newark and Chicago.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico has begun providing COVID-19 vaccinations to 15,000 people who work or live at long-term care facilities, state officials said. Beginning Sunday, the CVS and Walgreens pharmacy chains and Vida Pharmacy in Albuquerque administered doses of the Moderna vaccine at nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the state, officials said. “Sunday marks a monumental day in our fight with this deadly pandemic. It signifies a step toward protecting our seniors and securing their safety,” said Katrina Hotrum-Lopez, cabinet secretary of the Aging and Long-Term Services Department. The statement noted that people receiving vaccinations will need two doses from the same manufacturer administered several weeks apart. The pharmacies will send staff to facilities three times over the coming months to administer the vaccines. Dr. Tracie Collins, Department of Health cabinet secretary, said people who have been vaccinated can still carry and transmit COVID-19, so it’s important that they continue to wear masks and take other precautions such as washing their hands and distancing.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State police and health officials were investigating Saturday whether an Orange County health care provider violated state guidelines in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said in a statement that his office and state police were investigating Parcare Community Health Network in Orange County. Zucker said he received reports that Parcare might have fraudulently obtained the vaccine and diverted it to other facilities to be given to members of the public. The state has prioritized front-line health care workers, long-term care residents and staffers to receive the vaccine first. The first vaccine in the state was given to a critical care nurse in Queens on Dec. 14. “We take this very seriously and DOH will be assisting State Police in a criminal investigation into this matter,” Zucker said. “Anyone found to have knowingly participated in this scheme will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.” Parcare lists four locations in Brooklyn, one in Manhattan and one in Monroe, Orange County on its website. In an emailed statement, the company said it would cooperate with the investigation and that it “has a long history of partnering with the city of New York to provide vital healthcare services to New Yorkers who need them most – including providing COVID-19 testing – especially for New Yorkers in medically underserved communities who’ve been hardest hit by COVID-19.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A North Carolina health care system said it is delaying COVID-19 vaccinations scheduled for next month after a controversy arose over who would get the initial round of doses. Atrium Health said up to 97 vaccination appointments set for January have been canceled, The Charlotte Observer reported. The action followed a report by several Charlotte television stations which cited a tweet by Atrium social media manager Katie McKiever saying she had scheduled her first vaccine appointment for early January. According to guidance published in October, health care workers and medical first responders should get the vaccine first. “The key is to get those most at risk and those who are on the frontlines risking their lives for the community. We get the vaccine to them so they can care for those who need it as others are waiting,” said Dr. Scott Rissmiller, Atrium’s executive vice president and chief physician executive. Atrium also said it has revised its internal plan for vaccine distribution to exclude nonfront-line health care workers from the first phase.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The North Dakota Army National Guard on Saturday began providing rapid coronavirus testing to people arriving at Hector International Airport in Fargo. The tests were being offered for free to people on arriving flights to catch new infections from spreading in the community. The tests are expected to take 15 minutes to give a result. Over the last two weeks, North Dakota has seen a 68% decline in the average number of new cases reported each day. An average of about 199 new cases was reported each day over the last week. The Department of Health reported 133 people had tested positive during testing completed Friday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:Another 5,857 Ohioans have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to Ohio Department of Health data recorded Sunday. That number is well below the three-week average of 9,310 cases a day, but weekend numbers generally fall off. Sunday's cases bring the statewide total to 670,525 since the pandemic began. Another 33 deaths were recorded on Sunday, also below the three-week daily average of 74. Total deaths in Ohio stand at 8,509. The number of hospitalizations rose by 273 on Sunday, which is less than the three-week average of 360. Total hospitalizations have reached 36,786. The state reported 30 additional intensive-care admissions on Sunday; the latest three-week average for ICU admissions is 39 people a day.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health authorities have reported more than 2,600 news cases of COVID-19 over the last two days as well as 13 more deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus. The State Department of Health said the new counts from Saturday and Sunday bring the state totals to 279,139 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2,370 fatalities. There were 2,458 new cases Saturday and 173 cases Sunday, according to the department. The 13 new deaths were reported Sunday. Over the last seven days, more than 15% of coronavirus tests in Oklahoma have come back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland:The Department of Agriculture said among animals captured during wildlife surveillance recent tests confirmed mink at a farm that tested positive for the coronavirus in late November are now clear of the virus. KOIN reported the department conducted two rounds of follow-up tests, 14 days apart, to document the animals’ recovery. The first follow-up testing occurred on Dec. 7, with only one of 62 animals testing positive for barely detectable levels of the virus. With the second round of testing on Dec. 21, there were no signs of the virus among all 62 tested, indicating the mink population on the farm had recovered. One more round of testing will be conducted before releasing the quarantine, per federal guidelines. Scientists with USDA Wildlife Services, under the direction of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, are continuing to conduct wildlife surveillance near the farm, which entails trapping and testing animals.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWashington Crossing: Washington Crossing Historic Park said it filmed an annual reenactment of George Washington’s crossing of the Delaware River on Christmas morning earlier this month because of the pandemic. A video of the reenactment is available online at YouTube. The Park said the reenactment provided a “close-up view” of the event it called “a beloved community tradition that will continue for years to come.” Crowd-size restrictions barred holding the Revolutionary War reenactment in the “traditional, in-person manner,” organizers said. Usually, thousands gather every Christmas morning on the banks of the river in Washington Crossing and Titusville, New Jersey, to watch historical reenactors set out in boats to retrace the daring 1776 voyage of Washington and his troops. Last year, the crossing was completed for the first time in three years with what the Friends of Washington Crossing Park said was probably a record crowd of 4,500 to 5,000 looking on. The crossing had been scuttled during the previous two years, first by high wind and then by high water levels. Other activities at the annual event include Washington’s address to his troops, historical speeches and processions, and staff in period clothing providing public interpretation. In the original crossing, boats ferried 2,400 soldiers, 200 horses and 18 cannons across the river. Washington’s troops marched 8 miles downriver before battling Hessian mercenaries in the streets of Trenton. Thirty Hessians were killed, and two Continental soldiers froze to death on the march.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has awarded the Rhode Island Department of Health more than $3 million to help with expenses that resulted from the coronavirus pandemic. The federal agency said the money was provided “for various supplies which included personal protective equipment, mortuary-related supplies for the state’s five refrigerated trucks and supplies for contracted personnel to assist with staging and relocation of hospitalized COVID-positive elderly patients statewide.” Regional administrator and federal coordinating officer Capt. Russ Webster said FEMA plans to keep helping Rhode Island “meet its long-term goals to recover stronger, safer and smarter.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Teacher vacancies in South Carolina are up 26% compared to last year, according to a new study. The findings lead teacher advocates and public education officials to say the coronavirus pandemic is worsening the state’s teacher shortage. The State newspaper reported that school districts counted 699 teaching and service position vacancies at the start of this school year compared to 555 at the beginning of the prior academic year. The findings come from an annual report by the Center for Educator Recruitment, Retention and Advancement. Education officials said vacancies can lead to larger class sizes, more classes taught by long-term substitutes, and some specialized classes not being offered. Advocates also said the teacher exodus could mean problems for the state’s long-term recruitment and retention of teachers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Wildlife officials said South Dakota’s outdoor recreation economy boomed in 2020, providing much-needed sales in several business sectors, as well as hopes of reversing a long-term decline in the number of licensed hunters and anglers. The state waived entry fees and did not collect visitor information for almost two months at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Even so, state park visitation in 2020 has been roughly 31% higher than it was in 2019, said Al Nedved, deputy director of the South Dakota Game Fish and Parks Department’s parks division. “It was pretty evident early on that the outdoors were going to be a place where people could exercise or just relax or whatever they like to do and do it safely,” Nedved said. For the first time in several years, hunting and fishing license sales to state residents increased in South Dakota. Together, resident hunting and fishing license sales rose 6.7%, and roughly one-quarter of 2020 licenses were sold to hunters or anglers who had not bought a license since at least 2017, the Sioux Falls Argus Leader reported. Meanwhile, classes on everything from archery to plant identification have been filling up quickly when staff at the Game, Fish & Parks Department Outdoor Campus in Sioux Falls post them online, said campus director David Parker.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:The Tennessee Department of Health reported two days worth of coronavirus data on Saturday after not releasing data on Christmas. In those 48 hours, there were 14,395 cases, 9,230 of which were attributed to Friday's case count and 5,165 for Saturday's. To date, there have been 560,892 cases of the coronavirus reported in the state. So far, 5.48 million tests have been given. Tennessee confirmed 12 new deaths, five of which were attributed to Friday's case count and seven for Saturday's. In all, 6,443 people have died as a result of the virus.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Dennis Bonnen, the outgoing speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, said Sunday that he has tested positive for the coronavirus following his wife becoming sick last week. Bonnen wrote on his Facebook page that he was diagnosed over the weekend. The Republican said his symptoms have so far been mild and that his family is in quarantine. Bonnen said his family celebrated Christmas alone out of concern of spreading the virus and that it’s unknown how they were initially exposed. Bonnen’s positive test comes as coronavirus hospitalizations are hovering near their summer peak in Texas, even amid holiday gatherings and travel that health officials have warned are likely to further spread the virus. “This disease is no joke in its unpredictability and severity, so please continue to keep your guard up and your loved ones protected,” Bonnen wrote.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Utah reported fewer new coronavirus cases in the week ending Saturday, adding 15,108 new cases. That's down 11.9% from the previous week's total of 17,149. Testing has changed around the holidays, making comparisons difficult. Labs and testing sites closed. People traveled or prepared for the holidays instead of getting tested. Some counties and states didn't report data as quickly. Across Utah, cases fell in six counties, with the best declines in Salt Lake, Utah and Davis counties.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Vermonters can now follow the progress of the state’s efforts to vaccinate the population against the virus that causes COVID-19 on a new dashboard on the website of the Health Department. The dashboard, which went live Wednesday, will provide information on the number of people who have been vaccinated and how many people have completed the two-shot series of vaccines needed to have immunity against the virus. It will also show the rates of vaccination by age, sex, race and ethnicity. As of Thursday, just under 4,400 people had received the first dose of one of the two vaccines being administered in Vermont. The state expects to receive a total of about 34,000 doses of vaccine by the new year. Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said that initially, the dashboard will be updated weekly, on Wednesdays, but as progress is made in the state’s vaccination campaign, it could be updated more frequently.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: New figures from the Department of Corrections showed that two inmates and one staff member who tested positive for the coronavirus have died in recent days. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the figures posted Friday showed that overall, 41 inmates and two staff members who had tested positive have died. That’s up from Dec. 21, when the department said were 39 inmates and one staff member who had died. The department did not immediately release details about the recent deaths. There are about 25,000 inmates in Virginia and the department has about 11,000 staff members. About 7,000 inmates have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic began.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee said last week he will extend a state ban on evictions to March 31. Inslee’s office did not offer more details on the moratorium extension, saying that more information would be available this week. “COVID-19 has had a significant financial impact on Washingtonians over the last nine months,” Inslee said in a statement. “I know this moratorium has been critical for many families and individuals as they cope with the impacts of this virus. People need certainty about whether the moratorium will be extended, and it is important that I provide that certainty today while we work out the final details of the moratorium.” Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan also extended the city’s eviction moratorium through March 31.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice reported that nearly half of his state’s stock of COVID-19 vaccines has been administered. But the promising news was tempered by the governor’s announcement on Christmas Day that 55 more West Virginians had died from the disease. During a press briefing Friday, the governor described, one by one, the latest people who had succumbed to the pandemic. “Not good, not good,” he said. By Saturday, that number had climbed further – with deaths now surpassing 1,250, according to state health officials. Earlier in the week, Justice said he expects West Virginia to complete within three weeks all vaccinations at hospitals, health departments and long-term care facilities. During his Christmas Day announcement, the governor reported that the state’s vaccination rate, about 47%, was the highest of any state. He said 28,623 of the 60,875 total doses delivered to West Virginia to date have been administered.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Officials said Dane County has secured a six-month extension of a program linking local growers with food pantries that was set to expire at the end of this year. The program began in April with the help of about $8 million of the county’s federal coronavirus relief funding. More than 4,000 hours of service have been logged to help those experiencing hardship and hunger, the Wisconsin State Journal reported. County Executive Joe Parisi said last week that a $5 million agreement has been reached with Second Harvest Foodbank of Southern Wisconsin to continue the program through at least the end of July. Many people facing job losses have turned to food pantries for meals. Requests for food from Second Harvest has increased more than 50% since last year, the nonprofit’s leader said last month.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Health care workers at Cody Regional Health have been challenged by the coronavirus pandemic. There have been struggles with obtaining masks and other protective equipment, workers getting sick, and rising numbers and longer stays in the intensive care unit. They have pushed through them all. “The things the employees have done here and the department leaders to care for the patients of this community, everybody has just gone above and beyond,” chief clinical officer Keith Ungrund told The Cody Enterprise. Ungrund said the hospital has had 10 to 15 people out per week because they contracted the virus or were in close contact with another person who did. That crunch on staffing has led to occasional cancellations of elective surgeries – those procedures that aren’t immediately life-threatening but must still be done. The staffing challenges have also meant some health care workers are being cross-trained to ensure there is coverage in the ICU. It has been a total team effort, Ungrund said. And despite a recent push for longer hours and more overtime to have the people they need in the building, morale isn’t lacking. “They are a strong team of caregivers that take care of each other very well,” said Barbara Mullaney, a nurse and the head of the acute and critical care units. “We ensure that we are rounding on them routinely to ensure they are getting breaks and they have what they need. We are so proud of our team and they are doing their best to stay upbeat and positive.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/28"}]}

Unofficially, there were 5,506 \"yes\" votes and 2,102 \"no\" votes.\n\nThe department will certify the results of the referendum at 2 p.m. Thursday, said Elections Unit Manager Barbara Lippincott.\n\nAppoquinimink Board President Richard Forsten said the overwhelming \"victory\" was realized through a well thought-out plan and volunteers getting the word out in all communities in the district.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"The district put a lot of time and thought into the planning that went into this, and the voters responded,\" Forsten said. \"We work awfully hard as a school board and care very much about education in this district. Education is one, if not the most important, thing government can do, and we want to continue to be a good school district.\"\n\nAppoquinimink Superintendent Matt Burrows said the real work begins now that the community has put its faith in the district, deemed the fastest-growing in the state.\n\n\"We have to use the money we were granted wisely,\" he said. \"The community came out and spoke tonight, and they deserve nothing but the best from us. We will now hit the ground running. We have three new schools to build.\"\n\nBecause of the growth the school district has seen in the past and is predicting in the future, officials saw a need to host a two-part referendum – one ballot item sought funding to build and expand schools, while the other sought funds for operational expenses.\n\nIn the last two years, Appoquinimink School District – which largely encompasses Middletown, Odessa and Townsend – has added 766 students. Since 2006, the district has 3,082 additional students and has a current enrollment of 10,644. Last year alone saw a more than 500-student increase.\n\nThat growth will continue as the population in the Appoquinimink School District is projected to increase significantly in the coming decades, from 66,429 people in 2015 to 89,892 people by 2025 and 107,206 people by 2035, according to WILMAPCO, a federally designated metropolitan planning organization used by the district to project growth.\n\nThe district will now be able to build a 1,600-student high school and 1,000-student middle school on the Fairview Campus, where they will join the existing kindergarten center and elementary school. This will create the first K-12 campus in the state.\n\nA new 840-student elementary school is also planned in the town of Whitehall on land that was donated to the district.\n\nThe district also has plans to redesign and expand Everett Meredith Middle School to allow for 1,000 students and to renovate Silver Lake Elementary School.\n\nSTORY: Residents feel forced out of Magnolia development\n\nSTORY: Middletown students pull of Wreaths Across America welcome\n\nAs a stop-gap measure, the district has added trailers to two middle schools and an elementary school, but temporary solutions were costly, with nearly $1 million spent and leasing fees.\n\nCedar Lane Elementary School and the district’s two high schools also repurposed spaces as classrooms, moved to “on-a-cart” instruction and are currently sharing rooms.\n\nThe price tag to fund the capital improvements is a little more than $268 million, of which 25 percent ($67.1 million) will be paid for by taxpayers through the referendum and 75 percent paid for by the state. That equates to 8.54 cents per $100 of assessed home value, which will range from about $5 a month for a house valued at $150,000 to about $14 a month for a home valued at $450,000.\n\nAppoquinimink was one of only two school districts to be approved for capital support from the state among five that applied this year. The state prioritized districts that showed critical enrollment issues.\n\nThe second question on the ballot sought $3.1 million for such things as teacher recruitment and retention, technology and operating expenses. The tax impact for this part is 15 cents per $100 assessed value of a home.\n\nMiddletown High Principal Matthew Donovan said before the referendum vote that he believes great outcomes require great teachers and support staff. He also said more funding was needed to attract and retain good teachers.\n\n\"We ask so much more from our teachers every day. Keeping quality teachers here is important,” he said. “The worst thing that can happen after they’ve practiced, become refined and are successful, is they leave. The investment in that teacher is lost if they go somewhere else.”\n\nSome of the money will be used for technology.\n\n“Learning, and especially 21st-century learning, is different than when most parents went to school,” Burrows said. “You are seeing more devices. Learning is no longer just happening between the four walls of the school building. It’s happening at home. It’s happening at the coffee shop. Learning is happening almost 24/7 because of student connectivity to the devices. We need to prepare our kids for the jobs that are out there and the jobs we don’t even know exist at this point as they move forward.\"\n\nWith the referendum passing, taxpayers will pay 23.54 cents per $100 of their home's value, which could be anywhere from $9 a month ($150,000 home) to $27 a month ($450,000 home).\n\nReach Jerry Smith at jsmith17@delawareonline.com.

The system is seeking an increase of 45 cents per $100 of assessed value, spread out over two years — 25 cents in year one and 20 cents in year two — with a referendum vote set for February 13, 2024.\n\nIf voters agree, Brandywine’s average property value, $72,701, would see about an extra $15 per month in year one and $12 a month in year two.\n\nAccording to the district, there are no capital projects on the docket with this request. The New Castle County district is aiming to cover operational costs, update technology and invest in school safety improvements.\n\nZooming out, many Delawareans already have tax on the mind.\n\nWhile administrators have to balance budgets, improve school facilities and keep pace with growth, many residents are already bracing for possible tax increases in the wake of the first property reassessment in decades.\n\nAre my taxes already going up?\n\nMaybe, maybe not.\n\nThe First State is coordinating a statewide reassessment of property values both residential and commercial for the first time since the 1980s, as previously reported by Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nData collection began in 2021 after a judge ruled Delaware's property tax system was unconstitutional, and all three counties hired the firm Tyler Technologies to carry out assessments.\n\nSussex County is now expected to release finalized reassessments in 2024. In New Castle County, the plan is to mail new assessments to property owners starting in November 2024, using these values to calculate new tax bills starting in 2025. In Kent, notification of new values was scheduled to be mailed last month, with the assessment appeal filing deadline of March 15, 2024, and the property tax bills going out later in 2024.\n\nSchedule so far:Property tax reassessment process extended in Sussex County because of staff shortages\n\nBringing the system in line with the law meant counties had to reassess property values to tie them closer to their present market value. Then, both school districts and counties must dial back their corresponding tax rates to bring in the same money — or in some situations, a bit more — as before.\n\nThe common wisdom, reported in 2020, was that likely a third of tax bills could go up, a third could stay the same and another third could go down. For his part, Wilson expects some taxpayers to see their bills rise as much as 10%.\n\nSchool districts are capped on how much additional revenue can be generated from reassessment. Per state law, districts are capped at 10% in additional revenue.\n\n“When people get their reassessment notice, they will have some sticker shock,” said Mitch Wilson, senior manager with Invoke Tax Partners’ property tax office. “Because they’re cognitive of their current assessment, what it’s been forever and ever. You’re going to see a change.”\n\nBackground:Judge rules Delaware property tax system unconstitutional; major changes to residents' bills could follow\n\nBreakdown:Delaware's outdated system for property taxes, explained\n\nGot a story?

Both parts relate to how expensive it's getting to run the system.\n\nOne ask is tied to previously approved capital improvements — a new intermediate school, expanding Clayton Intermediate School to Clayton Middle School and expanding North Elementary School — where additional funds are now needed to \"match state market pressure.\"\n\nThe district cited inflation impact at about $37 million more than initial estimates for approved projects.\n\nThe other hopes to increase taxes to support the growing general operating expenses of the district. Expenses include:\n\nRecruit and hire constables for every school building\n\nDeliver mental health supports in every school building\n\nMaintain competitive salaries\n\nEnhance student instructional technology materials\n\nProvide extracurricular activities for the new middle school\n\nFor the Smyrna district, the average assessed value of a New Castle County property is $47,400 and the average assessed value for Kent County property is $37,300.\n\nOn the capital side, the district will be responsible for 23% of costs, the state 77%. The debt service payments will be made over a 20-year cycle, one spokesperson explained, with the amount per average property hovering around $35 for the first five years. The operating ask is seeking to collect 51.70 cents more per $100 of assessed value in New Castle County and an additional 64.97 cents per $100 assessed value in Kent County by July 1, if approved.\n\nFor Smyrna, the purpose is simple: \"Prioritize the safety of students and staff, while facilitating necessary school expansion.\" More details can be found on the district website.\n\nDEEPER:Appoquinimink referendum was the latest: Why attempts to raise school funds keep failing\n\nReferendums didn't see much success in 2023, worrying some advocates. By December, when voters in Appoquinimink School District chose to reject three proposed tax hikes, they brought the overall approval rate for referendums in 2023 down to 15%.\n\nSmyrna voters will head to the polls on March 9. And Appoquinimink, Brandywine, Red Clay and Colonial all have new referendums slated for February.\n\nColonial's Feb. 29 referendum will also carry capital and operations asks — with nearly 20 years since the last major upgrade to its facilities. The system is looking to raise 25 cents per $100 of assessed property value in fiscal year 2025, 10 cents in 2026, 5 cents in 2027. More information comes on the district website.\n\nKent County has recently released new assessed values to homeowners, according to a Smyrna schools spokesperson, but the full reassessment process isn't complete. It's anticipated that once the process concludes, the basis for these proposed rates will be adjusted before tax bills are sent in the summer of 2024.

For Jake, his dad, Andy Ziegler, was already an Eagle Scout and his soon-to-be Scoutmaster. Evan's mom, Christy, also came along for the ride as her son got invested.\n\nBy 2019, the pair became stepbrothers when their parents got married.\n\nAnd as 2024 begins, the fellow senior patrol leaders have both earned the Eagle Scout rank, at the same time, having been honored in an awards ceremony with Troop 67 over the weekend.

It's the latest development following a 2020 settlement, as Delawareans for Educational Opportunity and the NAACP sued the state for being aware of deficiencies in resources provided to lower-income students, students with disabilities and multilingual learners in 2018.\n\nThe national firm not only concluded \"an alarmingly clear and negative relationship exists between the percentage of low-income students served by schools and the outcomes they achieve for students\" — but also set forth recommendations that the First State update its funding formula to follow students.\n\nAs expected, it recommends some sizable changes:\n\nIncrease overall state investment in public education.\n\nin public education. Distribute more resources according to student need .\n\n. Implement a weighted student funding formula for the state.\n\nfor the state. Improve funding transparency .\n\n.

Just months before, in February, the district's first attempt at that referendum failed, with 952 for the increase and 2,484 against.\n\nSuperintendent Dusty Blakey said if the upcoming referendum does not pass, the district could lose staff.\n\n\"If it doesn't pass, we'll try again,\" he said. \"But ultimately, it's people that will be impacted.\"\n\nSeveral of Colonial's most popular programs could also be affected.\n\nThe referendum specifically supports specialized programs recently introduced at the district's middle schools. Colonial has \"themed\" the schools, with McCullough Middle serving as the science, technology, engineering, art and math school; George Read focusing on agriculture, marketing, science, culinary and accounting; and Gunning Bedford centered on graphic design, information technology, gaming and coding, digital media, and visual and the performing arts.\n\nSTORY: New DSU program to teach high schoolers to code\n\nSTORY: Conrad Redskins now the Red Wolves\n\nAn elementary wellness program offers access to physicals, immunization and basic emergency triage at school.\n\nFor parents like Arista Gordy, president of the Carrie Downie Elementary School PTA, it's programs like those that have made her happy to send her kids to Colonial schools.\n\nOriginally from New York, when she moved to Delaware, Gordy said, she wasn't really \"excited about anything in particular (at Colonial) because there wasn't anything new, there wasn't a lot of innovation.\"\n\n\"But five years later, when my son started school, I was already seeing growth,\" she said.\n\nNow, though her family has outgrown their home in Old New Castle and is looking to move closer to Middletown, she said she doesn't want to switch school districts.\n\n\"I don't want to move into (Appoquinimink) School District,\" she said. \"I want to stay in Colonial. I will choice them. I will drive them if I have to.\"\n\nShe said she will vote \"yes\" to the referendum, and she's not the only one. At a public meeting Wednesday at George Read Middle School, several parents, staff and alumni made the commitment, attaching small pins that read \"The Power of We\" to their shirts and jackets.\n\n\"I'm ready to vote now,\" one woman said.\n\nSTORY: DOC officer assaulted, but details scarce\n\nThe only notes of discord came from the edge of the room, where two older residents talked loudly with district staff.\n\nBill Mohr, from Minquadale, said he previously had a granddaughter who attended school the Colonial district, but her family pulled her out because of fighting on the school bus, he said.\n\nThe 62-year-old, while for children, said he was against the referendum because he feels the school district hasn't done a good job letting residents know about the upcoming vote.\n\nSpecifically, he complained that while copies of the school district newspaper, the Colonial Reporter, had detailed information about the referendum, they were not delivered to several of his neighbors and friends. He himself received one, and the district said about 46,000 copies of the newspaper were mailed out.\n\nOn Thursday, the district said in an email that \"mailings are still being delivered to some due to some technical issues at the post offices.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm hot over this,\" Mohr said. \"I can tell you right now there are some mad people out there because they were not notified on this.\"\n\nAnthony DeLia, about the same age as Mohr, corroborated his story and said he had heard from several people who did not receive the mailer.\n\nHe was against the referendum because of its potential impact on seniors on Social Security and low-income renters, whose landlords could pass along the costs to them.\n\n\"The area we are living in, people can't afford an increase,\" he said. \"My pension's so small, my main income is my Social Security and the few investments I've made.\"\n\nMohr chimed in and said he was on disability and could not afford much of an increase either.\n\nBoth men were against the referendum in 2013, as well, and claimed a lack of notification resulted in its ultimate passage.\n\nBreaking the referendum down\n\nThe upcoming referendum proposes an increase of 39.4 cents per $100 of assessed home value. Most of that will go for operating expenses, but 1.4 cents, or $4.7 million, will go toward constructing secure entrances at several of the district's schools, Blakey said.\n\nThe increase will be phased in over a two-year period. Only 28.4 cents will be levied the first year, while an additional 11 cents will be levied starting in year two.\n\nFor a house with an assessed value of $75,000 (and an estimated market value of $265,000), that equates to an increase of $213 the first year, and an additional $82.50 come year two.\n\nThe referendum includes:\n\nExpanded preschool: More seats would be available for 3- and 4-year-olds. The district currently has a waiting list of about 160-180 children for those programs.\n\nMore seats would be available for 3- and 4-year-olds.

Neil Webster, girls basketball at William Penn, said his children and wife went to the high school, and now he has a daughter that teaches at William Penn and a granddaughter that teaches at McCollough.\n\n\"I was excited she wanted to go back and teach where she started school,\" he said of his daughter.\n\nFor him, the referendum is all about \"the classroom\" and making sure the district has enough resources to provide a world-class education.\n\n\"I live in the district, and because I live there, it affords me the opportunity to see the products of the public school district,\" he said. \"I recognize how important it is that we fund the schools. They need to be able to offer programs like William Penn does.\"\n\nGary Phillips, who graduated from William Penn High School and is president of Friends of Colonial, said his entire family has attended Colonial Schools: his children, his grandchildren, his wife, his brother.\n\nWhile he has fond memories of his time as a student, he has embraced the need for change.\n\n\"When you look at education and how it's supposed to be preparing our children, our students, for the 21st century, you have to keep up with it,\" he said. \"We need to be looking ahead, not at present times or in the past.\"\n\nHe's excited about the new programs at Colonial and has been pushing for the referendum to pass, sharing information about the measure on the Friends of Colonial Facebook page and other social media. Phillips said there's value in funding Colonial schools not only for local parents, but the community as a whole.\n\n\"The fact is that better schools create better values within the community,\" he said. \"They increase property values. We're looking into kids that are probably getting into less trouble and probably being more focused on an education that they're excited about and more successful at.\"\n\nMore on the referendum:\n\nwww.colonialschooldistrict.org/vote\n\nTax calculator:\n\nwww.colonialschooldistrict.org/calculator-2/\n\nPolling places — Open 10 a.m. - 8 p.m. Feb. 28\n\nDistrict residents can vote at ANY of the following locations:\n\nCarrie Downie Elementary School\n\nCarvel State Building\n\nCastle Hills Elementary School\n\nDelaware City Library\n\nEisenberg Elementary School\n\nHoward Weston Senior Center\n\nKingswood Community Center\n\nMcCullough Middle School\n\nNew Castle Senior Center\n\nPleasantville Elementary School\n\nSouthern Elementary School\n\nWilbur Elementary School\n\nWilliam Penn High School\n\nWilmington Manor Elementary\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

However, school security was reduced from 10 cents to eight cents, and textbooks, technology and student organizations were combined into one category, tentatively called \"student services and support,\" and would receive eight cents.\n\nIf passed, it would raise $7.35 million for one of the fastest growing school districts in the state. Indian River's student population has grown by 22.4 percent over the last 10 years.\n\nIndian River Chief Financial Officer Jan Steele explained school safety was reduced and student services and support were increased due to the State of Delaware looking to cut $15 million in public education, which would in turn cause the Indian River School District to lose $900,000.\n\n\"One of the suggestions is to cut education sustainment funds from each district, which we use to pay local salaries,\" Steele said. \"We would then need to come up with local salary funds based on the state cuts.\"\n\nDespite the most recent Indian River School District referendum's failure to pass, referendums in Delaware have had recent success.\n\nBACKGROUND: Indian River board approves second referendum\n\nAfter failing to pass the first time, a referendum in the Brandywine School District passed on May 16 to raise funds for the operating budget as well as money for a capital funds project. The referendum was approved by voters 5,780 to 3,720.\n\nThe Appoquinimink School District recently passed two referendum measures to build a new school and to raise money for teacher recruitment and retention, technology and other expenses. The capital project referendum passed by a margin of 5,506 to 2,102 while the referendum for operational funding passed 5,152 to 2,496.\n\nEven with the recent success of referendums in Delaware, not all residents are happy to see another one on the table.\n\n\"I have a bad feeling about it,\" said Mark Warrington of Selbyville. \"I'm all for the kids but this would adversely affect those of us on a fixed income.\"\n\nBunting added she and the district will make more of an outreach to inform wary citizens.\n\nFor example, senior citizens can qualify for a tax break and not see any difference in taxes, she said.\n\n\"We have talked about going to senior citizen centers and having conversations there,\" Bunting said. \"If we can go and talk to people and answer their questions we can ensure they are not operating on misconceptions and we can get them to understand the situation and get them to be more empathetic.\"\n\nBunting said concerns have also been raised due to the audit report released by the Delaware Office of Auditor of Accounts just five days before the previous Indian River School District Referendum. The report detailed financial misdoings by the district and former Chief Financial Officer Patrick Miller.\n\nThe district has been working with the auditor's office, and Bunting hopes the office will give the district a letter of support.\n\n\"We are working with them to verify we are making changes,\" she said. \"And we want to be able to document those changes.\"\n\nThe district will cut costs even if the referendum does pass, Bunting said.\n\n\"I often liken our situation to your home situation,\" she said. \"If your budget gets tight or an unexpected expense arises, you start to look around and see what you can do without or wait another year to purchase. We are going to start to do that now.\"\n\nThe district will also be utilizing social media more than ever to help get the message out, Bunting added.\n\nFor Bunting, the referendum is ensuring students are properly served in the school district and there is no change in the operations of the district.\n\n\"I hope the public will see the need that our kids have,\" she said. \"We are up about 300 children from Sept. 30. We continue to grow and we need more of everything.\"\n\nrghughes@dmg.gannett.com\n\nOn Twitter @hughesg19", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2017/04/29/delaware-schools-struggle-proposed-cuts/100565074/", "title": "Delaware schools struggle with proposed cuts", "text": "Jessica Bies, and Matthew Albright\n\nThe News Journal\n\nEducators and parents are up in arms over $37 million in budget cuts to public schools proposed by Gov. John Carney and vow a fight in the General Assembly to stop them.\n\n\"At some point in time, we have to look at our future and stop robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said Jeff Day, who is running for a spot on the Christina school board and has children in the Appoquinimink district.\n\nCarney has said he would rather not be making any cuts but said \"shared sacrifice\" is necessary in the face of the state's nearly $400 million budget deficit.\n\n\"These are extremely modest cuts in the scheme of things, and other cabinet agencies are being cut a lot more,\" Carney said. \"All we're asking is that our school boards do a little more to run a little more efficiently.\"\n\nSTORY: Standoff ends in Middletown; suspect in Delaware trooper death killed\n\nSTORY: Fear spreads through Middletown-area neighborhood\n\nThe cuts are only 1.5 percent of the state's $1.37 billion public school budget, the governor noted.\n\nAbout $15 million of the cuts will come straight from school districts' operational funds, money that generally isn't used to pay teachers but covers training, technology and other administrative costs.\n\nAn additional $22 million will come from something called the \"education sustainment fund,\" which is used for a much wider range of services like math and reading specialists, after-school programming and paying staff salaries over the summer, before tax receipts come in.\n\nCarney's plan would allow districts to make up the $22 million cut by giving school districts a one-time shot at raising property taxes – without asking their voters in a referendum. It would need the approval of the General Assembly.\n\nThat would leave only a $15 million cut spread over the entire system, the governor reasons.\n\nBut school board members say the decision to raise that so-called \"match tax\" would put them in the painful position of losing money or outraging taxpayers at a time when many school boards already are struggling to pass referendums.\n\nSchool board members also say the property tax increases would unfairly burden taxpayers in property-poor districts.\n\n“It’s foolish, I think, and a fool’s errand when the state is facing a big deficit like it is, to argue the state shouldn't cut education,\" Appoquinimink school board President Richard Forsten said. “Times are tough and everyone needs to tighten their belts … but if we’re going to do it, it needs to be fair.”\n\nA tight timeline\n\nThe General Assembly has until June 30 to debate the state budget, and school districts have only until July 13 to get tax warrants to their local counties, giving them little time to ponder a final decision on the match tax.\n\nThe dilemma for superintendents and principals is that state law mandates any teacher laid off must be notified no later than May 15.\n\nSTORY: Carney proposes tax hikes, spending cuts in state budget\n\nSTORY: Delaware's budget hole deepens by $35.6 million\n\nDistricts will need to plan for cuts they aren't even sure are coming. That means they might be sending pink slips to employees they might not need to fire.\n\nConversely, the cuts may deepen and they may have dip into their reserves or get rid of school programs.\n\nRep. Melanie George Smith, D-Bear and chair of the budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, acknowledges the timing is tough for districts. But she said it's too early in the General Assembly to give a final ruling.\n\nLawmakers still have to settle the thorny question of how much to cut and how much to raise revenue. Carney has proposed an equal balance of tax increases and spending cuts, but lawmakers don't have to follow that rule.\n\nWhile there's little appetite among lawmakers to balance the budget with nearly $400 million in tax increases — thus avoiding cuts entirely — they could lean a little heavier on taxes than Carney did. They could expand Carney's proposed increases to the income tax, corporate franchise tax and tobacco tax. Or they could impose other hikes, like expanding the lodging tax or adding to the alcohol tax.\n\nThat could mean the proposed cuts to education would vanish or diminish.\n\nThis revenue issue is perhaps the biggest question looming over the current General Assembly. And Smith said her committee won't know how to handle education cuts until that question is answered.\n\n\"We on JFC can't say what we're going to do until our 62 colleagues decide what kind of revenue we have to work with,\" Smith said.\n\nShe said it's also possible her committee will find other, less painful places to cut education spending.\n\n\"The question isn't how much we're cutting; the question is what we're cutting,\" she said. \"We can find places to cut spending that don't affect direct instruction.\"\n\nBut \"there really are no easy answers here,\" George cautioned.\n\nIf state government were to avoid education cuts, it would have to make deeply painful cuts elsewhere. Education makes up about one-third of the budget.\n\nThe only other part of government that is anywhere near that size is health and social services, on which the state spends about $1.1 billion.\n\nStory continues below graph.\n\nSchools have been taking up a greater share of the state budget each year because state officials are required by law to increase funding as the number of students in public schools grows. As a result, the number of education employees in Delaware has grown significantly even as the number of other government workers has declined.\n\nSTORY: Gov. John Carney: Fix budget, update Coastal Zone Act\n\nIn 2009, there were 16,877 school district employees — as of this February, that number had grown to 19,422. During the same period, the number of other state government employees shrank from 14,103 to 13,338.\n\nWhile Carney has insisted he does not intend for schools to cut staff, salaries are the biggest part of every district's budget. Which has several of them looking at layoffs.\n\nTo tax or not to tax?\n\nThe cuts are worse if school boards don't impose the referendum-less \"match tax.\"\n\nFor instance, Christina School District is estimating total losses of about $5.86 million — $3.9 million of which it could potentially recover via the match tax.\n\nThat means raising taxes 7.3 cents per $100 of assessed property value. For example, a home in Windy Hills, Newark, recently sold for $224,000 has an assessed property value of $63,700 and would face a potential annual property tax increase of $46.50, according to district records.\n\nIn comparison, Christina’s last referendum, held in 2016, raised taxes by 30 cents, an increase of about $191 per year on a similarly valued home.\n\nEven if the district ultimately decides to raise taxes without voter approval, it still would have to make about $2 million in cuts, according to Christina Financial Manager Bob Silber. Due to timing considerations, it's also making plans for the full $5.9 million.\n\nCausalities could include the district's Montessori Program, which has an enrollment of about 60 students and was recently re-committed to by the school board. Another option is to discontinue elementary instrumental music and elementary and secondary string music classes.\n\nThe cuts seem large, but for some school districts, reductions are compounded by the fact they already planned on making large ones next year.\n\nTake Indian River, which days before Carney released his budget had outlined $1.72 million in reductions.\n\nThough it recently passed a $7.35 million referendum, the district has been struggling financially and planned on reducing the amount of paid coaching staff for athletics and some salary reductions, including eliminating non-athletic extra pay for extra responsibilities.\n\nThe plan was to streamline programs, not eliminate them. But now, with Indian River facing a total of about $3.4 million in cuts, the scope of that original budget reduction plan could change. Passing the “match tax” would raise taxes about 12.5 cents per $100 of assessed property value, Superintendent Mark Steele told residents during a recent \"town hall\" held on Facebook Live.\n\nSTORY: Colonial takes another shot at referendum, warns of cuts\n\nSTORY: Indian River School District faces $3.4M in cuts\n\nFor Colonial, which is holding a referendum June 6, there's even more on the line.\n\nThe district's last referendum, in February, was voted down, which means the district was already considering cuts.\n\nShould the June referendum also be defeated, Colonial is preparing to implement over $4 million in reductions for the 2017-2018 school year, including 120 layoffs. The budget cuts add roughly another 50 layoffs, bring the total to 170.\n\nThose estimates are based on the total cuts the district could see in the budget — about $3 million — and does not include the match tax.\n\n\"The idea of the referendum is really to make us whole,\" Colonial Superintendent Dusty Blakey said. \"To keep us at our operating level currently.\"\n\nShared sacrifice\n\nOther school districts, like Appoquinimink, are approaching the education cuts a little differently. The district is considering reducing transportation costs, reducing its budget for substitute custodians and eliminating up to 17 teachers, among other things.\n\nForsten, the school board's president, seems to realize cuts, if not inevitable, are likely. He's trying to prepare for them.\n\nHe and the district's financial director, Charles Longfellow, are working to ensure that even if the district has to raise taxes, it's doing so in a way that's fair to local residents.\n\nBecause the way Carney has proposed doing it, that's not fair, Forsten said.\n\nHe said because the cuts aren't based on districts' property tax bases, some Delaware homeowners will have to pay only a little bit more in taxes each year, while homeowners in districts like Appoquinimink would shell out a pretty significant chunk of change.\n\nForsten used Brandywine, which like Appoquinimink is facing about $3 million in total cuts, as a comparison.\n\nIf Brandywine and Appoquinimink both had to cover the total $3 million, he said, the taxes in Appoquinimink would be higher.\n\nIn Brandywine, a home valued at $63,700 would face annual property tax increase of about $56. In Appoquinimink, where rates needed to be raised more because there's less taxable property, taxes will go up by about $95.\n\nForsten thinks the formula for calculating the cuts needs to be changed, so residents all pay roughly the same.\n\nAt a board workshop Wednesday night, not all agreed.\n\nChristina's Day says instead of suggesting changes to how the cuts are made, school boards throughout the state should be rallying against any cuts at all.\n\n\"Don't roll over, acquiesce and say, 'Yes, Dover, if you give us the authority to match tax, we'll use it,'\" Day said. \"Otherwise, they'll just keep doing this.\"\n\nHe also thinks resources given to school districts should be the same across the state, and that Appoquinimink should be fighting to eliminate the cuts altogether instead of looking out for its \"best interests\" and making sure it doesn't have to pay significantly more in taxes than Brandywine or Christina.\n\n\"I think we should be fighting so that all kids in the state are not hurt by this budget,\" Day said.\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

His two children are students in Appoquinimink.\n\nIssues: Petkevis has mainly expressed concerns about violence in schools, citing outreach from community members worried about student safety. To combat this, reevaluating measures of rule enforcement and the district’s code of conduct have been suggested by the candidate.\n\nThe district’s teacher shortage and dwindling test scores are intertwined with issues related to violence in the district, according to Petkevis. In response to Citizens For Delaware Schools', he also recommended potentially soliciting funding from local developers to go toward the district’s resources and implementing financial responsibility into the curriculum for high school students.\n\nPolls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nAlfred G.

The alumna of Red Clay Public Schools holds a bachelor's degree in dance, as well as another bachelor's degree in English and a master's in education from the University of Delaware. Gilbert is a certified teacher, with experience from K-12 special education to high school English Language Arts, though currently a stay-at-home mother to her four children. Her two daughters and two sons attended private schools in Delaware.\n\nIssues: “Let me be clear,\" wrote this candidate on her Facebook page, operating as a landing pad for other campaign materials. \"The school’s role is to educate, NOT indoctrinate. Reading, writing, mathematics (not Common Core), true history (not Critical Race Theory or whatever name they’ve morphed it to).”\n\nGilbert said plummeting test scores in the district motivate her to run, alongside hopes to boost graduation rates and college readiness. She lists safety, effectiveness, curriculum and transparency as her priorities on her website. Among top-of-mind issues, she also noted parents and guardians \"will have their voices heard.\"\n\nLearning loss concerns:What’s the cost of failing math? Well, for Delaware kids it could be $66 billion\n\nDouglas Danger Manley, 38, Newark\n\nBackground: Manley works at a cybersecurity startup as a software engineer, an industry and occupation he’s found himself in for about 17 years. The Newark resident is also a volunteer firefighter with Mill Creek Fire Company, where he’s been for the past decade. He’s now its president, after having served on the board for three years.\n\nManaging a $3-4 million budget with Mill Creek, Manley told The News Journal/Delaware Online he’s used to dealing with a fixed amount of funding from state and local governments — which leave a “need to squeeze every bit of value out of that funding as we can to provide our services.”\n\nIssues: Manley has no children, and he sees that as an asset. He says this will allow him to maintain a public-service perspective. The candidate shared his focus on supporting resources for Christina School District, sharpening communication and community engagement. He also said protecting students will be a priority, especially gay or transgender children — but he hopes the district “focuses on its mission of education and doesn't get lost in the mire” of various culture wars.\n\nDistrict E\n\nY.F. Lou, 36, Newark\n\nBackground: The single father of two children, enrolled in Christina, works with the state’s health department, where he said his work focuses on improving healthcare for the most vulnerable in long-term care facilities. He also serves as a volunteer firefighter for Aetna Hose, Hook and Ladder Company. Lou's family moved to Delaware from China when he was young, an experience the candidate believes will allow him to advocate for Christina's diverse student body, as he said in a late-March candidate forum. He attended public school in Lewes, graduated from the University of Delaware, and has been a full-time Newark resident since 2012. Lou also attended both University of Southern California and Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health for graduate degrees.\n\nIssues: With an 8-year-old at West Park Elementary — and a 5-year-old headed there in the fall — Lou finds himself motivated by three key issues: safety, community engagement and a goal to \"broaden our students’ horizons.\"\n\nFor Lou, safety includes keeping guns out of schools, \"fostering a safe and welcoming environment for all of our students especially those most vulnerable,\" as well as monitoring environmental health and safety, such as lead. Community and stakeholder engagement, as he put it, focuses on how the pandemic created opportunities to capitalize on for information sharing and family engagement. In terms of broadening horizons, the candidate hopes to see more support of art programs to keep students \"curious and innovative.\"\n\nYong Peng, 53, Newark\n\nBackground: Peng works for the federal government as a software engineer, having previously worked for companies like Delmarva Power and Bank of America. Peng, in one candidate forum, called himself a “happy immigrant” focused on giving back to Delaware. Peng was born in China and came to the U.S. to study. The 15-year resident of Newark has a doctorate in physics, having worked in research and teaching at a few universities before his current line of work. Peng said he has also worked as a math tutor in Wilmington.\n\nIssues: Peng said he sees a “crisis in public education.” Two issues are top-of-mind for the father of two. One, he perceives too much focus on topics that are “ignoring the core curriculum,” which are reading, writing and math. He didn't elaborate. Two, he believes school policies are failing at “enhancing the parent's right to oversee their children’s education.” Peng said his daughter used to study in Christina School District, though no longer, and now he is running for the future of the community.\n\nPolling places, open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nPulaski Elementary School , 1300 Cedar St., Wilmington\n\n, 1300 Cedar St., Wilmington The Bancroft School , 700 N.

Before that, English-Wynn worked in the Department of Labor as a deputy principal. This career, the candidate said, meets more than 10 years of experience in mentorship and advocacy connected to K-12 education and the community. A \"proud alumna\" of Red Clay schools herself, English-Wynn also has a young child entering the district this fall. She said the Wilmington district prepared her for later degrees from Wilmington University and Delaware State.\n\nIssues: The alumna said the impact of both \"a supportive community and quality education\" are keys to students succeeding. She noted three issues motivating her campaign: equity and access, parent engagement and support for educators.\n\nWilmington:They struggled during Ida. Now one Wilmington community is finding a better way to respond\n\nJohn Shulli, 50, Wilmington\n\nBackground: Born and raised in Wilmington, Shulli returned to his home state after 26 years in the U.S. Army and Department of Defense — 22 of which were spent overseas. He works in a civilian job on A.I. policy for the Pentagon, as well as teaches part time as a colonel in the Army Reserve. He graduated from John Dickinson High School before attending Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona.\n\nIssues: Shulli said he's motivated to run by the \"severe\" learning loss faced since the pandemic and highlighted in state and district's statistics. The district must, as he sees it, \"restore our children’s academic standings so they can compete in a local, regional, national and global jobs market.\"\n\nDistrict D\n\nCarlucci Coelho, 53, Wilmington\n\nBackground: Coelho said he came to the U.S. hoping to work as an artist. He has worked in real estate since 2017, as well as the nonprofit sector. He earned a two-year degree in fashion business, according to his website, alongside a parallel degree in costume and set design while studying in Portugal. Though he doesn't have kids enrolled in the district, Coelho said he's been close to the community for over 30 years. Coelho also ran for state representative as a Republican last year, but did not secure a win in District 13.\n\nIssues: Coelho stressed that he is against any kind of bullying, citing that protecting safety in schools is paramount in his platform. Another motivating issue is budgeting, making sure money is distributed \"to those schools and programs who need the most.\" He also said he supports strong academics alongside more vocational training in every school.\n\nIn other background, in response to a question for the ACLU-DE voter's guide about the teaching of U.S. history and whether students have the right to learn free of viewpoint-based censorship, Coelho said parents should have \"the choice of accepting or denying what their own kids have the right or not to read. These children have parents who have different views about life and we must respect all parents views.\" Also when running for state representative, the candidate expressed support for a failed 2022 bill aimed at barring transgender athletes to compete in school sports, saying: \"Woman sports is woman sports.\"\n\nJose Matthews, 27, Elsmere\n\nBackground: Matthews has represented District D on the Red Clay School Board since 2018. Working in the healthcare field in different capacities over the last six years, his day job is working a community liaison for Rockford Center, a community mental health organization. The incumbent lives in Elsmere with his husband, who is a teacher.\n\nIssues: Matthews said he wants to keep up his work. In his first term, he said, the board tackled many issues related to equity around the pandemic, one being transparency. He said he \"was one of the biggest supporters on the board to make sure we continue to provide a Zoom option both to watch the meetings and to participate in public comment.\" If elected, he hopes to continue to offer that access.\n\nRed Clay has fallen behind other northern New Castle County districts, Matthews said, in terms of keep up with building maintenance and competitive salaries. He plans to make that competitiveness a priority, even if it means the district's first referendum in nearly a decade. He also aims to maintain a focus on family and parent engagement.\n\nPolling places, open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nActivity Center at Hockessin PAL , 7259 Lancaster Pike, Hockessin\n\n, 7259 Lancaster Pike, Hockessin AI DuPont High School , 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington\n\n, 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington Baltz Elementary School ,1500 Spruce Ave., Wilmington\n\n,1500 Spruce Ave., Wilmington Cab Calloway School of Arts , 100 N.

For four years, she's handled zoning variance requests on the town of Smyrna's Board of Adjustment. She’s a member of the Alpha Beta Gamma sorority at Delaware Technical Community College, the Holly’s Club and the Boys and Girls Club board.\n\nIssues: Fontaine St. Pierre decided to run for the board because she wants to serve as “a liaison between parents, teachers and the community, providing the best resources for our children's education, and allowing parents to have the most influence in their children's life.” She wants to recognize and prioritize instructors' interests and concerns.\n\nShe said the most important issues in the district are continuing to push for high-quality, intellectually-rigorous education to prepare students for the competitive labor market, providing safe schools, confronting bullying and cyberbullying and expanding self-esteem initiatives for students.\n\nAs for controversial issues such as critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “An inclusive educational system offers various advantages, including enhanced educational quality for all students and assisting students in becoming more responsive to an inclusive attitude. This could also help with behavioral issues, self-esteem, social skills, and community involvement. All students have the right to a challenging core education and outstanding instruction from well-trained educators. Students should be allowed to have an open and honest discussion about America's past, and they deserve to see themselves and the issues that impact them reflected in their classrooms and books.”\n\nShe encourages parents to attend board meetings to address issues and share comments and insights.\n\nBobbi Jo Webber, 44, Kenton\n\nBackground: A farmer for over 25 years along with her husband on their family’s farm, she has two children, a son who is a freshman at Smyrna High School and a daughter in sixth grade at Clayton Intermediate School. She’s volunteered for 10 years at Sunnyside Elementary and at Clayton Intermediate School, running fundraisers, helping teachers in classrooms and hosting free field trips at her family’s farm.\n\nIssues: Webber wanted to run for school board to improve safety, success of students, transparency and teacher compensation. She believes teachers and staff should hold students accountable for misconduct and follow through with consequences, but also favors hiring constables “who will help pull some of that responsibility off of the teachers so that they can focus on education.” She wants the administration to notify parents “about important issues that occur in the schools – the good and the bad.” She favors competitive pay: “We cannot lose these amazing educators we have to neighboring districts because of financial reasons.”\n\nIn regard to issues like critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “All races and groups should be represented in our classes. Our students should be exposed to a well-rounded curriculum. Bias and unfounded opinion do not belong in the classroom.”\n\nOn transgender policies, Webber said, “I believe that students can express themselves in a way that they feel is appropriate, although personal expression cannot become a distraction for other students. I do not approve of transgender students using the locker room or restroom of their choice of gender. I feel it could develop into an unsafe and distracting situation for other students.\"\n\nIn curriculum decisions, she said parents and community members should have their opinions represented, but they also need to trust educators to make decisions that will benefit students’ education.\n\nPolling places, open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/12/05/state-approves-funding-requests-for-schools-red-clay-eyes-referendum/71754086007/", "title": "State approves funding requests for schools, Red Clay eyes ...", "text": "More holidays are on the way for many, but it's still business as usual in education throughout the state.\n\nMake Us Visible Delaware hopes to spur more support for Asian American history to infuse in K-12 education.

Tell me about it: kepowers@gannett.com]\n\nAnother event aims to spur interest in Asian American history for Delaware schools\n\nMake Us Visible Delaware just launched this fall, under the mission to push for more Asian American history in Delaware's K-12 curricula.\n\nNow, it seems the group hopes to build community support.\n\nMUV plans to host an engagement event Saturday, Dec. 9, discussing these efforts, offering resources and more. The event will run from 1 to 4 p.m. at the Sanford School in Hockessin. Register ahead or learn more online.\n\nThe budding arm of a national organization hopes to meet with residents, schools and lawmakers throughout the state to see legislation supporting more Asian American history instruction, followed by active implementation. These hopes mirror efforts in Connecticut, New Jersey, Florida and other states.\n\nLearn more:One group aims to boost Asian American history in Delaware schools. Where does it start?\n\nState approves school funding requests for building projects, Red Clay eyes referendum\n\nDelaware Department of Education approved several requests for state funding next fiscal year. The department green-lit 50 certificate of necessity requests last month, while 44 involved state funding.\n\nSchool districts submit such requests every year, hoping for capital project or deferred maintenance assistance from the state. The state decides whether to approve, kicking in state funds that must come alongside a certain amount of local monies.\n\nFrom new Appoquinimink elementary, middle and high schools, to a new Charles W. Bush Early Education Center in Brandywine or renovations to over 20 Red Clay schools — which project funding districts hoped to secure can be explored online. Some expected totals are below, in state funds, concentrated in six districts:\n\nAppoquinimink: $223,177,971\n\nRed Clay Consolidated: $192,309,981\n\nColonial: $73,449,859\n\nBrandywine: $60,400,000\n\nChristina: $5,503,609\n\nPolytech: $2,953,097\n\nRed Clay must hold a referendum to meet local funding requirements, to pave the way to some $289 million in funding for its projects. If passed, Red Clay district residents would see a net increase of $0.50 per $100 of assessed value, over three years.\n\nIf it fails, Red Clay can try again a few months later. If the referendum fails again, state funds will be withdrawn. Community information meetings are expected, as the last ask like this was back in 2015.\n\nThe referendum is set for Feb. 28, 2024.\n\nKeeping pace:Appoquinimink, Brandywine ask for tax increases in coming referendum votes\n\nDelaware's HBCU continues to grow\n\nDelaware State University just released its fall enrollment figures by late November — continuing to break records at 132 years old.\n\nThe Dover institution now has 6,451 students, an increase of 3.5% over last year and 23% since 2020. That makes it one of the fastest-growing Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the country.\n\nAccording to Delaware State's press release, President Tony Allen is \"cautiously optimistic\" toward the growth.\n\n\"As we have seen impressive growth in our enrollment since 2017, we have also seen the national trend going in the other direction,\" he said in a statement. \"We continue to monitor the falling rates of college attendance nationwide and the steady declines in high school graduates due to lower birth rates in the U.S.\"\n\nDSU also saw growth in its graduate profile, up 7% to nearly 900 students; a 5% increase in new transfer students, up to just over 300 students; and a boost in online scholars at nearly 800 students. Nearly 80% of this fall's first-year in-state students are Inspire Scholarship holders.\n\n\"The race for talent is on,\" Allen writes. \"And we have to be prepared to meet our studentswhere they are.\"\n\nICYMI:Archmere lands $3 million donation, DSU Aviation signs new United deal: Education Roundup\n\nGot a story?

The first of its three buildings won't be done until 2019, and the district's new middle school and high school won't be done until 2020.\n\n\"In this growth time, you have to take into consideration the environment for kids, and we have to make sure we have an environment they can learn in,\" Burrows said.\n\nCape Henlopen School District is in a similar position — residents passed a $130 million referendum, and the district has said rebuilding and remodeling its elementary schools will help it get rid of modular classrooms. The district recently eclipsed 5,200 students and has added nearly 1,000 since 2002.\n\nCape Henlopen's construction will not conclude for several years, between 2018 and 2021, which means the modular classrooms could stay in use for several years.\n\nSTORY: Autism Delaware offering college scholarships\n\nSTORY: Colonial School District gears up for referendum\n\nWithout modular classrooms, class sizes would grow, Burrows said.\n\nThe two schools getting trailers at Appoquinimink already have several classes with 30 or more students, according to the Department of Education.\n\nStudents interviewed by the district ahead of its referendum said large class sizes make it hard for teachers to focus on individuals. The modular classrooms, which have narrow hallways and doors, create backups and cause students to be late for class, the students said in a video.\n\nNevertheless, four temporary classrooms will be placed at Cedar Lane Elementary, which already has trailers but has been growing at a rate of 80 to 100 children a year. Eight will be added at Appoquinimink High School, which is overcapacity. The school is growing at a rate of about 60 students a year and had a fall enrollment of 1,638, according to the Department of Education. It's designed to hold about 1,600.\n\nThere are also modular classrooms at Alfred G. Waters Middle School and Louis L. Redding Middle School.\n\n\"I know those teachers are feeling somewhat disconnected from the building,\" Waters Principal Tom Poehlmann said.\n\nThe modular classrooms house three world-language teachers and a STEM teacher.\n\nSTORY: Middletown race will decide control of state Senate\n\nSTORY: Suspicious package at UD was a battery\n\nThe rooms are on the small side, which makes hands-on learning slightly difficult, though Poehlmann said, for the most part, the modular classrooms are a good short-term solution.\n\n\"We occasionally this year have had problems with the heat not working out there, and there not being heat or air conditioning in the connector,\" he said. \"Not often, but sometimes ... like this morning.\"\n\nFunding for the trailers is not sustainable, Burrows said. The temporary solution has cost nearly $1 million to date, and leasing costs are ongoing. There is no matching state support, which means the trailers must be funded by local revenue, typically raised through taxes.\n\n\"Definitely it's a cost you don't want to have because that cost is 100 percent local,\" Burrows said. \"It comes 100 percent out of your local cost. You'd much rather build something the community can use and will be there for 50 years.\"\n\nBy comparison, the state contributes about 75 percent of costs toward capital building projects.\n\nBurrows said while he hopes the new modular classrooms hold the district over until the new buildings are done, there is a chance it may have to add more, perhaps at Cedar Lane.\n\nThough costly, they are by no means inferior learning spaces, he said. They aren't \"trailers\" per se and are attached to the school by a closed hallway. They are wired for the internet and have all the technology regular school classrooms have.\n\n\"You can't really tell the difference unless you're outside the building,\" Burrows said.\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.
