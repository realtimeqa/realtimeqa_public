Since then, they’ve sent four singles to the top of Billboard’s mainstream-rock chart — “Check My Brain,” “Your Decision,” “Hollow” and “Stone.” Their latest album, “The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here,” debuted at No. 2 on Billboard’s album chart while earning a rave from No Ripcord, whose writer weighed in with “ ‘The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here’ is up there with the best Alice in Chains albums, with each track a conquest of structure and composition.”\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 30.

It's now the fastest-selling single by a country duo in digital history, inspiring a remix with rapping by Nelly.

But there was always more to Cheap Trick’s story than “At Budokan” — from the power-pop classics that drove all those Japanese girls to go wild in the first place through the more ambitious chamber-pop of “Dream Police” and \"Voices\" to such oft-forgotten ’80s gems as “Everything Works if You Let It” and “If You Want My Love.\" I just saw them open for Heart and they completely rocked the house.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 12.

Subsequent hits include the five-times-platinum \"Airplanes\" with Hayley Williams, the double-platinum \"Magic\" with Rivers Cuomo, and his latest double-platinum hit, 2013's \"HeadBand,\" featuring 2 Chainz. Last year, he dropped an album titled \"Psycadelik Thoughtz\" with no promotion or pre-release singles. It became his lowest-charting album and produced no hits.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 13.

The quadruple-platinum \"Fancy\" spent seven consecutive weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100, the longest run at No. 1 by any female rapper, also earning the magazine's title of song of the summer.

His latest album, “Summertime: Willie Nelson Sings Gershwin,” is exactly what the title would suggest. That album just before that, \"Band of Brothers,\" was his first release to focus on predominantly new material in nearly 20 years. It hit the country charts at No. 1. Of course, he'll probably just play some subtle variation of the set he always plays, but it's a good one, from \"Crazy\" and \"Funny How Time Slips Away\" to \"On the Road Again.\" Nelson also is known for such classics as \"Red Headed Stranger,\" \"Hello Walls,\" a heartbreaking cover of \"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain\" and the great Waylon Jennings duets \"Good Hearted Woman\" and \"Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 15; 7 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 16.

That song topped the charts in several countries, from Australia to the U.K. But he may be better known here in the U.S. as the featured singer on the Wiz Khalifa smash “See You Again,” a tribute to the last Paul Walker that enjoyed a 12-week stay at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 on its way to going six-times-platinum.

Urban’s previous country hits included the chart-toppers “Somebody Like You,” “You’ll Think of Me,” “Days Go By,” “Making Memories of Us,” “Sweet Thing” and “Only You Can Love Me This Way.” He recently scored his first platinum singles with “We Were Us,” a Miranda Lambert duet, and “Cop Car.”\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 22.

Formed in 1983, they worked the psychedelic fringes for a decade before breaking through with “She Don’t Use Jelly,” an unlikely modern-rock radio hit, in 1993. That single would remain their only proper U.S. hit, but thanks to Wayne Coyne’s freaky cult of personality and fractured sonic vision, they’ve retained their position as critical darlings and lovable cult heroes while cranking out a string of modern classics. The most compelling introduction to their world may be 1999’s majestic “The Soft Bulletin” and 2002’s high-concept masterpiece, “Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.” But there’s something to said for tracking down their latest, a track-by-track re-imagining of the Beatles’ “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” with guest appearances by Miley Cyrus, Maynard James Keenan and the Valley’s own Treasure Mammal.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 22.

They’ve since followed through with a four-song EP, “Calibraska,” which hit the charts at No. 12.\n\nDetails: 5 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 23.

Co-founding guitarist Jeff Hanneman died in 2013, but they soldiered on with Exodus guitarist Gary Holt on last year’s excellent “Repentless,” a suitably punishing tribute to Hanneman’s memory that Punk News hailed as no less than “the best Slayer album of the 21st century.”\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 26.

Released in 1995, their self-titled debut went double platinum and spawned the classic Modern Rock hits \"Only Happy When It Rains\" and \"Stupid Girl.\" They’re touring on a new release, “Strange Little Birds,” which hit the streets in June and spawned their latest Top 40 appearance on Billboard’s alternative songs chart, “Empty.”\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 27.

And like the Beatles, who also had great accents, this New Zealand duo knew just when to quit — which in their case, was after two seasons of staking their claim as the most consistently inspired purveyors of musical comedy ever. They still tour, though, on occasion, having last played Phoenix in 2013 on a bill that also featured Dave Chappelle. Billed as the Flight of the Conchords Sing Flight of the Conchords Tour, this latest run of dates will feature the debut of new material.\n\nDetails: Friday, Oct. 28. Comerica Theatre, 400 W.

That song remained his biggest hit until the triple-platinum triumph of “Honey, I’m Good,” his first and only Top 10 entry on the Hot 100.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Friday, Oct. 28.

It's still a good deal | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nSuper Bowl commercials are more expensive than ever. But for advertisers, they’re a better deal than ever.\n\nNBC — which is broadcasting this year’s game — announced last week that it is sold out of Super Bowl ads, with multiple 30 second spots having sold for a record $7 million each.\n\nWhy would advertisers spend $7 million on one ad? Because it’s the Super Bowl — a broadcast that is still watched by roughly 100 million viewers, even as ratings for some other big sporting events are falling.\n\nNothing in the media world comes close to getting companies the exposure that the Super Bowl can. That’s increasingly important as the media landscape grows more fragmented, according to Patrick Crakes, a former Fox Sports executive turned media consultant.\n\n“The fractionalization of attention because of streaming and social media makes the Super Bowl more important than ever,” Crakes told CNN Business. “If you’re in business with the NFL and you’re advertising during the Super Bowl, you’re a real player.”\n\nCrakes added that there’s also examples of the big game “helping build brands.”\n\n“Think about a company like GoDaddy. GoDaddy invested in the Super Bowl for years, did a lot of crazy things to get attention inside it, and it helped their business,” he said. “I think it’s a great investment, even at this price tag.”\n\n“You’re getting close to $500 million”\n\nThe Super Bowl — and the ads that come with it — is also a great investment for networks.\n\nWe don’t know yet what NBC will make in terms of ad revenue for this year’s broadcast. However, it’ll likely be a sizable chunk of change, according to Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.\n\n“You’re likely looking at about 70 ads, so you’re getting pretty close to $500 million in ad revenue from the game for NBC,” Calkins told CNN Business. “And that, by the way, is just during the game. That doesn’t count before the game, after the game and all of the other opportunities there are to run additional advertising.”\n\nFor example, last year’s Super Bowl notched $434.5 million of in-game ad revenue, according to research firm Kantar. That’s more than the World Series and NBA finals and second only to the Olympic Games, which take place over a span of weeks.\n\nKantar noted that this year’s game — which pits the Cincinnati Bengals against the Los Angeles Rams — is projected to surpass last year’s numbers. (NBC shares the Super Bowl rights with the NFL’s other TV partners every couple of years.)\n\n“$500 million is a lot of money for anyone, but in the world of media, Super Bowl spots are in a whole other level,” Calkins said. “That is why the NFL is such a valuable sports franchise, because there’s this ability to charge advertisers this much to be on these events.”\n\n“A lot of people watching the Super Bowl don’t really care about the game”\n\nTV is going through a rapid transformation because of the streaming revolution, but the NFL continues to be one of the ratings bedrocks for traditional networks.\n\nThe league’s viewership for the 2021 regular season was up roughly 10% overall from last year, bringing in an average of 17.1 million viewers per game.\n\nThat is the highest regular season average since 2015, according to the league, and comes at a time when ratings for other big live events — such as awards shows — are experiencing record lows.\n\nCalkins explained that for networks like NBC there’s “two big benefits” to being in business with the NFL and broadcasting the Super Bowl. The first is the surplus of ad revenue and the other is “NBC will use this opportunity to support the rest of their lineup” via promos before, during and after the game.\n\n“For NBC, the Super Bowl is an event that they can use to jump start the rest of their lineup as they go into the spring and the rest of the year,” he said.\n\nCalkins added that “a number of years ago, people said, ‘the Super Bowl is going to fade away. It’s getting unsustainable.’ It’s completely the reverse.”\n\n“The Super Bowl is more and more important because it’s a shared experience,” Calkins said. “And what’s interesting is a lot of people watching the Super Bowl don’t even really care about the game. They’re watching the ads.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/Ad-Meter/buzz-meter/2023/02/12/he-gets-us-super-bowl-ad-commercial-jesus/11243476002/", "title": "Super Bowl commercials for Jesus? How were 'He Gets Us' ads ...", "text": "Amid the snack treat, booze, car and gambling pitches, the service of extending a brand on Super Bowl Sunday nudged an unlikely figure into the spotlight of what’s often referred to as the USA’s biggest secular holiday.\n\nJesus Christ.\n\nSunday’s game got two doses, the first coming midway through the second quarter with Patsy Cline’s soaring vocals serving as the backdrop for a 30-second advertisement for 'He Gets Us', a group touting itself as a “movement to reintroduce people to the Jesus of the Bible and his confounding love and forgiveness.”\n\n'He Gets Us' aired two spots within a broadcast charging $7 million for 30 seconds. In the first, He Gets Us urges viewers to “be childlike” while replaying still and moving images of children, ranging from reuniting after quarantine to bathroom etiquette to sharing headphones on a bus. A 60-second ad later in the game interspersed images of anger and perceived division to tout a message of inclusion.\n\nAD METER:Everything to know for the big game's commercials\n\nNEWSLETTER: Get the latest sports news straight to your inbox\n\nNot unlike well-known beer brands advertising on the big game, Christianity remains the dominant religious force in the USA, though leaders are concerned about brand diminishment in an increasingly stratified landscape. That’s in part what created the conditions for a pair of decidedly sobering ads that may have killed a buzz or two throughout the land.\n\nWhat sort of reception did the ads get?\n\nThe 30-second and 60-second ads run by 'He Gets Us' placed eighth and 15th, respectively, in USA TODAY's Ad Meter, which ranks commercials by consumer rating.\n\nIt also generated some social-media buzz, with \"Christian Super Bowl\" among the trending topics on Twitter on Monday morning. Though the tenor of that buzz was mixed, with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., among those criticizing the ads.\n\n\"Something tells me Jesus would *not* spend millions of dollars on Super Bowl ads to make fascism look benign,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\nWhat is 'He Gets Us'?\n\nHe Gets Us claims not to be “'left’ or ‘right’ or a political organization of any kind,” nor does it claim affiliation with a particular denomination. The group is a non-profit 501(c)(3) and a subsidiary of Servant Foundation.\n\nWhat’s the Servant Foundation?\n\nServant Foundation is a Kansas-based non-profit that reported $405 million in total revenue for fiscal year 2020. From 2018-2020, Servant Foundation donated more than $50 million to the Alliance Defending Freedom, a non-profit known for fighting abortion rights and non-discrimination laws, according to Lever News.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center listed the Alliance Defending Freedom as an anti-LGBTQ hate group in 2016, citing the ADF’s support of criminalizing homosexuality and approval of imprisoning LGBTQ individuals for engaging in consensual sex.\n\nADF told USA TODAY it \"categorically rejects\" this classification by the SPLC, calling it a \"deliberate mischaracterization of our work.\"\n\nWho donates to 'He Gets Us'?\n\nWhile the group’s donors are largely anonymous, a significant figure publicly acknowledged his family was one of its biggest backers. Hobby Lobby founder and billionaire David Green informed talk show host Glenn Beck his family was helping fund the ads.\n\nGreen and Hobby Lobby won a significant victory in 2014 when the Supreme Court ruled that Hobby Lobby and other “closely held corporations” can continue to deny providing health insurance coverage for some or all forms of birth control based on religious objections. The ruling affected more than 60 million American workers at the time.\n\n“You’re going to see it at the Super Bowl—‘He gets Us,’ ” Green told Beck. “We are wanting to say—we being a lot of people—that he gets us. He understands us. He loves who we hate. I think we have to let the public know and create a movement.”\n\nWhy does Jesus need a PR guy?\n\nIn short, like anyone else – to trump up interest in a brand some see diminishing.\n\n“It fits with our target audience really well,” He Gets Us campaign spokesperson Jason Vanderground told The Associated Press in the leadup to Sunday's game. “We’re trying to get the message across to people who are spiritually open, but skeptical.”\n\nIn a September 2022 modeling, the Pew Research Center estimates that if Christians in the USA continue leaving religion at its current rate, Christians of all ages will shrink from the current 64% to “between a little more than half (54%) and just above one-third (35%) of all Americans by 2070.”\n\nThe study also estimates that if current trends continue, those identifying with no religion will increase from the current 30% to “somewhere between 34% and 52% of the U.S. population.”\n\nContributing: Tom Schad", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/02/07/super-bowl-ad-costs-soar----but-so-does-buzz/79903058/", "title": "Super Bowl ad costs soar — but so does buzz", "text": "Chris Woodyard\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThis Super Bowl won't be just about game statistics. The numbers associated with the off-field action — the commercials — are equally important, especially to the marketers that spend up to $5 million for 30 seconds of air time.\n\nThe important figures will take many forms, ranging from how many people watched commercials during the TV broadcast to what percentage of those viewers can remember the brand names in the ads they saw. Marketers, of course, want to air ads that boost their brand as well as bolster sales.\n\nWith so much money at stake, advertisers have to play an inside game in search of a touchdown, not a fumble, when it comes to ads that break through. They will look at survey data and statistics like these:\n\nTV Audience. Last year, 114 million viewers saw the game -- and all those ads, Nielsen says. About 54 million, or 47%, were women.\n\nPre-game views. Given the immense cost to air Super Bowl ads, most companies release them ahead of time. As of Friday, YouTube said about 40 ads and more than 130 teasers had been posted. It says those who post their ads in advance get 2.2 times more views than those who wait until game day.\n\nAudience engagement. Some 17.7% of adults say ads are the most important part of the Super Bowl, according to Prosper Insights and Analytics, which conducted a survey for the National Retail Federation. That's almost half as many who cite the game itself, at 34.7%. For others, the food and getting together with friends is the main draw. Almost one-fourth (23%) say they don't watch the game.\n\nOne in eight people view Super Bowl ads as entertainment, according to the Prosper/NRF survey. Nearly 18% say the ads make them aware of advertisers’ brands and 10.3% said they influence their buying decisions.\n\nFree publicity. It's not just the ad itself. Companies count on a wave of free publicity from TV shows, magazines, newspapers and websites. Many of those outlets also pay the most attention to the celebrities featured in the ads, who often have huge numbers of Twitter followers and other social media presence. \"Celebrities help you reach even more people, in fresher, newer ways,\" says Dean Evans, Hyundai's chief marketing officer.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/01/08/super-bowl-ads-4-million-dollars/1818257/", "title": "Some Super Bowl ads cost record $4M, CBS says", "text": "Laura Petrecca, USA TODAY\n\nCEO Moonves says spots are practically sold out\n\nBut . . . network may still take late sales requests\n\nAdvertisers include Pepsi, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch , GoDaddy, Lincoln, Skechers, etc.\n\nCBS has unveiled its game plan for covering the Feb. 3 Super Bowl action, and also disclosed that it's practically out of commercial time for the Big Game.\n\n\"We are sold out,\" CBS Corp. CEO Leslie Moonves said during a CBS media event on Tuesday. But he did leave a bit of wiggle room for last-minute advertisers who wanted to buy time in the game, saying that the network still had the ability to meet late sales requests.\n\nHe also said that some 30-second ad units sold for more than $4 million each.\n\n\"These numbers are the highest ever paid for Super Bowl spots,\" Moonves said.\n\nBig Game advertisers include car makers, soft-drink producers, fast-food companies and sportswear firms. Pepsi, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch , GoDaddy, Lincoln, and Skechers are among the many in the game.\n\nMoonves said local TV ad sales were robust as well. In the New York market -- where both the Jets and the Giants didn't even make it to the playoffs -- some 30-second ad slots on WCBS sold for more than $1 million each.\n\nMoonves pointed out the large, engaged Super Bowl audience, and said that for many, Super Sunday is a national holiday.\n\nIt's \"truly extraordinary\" what this event means to America, he said.\n\nFor its Super Bowl XLVII coverage, the network is pulling together resources from its sports, news and entertainment divisions. Programming -- which will begin the week before the Big Game -- will not only focus on the actual Super Bowl, but also on the cuisine, architecture and culture of the game's host city New Orleans.\n\nContent will run on platforms such as broadcast TV, cable TV, radio and digital. The halftime show will be shown on TV as well as streamed live.\n\nAt Tuesday's media presentation, CBS media executives and sports announcers kept the atmosphere light, frequently joking around and poking fun of one another.\n\nAt one point during the event, the name of this year's Super Bowl's halftime performer -- Beyoncé Knowles -- came up.\n\nMoonves was quick to jump in with his own joshing commentary: \"I actually wanted Janet Jackson,\" he said, referring back to Jackson's controversial halftime show of 2004 when she had an infamous breast-baring \"wardrobe malfunction.\"\n\nCBS aired the Super Bowl that year, and took some heat for the mishap.

Super Bowl slots fetch about twice the cost of the second-most-costly ad time — the Academy Awards, he says, which go for about $1.8 million this year.\n\nCBS reported a sell-out of its Super Bowl ad time last week.\n\nOne reason for the price hikes — and the sell-outs: Folks watch them. Unlike any other show, Super Bowl advertisers get an audience that stays around during the commercials.\n\nLast year, only seven out of every 1,000 viewers turned the station during Super Bowl commercial breaks, says Swallen. That's at least five times lower than the normal \"tune away\" rate for commercials aired during normal TV programming, which is 30 to 40 per thousand viewers, says Swallen.\n\nAfter all, says Swallen, with 110 million viewers, half of Super Bowl watchers are tuning in for the ads.\n\nSo it should be no surprise that the number — and total running time — of Super Bowl ads keeps growing.\n\nThe past three Super Bowls have been the most ad-saturated ever, says Swallen, with each containing more than 47 minutes of ad time. That is not just paying sponsors, but also \"house ads\" that networks air to promote their own shows.\n\nTypically, the networks run 25 to 30 ads to promote their own shows during the Super Bowl.\n\nThe number of paid commercials keeps growing, too, with NBC airing 62 during last year's game totaling 40.5 minutes of ad time. That compares with 36.45 minutes of ad time a decade ago in 2002.\n\nThere's another reason for the commercial creep: rising costs.\n\nThe fees that the National Football League charges the networks to broadcast the Super Bowls keeps rising. So the networks not only charge more for the ads, but also often air more of them to recoup the costs, says Swallen.\n\nThe risk for advertisers, he warns: Their ads may get lost in the clutter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2018/01/05/papa-johns-super-bowl-advertising/1007680001/", "title": "Super Bowl without Papa John?

And if it does, it's still unclear whether Schnatter would even be featured in the ad.\n\nThat would be a switch. Schnatter has been the most recognizable face in the chain's ads for many sporting events and especially on Super Bowl Sunday, the biggest day of the year for pizza sales as customers buy millions of pies from chains and independent operators.\n\nThirty-second ads during the Super Bowl cost more than $2 million, significant cash even for Papa John’s, where the yearly marketing and promotional budget exceeds $160 million.\n\nDec. 22:Papa John or 'Papa Gone'? Twitter reacts as CEO John Schnatter steps down\n\nDec. 21:Papa John's CEO, pizza titan John Schnatter, steps down\n\nBrandon Rhoten, the chain's chief marketing officer, said in an emailed response to questions Thursday that Super Bowl advertising might be a game-time decision for the company this go-around.\n\n\"We currently do not have a Super Bowl spot booked or produced, but are exploring our options in and around the game,\" he said.\n\nRhoten added, \"I didn’t buy my Super Bowl spot last year until the Monday before the game, so you never know.”\n\nThe company appears to be stepping lightly after Schnatter fumbled a November earnings call by blaming his company's lagging sales on the NFL's decline in popularity amid player protests during the national anthem. Schnatter was roundly ridiculed on social media after the call, with some saying the decline was because of the quality of the pizza.\n\nThen white supremacists crowned Papa John’s the official pizza of the alt-right — sharing an image of a pizza topped with a swastika fashioned with pepperoni slices. It forced Papa John’s officials to release a statement disavowing the endorsement.\n\nNov. 15:Papa John's CEO apologizes to NFL, players for comments; blasts white supremacists\n\nNov. 6:Papa John's condemns endorsement from white supremacist publication\n\nAnd while the company remains the official sponsor of the NFL — the sponsorship deal was renewed in 2016 for undisclosed financial terms — it apparently has been reconsidering whether tying its fortunes to the league and its big game is a good idea.\n\nRhoten told Ad Age, an advertising trade publication, that the company has been distancing itself by removing NFL imagery and \"official sponsor\" wording from ads. He also said the company is evaluating whether to continue as the official pizza sponsor of the NFL and the Super Bowl.\n\nThe company also is airing more 15-second spots highlighting the pizza chain rather than 30-second spots about football and stars such as ex-quarterback Peyton Manning.\n\nThe goal is to avoid tying the company’s fortunes to partners such as the NFL, Rhoten told Ad Age. \"We can't be beholden to their success. ... We'll take advantage of it, and when they win, we'll win. But when they're not doing as well, we don't want to suffer.\"\n\nNov. 1:Papa John's CEO blames NFL for declining sales due to mishandling of anthem protests\n\nAug. 7:Papa John's sells a gluten-free pizza that people with serious gluten intolerance can't eat\n\nHe was noncommittal on whether Schnatter will appear in ads around the Super Bowl or thereafter. Rhoten said Schnatter is still integral to the Papa John's story but added the “the brand has some room for flexibility.”\n\nThis year, Papa John’s executives hinted that they may have some fun by mixing in a fresh face in rapper Lil Jon. His Twitter account carried a tweet Dec. 22 joking that he’d accept the CEO job and could “start immediately.”\n\nA Twitter exchange led to phone calls between Laundry Service, Papa John's new creative contractor, the company and the rapper. Lil Jon's account later carried a cryptic update about Papa John’s late last month: “Excited for the future” with a handshake emoji.\n\nFans who don't know about Lil Jon more likely will be watching for Big John in the Super Bowl's ads. If there's no Schnatter, that could be even more telling.\n\nFollow Grace Schneider on Twitter: @gesinfk", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/super/2017/05/09/super-bowl-olympics-winter-advertising-pyeongchang-nbc/101469776/", "title": "NBC looking to sell Super Bowl, Olympics ad combos", "text": "Kevin Spain\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nTo ease the burden of Super Bowl advertising, NBC will offer advertisers a package to run their ad during Super Bowl LII as well as during the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, less than a week later.\n\nThe cost of advertising during the Super Bowl has increased every year since advertisers paid $42,000 for Super Bowl I in 1967.

McCall\n\nAdvertisers have lined up again this year to spend huge dollars on commercials that will air during Sunday’s Super Bowl. They might as well dump those dollars in the Hudson River as they cross the bridge from Madison Avenue on the way to MetLife Stadium.\n\nA 30-second commercial on the Fox Super Bowl broadcast will cost $4 million. That’s up $1 million in just four years. It’s the most expensive time on television, and all commercial availabilities have been sold.\n\nViewers who have little interest in football will flock to their televisions to watch the Super Bowl commercials, hoping to see this pop culture art form at its best. In spite of the hype and anticipation each year, the commercials often disappoint. As a group, Super Bowl commercials are overproduced and offbeat, have too many special effects and present little focus on the actual product.\n\nLast year’s Super Bowl commercials were creatively unimpressive and practically insignificant. The GoDaddy commercial featured nerdy Walter in a sloppy kiss with supermodel Bar Refaeli. A Doritos commercial showed grown men dressing up like princesses. The commercial for Oreos depicted a brawl at a library. Library brawls always make people want to buy cookies.\n\nBeyond the stupid factor in many Super Bowl commercials, however, is the negative social messaging found in some of these expensive, high-profile ads. Last year’s Taco Bell commercial portrayed senior citizens who escaped a retirement home in a mocking and clownish manner. Commercials for Axe Apollo and Speed Stick deodorants portrayed women in highly sexualized ways.\n\nThe companies wasting money to place ads in the broadcast apparently don’t realize how hard it is to get Super Bowl viewers to focus on commercials. Many viewers watch the big game at parties, in large groups or in bars. The noise and distractions in these settings make it difficult for viewers to follow the commercial story line or get the product’s message.\n\nData from the Nielsen media research firm confirm this recall problem. Surveys conducted after the 2013 Super Bowl asked viewers to reflect on the commercials aired. Of the commercials researched, viewers could identify the product’s brand name less than 14 percent of the time. And this level of brand name recognition is worth $4 million per 30 seconds?\n\nThe most effective ad from last year’s Super Bowl, as measured by media analytics firm Ace Metrix, was for Budweiser. Budweiser has historically produced memorable Super Bowl ads because the storylines are easy to follow. In addition, the Budweiser logo and the starring Clydesdales are unmistakable identifiers for the product.\n\nAdvertisers today want to get as much publicity as possible out of their Super Bowl buys, so they tease out previews of the commercials through the Internet. Fans of Stephen Colbert probably can’t wait to see the Comedy Central comedian stooping to promote pistachios. Colbert should have an easy time topping last year’s Super Bowl pistachio commercial featuring Psy, the Gangnam style flash in the pan. The Psy ad was rated by Ace Metrix as one of the least effective.\n\nKia has hired Laurence Fishburne to connect his “Matrix” movie fame and character to the automaker. Never mind that “The Matrix” was released in 1999, and football fans who aren’t into cyberpunk science fiction won’t get the significance of a red key vs. blue key reference.\n\nJaguar’s first-ever Super Bowl commercial will push its F-Type R coupe. The car’s base price is about $70,000, which eliminates virtually all football viewers from the potential customer pool. Target marketing this is not.\n\nThus, it appears Madison Avenue has lost its mind when it comes to Super Bowl advertising. The ad agencies are more focused on creative razzmatazz than on moving products off store shelves. The commercials might win production awards that advertising associations hand out to each other, but that won’t help the bottom lines for corporations paying too much for 30 seconds with false hopes of increasing sales. And companies that get their ads placed in the fourth quarter of a lopsided game are really wasting their money.\n\nMcCall is a professor of communication at DePauw University in Greencastle, and author of “Viewer Discretion Advised: Taking Control of Mass Media Influences.” Contact him at jeffmccall@depauw.edu.

What are you most excited for: the sport, the food, or the commercials? That much may be up for debate, but if you're one of the Super Bowl advertisers putting the finishing touches on your outrageously expensive advertisements, we know what you're most wired for.\n\nKantar Media released its latest marketing progress report for the 2014 Super Bowl last week, and the firm's data illuminated that companies are still more willing than ever to cough up the big bucks to get their name on the big screen when there is a break in the football action. Kantar reports that from 2004 through 2013, the Super Bowl game has generated $2 billion of network advertising sales from more than 130 marketers, and this year is not expected to upset any kind of sales. The average rate for a 30-second advertisement in the big game has increased by more than 70% during the past decade, reaching $4 million in 2013, and the firm expects even slightly higher pricing for the 2014 game on account of sustained healthy demand.\n\nAD METER:Welcome to this year's Super Bowl Ad Meter\n\nSo, who has already put down the deposit for the expensive face-time at this year's Super Bowl? Here are the top five Super Bowl advertisers that have spent $437 million on advertising during past games, and will make an appearance again on the first Sunday of February. Though the broadcaster of this year's championship game, Fox (FOX), has already enjoyed the payoff from a host of new first-time advertisers this year, these five companies highlighted by Kantar Media have continued to shell out the most cash and deliver the most memorable commercials.\n\n1. Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD)\n\nComing in first as the top Super Bowl advertiser is Anheuser-Busch InBev, the brewer of the beverage that many will be enjoying at next month's big game. The St. Louis, Missouri-based brewing company nabs the top spot with its five game appearances from 2009 to 2013 and $145.9-million price tag. Let that sink in a little. Anheuser's investment is more than double what Hyundai, Chrysler, and Coca-Cola have all paid, and it is almost $50 million more than what its closest competitor, Pepsi, has shelled out for the big game.\n\nIt's difficult to understand how one company can justify that significant of a payoff for a few 30-second ads, but Anheuser-Busch continues to do so year after year, and somehow, we think the beer giant probably know what it's doing. The brewer has maintained that one of its biggest drivers of success continues to be its innovating marketing and advertising efforts, and considering the entertaining commercials Anheuser has rolled out as of late, we're certainly not complaining.\n\n2. PepsiCo\n\nBack to the food and beverage industry, we come to Coke's biggest rival, Pepsi. Despite taking second place to Coke when it comes to global domination of the soda market, Pepsi blows past its competition in the Super Bowl advertising game, spending more than $3 million more on its expensive advertisements from 2009 to 2013. Kantar Media reports that Pepsi has enjoyed five consecutive appearances during those 5 years, and it has a $97-million tab to prove it.\n\nThis year, Pepsi will make its mark on the Super Bowl again, sponsoring yet another halftime show, and it is likely that the company will show up big. As aforementioned, it is now more important than ever for Pepsi to connect with viewers and pull them back in under the Pepsi roof, and the beverage giant recognizes the Super Bowl as the perfect time to do just that.\n\n3. Hyundai\n\nNext up, we come to another auto company that even pulls ahead of Chrysler's investment in Super Bowl advertisements. Hyundai stands as the third top advertiser at the Super Bowl, according to Kantar Media, and has its five consecutive appearances from 2009 to 2013 and $67.4-million expense to thank for that. That's quite a price tag for the South Korean auto company to swallow, but Hyundai is expected to make yet another splash on the TV screen this year on February 2, and interestingly enough, Ad Weekreports that it has even enlisting celebrities to help it do it this time. Hyundai has typically shied away from featuring celebrities in its ads, but this year, those who tune in to the game should expect three celebrities to star in one of two Hyundai's 30-second commercials.\n\n4. Chrysler\n\nSwitching gears (no pun intended) to the auto industry, we come to Chrysler Group, the company that takes the spot for fourth biggest advertiser at the big game. Headquartered in Auburn Hills, Michigan, this auto company has made four Super Bowl advertising appearances during the past five years from 2009 to 2013, and it has spent a whopping $64.3 million, up $2 million from what Coke paid for its five appearances. Auto companies have been known to especially take advantage of the commercial air-time during Super Bowl games, and Chrysler's big commercial in 2013 drew significant attention, from all farmers and non-farmers alike. It'll be interesting to see what the auto giant comes up with this year, as past history would dictate that it'll probably be something worth watching.\n\n5. Coca-Cola (KO)\n\nComing up first is a company that has won favor from both kids and adults: the Coca-Cola Co. This beverage and snack food giant is the fifth biggest Super Bowl advertiser, and spent $62.3 million on its ads in the time period from 2009 to 2013. Within those five years, its ads have appeared on the Super Bowl big screen all five times.\n\nThat's a hefty amount of money for just about any company to hand over for advertising purposes, especially for five consecutive years, but Coca-Cola has been known to maintain a significant focus on its marketing efforts, and its biggest rival PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP), isn't exactly a shy advertiser, either. This year, both companies will go after the Super Bowl spotlight once again as they currently navigate the effects of consumers switching over from their sugar-laden drinks to more healthful beverage options. It is now more important than ever for these companies to make a lasting impression on viewers, and consdering the Super Bowl provides the one time that audiences have been known to stick around during commercial breaks, Coca-Cola is ready to take advantage. Kantar Media reports that in the 2013 game, the percentage of audience tuneaway during the average commercial was only 0.7 percent, making the highprice tag that much more worth it for companies like Coca-Cola.\n\nWall St. Cheat Sheet is a\n\nUSA TODAY\n\ncontent partner offering financial news and commentary.

The people of Kenya have won because we have raised the political bar. The people of Kenya are the biggest winners,” he said\n\nHe expressed his “gratitude” to Kenyan citizens “who refused to be boxed into tribal cocoons.”\n\nHe also thanked his competitor and veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, and said: “We dwelled on issues and tried to sell an agenda to the people of Kenya during the campaign.”\n\n“It was God that brought us here … my team and I will make sure that the sacrifices made by many Kenyans is not in vain …I will run a transparent, open, democratic government and I will work with the opposition to the extent that they provide oversight over my administration,” he added.\n\nThere was a divided response to the presidential election results in Kenya on Monday evening. In Eldoret, live pictures from Ruto’s hometown showed large crowds celebrating and cheering his win.\n\nBut in Kisumu, Odinga’s stronghold, protests erupted. Live images showed scores protesting the election results, tires on fire and smoke billowing in the air.\n\nOdinga’s running mate Martha Karua also took to Twitter following the results announcement and said: “It is not over till it is over.”\n\nResidents look at newspapers displayed at a stand in Mathare, Nairobi, on August 12, 2022, following Kenya's general election.

I would like to express my appreciation to everyone who contributed to smooth & peaceful elections,” Farmaajo said in a Twitter post.\n\nMohamud has enjoyed an outpouring of goodwill messages on his victory, including one from the Prime Minister of neighboring Ethiopia, Abiy Ahmed.\n\n“I would like to congratulate former President @HassanSMohamud on being re-elected as the President of the Federal Republic of Somalia. I look forward to working closely with you on common bilateral and regional interests,” Abiy tweeted Monday.\n\nThe presidential election had been delayed for more than a year due to a political crisis compounded by the power tussle between Farmaajo and the suspended Prime Minister Mohamed Hussein Roble.\n\nThe incoming government would aim to contain Somalia’s burgeoning challenges bequeathed by the Farmaajo administration. Somalia is facing its worst drought in decades and grapples with high costs of living and a resurgent Al-Shabaab Islamist sect that continues to launch lethal attacks across swathes of the country, including the capital Mogadishu.\n\nThe returning president, Mohamud, accused Farmaajo of failing to rein in the deadly terrorist group since he assumed power in 2017.\n\n“Farmajo promised to eradicate Al-Shabaab from Somalia in just two years when he took office in 2017. He also promised victims of terrorism his government would swiftly compensate them. Nevertheless, this has proven another broken promise,” Mohamud wrote in an article he authored in the run-up to the presidential election, adding that “…Somalia in 2022 should be better secured against Al-Shabaab and better integrated and governed as a federal state.”\n\nLong designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, Al-Shabaab has fought to topple the central government and establish a rule based on its strict interpretation of Islam’s Sharia law.\n\nEarlier in May, the brutal sect overran a major military base housing the African Union forces in Mogadishu, killing a number of Burundian peacekeepers.", "authors": ["Nimi Princewill"], "publish_date": "2022/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/politics/donald-trump-tax-returns-released/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump: Key takeaways from six years of former president's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSix years of Donald Trump’s federal tax returns released on Friday show the former president paid very little in federal income taxes the first and last year of his presidency, claiming huge losses that helped limit his tax bill, among other revelations.\n\nThe returns, long shrouded in secrecy, were released to the public on Friday by the House Ways and Means Committee, the culmination of a battle over their disclosure that went to the Supreme Court. They confirm a report issued from the Joint Committee on Taxation that Trump claimed large losses before and throughout his presidency that he carried forward to reduce or practically eliminate his tax burden. For example, his returns show that he carried forward a $105 million loss in 2015 and $73 million in 2016.\n\nThe thousands of pages of documents from the former president’s personal and business federal tax returns – which spanned the years 2015 through 2020 – provide a complex web of raw data about Trump’s finances, offering up many questions about his wealth and income that could be pursued both by auditors and Trump’s political opponents.\n\nHere are key takeaways from the documents reviewed by CNN:\n\nReturns shed light on questionable tax claims\n\nTrump’s returns also show the former president made several claims that auditors may question.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation, which reviewed the returns, flagged that Trump claimed a large number of questionable items on his tax returns, including eyebrow-raising amounts of interest he claims to have received from loans to his children that the bipartisan committee said could indicate Trump was disguising gifts.\n\nThe JCT argued that an auditor should investigate the loan agreements Trump made with his children, including the interest rates. If the interest Trump claims to have charged his children was not at market rate, for example, it could be considered a gift for tax purposes, requiring him to pay a higher tax rate on the money.\n\nIn each year of his presidency, for example, Trump claimed he received exactly $18,000 in interest on a loan he said he gave his daughter Ivanka Trump and $8,715 in interest from his son Donald Trump, Jr.. In 2017 to 2019, Trump said he received exactly $24,000 from his son Eric Trump, and Eric paid him $19,605 in interest in 2020.\n\nThat raises the question of whether “the loans were bona fide arm’s length transactions, or whether the transfers were disguised gifts that could trigger gift tax and a disallowance of interest deductions by the related borrowers,” the JCT said in its report.\n\n“It’s unusual to have interest in round numbers – very rare,” said Martin Sheil, former supervisory special agent for IRS’ Criminal Investigation unit. “An auditor would want to see payments, loan agreements and interest rates.”\n\nThere are also questions about Trump’s returns listing an identical amount of company expenses and income.\n\nFor example, in 2017, Trump claimed his business DJT Aerospace LLC, which operates Trump’s personal helicopter, claimed $42,965 in income. It also claimed the exact same amount – $42,965 – in expenses. In other words, every single dollar – to the dollar – that the company earned was negated by the company’s expenses, such as payroll, fuel and other items. That left the company with zero income – and nothing to tax.\n\n“Total expenses equaling total income is a statistical impossibility,” said Shiel, who added that the figures are not evidence something illegal was done. “It just doesn’t happen.”\n\nThe JCT in its report raised several similar questions. For example, it noted IRS auditors were investigating multiple so-called large unusual questionable items on Trump’s tax returns for which the regulator wanted Trump to provide supporting evidence to back up his claims.\n\nRelease comes after years-long fight\n\nThe returns were obtained by the Democratic-run Ways and Means Committee only a few weeks ago after a protracted legal battle that lasted nearly four years. The committee voted last week to release the tax returns, but their release was delayed to redact sensitive personal information like Social Security numbers.\n\nThe release of the tax returns follows a pursuit for the documents that had typically been made public voluntarily by past US presidents. Trump and his legal team continuously sought to keep his returns secret, arguing that Congress had never wielded its legislative powers to demand a president’s tax returns, which Trump said could have far-reaching implications.\n\n“The Democrats should have never done it, the Supreme Court should have never approved it, and it’s going to lead to horrible things for so many people,” Trump said in a statement following the release.\n\n“The ‘Trump’ tax returns once again show how proudly successful I have been and how I have been able to use depreciation and various other tax deductions as an incentive for creating thousands of jobs and magnificent structures and enterprises.”\n\nOther Republicans also criticized Democrats’ efforts in pursuit of the tax returns as political, with Texas Rep. Kevin Brady – the committee’s top conservative – saying the release would amount to “a dangerous new political weapon that reaches far beyond the former president and overturns decades of privacy protections for average Americans that have existed since the Watergate reform.”\n\nDuring the committee’s closed-door meeting last week, Republicans warned that the release of Trump’s tax returns by Democrats could prompt retribution once Republicans control the House next year – like going after the taxes of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.\n\n“I had countless people tell me of things that they were concerned with President Biden’s family dealings and how they believed that him and his family is enriched because of his political power. And they are begging for oversight and accountability on that,” said Rep. Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, according to excerpts the GOP released from the meeting. “Do we need to go down all that? Is that what you all are wishing to do?”\n\nReturns show he held foreign bank accounts while in office\n\nTrump reported having foreign bank accounts between 2015 and 2020, including a bank account in China between 2015 and 2017, his tax returns show.\n\nTrump was required to report the accounts to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The filings show that the former president maintained foreign bank accounts in countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and China.\n\nThe China bank account, which was reported by The New York Times in 2020, was tied to Trump International Hotels Management’s business push in the country, Trump Organization lawyer Alan Garten said at the time.\n\nThe 2020 disclosure of business dealings in China came as the Trump campaign sought to portray Biden as a “puppet” of China. Biden’s income tax returns and financial disclosures showed no business dealings or income from China.\n\nThe returns also show that Trump paid more in foreign taxes than in US federal income taxes in 2017, the first year of his presidency.\n\nIn 2017, Trump paid just $750 in US federal income taxes because of large carry-forward losses that he claimed in prior years, negating virtually all of his American tax liability. Yet Trump paid nearly $1 million in taxes to foreign countries that year.\n\nThe fact that Trump paid foreign taxes isn’t in itself surprising, but it shows how Trump’s companies and businesses interests span the globe, and how those businesses are subject to local tax laws and regulations.\n\nOn his tax return, Trump listed business income, taxes, expenses or other notable financial items in Azerbaijan, Panama, Canada, India, Qatar, South Korea, the United Kingdom, China, the Dominican Republic, United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, Grenada, US territory Puerto Rico, Georgia, Israel, Brazil, St. Maarten, Mexico, Indonesia, Ireland, Turkey, and St. Vincent.\n\nTrump claimed no charitable deductions in 2020\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump pledged he would donate the entirety of his $400,000 salary to charity each year. He frequently boasted about donating parts of his quarterly paycheck to various government agencies.\n\n“While the press doesn’t like writing about it, nor do I need them to, I donate my yearly Presidential salary of $400,000.00 to different agencies throughout the year,” Trump tweeted in March 2019.\n\nIf he donated his 2020 salary, he didn’t claim it on his taxes. Among the six years of tax returns the House Ways and Means Committee released, 2020 was the sole year in which Trump listed no donations to charity.\n\nTrump’s finances took a sizable hit in 2020, probably as a result of the pandemic and the lack of demand for vacations and lodging in his hotels. Trump reported large donations to charity in 2018 and 2019, helping reduce the amount he owed on millions of dollars in income he reported in those years.\n\nBut Trump posted a massive $4.8 million adjusted loss in 2020, a year, which alone wiped out his federal income tax obligation. Trump paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2020.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation raised questions about the accuracy of some enormous charitable deductions Trump claimed in previous years’ tax returns, including large and unsubstantiated cash gifts. Trump also claimed a $21.1 million deduction in 2015 for donating 158 acres of his 212-acre property called Seven Springs in North Castle, New York. That donation, which was made to a land trust, is a focus of the Manhattan district attorney’s criminal investigation of the Trump Organization’s finances.\n\nTrump’s own 2017 tax law appears to have reduced the amount he was able to deduct from tax bill\n\nTrump claimed that the 2017 Republican tax plan he championed and signed would cost him and his family “a fortune.” It’s not clear that it did, but it does appear to have limited the amount that he could claim in one part of his complex tax return.\n\nThe 2017 tax law capped the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, at $10,000 a year. In previous years, tax filers were allowed to deduct more of their SALT payments. Although the law was passed in 2017, it didn’t apply until the 2018 tax year.\n\nIn 2018, Trump listed $10.5 million in state and local taxes, but could deduct just $10,000 of that from his taxes. In 2019, Trump paid $8.4 million in SALT but was capped at $10,000. And in 2020, Trump said he paid $8.5 million in SALT but claimed the maximum allowable $10,000.\n\nBy comparison, in 2016 and 2017, Trump was able to deduct significantly more from state and local taxes. For example, in 2016 and 2017, he deducted $5.2 million each year in SALT payments.\n\nSome Democrats criticized the 2017 tax law’s SALT cap for taking aim at residents in the Northeast and the West who have some of the highest property taxes in the country. The Tax Foundation found that property tax deductions capped in 2017 had previously accounted for about a third of all state and local tax deductions. But Trump defended the provision, saying the cap was necessary even if it would hurt his own finances.\n\nIt’s not clear how much the SALT cap hurt Trump, however. Although that particular deduction was capped, Trump claimed many other deductions that limited the amount of federal income taxes he had to pay.\n\nPresidential audits\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee, which is responsible for overseeing the IRS and writing tax policy, requested the returns under the authority of section 6103 of the US tax code. Their report focused primarily on whether Trump’s tax returns during his time in office were properly audited under the IRS’ mandatory audit program for US presidents.\n\nThe committee found that the IRS opened only one “mandatory” audit during Trump’s term – for his 2016 tax return. And that didn’t take place until the fall of 2019, after Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sent a letter asking the IRS for Trump’s returns and tax information. The report characterizes the presidential audit program as “dormant.”\n\n“The research that was done as it relates to the mandatory audit program was nonexistent,” Neal said last week following the committee vote.\n\nRepublicans on the committee argued that Democrats acknowledged it was “not necessary to publicly release the private tax information to change requirements on the presidential audit program.”\n\nA Republican dissent issued Friday warned that, “Democrats’ dangerous precedent will lead the American public to demand other people’s tax returns to be released.”\n\nLast week, the House passed a bill that would reform the presidential audit process in a largely symbolic vote before Republicans take the majority in the new Congress. The legislation is not expected to be taken up by the Senate before the new Congress is sworn in.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["David Goldman Jeremy Herb Jeanne Sahadi Maegan Vazquez", "David Goldman", "Jeremy Herb", "Jeanne Sahadi", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2020/08/13/ivory-coast-soccer-association-election-postponed/42207057/", "title": "Ivory Coast soccer association election postponed", "text": "AP\n\nABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — The Ivory Coast soccer association said Wednesday it has indefinitely postponed an election to choose a new president because of what it called “serious shortcomings” in the electoral process.\n\nThe election, which was planned for Sept. 5, has been hit by a series of problems.\n\nFormer Chelsea striker Didier Drogba is one of the candidates to lead the association but he was initially refused permission to stand because his candidature wasn't backed by the West African country's players' association.

As of Tuesday evening, national roads in at least 14 regions across the country have been blocked by protests, the National Police of Peru said in a statement.\n\nThe army has been deployed in Peru to protect public spaces across the country amid ongoing protests, according to a statement by Peruvian Defense Minister Luis Alberto Otárola on Tuesday evening.\n\n“The immediate protection by the Armed Forces of the strategic points of national assets, airports, hydroelectric plants and all that infrastructure that, due to its strategic value, serves to guarantee the life and subsistence of all Peruvians, has been ordered,” Otárola explained in a statement broadcast by Peru’s state-run media, Peru TV.\n\nCastillo's removal from power accelerated long-simmering political tensions in the country. Alessandro Cinque/Reuters\n\nThe defense minister also declared a state of emergency for the national road network.\n\n“We are going to assume control of the national road network throughout the country, to ensure the free transit of all Peruvians,” Otárola said.\n\nHe also said that a state of emergency has specifically been implemented in the southern cities of Arequipa and Ica, “so that the Armed Forces and the National Police can take control of the internal order.”\n\nHere’s what you need to know\n\nWhat has sparked Peru’s recent unrest?\n\nPeru was plunged into more political turmoil when Castillo was impeached and arrested on December 7, after he announced plans to dissolve Congress and install an emergency government ahead of a looming impeachment vote by lawmakers.\n\nBoluarte, his former vice president, has since become president, and on Monday proposed bringing general elections forward two years to April 2024 during a televised speech.\n\nCastillo’s removal from power accelerated long-simmering political tensions in the country. Since last week, demonstrations have erupted in cities across the country, sometimes marked by clashes with Peru’s security forces. Some are protesting in support of Castillo, while others want a total reset of the country with fresh general elections and a dissolution of Congress.\n\nWho is Pedro Castillo?\n\nElected in July 2021 by a narrow margin in a runoff, the former leftist leader promised “to govern with the people and for the people” but his short-lived presidency has largely focused on his own political survival.\n\nA former rural school teacher, Castillo survived two impeachment attempts in his first year as president and faces six ongoing investigations by the office of the National Prosecutor.\n\nHis government was mired in chaos since inauguration, with dozens of ministers appointed, replaced, sacked or resigned in little over a year – piling further pressure on the embattled president ahead of his ousting last week.\n\nCastillo has railed against the opposition for trying to remove him from the first day he was in office and accused Peru’s Attorney General, Patricia Benavides, of orchestrating what he called a new form of “coup d’état” against him.\n\nIn October, Benavides filed a constitutional complaint against him based on three of the six investigations her office had opened. The complaint allowed congress to carry out its own investigation against the former president.\n\nThe national prosecutor’s office has looked into a cascade of investigations on whether Castillo used his position to benefit himself, his family and closest allies by peddling influence to gain favor or preferential treatment, among other claims.\n\nCastillo has repeatedly denied all allegations and reiterated his willingness to cooperate with any investigation. He argues the allegations are a result of a witch-hunt against him and his family from groups that failed to accept his election victory.\n\nAre the protests violent?\n\nAt least seven people have died in the protests ongoing in Peru, according to a tweet from the health ministry on Wednesday.\n\nTwo minors are among those killed, Peru’s ombudsman’s press office said on Tuesday. And at least 47 individuals were hospitalized as a result of protests in the cities of Lima, Apurímac, Huancavelica and Arequipa, Peru’s Health Ministry tweeted.\n\nBoluarte on Tuesday called for calm to be restored to the country, and said that she had instructed police not to use any lethal arms against protesters.\n\n“Everyone has the right to protest but not to commit vandalism, burn hospitals, ambulances, police stations, assault airports, (these) are not normal protests, we have reached the extreme,” Boluarte added.\n\nWhat other disruption has the unrest caused?\n\nTrail and air travel across some regions of Peru has been affected by the demonstrations. Trains to and from Machu Picchu were suspended from Tuesday, rail operator PeruRail said in a statement.\n\n“We regret the inconvenience that these announcements generate for our passengers; however, they are due to situations beyond the control of our company and seek to prioritize the safety of passengers and workers,” the statement read.\n\nFlights have also been disrupted due to protests, with LATAM Airlines Peru announcing the temporary suspension of services to and from airports in the cities of Arequipa and Cuzco.\n\nProtesters attempted to storm the terminal at Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport in Cuzco on Monday, according to the Peruvian Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation (CORPAC).\n\nSo far there have been no reports of injuries, arrests or damage to the airport, according to CORPAC.\n\nWhat do the demonstrators want?\n\nDemonstrators have called for a general election, the dissolution of Congress, and the creation of a new constituent assembly.\n\nFernando Tuesta Soldevilla, a professor of political science at Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP), told CNN the protests represented a violent show of anger against “everything that has accumulated in the last few years: increasing social and economic ruptures.”\n\nHe added that protesters were also demonstrating over social and environmental issues, on top of their “furious rejection of Congress.”\n\nHowever Peruvian lawmakers hold the key to calling new elections and they are unlikely to do so as they would be voting themselves out of a job, according to Tuesta Soldevilla.\n\nWill Boluarte’s ascendency bring stability?\n\nPeru has been racked with political instability in recent years, with many Peruvians calling for political change, according to a September poll by the Institute of Peruvian Studies, which found 60% of those surveyed supported early elections to refresh both the presidency and Congress.\n\nIt is unclear if Boluarte’s ascendancy to the presidency can gain widespread political buy-in.\n\nBoluarte “does not have a recognized political career,” said Tuesta Soldevilla. “And without partisan support, political party or social organization behind her, she is weak from the beginning.”\n\n“Everyone knows when Dina Boluarte’s government began, but no one can be sure how long it will last,” he told CNN.\n\nBoluarte also doesn’t belong to a political party after she was expelled from Peru Libre due to internal disagreements.

Among them: expanding access to preschool and raising teacher pay.\n\nIn 2021, teachers made less than 77 cents on the dollar compared with other college graduates. Yet surveys show teachers work more than 50 hours a week on average. Close to 1 in 5 work elsewhere at another job. It's no surprise that nearly half of U.S. schools are short teachers. Some states and districts have proposed or enacted pay bumps but they've been modest at best.\n\nFederal legislation again before Congress this session would set a teacher salary floor of $60,000. While raising teacher pay has garnered the support of some Republicans, the American Teacher Act is unlikely to get far. In some states teachers make less than $50,000 on average.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nTeacher shortage:Amid crippling teacher shortages, some schools are turning to unorthodox solutions\n\nBiden urges lawmakers to protect abortion rights\n\nBiden called on lawmakers to “restore” abortion rights after the Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.\n\n“The vice president and I are doing everything to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient safety,” Biden said, noting that states across the country have implemented abortion bans and restrictions.\n\n“Make no mistake about it.

Tsay, who is in attendance, received a standing ovation from lawmakers as Biden acknowledged him.\n\n“He saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well,” Biden said. “Ban assault weapons once and for all.”\n\nMass shootings typically lead lawmakers to call for such actions but it’s unlikely that a ban will pass in a divided Congress with many Republican lawmakers who have vowed that they will not waver on gun control.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\n'Still too high':Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin orders independent panel to study military suicide\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene yells at Biden multiple times\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a fervent opponent of Biden who has called for his impeachment, yelled at him twice during the State of the Union address.\n\nThe first time came as Biden said Republicans want to cut Social Security and Medicare – an accusation that Greene refuted when she stood up yelled “Liar!”\n\nGreene later yelled, “China spied on us!” near the end of Biden’s speech.\n\nShe also yelled to “close the border” and “it’s your fault” when the president talked about the fentanyl crisis.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nHeckling lawmakers:Marjorie Taylor Greene, other Republicans spar with Biden over Social Security, Medicare\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nBiden on Tyre Nichols’ death: ‘Something good must come from this’\n\nBiden used his speech to pay tribute to Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBiden called for more police training and more resources to reduce violent crime, along with more investments in housing, education and training.\n\nNoting that Nichols’ mother and stepfather were seated in the first lady’s box, Biden urged lawmakers to commit themselves to making the words of Nichols’ mother come true: “Something good must come from this.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nTyre Nichols killing:7 more Memphis police employees under investigation in Tyre Nichols' death, city attorney says\n\nBiden invokes Uvalde massacre in call for gun reform\n\nIn a call to action on gun violence, Biden invoked his trip to Uvalde, Texas, after the Robb Elementary School shooting where 19 students and two teachers were killed.\n\n“Do something, do something. That was the plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde, I met with everyone.” Biden said, then pointing to the bipartisan gun reform law he signed. “Thank god we did.

She's suing police, the school district and a gunmaker.\n\nCOVID is under control but vigilance necessary, says Biden\n\nWhile COVID-19 deaths are down nearly 90%, and the end of the public health emergency is close, Biden said the country will remember the pain of losing loved ones will never go away for many.\n\n“Families grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table. We remember them, and we remain vigilant,” he said.\n\nBiden said it was important to remain vigilant and monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments. He urged Congress to fund these efforts and keep America safe.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nThe COVID emergency declaration is ending:What it means for tests, vaccines, treatment\n\nBiden: Police departments 'must be held accountable'\n\nSaying Tyre Nichols’ mother wants something good to come from his death at the hands of police officers in Memphis, Biden called for police reform.\n\n“When police officers or departments violate the public trust, they must be held accountable,” he said.\n\nBiden also pointed to an executive order he signed affecting federal officers that banned chokeholds, restricted no-knock warrants, and implemented “other key elements of the George Floyd Act.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nTyre Nichols:Ex-Memphis police officer took a photo of Tyre Nichols after beating, document says\n\nBiden urges Congress to act on labor reform\n\nBiden called for Congress to take up labor reform and worker protections as he touted his support for unions and his pledge to be “the most pro-union president.”\n\n“I’m so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing,” said Biden. “Workers have a right to form a union.”\n\nBiden also urged action on additional worker protections and benefits, including paid family and medical leave and affordable child care, specifically calling for the return of the expanded Child Tax Credit.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nLabor secretary makes move:Former Boston mayor Marty Walsh stepping down as Biden Labor Secretary for job with NHL union\n\nBiden calls for rebooting the expanded Child Tax Credit\n\nParents who qualify for the Child Tax Credit (CTC) won’t be getting as hefty checks as last year. That’s because the enhanced CTC, which parents could also opt to receive in installments rather than waiting to receive it in a lump sum payment when they file their taxes, expired.\n\nThe enhanced CTC increased payments from $2,000 per qualifying child to $3,600 for children ages 5 and under and $3,000 for children ages 6 through 17. This year it will go back to $2,000 for qualifying children of all ages.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden vowed to “restore the full Child Tax Credit which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.”\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nChild tax credit this year:How much is the Child Tax Credit for 2023?

McCarthy said Republicans aren’t going to cut those programs, but Democrats say the math will force those cuts if the GOP demands lowered government spending.\n\nBiden in his speech said Republicans want to cut the programs, to which Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., stood up and yelled “Liar!” as other members booed the president.\n\n“OK, so we agree,” Biden said. “Social Security and Medicare is off the books.”\n\nBipartisan cheers returned to the chamber.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nMedicare:Medicare launches plan to negotiate prices for the costliest drugs. Here's what to know.\n\nBiden takes credit for deficit cuts\n\nBiden celebrated the government’s deficit cuts seen under his administration in his State of the Union address.\n\n“For the last two years, my administration has cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion, the largest deficit reduction in American history,” Biden said. The deficit’s cut was partly a result of higher tax revenues that Biden touted but also the end of spending related to the pandemic.\n\nBiden also took a jab at former President Donald Trump for increases in the federal deficit under Trump’s administration. “Under the previous administration, the American deficit went up four years in a row,” Biden said, to boos and jeers from Republican lawmakers.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat happens if the US hits the debt ceiling?:Here's what to expect if we reach debt limit.\n\nBiden says Republicans want to ‘take the economy hostage’ in debt ceiling talks\n\nBiden accused Republicans of wanting to “take the economy hostage” unless he agrees to their demands for spending cuts during debt ceiling talks.\n\nBiden demanded Republicans show “what their plans are.” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has not specified what Republicans want axed.\n\n“Some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years,” Biden said, prompting loud boos from Republicans in Congress.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nMedicare and debt ceiling fight:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nBiden defends Inflation Reduction Act\n\nPresident Biden touted the Inflation Reduction Act which he signed into law, saying he was taking on powerful interest to bring health care costs down.\n\n“You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on earth,” he said. “Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.”\n\nHaving capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare, Biden said it was time to help Americans not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives. “Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it,” he said. The law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year.\n\nHe also promised to veto any attempts to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCredit fees:Biden moves to limit credit fees to $8 for missed payments in latest \"junk fee\" crack down\n\nBiden tangles with GOP lawmakers over Social Security and Medicare\n\nBiden got into an unusual back and forth with Republicans over whether GOP lawmakers want to end the automatic continuation of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nWhen some vocally protested, Biden responded: “Anyone who doubts it, contact my office. I’ll give you a copy of the proposal.”\n\nWhen the protests continued, Biden said he wasn’t arguing that all Republicans back reviewing entitlement programs every five years.\n\n“But it’s being proposed,” he said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nMedicare debate:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nCheers and boos for Biden\n\nProgressive members of the House, known as “the Squad,” cheered as President Joe Biden pushed for fair taxes and called out low tax rates for billionaires.\n\n“You tell ‘em, Joe,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.\n\nHe also had plenty of jeers from the Republican side of the chamber when he slammed former President Donald Trump’s fiscal record and accused the House GOP of trying to cut Social Security and Medicare. The latter attracted loud boos.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., stood up and yelled, “Liar!” from the back of the chamber.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nTalkative Biden:On average, Biden is most talkative president in six decades of State of Union addresses\n\nBiden repeats call for ‘billionaire’s tax’\n\nBiden used his speech to call again for Congress to pass a so-called “billionaire’s tax,” saying some of the biggest corporations in the country are raking in billions of dollars in profits but paying no federal income taxes.\n\n“That’s simply not fair,” he said.\n\nBiden did not spell out the specifics of his proposal. But in the past, he has called for a 20% levy on households with a net worth of more than $100 million.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nWhat are the tax brackets?:What are the 2022 US federal tax brackets? What are the new 2023 tax brackets?

Biden then announced, “new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.”\n\n“American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables,” he said. “And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.”\n\nBiden’s message echoes former President Donald Trump’s prior State of the Union addresses where he boasted about initiatives to bring back manufacturing jobs that have been lost over the years.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nInsulin costs:Medicare caps insulin costs at $35 a month. Can Biden get that price for all Americans?\n\nBiden touts legislative victories in infrastructure and manufacturing\n\nBiden championed his series of legislative victories that ranged from tackling the country’s supply chain shortage and sweeping investments in domestic manufacturing and infrastructure.\n\n“We’re gonna make sure the supply chain for America begins in America,” Biden said, touting a bipartisan bill he signed that made investments to boost domestic manufacturing of semiconductors.\n\n“To maintain the strongest economy in the world, we need the best infrastructure in the world,” said Biden, pointing to the bipartisan infrastructure bill. “Folks, we’re just getting started.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhy Bono is at SOTU:Here's why musician, advocate Bono is at Biden's State of the Union address\n\nBiden appeals to middle and working class people on manufacturing\n\nIn an appeal to middle class and working class people, Biden said he ran for president “to make sure the economy works for everyone” so that everyone can have pride in what they do for a living.\n\n“For decades, the middle class was hollowed out,” he said. “Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be.”\n\nBiden then spoke about his administration’s accomplishments in the manufacturing sector.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\nMore:As Biden prepares 2024 reelection run, Dems worry blue-collar voters are slipping away\n\nBiden: ‘COVID no longer controls our lives’\n\nBiden said the nation’s economy is roaring back from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much,” he said. “Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.”\n\nBiden said his administration has created 12 million jobs, “more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nA full House – literally – for State of the Union\n\nPresident Joe Biden entered a full House chamber Tuesday.\n\nThe capacity crowd included House and Senate members, current and former Supreme Court justices, family and honored guests.\n\nBiden’s first words were met with a standing ovation, as he honored Republican and Democratic leaders – but also as he described the state of the union.\n\nThe applause came from Democrats and Republicans, and the standing ovations were sometimes led by a row of powerful Senate moderates, including Sens.

That closely matches the FiveThirtyEight average of polls.\n\nBiden’s job performance has stayed below since August 2021 in most polls. Even more troubling for Biden, most Americans can’t identify his achievements.

Multiple other cabinet members are also fanning out across the country.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nHow would Biden’s billionaire tax work?\n\nTonight Biden will resurface his plan to levy more taxes on the ultra-wealthy. But how would that work?\n\nUnder the current tax system, you don’t have to pay taxes on assets like stocks, homes and artwork that can appreciate over time until you sell it. But if you hold onto them until you die, you won’t have to pay any taxes. And on top of that, heirs that inherit your assets won’t have to pay taxes if they sell them.\n\nThe Biden Administration refers to this as a tax loophole, as billionaires benefit the most since they’re more likely than working-class Americans to get compensated via stocks or other assets that appreciate over time or inherit them.\n\nTo end the practice, Biden is proposing “minimum income tax” on American households worth more than $100 million. His plan calls for the wealthiest Americans to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, including unrealized gains from assets that have increased in value since their purchase.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nTaxing billionaires:Should the wealthy pay taxes on expensive art and wine? Joe Biden thinks so. Here's how it would work\n\nOcasio-Cortez lays out expectations for Biden’s speech, working with Republicans\n\nAhead of Biden’s address, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y., said she’s hoping to “hear a really strong vision” from Biden and explained how Democrats and Republicans could find common ground after the GOP gained control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\nThe New York lawmaker told CNN she hopes to hear “about not just what we've done so far, but also our plans on executing on the enormous bills and successes that we've had in the last one to two years,\" saying “There still is implementation and execution on these plans to address our priorities around climate, taxing the rich and so much more.”\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden's 'finish the job' call in State of the Union echoes FDR\n\nHistorian Michael Beschloss hears echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden will call on Republicans to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the country, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Finish the job” was used as a rationale for FDR's reelection, Beschloss tweeted about the phrase’s historical lineage. It was also a slogan for the World War I effort. And in a famous radio address during World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to “finish the job.”\n\nAt the start of Biden’s administration, many comparisons – not all of them favorable – were made between the size and scope of Biden’s ambitions, Roosevelt’s programs and the World War II spending that lifted the nation out of the Great Depression.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders: Biden is more interested in 'woke fantasies' than concerns of everyday Americans\n\nIn delivering the Republican response to the State of the Union, Arkansas Gov.

What it will take for Biden to set a SOTU record\n\nBiden’s first State of the Union address in 2022 was somewhere between the longest and shortest speeches ever given, according to The American Presidency Project. Will he keep his second address tonight short and sweet, or will he be long-winded?\n\nIf he intendeds to break the record for the shortest speech ever, he’d have it keep it under 28 minutes and 55 seconds. That was the time Richard Nixon took to deliver his address in 1972. To beat the longest address ever, he’d have to outdo his fellow Democrat former President Bill Clinton, who went on for 1 hour, 28 minutes and 40 seconds for his final State of the Union speech in 2000. Clinton also claims the spot for the second longest address, clocking in at 1 hour, 24 minutes and 58 seconds in 1995.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to promise investment in ‘places and people that have been forgotten’\n\nBiden will spend part of his address promoting his economic plan and assuring Americans that he wants to invest in “places and people that have been forgotten.”\n\nAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible, he will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Maybe that’s you watching at home,” Biden will say. “You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to praise recovery from Jan. 6 riot, COVID\n\nPresident Joe Biden will say “the story of America is a story of progress and resilience” in his State of the Union address as he touts a rebounding economy, COVID-19 recovery and democracy that survived the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, according to excerpts of the speech provided by the White House.\n\nBiden will tout 12 million new jobs created under his presidency – many that came back following the pandemic – to claim economic progress. And he will reflect on a period two years ago when businesses and schools closed at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden plans to say. “And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to ask Republicans to work with him in SOTU speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden will make a plea to Republicans in Congress to work with him. He said after the November elections that Americans sent a divided Congress to Washington because they want them to work together.\n\n“The people sent us a clear message,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released from the White House. “Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy Sen. Patty Murray and other lawmakers will be wearing crayons at State of the Union\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray and some of her Democratic colleagues will be wearing crayon pins to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday to signal their support for greater investments in child care. Such care now costs more than $10,000 a year on average, and roughly half of Americans live in a child care desert. Insufficient child care takes a toll on America's economy, recent research shows, costing taxpayers $122 billion annually.\n\nPartisan gridlock has prevented progress on major child care reforms, such as Murray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would generally cap child care expenses at 7% of a family's household income. Biden, who alluded to that cap in his last State of the Union, has also struggled to gain traction on his child care proposals.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nLawmakers to highlight key social issues through guests\n\nTuesday night’s State of the Union address will be the first year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic where lawmakers are allowed to bring their own guests. As part of tradition, lawmakers tend to invite guests that draw attention to issues important to them.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have invited guests to champion abortion access such as Roslyn Roger Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan New Jersey, who will attend the address alongside Rep. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the brutal beating and subsequent death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests who have been impacted by police violence. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer in 2014.\n\n– Christine Fernando and Ken Tran\n\nRepublican response: Sarah Huckabee Sanders follows in historic footsteps with her State of the Union response\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the first former White House press secretary to deliver a formal State of the Union response – she is not, however, the first governor of Arkansas to do the honors.\n\nBack in 1985, the Democrats picked a young governor of Arkansas to deliver their response to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nHis name? Bill Clinton ... then-future President Bill Clinton.\n\nSanders will give the Republican rebuttal after Biden's speech.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n5 big questions for the SOTU:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden and China: Spy balloon likely to be addressed\n\nThe speech is a chance for Biden to respond to those who have criticized how he handled the suspected Chinese spy balloon that drifted over the United States last week – and to send a public message to China. Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Michael Collins\n\nIntel chair: China balloon flew over nuke sites\n\nBiden to lay out 'forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package delivery companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentanyl.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n5 big questions on Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year. Meanwhile, inflation is still high and economists pin at least some of the blame on Biden for showering Americans with cash in early 2021 while the economy was already healing.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nWho is Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Arkansas governor to giver Republican response to Biden's State of the Union address\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, one-time White House press secretary for former President Trump and current governor of Arkansas, will deliver the Republican rebuttal to Biden’s State of the Union address tonight.\n\nSanders, the youngest governor in the U.S., hails from a prominent political family. Her father Mike Huckabee was the 44th governor of Arkansas, serving from 1996 to 2007 before launching an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2008 election. The younger Sanders has since cut out her own place in GOP politics, emerging as one of the more high-profile members of the Trump administration.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect from tonight's speech:Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nBiden's speech comes amid job gains\n\nOne accomplishment Biden is sure to bring up tonight is the level of job gains under his presidency. Since he took office the unemployment rate went from 6.3% to 3.4%, per the latest jobs data.\n\nDespite recession fears and massive tech layoffs, U.S. employers added 517,000 new jobs last month, well exceeding economists' expectations of around 180,000 new jobs.\n\nThe blowout jobs report paved the way for the Federal Reserve to pass more rate hikes aimed at lowering inflation, Fed Chairman Powell said in remarks he delivered earlier today. But the rate hikes could push the economy closer to a recession, which the central bank has avoided so far.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness plan remains stalled\n\nBiden has yet to fulfill his campaign promise of canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt. Last year he unveiled a plan to make good on his promise.\n\nHowever the plan is being stalled by legal challenges. Six states – Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina – formed a coalition to fight the proposal. They argue that canceling student loan debt extends beyond the administration’s legal authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments for the case later this month. The Biden administration claims it is well within their legal realm to proceed with its plan. It cannot do so unless the Court rules in its favor, however.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nStock market under Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10%. Last year the index fell into a bear market, meaning it dropped 20% below a market peak set last January.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump's time in office, the Dow gained 56%. That represents an annualized gain of close to 12%, one of the best stock market performances under a Republican president according to data from LPL Financial.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union speech tonight?\n\nBiden’s State of the Union speech is Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to stream the SOTU\n\nThe speech will be livestreamed by USA TODAY.\n\nWho is the designated survivor tonight?\n\nThe State of the Union address, delivered to a joint session of Congress and a crowd that includes all nine Supreme Court justices, poses a unique scenario in which every key member of the nation’s leadership is in one room.\n\nThat makes it both a momentous affair, and a significant national security risk. For this reason, each year one member of the president’s Cabinet dubbed the \"designated survivor\" hangs back.\n\nThe practice dates back to the Cold War, during which fears of a Soviet Nuclear attack abounded and a fresh urgency surrounded protocols for the order of presidential succession. The designated survivor for 2023 has not yet been announced, but heads of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy have most frequently been chosen.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat channel is the State of the Union on?\n\nThe major TV networks and other news outlets, such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and PBS, are providing live coverage of the address.\n\nWhat is the State of the Union address?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, told USA TODAY.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen did the annual message become known as State of the Union address?\n\nFrom 1790 to 1946, the speech delivered by the president to Congress was known simply as the \"Annual Message.\"\n\nIn 1947 is became the ‘State of the Union’ and has since been referred to by that name.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is the origin of the state of the union address?\n\nArticle II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president will “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”\n\nThis language birthed the practice, allowing the executive to deliver to a joint session of Congress and the American people.\n\nIn the modern era, the speech has become a vehicle for administrations to roll out their policy priorities for the coming year and spotlight key agenda issues.\n\n– Anna Kaufman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/africa/kenya-elections-polls-open-intl/index.html", "title": "Kenya elections 2022: Kenyans cast ballot in a race too close to call ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPolling has officially closed in Kenya’s crucial general elections as outgoing President Uhuru Kenyatta prepares to hand over power to a new leader.\n\nAbout 22 million Kenyans registered to vote, the country’s electoral body (IEBC) said, and polls opened from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. local time (11 p.m. ET Monday to 10 a.m. ET Tuesday).\n\nVoters in line to vote by closing time will still be permitted to cast their ballots, the electoral commission also promised a time extension for areas where voting started late.\n\nMany polling stations in Eldoret city, a stronghold of presidential candidate and current deputy president William Ruto, closed ballot boxes on the dot at 5 p.m. local time (10aET), as there were no voters still in line to cast their ballots.\n\nBallots will first be counted at polling stations immediately after voting ends, before then being sent to the constituency-wide tallying center which tracks the results from all reporting polling stations.\n\nIf no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote, the election will go into a run-off for the first time in Kenyan history.\n\nTuesday’s presidential election, according to opinion polls, is considered a two-horse race between Deputy President Ruto, 55, and veteran opposition leader Odinga, 77.\n\nOdinga is a businessman and politician who served as prime minister of Kenya for five years following the disputed presidential election of December 2007 that resulted in widespread protests and violence, leaving more than 1,000 people dead.\n\nOdinga is part of Kenya’s political dynasty; his father Jaramogi Oginga Odinga was the first vice president of independent Kenya.\n\nHe earned a master’s degree in mechanical engineering in East Germany in 1970 and was a one-time lecturer at the University of Nairobi after his studies abroad.\n\nHe is participating in the poll for the fifth and final time, he says after failing at his four previous attempts.\n\nOdinga has received the backing of former rival President Kenyatta, who overlooked his deputy Ruto for the top job.\n\nFondly known as “Baba” by Kenyans, he has pledged to set up social protection and a universal health care program called Babacare for poor households. Free education up to college level is also part of his plans.\n\nThis might be Odinga’s year, says political reporter and analyst Moses Odhiambo.\n\n“There’s a feeling that whichever side the government seems to lean on, wins. If you borrow from opinion polls, then Raila has an advantage,” Odhiambo told CNN.\n\nOdinga’s main opponent, Ruto, describes himself as the “Hustler-in-Chief,” citing his humble beginnings as a chicken seller who fought his way to one of Kenya’s highest political offices.\n\nRuto, a former teacher who holds a doctorate in Plant Ecology from the University of Nairobi, has adopted a populist “man-of-the-people” approach, designed to capture Kenya’s largest voting bloc – the youth.\n\nAnd he appears to be succeeding, veteran political analyst Herman Manyora told CNN: “Ruto has excited the youths … almost in a euphoric sense. That might help to make them turn out and vote.”\n\nRuto has pledged to prioritize Kenya’s economy and “uplift ordinary citizens” if elected president.\n\n“There is a world of difference between me and my competitor. I have a plan, he doesn’t,” Ruto says of Odinga.\n\nRuto was also tried alongside Kenyatta in 2013 at the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands for alleged crimes against humanity following the 2007 election violence. However, the charges were later thrown out.\n\nAlthough the election would bring about a change of administration, Ruto and Odinga’s affiliation with the present government does not necessarily provide a new political phenomenon, argues analyst Odhiambo.\n\n“Among the front runners, people are keen to balance between what is perceived as continuity and freshness within a continuity,” Odhiambo said.\n\n“Ruto is the deputy president and part of the current government. There’s a perception that Odinga could be an extension of the current president because of the support the president has given him.”\n\nWhat are the issues?\n\nAmong the key pressing issues for the electorate is myriad economic problems ranging from growing debt to high food and fuel prices and mass youth unemployment.\n\nParts of the country are also suffering from a debilitating drought that threatens to exacerbate growing insecurity issues.\n\nAnalyst Manyora says many Kenyans, especially young people, are disillusioned with the government and might boycott the elections.\n\n“There are things that might affect the turnout. One is the disillusionment in the country with the high cost of living, the helplessness and hopelessness among the youth, unemployment, poverty levels, and the people not seeing anything that the politicians are doing for them,” the analyst said.\n\nHe added that Kenya’s problems should ordinarily spur his countrymen to vote for the right candidates irrespective of tribe, but they aren’t “angry enough.”\n\n“One would expect that because of these problems Kenyans will turn out in large numbers at the polls to express their anger at the high cost of living by voting out those responsible … I don’t think Kenyans are at a point where they are angry enough to translate the anger into political action,” Manyora told CNN.\n\nThe role of ethnicity\n\nKikuyu, Luhya, Kalenjin, and Luo are four of the East African country’s most populous ethnic groups.\n\nOutgoing leader Kenyatta is among three of four Kenyan presidents that have emerged from the dominant Kikuyu ethnic group since the country gained independence in 1963.\n\n“The problem in this country is that tribal considerations supersede everything else … Most of the votes cast would be based on tribe; very few votes will come from critical voters,” analyst Manyora said.\n\nRuto is from the Kalenjin tribe, and Odinga is from the Luo ethnic group.\n\nBoth men traversed the country before wrapping up campaigns at the weekend and sought support from those outside their strongholds.\n\nBoth candidates also chose their running mates from the Kikuyu – one of Kenya’s largest voting blocs – also known as the Mount Kenya region.\n\nRuto is running alongside first-term MP Rigathi Gachagua while Odinga is on the ballot with former justice minister and one-time presidential aspirant Martha Karua.\n\nKarua will become Kenya’s first female deputy president If elected. Analyst Odhiambo says Odinga’s choice of running mate has excited women in Kenya.\n\n“There is a growing wave of support around women leadership which has been accelerated by Odinga’s choice of Martha as his running mate,” he said.\n\nWomen represent 49% of Kenya’s registered voters, according to the country’s electoral commission.\n\nOnly the Kikuyu and Kalenjin tribes have produced the country’s presidents and this is the first election where none of the leading candidates is a Kikuyu.\n\nNo candidate from the Luo tribe has won a presidential election.", "authors": ["Nimi Princewill Stephanie Busari Bethlehem Feleke", "Nimi Princewill", "Stephanie Busari", "Bethlehem Feleke"], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/02/07/nigeria-elections-boko-haram/23032235/", "title": "Nigeria postponing Feb. 14 vote amid Boko Haram violence", "text": "Michelle Faul\n\nAssociated Press\n\nDAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Nigeria's electoral commission will postpone Feb. 14 presidential and legislative elections for six weeks to give a new multinational force time to secure northeastern areas under the sway of Boko Haram, an official close to the commission told The Associated Press on Saturday.\n\nMillions could be disenfranchised if next week's voting went ahead while the Islamic extremists hold a large swath of the northeast and commit mayhem that has driven 1.5 million people from their homes.\n\nCivil rights groups staged a small protest Saturday against any proposed postponement. Police prevented them from entering the electoral commission headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria's capital. Armed police blocked roads leading to the building.\n\nElectoral officials were meeting with political parties Saturday, asking their views on a postponement requested by the national security adviser, politician Bashir Yusuf told reporters. He said the adviser argued the military will be unable to provide adequate security for the elections because of operations in the northeast.\n\nThe Nigerian official, who is knowledgeable of the discussions, said the Independent National Electoral Commission will announce the postponement later Saturday. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nA major offensive with warplanes and ground troops from Chad and Nigeria already has forced the insurgents from a dozen towns and villages in the past 10 days. Even greater military strikes by more countries are planned.\n\nNigeria and its four bordering countries announced plans Saturday to deploy an 8,750-strong force by next month to combat the growing regional threat posed by Boko Haram.\n\nDetails of the proposed deployment were revealed at the end of a three-day meeting in Cameroon in a statement read out by officials, including Issaka Souare, African Union adviser for Mali and the Sahel.\n\nThe plans call for Chad and Nigeria to contribute 3,500 troops each, while Cameroon and Niger would contribute 750 each and Benin would contribute 250. The force would be headquartered in Chad's capital, N'Djamena.\n\nNigeria's home-grown extremist group has responded with attacks on one town in Cameroon and two in Niger this week. Officials said more than 100 civilians were killed and 500 wounded in Cameroon. Niger said about 100 insurgents and one civilian died in attacks Friday. Several security forces from both countries were killed.\n\nInternational concern has increased along with the death toll: Some 10,000 killed in the uprising in the past year compared to 2,000 in the four previous years, according to the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nThe United States has been urging Nigeria to press ahead with the voting. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Nigeria two weeks ago and said that \"one of the best ways to fight back against Boko Haram\" was by holding credible and peaceful elections, on time.\n\n\"It's imperative that these elections happen on time as scheduled,\" Kerry said.\n\nThe elections had been called early. Elections in 2011 were postponed until April. May 29 is the deadline for a new government to be installed.\n\nOfficials in President Goodluck Jonathan's administration have been calling for a postponement.\n\nAny delay is opposed by an opposition coalition fielding former military dictator Muhammadu Buhari, though the opposition stands to take most votes in the northeast.\n\nSupporters of both sides are threatening violence if their candidate does not win. Some 800 people were killed in riots in the mainly Muslim north after Buhari, a Muslim, lost 2011 elections to Jonathan, a Christian from the south.\n\nAnalysts say the vote is too close to call, the most tightly contested election since decades of military dictatorship ended in 1999.\n\nJonathan's party has won every election since then but the failure of the military to curb the 5-year Islamic uprising, growing corruption and an economy hit by halved oil prices have hurt the president of Africa's biggest oil producer and most populous nation of about 170 million.\n\nA postponement also will give electoral officials more time to deliver some 30 million voter cards.

In that time period alone, the number of children who were killed in a homicide rose 27.7%.\n\nThe marked increase may be partly driven by the general trend in firearm-related homicides of children, which rose 47.7% between 2019 and 2020, the study says.\n\nOverall homicide rates increased the most for boys, rising 16.1% between 2018 and 2020. There was a decline in homicides among girls between 1999 and 2020, however.\n\nSystemic inequities\n\nThe rate of homicides in Black children increased 16.6% from 2018 to 2020. Black and Hispanic children have been victims of a steady increase in homicides since 2012 and 2014, respectively.\n\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native children had a decrease in homicide rates between 1999 and 2020, but it was not statistically significant, the researchers said. However, in most years, they have had the second-highest rates of homicide among racial and ethnic groups. The researchers also said these numbers may also be underestimated, since the race of some victims may have been misidentified as Hispanic.\n\nHomicide rates for Asian, Pacific Islander and White children have steadily declined since 1999, the study says.\n\nEarlier studies have shown that the racial disparities may be attributed in part to racism and the system-based inequities of the neighborhoods many children live in, with high concentrations of poverty, few safe places to play and underfunded school systems.\n\nThese neighborhoods are also run by authority figures who – due to unconscious bias – dehumanize these children and perceive them as “less childlike and innocent” and “as more culpable for their actions,” with “fewer childhood protections and benefit compared to their White peers,” the new study says.\n\nThe homicide rate has also increased since 2011 in rural areas that have seen limited employment opportunities and challenges with poverty. It’s a slower climb than in urban areas, but is a longer period of an upward trend, the study says.\n\nThe child homicide rate in the South has also been increasing since 2013, the study found.\n\nThe researchers also looked at deaths by age group. Children 10 or younger were most often killed by neglect or abuse, usually from parents or caregivers, particularly a father’s or mother’s companion.\n\nMost of the victims who were 11 and older were killed in arguments, during a crime or by a friend or acquaintance, the researchers found.\n\nBlack boys ages 16 to 17 had a homicide rate that was 18 times higher than that of White boys and 4.6 times higher than in Hispanic boys.\n\nEscaping poverty through education\n\nThe rates of homicides of infants and 1- to 5-year-olds have been steadily declining for the past two decades. The researchers suggest that decline coincides with medical reform and federal programs like the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, which supports pregnant people and parents of young children in communities with higher risks and barriers to positive maternal and child health outcomes, as well as training programs that emphasize positive parenting skills.\n\nDr. Karen Sheehan, an attending physician in emergency medicine at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, agreed that there may be a connection between these programs and the decline in homicides in the youngest children.\n\n“We’ve put a lot of resources in this country to help strengthen families, through home visiting programs and also through sometimes programs like child tax credits, and perhaps that is why we’re seeing the decrease in those categories because of this investment that we have made,” said Sheehan, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nSheehan and other doctors have been working to improve the health of children through their Chicago Youth Programs.\n\n“If we wanted to improve their health, it was essential to get them out of poverty, and for most, education was the shortest route,” she said.\n\nThe programs offer tutoring, health care and recreation. Research shows that these kinds of youth development programs are effective at improving children’s financial stability, education and well-being. Similar programs can also prevent violence against kids.\n\n“If we invest strategically and structurally, we can move the needle on violent death,” Sheehan said.\n\nA forgotten group\n\nThe new study found that homicides among 6- to 10-year-olds have been increasing since 2014.\n\nThe researchers say that most violence intervention programs at school for this age group focus on talking about sexual abuse and peer violence like bullying, rather than parent-child violence, unless the child is showing specific behavioral problems. The authors suggest that programs that educate about intimate partner violence may be needed.\n\nThe study also suggested that reducing access to “lethal means” like guns could reduce deaths in kids 6 to 10.\n\nSheehan said the numbers for this age group stood out.\n\n“I think people often forget about this age group. We think about the younger kids with child abuse and the older kids with firearm injury, but that 6- to 10-year-old group – it’s something that we need to get on our radar and be paying attention to.”\n\nLooking at why the systems aren’t working\n\nFor the study, the researchers used the National Vital Statistics System’s Wonder mortality data, which uses death certificates for US residents and the National Violent Death Reporting System.\n\nAlthough reliable, the records may miss some homicides. Infant deaths might also be misclassified or not reported. Additionally, the data comes from only 45 states, so it can’t be completely generalizable to the entire country, and the numbers underestimate the true number of homicides of children in the US.\n\nDr. Elinore Kaufman, an assistant professor in the department of surgery at the Perelman School of Medicine at Penn, said the increases in homicides were not surprising, but “that doesn’t mean they’re not alarming.”\n\n“I think, as a society, we have to take a hard look at the systems that we have in place to protect children and to try to come to an understanding of why they’re not working better for these young children,” said Kaufman, who wrote an editorial published alongside the study.\n\nThe US needs a multisector response to reduce the number of homicides involving children, she said.\n\nFor the little ones who more often die from abuse or neglect, there need to be policy interventions that “create and support services for new parents and families,” including things like paid family leave and other programs that have been shown to decrease community rates of child abuse.\n\nFor all children, reducing access to firearms has the potential to save lives, Kaufman said. She also believes there needs to be more research to better understand the association between social inequity and poverty in communities.\n\n“Child homicides are preventable,” the study says. “The decrease in homicide rates for some geographic and child demographic groups is encouraging; however, more can be done to protect all children.”\n\nA jump in firearm injuries\n\nA separate study published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics found that the rates of firearm injuries treated at children’s hospitals in the US significantly increased during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic and stayed elevated throughout 2021.\n\nThe researchers compared the number of firearm injuries treated at children’s hospitals between April 2020 and December 2021 against those from April 2018 to December 2019. There were 1,815 firearm injuries in the earlier period and 2,759 during the pandemic, a 52% increase.\n\nIn each time period, a higher proportion of the victims were Black children who were covered by public insurance, and children up to 5. There were no other significant demographic differences among the victims.\n\n“The unequal burden of injury mirrors the disproportionate implications of Covid-19 for minoritized communities; pandemic conditions exacerbated many structural inequities that contribute to health disparities,” the study says.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAddressing structural racism, poverty, unsafe communities and other elements that contribute to violence like homicides will take effort, but Kaufman is confident that changes can bring an end to violence against children.\n\n“These are big problems, and it will take all of us to solve them. But that means that all of us in all our sectors, whether it’s health care, whether it’s education, whether it’s social services, and whether – and I actually do believe this – that the media has a huge role to play,” she said. “I think all of us in our sectors have a role to play and have the opportunity to make a difference for these children and for our society as a whole.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/01/29/domestic-violence-research-children-abuse-mental-health-learning-aces/2227218002/", "title": "Domestic violence: Children who see abuse suffer as much as those ...", "text": "SAVANNAH, Ga. – Latrelle Huff says her twins were conceived by rape.\n\nNow she blames domestic violence for her children's health problems.\n\nThe Georgia woman says she had been in an abusive, on-and-off relationship for six years when she became pregnant. While pregnant, she says, the conflict continued. Huff spent 25 of 37 weeks on bed rest, she says, due in part to rectal bleeding her doctors said was caused by stress.\n\nTwo days after the twins were born in 2014, Huff says, the father took a swing at her. He was holding their newborn son. They were still in the hospital. Huff had just delivered by Cesarean section. \"He was so angry at me because my milk wouldn't come in,\" Huff, 39, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe boy was born with \"floppy baby syndrome,\" a muscular condition doctors said might be attributed to abuse during pregnancy. Both children struggle with health issues, including speech disorders, and have spent months in instructional therapy to learn how to follow directions.\n\nThe father denies sexually assaulting or abusing Huff. He was charged last year with assault and battery against her; his lawyer says he completed a pretrial program in September to avoid a conviction. In 2015, a grand jury in Savannah declined to indict him on sexual assault charges.\n\nNew research is giving scientists more insight into the far-reaching and long-lasting harms of domestic violence to the children who grow up around it – including a startling finding: Witnessing abuse carries the same risk of harm to children's mental health and learning as being abused directly.\n\nBrain imaging in infants shows that exposure to domestic violence – even as they are sleeping, or in utero – can reduce parts of the brain, change its overall structure and affect the way its circuits work together.\n\nStudies show that when babies born to mothers who were subjected to violence during pregnancy become adults, they have three times as much inflammation in their bodies as those whose mothers weren't. Inflammation causes a much higher risk of poor health, and a far greater likelihood of depression.\n\nAnd research also shows that these children are as likely to have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as soldiers returning from war.\n\nPsychologist Kathleen Kendall-Tackett, past president of the American Psychological Association's division of trauma psychology, said \"babies are like a blank slate.\"\n\n\"If a mother is beaten while pregnant, there is a chance the baby will be injured, delivered prematurely, and there is a stack of other things that can happen – including physiological programming of the hyperactive stress system that leads to inflammation as an adult,\" she said.\n\n\"It's like when a soldier comes back from combat, hears a click and hits the ground.\"\n\nResearchers estimate that between 4.5 million and 15 million children are exposed to physical violence in the home. Verbal and emotional abuse in the home is more difficult to track.\n\nSocial workers, health care providers and academics have long tracked the effects of trauma suffered by children growing up in urban neighborhoods with frequent gunfire and other violence. But outside of medical journals, there has been little reporting on the effect of the more common domestic violence on the millions of children who grow up on the residential battlefields where it occurs.\n\nNeuroscientist Tanja Jovanovic directs the Grady Trauma Project, a research institute based at Emory University in Atlanta. The risk of PTSD from domestic violence is high, she says, because it's a \"betrayal by someone who is supposed to be to a protector.\"\n\nMaking matters worse, Jovanovic said, domestic violence often eliminates the \"buffering effect of another positive adult,\" because the adult who is targeted can't provide comfort to the children who witness it.\n\nPsychologist Abigail Gewirtz says domestic violence can feel scarier than war. Gewirtz is the director of the Institute of Translational Research in Children's Mental Health at the University of Minnesota. It's \"one of the most terrifying forms of violence because it happens in a place which is supposed to be safe,\" she said. \"Children are totally powerless, especially very young children. They are totally dependent on their parents.”\n\nRead more:\n\nDomestic violence 'code of silence' contributes to prevalence across races, classes\n\n'Toxic stress' on children can harm their lifelong learning, mental and physical health\n\nExposure also reduces the potential of babies and toddlers to learn. Alissa Huth-Bocks, a child psychologist at University Hospitals in Cleveland, said the \"most damaging time\" is during pregnancy and the first three years of life, when development \"takes the biggest hit at the brain level.\"\n\nLong-lasting consequences\n\nNegative consequences continue well into adulthood. Among childhood adversities, Ronald Kessler says, those involving family violence inflict the worst long-term effects.\n\nKessler is a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School, the principal investigator of the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey – the first nationally representative survey of mental disorders in the United States. He is co-director of the World Health Organization’s World Mental Health Survey Initiative.\n\n\"One of the long-term effects of childhood adversity is that they create emotional scars that get reopened when people are exposed to traumas in adulthood – leading to adult PTSD,\" Kessler said.\n\nFor people of color, especially African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans, the effects of trauma are often magnified, federally funded research shows, because they are more likely to suffer from systemic racism, discrimination and microaggressions.\n\nThe nonprofit research organization Child Trends reported last year that 6 percent of kids nationally – about 4.5 million children – had seen or heard parents or other adults slap, hit, kick or punch each other in the home. Four percent had been exposed to or victims of neighborhood violence.\n\nThe results were based on a survey of parents about their children. In five states – Arizona, Mississippi, Arkansas, Hawaii and Tennessee – at least 10 percent of children had been exposed to domestic violence at home.\n\nChild Trends says parents likely under-report violence in the home out of embarrassment or fear of stigma. The research doesn't include the psychological and emotional abuse, including gaslighting, that many women and some men told USA TODAY was far worse for them and their children to live with.\n\nThe findings, children's health advocates say, underscore a need for improved detection and prevention of domestic violence, and better treatment of abuse survivors and their children in the health care system, schools and the courts.\n\nGeorgia, Huff's home, is among the states where the law recognizes the effects of domestic violence on children. The state has created criminal charges for domestic violence that happens anywhere in a house where children are present, not just when it occurs in front of the child.\n\nIn other ways, specialists say, the law and courts have a long way to go in recognizing the impact on children's well-being. Parents accused or even convicted of domestic violence in many cases are able to gain unsupervised visits with their children, or partial or full partial custody – even when children are afraid of the offender.\n\nWhen parents in an abusive relationship separate, conditions for their children can become even riskier. The nonprofit group Center for Judicial Excellence, which monitors family courts, found that more than 650 children were killed by a parent in a \"divorce, separation, custody, visitation, child support situation\" from 2008 through 2018.\n\nDomestic violence crosses racial, ethnic and socioeconomic lines. Cheryl Branch, executive director at Savannah's SAFE women's shelter, says the calls she gets from abused women in The Landings, an exclusive gated community, are as horrific as those that come from low-income clients.\n\nShe says women are afraid to leave husbands who threaten to spend whatever it takes to gain full custody of the children. When shelter residents go back to their domestic abusers – as many do – Branch is required to notify child protection authorities, just as she would be if a parent returned to someone who has sexually abused his or her child.\n\nHuth-Bocks, the Cleveland psychologist, says researchers' ability to study human brain development has \"exploded in the last five to six years.\" So has data on the mental health and addiction effects of adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs – 10 harmful experiences or conditions, including domestic violence, tracked by health professionals.\n\nGenerations of violence\n\nIn San Diego, the children of now-divorced Eric and Yadira Sanchez – Angel, Noel and their 15-year-old brother – say they can vividly recall visiting their maternal grandparents' house when they were young.\n\nThey talk about seeing their grandmother punch cabinet doors and throw drinking glasses. She and their grandfather would hit each other in front of them, they say. The grandparents could not be reached for comment.\n\nLater, Angel and Noel say, they watched as their mother chased their father with a kitchen knife and smashed a piece of a wood across his back. In December 2011, police arrested Yadira Sanchez on charges of felony assault with a deadly weapon and felony spousal battery, but prosecutors declined to pursue the charges.\n\nAs the alleged violence escalated, the children's grades and mental health declined, a review of school and medical records shows. (USA TODAY is not identifying the youngest son because he is a minor.)\n\n\"When these high levels of stress happen too often and too intensely, it creates a toxic pathway that alters how our brains and bodies operate and how we think, learn and behave,\" said psychologist Sheri Madigan, a professor at the University of Calgary in Canada.\n\nYadira Sanchez did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Ethan Marcus, acknowledges that the boys were exposed to domestic violence. But he claims Eric Sanchez's efforts to separate the boys from their mother likely hurt them far more.\n\n\"This is not a case where physical violence was the primary factor,\" Marcus said.\n\nChange to brain, body\n\nResearchers who followed 1,420 children in North Carolina from age 9 to 30 found that exposure to domestic violence in the home had the same serious and life-changing effects as experiencing the abuse directly.\n\nThe American Medical Association published the study in November. University of Vermont psychologist William Copeland was its lead author. These children \"have the same type of poor outcomes 10, 20 years down the road\" as children who \"experience it directly themselves,\" he said.\n\nA global study out last year of more than 125,000 people from all socioeconomic backgrounds found children who witnessed domestic violence had the same risk and incidence of PTSD as soldiers returning from war.\n\nResearch presented in November at the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies shows that children exposed at an early age to trauma, including domestic violence, have a smaller hippocampus – the brain area related to learning and memory formation – a risk factor for PTSD.\n\nOther research shows that the amygdala – the part of the brain that processes emotions, memory and fear – in children who have been exposed to violence reacts more strongly to threats than in children who haven't.\n\nEamon McCrory, a professor of developmental neuroscience at University College London, says the changes make it more difficult for these children to get along with others. Other studies have shown that exposing children to violence leads to lower grades and a greater probability of dropping out of school.\n\nPsychologist and professor Katie McLaughlin directs the Stress and Development Lab at Harvard. \"This change in size and likely the function of the hippocampus could be one potential mechanism that's underlying those differences in school achievement,\" she said. The brain works to help protect from danger. But when children are dealing with adversity, their brains can be overwhelmed.\n\nLearning disordered\n\nCatholic high schools around San Diego began scouting Angel Sanchez when he was in middle school, according to Phillip Lomax, his coach at the time. The strapping middle linebacker – he was 6-foot-tall and 225 pounds in high school – was hard to miss.\n\nProblem was, Sanchez said, just as his athletic abilities began gaining notice, his home life deteriorated and his grades dropped.\n\nHis mother stayed out late at night, his father found other men's numbers on her phone, and a pattern of erratic and often violent behavior against the boys and their father developed, Eric Sanchez said in requests for restraining orders and police reports.\n\nThe three boys each had an Individual Education Program detailing how they best learn given their disabilities. Angel has a speech impairment that affects his oral and written communication, reading comprehension and math problem solving. Noel was granted accommodations to receive extra time for homework and tests. The youngest boy struggles with reading and writing. All the boys were given intensive tutoring, language therapy and case managers.\n\nAs tensions between the parents rose, Angel's grade point average dropped from 3.0 at the beginning of his sixth grade to 1.3 by the start of 7th grade, school transcripts show.\n\nThat was the year – 2008 – that their mother chased their father around a table with a steak knife and stabbed the padded kitchen stools, Eric Sanchez and the boys told child welfare workers.\n\nNoel Sanchez, now 18, recalls that period. \"Oh man, I can still see and hear what happened those nights. That’s not going to go anywhere,\" he said.\n\nIn children exposed to domestic violence, the parts of the brain that detect threats and anticipate pain – the anterior insula and amygdala – are strongly affected by threatening faces during brain imaging.\n\nResearchers at University College London wrote in 2011 that the results might predict a later risk factor for anxiety disorders and increasing vulnerability to mental illness. A more recent study by the same authors showed this heightened responsiveness was present even when children weren't consciously aware of a threat.\n\n\"If you've grown up in a situation that's dangerous, you're much more likely to react to something that's actually totally safe (as if it were) a potential threat,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nThe two younger Sanchez boys went back and forth between their feuding parents. Angel stayed with his father. School progress reports show that Noel missed 57 classes in the first three months of 2017. His younger brother missed 137.\n\nIn 2016, Yadira Sanchez was granted a restraining order against Angel. Her lawyer, Ethan Marcus, says Angel kept trying to take his brothers away from their mother. Yadira lost custody of the boys in March 2017.\n\nLomax, the coach, says the chaos hurt Angel's future plans. \"If you’d asked me, when he was going into 9th grade, what Angel’s potential as a linebacker was, he was certainly a Division I contender, for sure,\" he said.\n\nEric Sanchez, the father, says one high school withdrew a scholarship offer after it saw Angel's grades. He missed practice often during high school during the parents' custody fight.\n\nNoel Sanchez says that the turmoil before their parents separated, and stays with their mother after the split, were so traumatic that he attempted suicide in 2014 and considered it at other times. \"I was just trying to hurt myself to let the pain go away,\" he said.\n\nMore:Surviving Suicide Q&A: Laura answers your questions on loss, depression, the hard stuff\n\nMore:After a suicide, here’s what happens to the people left behind\n\nFrom mother to daughter\n\nDebbie Ricker says domestic violence looms over three generations of her family. Both the California woman and her daughter Desiree say it led to Desiree's drug and alcohol abuse, and other mental and physical health struggles.\n\nRicker fought a 15-year custody battle with her ex-husband. It ended only when her son turned 18. She says the emotional abuse she suffered and her children witnessed still affects them. \"My ex was very open with his abuse toward me,\" she said. \"The abuse occurred in front of our kids, friends, family.\"\n\nDesiree, now 29, said \"I never heard him be nice to her. He belittled her every step of the way.\"\n\nMarc Loehren, Debbie Ricker's ex-husband and Desiree's father, denies their allegations. He was never charged with a crime against them. “My two children had a wonderful childhood,\" he told USA TODAY. \"There was no violence in this household. ... if anything, the mom hit me with a car.”\n\nHe acknowledges the children have been to multiple psychologists. But he cites Ricker's family background and marriages before and after their relationship. He alleges that Ricker tried to undermine his relationship with the children.\n\n\"The children are fairly disturbed from anything that the mom has told them – which is alienation,\" Loehren said.\n\nDuring an interview for a family evaluation during the custody fight, Loehren said Ricker was scaring the children by calling the police when he allegedly violated restraining orders.\n\nBased on the evaluator's recommendation, a family court judge ordered the parents into joint counseling. The judge said each had to educate themselves on \"child development and high parental conflict.\"\n\nRicker, 62, says she asked for a divorce. She says Loehren suggested the two of them sit down and explain it to the children. She says he opened he conversation by saying \"Mommy doesn't like daddy anymore, so she is breaking our family apart.\" The kids started screaming and crying, Ricker says. Then they started to hit her.\n\nDesiree started to gain weight when she was about 5. A therapist would later attribute the weight gain to the family dysfunction. When Desiree was 12, the family doctor told Ricker that her daughter had pre-diabetes. \"It just made me cry,\" Ricker says.\n\nIn high school, Desiree says, she gained about 100 pounds – weight she still carries. At 12, Desiree says, she began an abusive relationship with a boyfriend who also came from a violent home. It lasted, on and off, until she was 27. The ex-boyfriend was never charged with abusing her.\n\nStudies show that childhood adversities can lead to obesity later in life. Duke University researchers reported last year that children aged 12 to 15 were far more likely to eat poorly and less likely to get physical activity after exposure to domestic violence.\n\n'These things go together'\n\nIt's common for children who are exposed to domestic violence to also suffer other adverse childhood experiences. ACEs are linked to a range of mental and physical health consequences throughout life, up to and including early death.\n\n“If there's domestic violence in the household, it's statistically likely that there's also physical abuse and emotional abuse and maybe drug abuse or alcohol abuse,\" said Canan Karatekin, a professor of the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota. \"These things go together.”\n\nHuff took on the role of protector of her younger siblings. It carried its own burden.\n\nDuring the summer before fifth grade, she says, she remembers holding one of her sisters in her lap as another was rushed to the hospital after the first of several suicide attempts. \"I had to grow up fast and be a second mom to my siblings,\" she says. \"It made me stronger. ... I was determined not to be like my sister or my mother.\"\n\nBut that was nearly impossible.\n\nHuff and her mother say domestic violence spans generations in their family.\n\nDenise Boyd was caring for a year-old daughter while she was pregnant with Huff at 21. Boyd was having a breakdown, she says, after years living with the abusive father of her children.\n\nThe father could not be reached for comment. He was never charged with a crime against Boyd.\n\nBoyd's mother went to take her home to Georgia. Once in her parents' home, Boyd says, she rarely went out. On rare occasions when she did, she would hide on the floor of the family car. \"I felt like I wasn’t the same anymore,\" Boyd said. \"I didn't know what was happening to me.\"\n\nHuff was born in August 1979. As a little girl, she developed a speech disorder. In eighth grade, Huff says, she was so anxious she tried to run away. She was sent briefly to a juvenile detention facility.\n\nDavid Murphey, director of the Child Trends DataBank, describes domestic violence as a type of toxic stress linked to health problems later in life. Domestic violence rewires the brain, he said, harming executive function – \"the ability to weigh options and make well-considered choices.\"\n\nHow can communities best address abuse?\n\nDetecting, treating and preventing exposure to domestic abuse are the keys to reducing it, specialists say.\n\nCertified nurse midwife Pamela Glenn, field education supervisor at Minneapolis's Walden University School of Nursing, has screened her patients for abuse for 30 years.\n\nShe says health care professionals should create a safe space for patients, don't judge or blame, and avoid using the word \"abuse.\"\n\n“Most people, when they hear the word 'abuse,' they automatically think physical violence,\" Glenn said. \"The abuse may be emotional abuse only – but that can be extremely damaging to people's health.”\n\nShe asks questions such as “Does your partner support you?\" And \"Do you ever find that your partner is constantly checking up on you when you're not together and almost interrogating you at times?\" If she suspects abuse, she says, she offers resources such as information for an advocate or safe place.\n\nSpecialists say screening alone is not enough. \"Screening is the great first step, but it's only a first step,\" said Jess Bartlett, a trauma researcher with Child Trends. \"Too often we look at what kids have experienced, but not how they function.\" She says health care providers should look at children's needs, and whether the community has the resources to respond.\n\nMurphey agrees. “Unless there are adequate networks of services and referral practices to follow the results up,\" he said, \"what you're doing is you're really setting up an unfortunate situation where you know you've got lots of problems but you don't have services in place yet to respond to them.”\n\nWith treatment, researchers wrote in a report for the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, children exposed to early trauma including domestic violence can overcome the experiences without developing stress-related disorders.\n\nOften the support of parents, friends, family and school can help alleviate the effects of stress and trauma in children, according to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network.\n\n\"A strong relationship with a caring, nonviolent parent is one of the most important factors in helping children grow in a positive way despite their experiences,\" the group wrote in a 2014 report.\n\nBut Huth-Bocks said the parents she works with are often \"preoccupied keeping everyone alive and can't always be the most sensitive parent.\n\n\"There’s bigger fish to fry.\"\n\n'Pure chaos'\n\nHuff says it was a violent world that her twins entered in July 2014.\n\nShe says the father was holding the boy two days after their birth when he took a swing at her. The girl was the crib behind Huff, she says. She says she had to hold onto the crib to keep it from falling.\n\nThe father, Ignacio Ramirez Vallejo, denies her account. \"It never happened,\" he told USA TODAY. He was not charged in the alleged incident. “I’ve been in court many times,\" he said. \"Latrelle tried to accuse me for many different things. We were together almost seven years. They never find me guilty.”\n\nRamirez Vallejo says he did not sexually assault Huff.\n\nHis lawyer, A.J. Balbo, gave USA TODAY copies of letters he says Huff wrote to Ramirez Vallejo two years before the twins' birth saying she wanted to have children with him. “Everything they say about me is not true,\" Ignacio Ramirez said. \"I’m a Christian.”\n\nJeanne Fell, a nurse practitioner who specializes in neurology and has treated Huff's twins, says the pregnancy was about as complicated as they come. Huff had severe vomiting during much of the pregnancy and required intravenous medication. A cesarean section was scheduled at 37 weeks. A typical pregnancy lasts 40.\n\n\"It's been pure chaos since these kids have been born,\" Fell said. \"She does her very best, but certainly there are limits to how much she can give of herself to the children.\"\n\nBoth babies were poor eaters, Fell says.

Additionally, they have very little to no nutritional value.\n\nA 2019 article published in the the journal Public Health Nutrition describes them as \"liable to overcompensation.\"\n\nThese foods include things like ice cream, chips, cheeseburgers, French fries, soda, cake, candy, and cookies.\n\nUPFs have also been linked to a number of health issues including an increased risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease, cancer and depression in women. They've also been linked to cognitive decline like dementia.\n\nMore:You know ultra-processed foods are linked to health risks. Here's how to eat less of them\n\nFood addiction\n\nFood addiction is not classified as a mental illness in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR), a guide for healthcare professionals to diagnose mental disorders. However, there's been growing research into the topic in the last 20 years, according to the study.\n\n“There is converging and consistent support for the validity and clinical relevance of ultra-processed food addiction,” Ashley Gearhardt, a University of Michigan professor and lead author of the study said news release. “By acknowledging that certain types of processed foods have the properties of addictive substances, we may be able to help improve global health.”\n\nSymptoms of a food addiction can include craving food even when you're already full, eating more of something than you intended or continuing to eat something despite negative consequences.\n\nChris van Tulleken, a doctor and the author of Ultra-Processed People told the Guardian that while food itself is not addictive, “UPF is not really food. The purpose of food is to provide nourishment. UPF’s primary purpose is profit and financial growth.\"\n\nMore:Do healthy chips exist? All the salty details on baked, fried and homemade potato chips\n\nOur relationship with food\n\nGearhardt told the Guardian that UPFs have changed our body's relationship with food, mainly our reward system to fats and sugars.\n\n“Our survival system has gone into hyper-overdrive,\" Gearhardt said.\n\nThat comes by way of dopamine. According to the study, when someone eats UPFs they get a spike in dopamine, which makes them feel good. They feel terrible once it crashes and then crave the good feeling. So, they seek out more UPF's.\n\nThat processes is similar to what happens to our bodies when we consume alcohol, cigarettes or other addictive substances. While we know that ethanol and nicotine are the addictive properties in alcohol and cigarettes, researchers still don't know what exactly causes UPFs to have a similar effect.\n\nHowever, Van Tulleken told the Guardian, that not everyone will be addicted to them.\n\n\"Almost 90% of people can try alcohol and not develop a problematic relationship,\" he said.\n\n\"Many UPFs for many people are addictive, and when people experience food addiction, it is almost always to UPF products.\"\n\nMore:Does the ‘healthiest diet’ exist?

That amount is said to produce a mild intoxication for nonregular users.\n\n“One of the highest quality studies included in our publication found that use of high potency cannabis, compared to low potency cannabis, was linked to a four-fold increased risk of addiction,” said study coauthor Tom Freeman, a senior lecturer in the department of psychology and director of the addiction and mental health group at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, in an email.\n\nIn the United States, about 3 in 10 people who use marijuana have cannabis use disorder, the medical term for marijuana addiction, according to the US Centers for Disease and Prevention.\n\nThe European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction found a 76% rise in people entering treatment for cannabis addiction over the past decade, “while cannabis potency continued to rise during the same time,” Freeman said.\n\nIn addition, “a report by the United Nations found that in the past two decades, the proportion of people seeking treatment for cannabis addiction has risen in all world regions apart from Africa,” he said.\n\nA yearly rise in potency\n\nIn a gram of herbal cannabis, the dried and harvested tops of female marijuana plants that are typically smoked, THC concentrations increased by approximately 2.9 milligrams each year, according to a 2020 study by Freeman and his team at the University of Bath.\n\nThe potency of marijuana has been increasing every year since the 1970s, studies have found. Adobe Stock\n\nIn cannabis resin, the sticky brown sap on the plant from which extracts and concentrations are made, THC levels increased by approximately 5.7 milligrams each year from 1975 to 2017, the study found. Concentrated products can reach extremely high levels of THC.\n\nThis yearly rise in potency may not be clear to consumers, experts fear. While looking at a product label might tell a person the “precise potency” of THC in a store where marijuana is legally sold, “people buying cannabis illegally may not be able to access reliable information about the potency of the product they are using,” Freeman said.\n\n“However, certain types of cannabis are typically more potent than others – cannabis extracts are typically more potent than cannabis flower,” he added.\n\nWhile people do try to adjust their consumption when the potency of their cannabis varies, “such as by adding less cannabis to their joint or inhaling less deeply,” these efforts fail to completely work, Freeman said. That means “higher potency products still deliver a larger dose of THC to consumers than lower potency products,” he said.\n\nMental health affected\n\nAs marijuana became more potent, cases of marijuana-associated psychosis rose, the review found. Psychosis is a “loss of contact with reality” that can be characterized by hearing voices and having delusions, Freeman said.\n\n“The evidence linking cannabis potency to addiction and psychosis was very clear,” he said.\n\nHigh-potency weed users appear to have a significant increase in the likelihood of developing generalized anxiety disorder than those who smoke less robust strains of marijuana, a 2020 study had found.\n\nHowever, the new review of studies found a “more varied” connection between the increase in marijuana potency and depression and anxiety, “meaning that the impact is unclear for these other mental health outcomes,” Freeman said.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/health/melatonin-overuse-wellness/index.html", "title": "Using melatonin for sleep is on the rise, study says, despite potential ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nMore and more adults are taking over-the-counter melatonin to get to sleep, and some may be using it at dangerously high levels, a study has found.\n\nThe overall use among the US adult population is still “relatively low,” but the study does “document a significant many-fold increase in melatonin use in the past few years,” said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School. She was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study, published in the medical journal JAMA, found that by 2018 Americans were taking more than twice the amount of melatonin than a decade earlier.\n\nMelatonin has been linked to headaches, dizziness, nausea, stomach cramps, drowsiness, confusion or disorientation, irritability and mild anxiety, depression and tremors as well as abnormally low blood pressure. It can also interact with common medications and trigger allergies.\n\nWhile short-term use for people with jet lag, shift workers and those who have trouble falling asleep appears to be safe, long-term safety is unknown, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n“In an associational study we found that older adults who reported frequent use — every night or most nights — of a sleep aid (over the counter or prescription) had a higher risk of incident dementia and early mortality,” Robbins said.\n\nHowever, researchers could not determine which type of sleep aid — over-the-counter medications, such as melatonin, or prescription medications — was responsible for the findings.\n\nMelatonin’s side effects\n\nSince 2006, a small but growing subset of adults are taking amounts of melatonin that far exceed the dosage of 5 milligrams a day typically used as a short-term treatment, the study found.\n\nHowever, pills for sale may contain levels of melatonin much higher than what is advertised on the label. Unlike drugs and food, melatonin is not fully regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, so there are no federal requirements that companies test pills to ensure they contain the amount of advertised melatonin.\n\nPeople are using twice as much melatonin as they did a decade ago, sometimes at dangerously high levels. Shutterstock\n\n“Previous research has found that that melatonin content in these unregulated, commercially available melatonin supplements ranged from — 83% to +478% of the labeled content,” said Robbins, who coauthored the book “Sleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep But are Too Tired to Ask.”\n\nNor are there any requirements that companies test their products for harmful hidden additives in melatonin supplements sold in stores and online. Previous studies also found 26% of the melatonin supplements contained serotonin, “a hormone that can have harmful effects even at relatively low levels,” according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\n\n“We cannot be certain of the purity of melatonin that is available over the counter,” Robbins said.\n\nTaking too much serotonin by combining medications such as antidepressants, migraine medications and melatonin can lead to a serious drug reaction. Mild symptoms include shivering and diarrhea, while a more severe reaction can lead to muscle rigidity, fever, seizures and even death if not treated.\n\nIs it bad to take melatonin every night?\n\nBecause it is purchased over the counter, experts say many people view melatonin as an herbal supplement or vitamin. In reality, melatonin is a hormone made by the pineal gland, located deep within the brain, and released into the bloodstream to regulate the body’s sleep cycles.\n\n“There is a view that if it’s natural, then it can’t hurt,” Robbins told CNN in an earlier interview on the impact of melatonin on children. “The truth is, we just really don’t know the implications of melatonin in the longer term, for adults or kids.”\n\nAnother reality: Studies have found that while using melatonin can be helpful in inducing sleep if used correctly — taking it at least two hours before bed — but the actual benefit is small.\n\n“When adults took melatonin, it decreased the amount of time it took them to fall asleep by four to eight minutes,” Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, a professor in the department of pediatrics at Seattle Children’s Hospital at the University of Washington, told CNN in 2021.\n\n“So for someone who takes hours to fall asleep, probably the better thing for them to do is turn off their screens, or get 20 to 40 minutes of exercise each day, or don’t drink any caffeinated products at all,” Breuner said.\n\n“These are all sleep hygiene tools that work, but people are very reticent to do them. They rather just take a pill, right?”\n\nTraining your brain to sleep\n\nThere are other proven sleep tips that work just as well, if not better than sleeping aids, experts say. The body begins secreting melatonin at dark. What do we do in our modern culture? Use artificial light to keep us awake, often long past the body’s normal bedtime.\n\nResearch has found that the body will slow or stop melatonin production if exposed to light, including the blue light from our smartphones, laptops and the like.\n\n“Any LED spectrum light source may further suppress melatonin levels,” said Dr. Vsevolod Polotsky, who directs sleep basic research in the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nSo ban those devices at least an hour before you want to fall asleep. Like to read yourself to sleep? That’s fine, experts say, just read in a dim light from a book or use an e-reader in night mode.\n\n“Digital light will suppress the circadian drive,” Polotsky said, while a “dim reading light will not.”\n\nOther tips include keeping your bedroom temperature at cooler temperatures — about 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 20 degrees Celsius). We sleep better if we’re a bit chilly, experts say.\n\nSet up a bedtime ritual by taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book or listening to soothing music. Or you can try deep breathing, yoga, meditation or light stretches. Go to bed and get up at the same time each day, even on weekends or your days off, experts say. The body likes routine.\n\nIf your doctor does prescribe melatonin to help with jet lag or other minor sleep issues, keep the use “short term,” Robbins said.\n\nIf you are planning to use melatonin for a short-term sleep aid, try to purchase pharmaceutical grade melatonin, she advised.

They have been taken out of school, away from their friends and familiar support structures, and had to live with the uncertainty and fear that came with the coronavirus. Many parents lost jobs. Millions of children lost parents and grandparents to Covid-19.\n\nThe study, published Thursday in the journal Biological Psychiatry: Global Open Science, is one of the first to look at the physical changes in the brain brought by that the stress and anxiety.\n\nThe research comes out of a larger study in which scientists were trying to understand the gender differences in depression among adolescents.\n\nEight years ago, they set out with a plan to take MRI scans of 220 children ages 9 to 13 every two years. The team had completed two sets of scans when the pandemic interrupted their research, and they weren’t able to start scanning again until the end of 2020.\n\nWhen their research was interrupted, the team decided it would be interesting to study the effects that this stressful event was having on kids’ developing brains. The pre-pandemic scans would help them make this comparison.\n\nThe researchers matched children in the same demographics – including gender, age, exposure to stress and socioeconomic status.\n\nTo find the average brain age, they put the MRI scans through a model that pools data from other scans.\n\nThe researchers compared the MRI scans of 128 children. Half the scans were taken before the pandemic and the other half at the end of 2020.\n\nThey found that the children who had lived through the first year of the pandemic had brain ages that were older than their chronological age.\n\nThe brains that had gone through the beginning of the pandemic had growth in the area that can help regulate fear and stress, called the amygdala, and in the hippocampus, the area of the brain that can controls access to memories. Tissues had thinned in the part of the brain that controls executive functioning, the cortex.\n\nA child’s brain changes naturally over time, but research has found that these physical changes can speed up when a person goes through significant adversity in childhood.\n\nStudies have shown that people who are exposed to violence, neglect, poverty and family problems early in life have faster brain aging and can have problems with their mental health later on.\n\nIan Gotlib, lead author of the new study, said the research team had expected to find the problems with anxiety, depression and internalized problems. “The pandemic has not been kind to adolescent mental health,” said Gotlib, a psychology professor at Stanford University.\n\nBut they weren’t exactly sure what they would find with the MRI scans.\n\n“It’s always interesting to do research like this when you’re not really sure what’s going to happen,” Gotlib said. “These effects were interesting and happened pretty quickly.\n\n“This was just a one-year shutdown, so we didn’t know that the effects on the brain would be this pronounced after that short a period of stress,” he added. “It tracks with the mental health difficulties that we’re seeing.”\n\nWhat isn’t clear, he said, is whether the brain changes will have an impact later in life. The research team plans to scan the same kids later to track their brain development. There is a chance that their brain changes could have just been an immediate response to a stressor that will normalize over time, he said.\n\nThe team also plans to look at the 10 children in the study who had Covid-19 to see whether there is a different effect. The physical differences seem to be “a little more pronounced” in the children who had Covid, Gotlib said.\n\nDr. Max Wiznitzer, diversion chief of pediatric neurology at UH Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital, said the changes in the brain were interesting, but what’s important is whether the mental health problems persist.\n\n“The anatomy is not important. It’s the functionality that’s important,” said Wiznitzer, who wasn’t involved in the research. “The clinical consequence here is the functional impact, the mental health condition clinically and how it’s functioning and how you deal with it.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWith appropriate mental health interventions, problems like anxiety or depression can be managed. “The brain has that capacity for reorganization – or call it improvement, if you will,” Wiznitzer added.\n\nGotlib hopes parents and guardians keep in mind that although lockdowns and school closures may be over, the mental health consequences may be lingering.\n\n“Be sure that your adolescent or your teen is getting any help that he or she, that they, might need if they’re experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety” or being withdrawn.", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/politics/donald-trump-tax-returns-released/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump: Key takeaways from six years of former president's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSix years of Donald Trump’s federal tax returns released on Friday show the former president paid very little in federal income taxes the first and last year of his presidency, claiming huge losses that helped limit his tax bill, among other revelations.\n\nThe returns, long shrouded in secrecy, were released to the public on Friday by the House Ways and Means Committee, the culmination of a battle over their disclosure that went to the Supreme Court. They confirm a report issued from the Joint Committee on Taxation that Trump claimed large losses before and throughout his presidency that he carried forward to reduce or practically eliminate his tax burden. For example, his returns show that he carried forward a $105 million loss in 2015 and $73 million in 2016.\n\nThe thousands of pages of documents from the former president’s personal and business federal tax returns – which spanned the years 2015 through 2020 – provide a complex web of raw data about Trump’s finances, offering up many questions about his wealth and income that could be pursued both by auditors and Trump’s political opponents.\n\nHere are key takeaways from the documents reviewed by CNN:\n\nReturns shed light on questionable tax claims\n\nTrump’s returns also show the former president made several claims that auditors may question.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation, which reviewed the returns, flagged that Trump claimed a large number of questionable items on his tax returns, including eyebrow-raising amounts of interest he claims to have received from loans to his children that the bipartisan committee said could indicate Trump was disguising gifts.\n\nThe JCT argued that an auditor should investigate the loan agreements Trump made with his children, including the interest rates. If the interest Trump claims to have charged his children was not at market rate, for example, it could be considered a gift for tax purposes, requiring him to pay a higher tax rate on the money.\n\nIn each year of his presidency, for example, Trump claimed he received exactly $18,000 in interest on a loan he said he gave his daughter Ivanka Trump and $8,715 in interest from his son Donald Trump, Jr.. In 2017 to 2019, Trump said he received exactly $24,000 from his son Eric Trump, and Eric paid him $19,605 in interest in 2020.\n\nThat raises the question of whether “the loans were bona fide arm’s length transactions, or whether the transfers were disguised gifts that could trigger gift tax and a disallowance of interest deductions by the related borrowers,” the JCT said in its report.\n\n“It’s unusual to have interest in round numbers – very rare,” said Martin Sheil, former supervisory special agent for IRS’ Criminal Investigation unit. “An auditor would want to see payments, loan agreements and interest rates.”\n\nThere are also questions about Trump’s returns listing an identical amount of company expenses and income.\n\nFor example, in 2017, Trump claimed his business DJT Aerospace LLC, which operates Trump’s personal helicopter, claimed $42,965 in income. It also claimed the exact same amount – $42,965 – in expenses. In other words, every single dollar – to the dollar – that the company earned was negated by the company’s expenses, such as payroll, fuel and other items. That left the company with zero income – and nothing to tax.\n\n“Total expenses equaling total income is a statistical impossibility,” said Shiel, who added that the figures are not evidence something illegal was done. “It just doesn’t happen.”\n\nThe JCT in its report raised several similar questions. For example, it noted IRS auditors were investigating multiple so-called large unusual questionable items on Trump’s tax returns for which the regulator wanted Trump to provide supporting evidence to back up his claims.\n\nRelease comes after years-long fight\n\nThe returns were obtained by the Democratic-run Ways and Means Committee only a few weeks ago after a protracted legal battle that lasted nearly four years. The committee voted last week to release the tax returns, but their release was delayed to redact sensitive personal information like Social Security numbers.\n\nThe release of the tax returns follows a pursuit for the documents that had typically been made public voluntarily by past US presidents. Trump and his legal team continuously sought to keep his returns secret, arguing that Congress had never wielded its legislative powers to demand a president’s tax returns, which Trump said could have far-reaching implications.\n\n“The Democrats should have never done it, the Supreme Court should have never approved it, and it’s going to lead to horrible things for so many people,” Trump said in a statement following the release.\n\n“The ‘Trump’ tax returns once again show how proudly successful I have been and how I have been able to use depreciation and various other tax deductions as an incentive for creating thousands of jobs and magnificent structures and enterprises.”\n\nOther Republicans also criticized Democrats’ efforts in pursuit of the tax returns as political, with Texas Rep. Kevin Brady – the committee’s top conservative – saying the release would amount to “a dangerous new political weapon that reaches far beyond the former president and overturns decades of privacy protections for average Americans that have existed since the Watergate reform.”\n\nDuring the committee’s closed-door meeting last week, Republicans warned that the release of Trump’s tax returns by Democrats could prompt retribution once Republicans control the House next year – like going after the taxes of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.\n\n“I had countless people tell me of things that they were concerned with President Biden’s family dealings and how they believed that him and his family is enriched because of his political power. And they are begging for oversight and accountability on that,” said Rep. Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, according to excerpts the GOP released from the meeting. “Do we need to go down all that? Is that what you all are wishing to do?”\n\nReturns show he held foreign bank accounts while in office\n\nTrump reported having foreign bank accounts between 2015 and 2020, including a bank account in China between 2015 and 2017, his tax returns show.\n\nTrump was required to report the accounts to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The filings show that the former president maintained foreign bank accounts in countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and China.\n\nThe China bank account, which was reported by The New York Times in 2020, was tied to Trump International Hotels Management’s business push in the country, Trump Organization lawyer Alan Garten said at the time.\n\nThe 2020 disclosure of business dealings in China came as the Trump campaign sought to portray Biden as a “puppet” of China. Biden’s income tax returns and financial disclosures showed no business dealings or income from China.\n\nThe returns also show that Trump paid more in foreign taxes than in US federal income taxes in 2017, the first year of his presidency.\n\nIn 2017, Trump paid just $750 in US federal income taxes because of large carry-forward losses that he claimed in prior years, negating virtually all of his American tax liability. Yet Trump paid nearly $1 million in taxes to foreign countries that year.\n\nThe fact that Trump paid foreign taxes isn’t in itself surprising, but it shows how Trump’s companies and businesses interests span the globe, and how those businesses are subject to local tax laws and regulations.\n\nOn his tax return, Trump listed business income, taxes, expenses or other notable financial items in Azerbaijan, Panama, Canada, India, Qatar, South Korea, the United Kingdom, China, the Dominican Republic, United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, Grenada, US territory Puerto Rico, Georgia, Israel, Brazil, St. Maarten, Mexico, Indonesia, Ireland, Turkey, and St. Vincent.\n\nTrump claimed no charitable deductions in 2020\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump pledged he would donate the entirety of his $400,000 salary to charity each year. He frequently boasted about donating parts of his quarterly paycheck to various government agencies.\n\n“While the press doesn’t like writing about it, nor do I need them to, I donate my yearly Presidential salary of $400,000.00 to different agencies throughout the year,” Trump tweeted in March 2019.\n\nIf he donated his 2020 salary, he didn’t claim it on his taxes. Among the six years of tax returns the House Ways and Means Committee released, 2020 was the sole year in which Trump listed no donations to charity.\n\nTrump’s finances took a sizable hit in 2020, probably as a result of the pandemic and the lack of demand for vacations and lodging in his hotels. Trump reported large donations to charity in 2018 and 2019, helping reduce the amount he owed on millions of dollars in income he reported in those years.\n\nBut Trump posted a massive $4.8 million adjusted loss in 2020, a year, which alone wiped out his federal income tax obligation. Trump paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2020.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation raised questions about the accuracy of some enormous charitable deductions Trump claimed in previous years’ tax returns, including large and unsubstantiated cash gifts. Trump also claimed a $21.1 million deduction in 2015 for donating 158 acres of his 212-acre property called Seven Springs in North Castle, New York. That donation, which was made to a land trust, is a focus of the Manhattan district attorney’s criminal investigation of the Trump Organization’s finances.\n\nTrump’s own 2017 tax law appears to have reduced the amount he was able to deduct from tax bill\n\nTrump claimed that the 2017 Republican tax plan he championed and signed would cost him and his family “a fortune.” It’s not clear that it did, but it does appear to have limited the amount that he could claim in one part of his complex tax return.\n\nThe 2017 tax law capped the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, at $10,000 a year. In previous years, tax filers were allowed to deduct more of their SALT payments. Although the law was passed in 2017, it didn’t apply until the 2018 tax year.\n\nIn 2018, Trump listed $10.5 million in state and local taxes, but could deduct just $10,000 of that from his taxes. In 2019, Trump paid $8.4 million in SALT but was capped at $10,000. And in 2020, Trump said he paid $8.5 million in SALT but claimed the maximum allowable $10,000.\n\nBy comparison, in 2016 and 2017, Trump was able to deduct significantly more from state and local taxes. For example, in 2016 and 2017, he deducted $5.2 million each year in SALT payments.\n\nSome Democrats criticized the 2017 tax law’s SALT cap for taking aim at residents in the Northeast and the West who have some of the highest property taxes in the country. The Tax Foundation found that property tax deductions capped in 2017 had previously accounted for about a third of all state and local tax deductions. But Trump defended the provision, saying the cap was necessary even if it would hurt his own finances.\n\nIt’s not clear how much the SALT cap hurt Trump, however. Although that particular deduction was capped, Trump claimed many other deductions that limited the amount of federal income taxes he had to pay.\n\nPresidential audits\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee, which is responsible for overseeing the IRS and writing tax policy, requested the returns under the authority of section 6103 of the US tax code. Their report focused primarily on whether Trump’s tax returns during his time in office were properly audited under the IRS’ mandatory audit program for US presidents.\n\nThe committee found that the IRS opened only one “mandatory” audit during Trump’s term – for his 2016 tax return. And that didn’t take place until the fall of 2019, after Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sent a letter asking the IRS for Trump’s returns and tax information. The report characterizes the presidential audit program as “dormant.”\n\n“The research that was done as it relates to the mandatory audit program was nonexistent,” Neal said last week following the committee vote.\n\nRepublicans on the committee argued that Democrats acknowledged it was “not necessary to publicly release the private tax information to change requirements on the presidential audit program.”\n\nA Republican dissent issued Friday warned that, “Democrats’ dangerous precedent will lead the American public to demand other people’s tax returns to be released.”\n\nLast week, the House passed a bill that would reform the presidential audit process in a largely symbolic vote before Republicans take the majority in the new Congress. The legislation is not expected to be taken up by the Senate before the new Congress is sworn in.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["David Goldman Jeremy Herb Jeanne Sahadi Maegan Vazquez", "David Goldman", "Jeremy Herb", "Jeanne Sahadi", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/10/30/headaches-migraines-childhood-trauma-stress/71302252007/", "title": "Headaches and migraines: Childhood trauma could be causing them", "text": "If you suffer from headaches, new research suggests your childhood may be partially to blame.\n\nA report published last week in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, found that people who experienced one or more traumatic events during childhood were 48% more likely to develop headache disorders as an adult.\n\nThe body holds trauma that can manifest into physical symptoms, the study found. The authors say it's important for providers to keep childhood trauma in mind as they treat headache disorders. Experts suspect headaches may become more prevalent in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as reports of substance abuse, chronic disease and other trauma events increased.\n\n“These findings cannot be ignored,” said Catherine Kreatsoulas, a senior author on the study, who teaches at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “How this will play out in the future is yet to be seen. But we definitely have an issue in front of us.”\n\nSuffer from headaches?Over half of the world does and women report the most, study says\n\nHeadaches and childhood trauma\n\nThe large study included over 154,000 participants from the U.S. and 18 other countries.\n\nIn their analysis, Harvard researchers discovered that as the number of traumatic events in a person's life increased, so did the odds of having headaches. People who reported one traumatic event had a 24% increased risk of a headache disorder, while people who had four or more were more than twice as likely to experience chronic headaches.\n\nThe study grouped the traumas into different categories. Physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, witnessing or using threats of violence, or serious family conflicts were categorized as threat traumas.\n\nExperiences such as neglect, economic adversity, having an incarcerated household member, divorce or separation, parental death, and living in a household with a person who has a mental illness, chronic disability or disease, or alcohol or substance abuse were categorized as deprivation traumas.\n\nResearchers found the first category, threat traumas, were associated with a 46% increase in headaches while deprivation traumas corresponded with a 35% increase.\n\n“We saw these played a very distinct role in headaches in adulthood,” Kreatsoulas, the senior author of the study, said. “These pathways are really important and we really need to pay attention to what’s happening in childhood and adolescence.”\n\nTrauma and the brain\n\nExperts say threat and deprivation trauma may affect the brain in different ways.\n\nThreat-related trauma may impact the formation of the hippocampus, the amygdala and other parts of the brain that are involved in emotional processing, said Dr. Mia Minen, director of headache research at NYU Langone Health.\n\nDeprivation impacts the brain’s development, she said. When children are neglected, they’re not likely to get the proper attention that stimulates connections in the brain. The changes in connections may be linked with headaches in adulthood.\n\nStress-induced hormones, like cortisol, triggered by trauma-related conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder may also contribute to migraines, Minen said.\n\nEarly intervention\n\nHeadache and migraine disorders can be debilitating and getting rid of them is not as easy as popping over-the-counter pain medication.\n\n“Migraine is extremely disabling,” Minen said. “And unfortunately, (migraines) really affect people during their most productive years of life.”\n\nThey can have a harsher impact on children, who often miss school, extracurricular and social activities, said Dr. Megan Purser, pediatric psychologist at the Texas Children’s Hospital headache clinic.\n\nShe’s already seen an increase in young patients with headaches at her clinic following the COVID-19 pandemic, which fueled certain deprivation traumas noted in the new study such as social isolation, chronic disease, substance abuse, parental death, and financial issues, among others.\n\nChildren who suffer from headaches tend to grow into adults who suffer from them, so it’s important to screen for trauma and intervene early before it impacts school, higher education, work or social life in the future.\n\nPediatricians should set the groundwork for children who experience chronic headaches. Purser said, so they'll have the skills and tools they need to be healthier as adults.\n\nSend tips to Adrianna Rodriguez at adrodriguez@usatoday.com\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

As more and more states move to legalize marijuana, the stereotypical mind-numbing effects of weed have become passé, often replaced by an acceptance of the drug as an acceptable way to socialize, relax and get better sleep.\n\nBut while society may have forgotten the impact that weed can have on the brain, science has not.\n\nStudies have long shown that getting high can harm cognitive function. A January 2022 review of research, published in the journal Addiction, finds that impact may last well beyond the initial high, especially for adolescents.\n\n“Our study enabled us to highlight several areas of cognition impaired by cannabis use, including problems concentrating and difficulties remembering and learning, which may have considerable impact on users’ daily lives,” said coauthor Dr. Alexandre Dumais, associate clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Montreal.\n\nWeed can affect your ability to make decisions, solve problems and perform other cognitive functions, a study found. Adobe Stock\n\n“Cannabis use in youth may consequently lead to reduced educational attainment, and, in adults, to poor work performance and dangerous driving. These consequences may be worse in regular and heavy users,” Dumais said.\n\nWeed’s impact on the brain can be particularly detrimental to cognitive development for youth, whose brains are still developing, said Dr. Megan Moreno, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“This study provides strong evidence for negative cognitive effects of cannabis use, and should be taken as critical evidence to prioritize prevention of cannabis use in youth,” Moreno said. “And contrary to the time of Cheech and Chong, we now know that the brain continues to develop through age 25.\n\n“Parents should be aware that adolescents using cannabis are at risk for damage to their most important organ, their brain.”\n\nHigher-level thinking\n\nThe January 2022 review looked at studies on over 43,000 people and found a negative impact of tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the main psychoactive compound in cannabis, on the brain’s higher levels of thinking. Those executive functions include the ability to make decisions, remember important data, plan, organize and solve problems, as well as control emotions and behavior.\n\nCan you recover or reverse those deficits? Scientists aren’t sure.\n\n“Research has revealed that THC is a fat-soluble compound that may be stored in body fat and, thus, gradually released into the bloodstream for months,” Dumais said, adding that high-quality research is needed to establish the long-term impact of that exposure.\n\nSome studies say the negative effects on the brain may ease after weed is discontinued, but that may also depend on the amount, frequency and years of marijuana use. The age in which weed use began may also play a role, if it falls within the crucial developmental period of the youthful brain.\n\n“Thus far, the most consistent alterations produced by cannabis use, mostly its chronic use, during youth have been observed in the prefrontal cortex,” Dumais said. “Such alterations may potentially lead to a long-term disruption of cognitive and executive functions.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn addition, some studies have shown that “early and frequent cannabis use in adolescence predicts poor cognition in adulthood,” he added.\n\nWhile science sorts this out, “preventive and interventional measures to educate youths on cannabis use and discourage them from using the substance in a chronic manner should be considered … since youths remain particularly susceptible to the effects of cannabis,” Dumais said.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/health/family-connections-flourish-parenting-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "Children with strong family bonds have a high chance of flourishing ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChildren with strong family connections are associated with a high likelihood of flourishing in life, a new study found.\n\nNumerous studies have shown that strong family bonds lower the chances of poor outcomes in children such as risky behaviors and drug abuse, but this study revealed that there may be positive outcomes as well, said lead study author Dr. Robert Whitaker, director of the Columbia-Bassett research program at Columbia University in New York City.\n\n“What was different about this study was it showed that family connection is associated with thriving and not just surviving or avoiding harm,” Whitaker said.\n\nResearchers surveyed over 37,000 children in 26 countries and found adolescents who reported having a great bond with their family also reported that they were succeeding in life.\n\nThe study, which was published in the journal Pediatrics, included children ages 11 to 13 years old who were surveyed between 2016 and 2019.\n\nThe data was gathered across Europe, Africa, Asia and South America from the International Survey of Children’s Well-Being, a survey supported by the Jacobs Foundation, a Zurich-based organization that focuses on providing schools around the globe with science-based knowledge to help kids succeed.\n\nFamily connection was determined by a mean score of five categories: care, support, safety, respect, and participation. For each subject, participants were given a statement and asked to assess how much they agreed with it, scoring from zero (do not agree) to 4 (strongly agree). For example, to measure care, children were asked how much they agreed with the statement, “I feel safe at home.”\n\nThe essence of family connection is children feeling that they are accepted and nurtured at home, which allows them to learn what their strengths and weaknesses are in a safe environment as they are building their identity, Whitaker said.\n\nFlourishing was determined by a mean score of six categories: self-acceptance, purpose in life, positive relations with others, personal growth, environmental mastery and autonomy. The survey structure was the same as that for family connections, except the ranking system ranged from zero to 10.\n\nWhen it comes to flourishing, it’s about kids accepting their strengths and weaknesses and then being able to use their strengths to find their purpose in life, he said.\n\nChildren can thrive, not just survive\n\nChildren with the greatest level of family connection were over 49% more likely to flourish compared with those with the lowest level of family connection, according to the study.\n\nIt’s not enough to not have depression and anxiety to live a good life, according to Elaine Reese, a professor of psychology at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“A good life entails having a sense of purpose and meaning, which is what the flourishing scale in this study measured,” she said.\n\nThe highest scores in both family connection and flourishing came from children who said they live with both parents, have enough food or never have their family worrying about finances.\n\nResearchers then controlled the data for families’ poverty levels, including financial circumstances and food insecurity, to remove the effect they may have had on the numbers. After controlling for these factors, the strength of family connections still impacted how much children flourished.\n\nHow to strengthen family connection\n\nAdults have a very powerful influence on the emotional climate in the home, so it’s important to create a space where children feel seen and heard, Whitaker said.\n\nA great opportunity to strengthen family bonds is around the dinner table, he said. Adults should create an environment where children feel comfortable speaking freely. While they are talking, grown-ups should show that they have a genuine interest in what their children are saying and try to suspend judgment, Whitaker added.\n\nAdults do not need to make grand gestures to bond with their children, Reese said. Having meaningful conversations is more important for your connection than taking them on expensive trips, she said.\n\nSilence is also another powerful form of communication, he said.\n\nChildren and parents or their caregivers spending time together in silence or even running an errand or doing chores can create a connection, according to Whitaker.\n\n“We don’t necessarily need to fill those moments with chatter or the radio,” he said.\n\nOther adults may impact how children flourish\n\nIn the future, Whitaker said he wants to research the impact community members like teachers have on children.\n\n“We suspect that sense of connection to non-parental adults probably adds to the likelihood that teen will flourish,” he said in an email.\n\nOutside relationships are important and do impact children, especially during infancy and early childhood, said Kelly-Ann Allen, an educational and developmental psychologist and senior lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. She was not involved in the study.\n\n“If children experience healthy trusting relationships early, they are more likely to establish healthy trusting relationships as adults,” she said.", "authors": ["Megan Marples"], "publish_date": "2022/05/20"}]}

It’s based on modeling of the novel coronavirus that now informs policy in the United Kingdom and other nations.\n\nAnd it endeavors to answer the question everyone is asking:\n\nWhat the hell is going on?\n\nWhy are we shutting down our daily lives, our economies, our human interaction?\n\nAs almost all of us retreat to our homes for a long period of social separation from others in our communities, we’re asking another important question:\n\nJust how long is this going to last?\n\nThe paper with the interminable name, whose lead researcher, Neil M. Ferguson, is an epidemiologist at Imperial College and professor of mathematical biology who specializes in infectious disease spread in humans and animals, has an answer.\n\nWe’re in for a long slog.\n\n“The global impact of COVID-19 has been profound,” writes Ferguson and 29 others, “and the public health threat it represents is the most serious seen in a respiratory virus since the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic.”\n\nHere's the problem:\n\nA new virus, unleashed on the world in Wuhan, China, is now spreading across the globe. Its destructive power is such that it very rapidly sickens people, particularly the elderly, to the point that large percentages require critical care at hospitals to save their lives.\n\nThe numbers of patients have been so large in some regions of the world that they have completely overwhelmed health-care systems and forced war-time like triage decisions of life and death.\n\nIn Italy some patients can’t even get into the hospitals and die at home.\n\nIn dealing with this problem, there are two fundamental strategies to employ: “mitigation” and “suppression,” write the authors.\n\nMitigation works to slow, not stop, the spread of disease, by encouraging home isolation of those believed infected, home quarantine for those living in the same home with them and social distancing of the elderly and other at-risk populations.\n\nSuppression requires social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of infected patients and quarantine of their family members. It can require closing schools and universities.\n\n“Each policy has major challenges,” write the authors.\n\nAccording to their U.K. and U.S. modeling, mitigation would reduce health care demand by two-thirds and deaths by half. It would still result in “hundreds of thousands of deaths” and would still overwhelm the intensive care units in our hospitals “many times over.”\n\nSuppression would require strict adherence until a vaccine is developed and scaled up for the larger public. That could take “potentially 18 months or more.” If relaxed before that time, “transmission will quickly rebound.”\n\n“We conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission.”\n\nIf social distancing is effective, it “may allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily in relative short time windows, but measures will need to be reintroduced if or when case numbers rebound,” the authors write.\n\n“… while experience in China and now South Korea show that suppression is possible in the short term, it remains to be seen whether it is possible long-term, and whether the social and economic costs of the interventions adopted thus far can be reduced.”\n\nOn Sunday, The (U.K.) Guardian newspaper reported that secret briefing papers delivered to National Health Service officials project the epidemic will infect 80% percent of all Britons and last until the spring of 2021.\n\n“The document, seen by the Guardian, is the first time health chiefs tackling the virus have admitted that they expect it to circulate for 12 more months and lead to huge extra strain on an already overstretched NHS.\n\nIt also suggests that health chiefs are braced for widespread infection. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, told The Guardian:\n\n“For the public to hear that it could last for 12 months, people are going to be really upset about that and pretty worried about that. … A year is entirely plausible. But that figure isn’t well appreciated or understood. “I think it will dip in the summer, towards the end of June, and come back in November, in the way that usual seasonal flu does. I think it will be around forever, but become less severe over time, as immunity builds up.”\n\nTHE VIRUS DOESN’T CARE ABOUT YOUR POLITICS\n\nWe are in the middle of both a global health-care crisis and a presidential election. It would have been impossible to keep politics out of the decision-making as we ramp up to confront the novel coronavirus.\n\nBut we have to try to keep it out, writes Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and former commissioner of the New York City Health Department.\n\nFrieden’s observations are noteworthy because they are published on the VOX news and opinion website that is generally projecting a liberal slant – a slant that more than not agrees with the Democratic Party.\n\nThe Republican White House has made a number of missteps on testing, and the president as erred repeatedly with some of his public comments, notably his criticism of the U.S. Centers for Disease controls, notes Frieden.\n\nBut the White House has also done good, he argues:\n\n“Whatever your view of the current administration, some of its actions have saved lives. The ban on travel from China undoubtedly reduced the number of Americans who became infected with Covid-19. The new ban on travel from the EU could have some benefit — but only if we understand that this delays disease spread and does not prevent it, and is justified only if we use the time it buys ...”\n\nThe administration has made key mistakes on testing. It failed to quickly recognize and break through the bureaucratic labyrinth at the CDC and Food and Drug Administration that was blocking rapid development and deployment of COVID-19 tests.\n\nBut a lot of the criticism, while legitimate, has overlooked the limitations of testing, Frieden explains.\n\n“A surge in people being tested could actually spread disease, because people can become infected by someone else waiting to be tested. Getting tested today is no guarantee you won’t get infected tomorrow — and may give you a false sense of security. Furthermore, emerging data suggests that testing of throat swabs may miss as many as two-thirds of infections.”\n\nTesting is vital in many scenarios, particularly used in places where there are few confirmed infections, Frieden explains. In such cases, testing can inform containment and isolation strategies. Seattle, in fact, might have avoided full-fledged breakout had the federal government provided them the testing authority or test kits they needed.\n\nThe American health-care system is facing an enormous challenge. It will need the help of all of the American people to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prevent the overload of emergency rooms and hospital wards.\n\nBoth sides have been guilty of playing politics with this issue. Given the stakes, Frieden writes, we need to put down our swords.\n\n“Partisanship has no place when lives are at stake. Covid-19 might even help all of us realize that we are all connected, and although we need to increase social distance, we also need to increase solidarity to help each other get through what has quickly become a national and global crisis.”\n\nMEXICO TALKS OF TIGHTENED U.S. BORDER\n\nMexico’s Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell told a news conference Friday that novel coronavirus in the United States more likely poses a threat to Mexico than Mexico poses to the United States, reports Yahoo News:\n\n\"If it were technically necessary to consider mechanisms of restriction or stronger surveillance we would have to take into account not that Mexico would bring the virus to the United States, rather that the United States could bring it here.\"\n\nThe Mexicans are likely responding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s foolish assertion that a wall is needed “more than ever” because of coronavirus.\n\nCORONAVIRUS MORE LIKE 1957 PANDEMIC\n\nNicholas A. Christakis, physician and Sterling Professor of Social & Natural Science at Yale, who was famously caught in the maelstrom of identity politics at Yale in 2015 (you can see it here and here), argues in a Twitter thread that our more relevant parallel to the past is not the Spanish Flu of 1918 but the 1957 Influenza-A (H2N2) pandemic.\n\nThat outbreak killed 1.1 million people globally and 115,700 in the United States.\n\nYou can read his thread here.\n\nChristakis in 2009 was named to the TIME 100 list of the magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. In 2009 and 2010, Foreign Policy magazine named him in its list of top global thinkers.\n\nBRITAIN PUTS MANUFACTURERS ON WARTIME FOOTING\n\nThe British government is calling on carmakers and other manufactures to shift to producing medical ventilators now in short supply with the global outbreak of COVID-19. Ventilators are necessary to assist breathing and save lives of many, especially elderly, infected patients, reports The (U.K.) Times.\n\nMatt Hancock, the U.K. secretary for health and social care, explained the situation:\n\n“We start with around 5,000 ventilators, we think we need many times more than that, and we are saying if you produce a ventilator then we will buy it. No number is too high. “They are relatively complicated pieces of kit, I couldn’t make one, but they’re not so complicated that the advanced manufacturing that this country is so good at now can’t be able to turn its production lines over to.”\n\n“HOW MUCH WORSE THE CORONAVIRUS COULD GET”\n\nThe New York Times demonstrates through adaptive graphics how the novel coronavirus might evolve in the United States given the various strategies we might employ. This modeling was developed by Nicholas Kristof (mentioned above) and Stuart A. Thompson, head of The Times Opinions visual journalism department.\n\nOn current track we’re headed for 100 million Americans (one-third) infected and one-million deaths, according to the graphic simulation. See it here.\n\n“WE NEED TO STOP ASSUMING WE ARE DIFFERENT”\n\nIt is still the lull before the storm, but the United States and a number of European nations, including Spain, France and Germany, should expect “very serious outbreaks” of COVID-19 soon, writes Helen Jenkins, assistant professor at Boston University School of Public Health, whose research focuses on the epidemiology of infectious diseases.\n\nIn an article on the Medium online site, Jenkins warns:\n\n“Wuhan was caught unawares, and Italy was unlucky to have the first big outbreak in Europe, although it is unclear why. The United States and European countries must learn from this very quickly. We need to stop assuming we are different and start introducing measures to protect our communities.” “How? The countries not yet seriously affected must start testing seriously. It’s not enough to test those returning from an ‘affected area.’ We have to realize that the virus is already present and we ourselves are an ‘affected area.’ Another essential measure is social distancing, which could include things like stopping all large (and some small) gatherings, closing schools, working from home, limiting not only international but also domestic travel, even isolating specific cities or regions.”\n\nJenkins argues that South Korea is the model to follow with its “widespread” testing, contact tracing and aggressive quarantine protocols.\n\n“All countries and localities need to throw as much effort as they can at this thing. Individuals and governments need to show decisive leadership and break their paralysis by indecision. Speed is everything — and we are all in this together.”\n\nShe offers this last bit of advice: “Wash your hands like your life or someone else’s depends on it.”\n\n* * *\n\nDespite barren shelves in grocery stores and all the shutdowns in workplaces and sports and entertainment venues, many young Americans are still socializing as if nothing has changed. Journalist and author Rod Dreher has been tweeting the observations of an unnamed doctor who is dealing with the viral outbreak in this country:\n\nCRITICAL PLACES REMAIN OPEN IN FRANCE, INCLUDING… “TOBACCONISTS”?\n\nWith 4,469 people confirmed infected and 91 deaths, France is feeling the escalation of coronavirus. That has led to extraordinary measures, reports The Times of London:\n\n“Edouard Philippe, the French prime minister, ordered the closure of restaurants, bars, cinemas and nightclubs. All shops were also shut, except for food stores, pharmacies, banks and tobacconists. He asked people to stay home.”\n\nI searched for a story that would tell us why tobacconists are essential in disease-ridden France, but could find none. I did, however, find a reader comment in this story in The Australian that, while obviously not authoritative, offers a reason:\n\n“Tobac shops sell newspapers, transport tickets not just smokes.”\n\nISIS TRAVEL WARNING: AVOID EUROPE\n\nThe Middle East terror group ISIS is warning its cohorts through its al-Naba newsletter to “cover their mouths when yawning and sneezing,” to wash their hands regularly and to stay out of Europe, where the coronavirus infection rate is high, reports The (U.K.) Times.\n\n“Having previously urged its supporters to attack European cities, the group is now advising members to “stay away from the land of the epidemic” in case they become infected.”\n\nThis legitimate front-page story provoked some cheeky responses from British readers:\n\n“Wimps.” * * * “The silver lining!” * * * “Terrorist newsletter? Is there an ISIS app?” * * * “Do ISIS have all the toilet rolls?” * * * “The next thing will be the West offering medical assistance.” * * * “Allah works in mysterious ways.” * * * “She certainly does.”\n\n‘LA DOLCE VITA’ LIVES ON IN ITALY\n\nThe Italians are making glorious music in the Age of Coronavirus with all of its social dislocation. Some of it is truly beautiful. Some of it is very funny. Enjoy.\n\nTWEETS ON THE PANDEMIC\n\nSome interesting observations both sober and silly.\n\n“CORONAVIRUS CALLED AMERICA’S BLUFF”\n\nAnne Applebaum, staff writer with the Atlantic Monthly and former member of the Washington Post editorial board, argues that America is in for a rude awakening:\n\n“The United States, long accustomed to thinking of itself as the best, most efficient, and most technologically advanced society in the world, is about to be proved an unclothed emperor. When human life is in peril, we are not as good as Singapore, as South Korea, as Germany. And the problem is not that we are behind technologically, as the Japanese were in 1853. The problem is that American bureaucracies, and the antiquated, hidebound, unloved federal government of which they are part, are no longer up to the job of coping with the kinds of challenges that face us in the 21st century. Global pandemics, cyberwarfare, information warfare—these are threats that require highly motivated, highly educated bureaucrats; a national health-care system that covers the entire population; public schools that train students to think both deeply and flexibly; and much more.”\n\nPLACES IN THE PATH OF THE VIRUS ARE BEATING IT, HERE'S HOW\n\nThe epicenter of the novel-coronavirus pandemic is Hubei Province in central China, with a population of nearly 60 million people.\n\nIn that region, whose capital city is Wuhan, the COVID-19 outbreak has proven catastrophic with 67,790 confirmed infections and 3,075 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Live Dashboard.\n\nOn Friday, Laurie Garrett, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and former senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations tweeted out this graph:\n\nIf you look at the lines, shown here in the larger graphic, you’ll see what is nearly a universal spike in COVID-19 diagnoses after certain countries in the world hit their first confirmed 100 people infected.\n\nSerious upsurges are felt now in Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, France and Germany. The United States trend line is also worrisome.\n\nJust as interesting are two lagging trend lines, whose COVID-19 cases are climbing more gently, with none of the critical overload that has hit China and Italy.\n\nThese locales in Southeast Asia and in proximity to Mainland China puts them directly in the path of the rapidly spreading pathogen.\n\nOne is Singapore, an island city-state of about 5.7 million people off southern Malaysia. The other, Hong Kong, a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China, with a population of 7.5 million.\n\nA third locale not shown on the graph, but also trending gently, is Taiwan, an island of 23.5 million people off the coast of Mainland China.\n\nTaken together the three locations have used fast-acting and aggressive measures to successfully control the spread of novel coronavirus.\n\nHow did they do it?\n\nThe answer goes back some 16-18 years to another coronavirus – SARS, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak of 2002-2004 -- that infected 8,000 people and killed 774 globally.\n\nChina and Southeast Asia were particularly hard hit, including Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which experienced among the highest SARS death rates in the world.\n\nThe SARS devastation left a lasting impact on these three population centers not far from China’s mainland and still influences how people live their lives today.\n\n“Take me,” writes Bloomberg Opinion columnist Nisha Gopalan, who lives and works in Hong Kong and did so at the time of the SARS epidemic.\n\n“I still compulsively wash my hands, 17 years after the outbreak. I have friends that have been using toothpicks to press elevator buttons for years. Some use tissues to open the doors of public washrooms, or carry spare masks in their handbags in case they catch the sniffles. This is all evidence of the indelible impact SARS has had on Hong Kong’s psyche. For many of us, advice from health officials on how to minimize the risk of Covid-19 infection has been superfluous.”\n\nMore importantly, governments in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan learned from the 2002-04 SARS contagion to react quickly when they realized a new and deadly coronavirus was on the loose.\n\nHere’s how they kept the spread of the disease low and are managing to outperform the emergency actions of governments in China, western Europe and the United States.\n\nSINGAPORE\n\n* Population: 5.7 million * Infected: 200 * Deaths: 0\n\nSingapore took immediate action to secure its borders and to perform contact tracing – the identification and tracking of infected people and other persons they came in contact with.\n\nIt was among the first countries to end inbound flights from Wuhan and then began putting travelers from affected areas of the world in quarantine, according to a New York Times op-ed by Benjamin J. Cowling, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology, and Wey Wen Lim, a graduate student in infectious disease epidemiology, both at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nHospitals and governments in Singapore created a united front to track the movements of infected people. While health workers surveyed all coronavirus patients about their movements, the state used data from transport companies, hotels and security footage to track whereabouts, according to The Times op-ed authors.\n\nA paper published by Harvard’s Center for Communicable Disease reports:\n\n“Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection.”\n\nHowever, the nation has been heavy-handed imposing quarantine and rules that “may not be directly translatable elsewhere,” reports TIME Magazine.\n\n“Since independence in 1965, it has been ruled by a single party that maintains tight control and is rarely subject to public criticism. Amid the coronavirus outbreak, quarantine and isolation protocols are strictly enforced. A permanent resident who breached quarantine rules lost his status, while a couple was charged in court with providing false information about their travel history.”\n\nInterestingly, Singapore has largely kept its public schools open to avoid large disruptions in people’s lives, according to The Times op-ed. Instead the nation has chosen to screen students and staff regularly.\n\nTo that end, a large social safety net is in place to help families affected by the disease, TIME reports.\n\n“No Singaporean has to fear affording treatment. Testing is free, and the government foots the hospital bills for Singaporean residents who have suspected or confirmed cases, TIME reports. “To make quarantine less onerous, the government offers self-employed people $100 Singapore dollars ($73) per day, while employers are prohibited from detracting quarantine days from staffers’ annual leave.”\n\nHONG KONG\n\nPopulation: 7.5 million * Infected: 140 * Deaths: 4\n\nSimilar to Singapore, Hong Kong very quickly put in place strong travel restrictions and controls to stop the flow of people from infected regions of China, The Times reports. It did close its schools, but perhaps because it would not create the kind of disruption it would cause in other lands. The region enjoys cultural advantages Singapore does not:\n\n“Hong Kong has a social structure that helps cushion some of the burden: Many families with two working parents already rely on domestic helpers or grandparents for child care.”\n\nThe memory of SARS still resonates and is driving reaction to coronavirus today, reports TIME.\n\n“In a city deeply scarred by the SARS outbreak—and still populated with hand sanitizer stations—familiar reflexes, like proper hand hygiene, have snapped back into practice. “People are quite cautious now when they face a major outbreak of an infection,” says David Hui, director of the Stanley Ho Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.”\n\nTAIWAN\n\nPopulation: 23.6 million * Infected: 53 * Deaths: 1\n\nAfter SARS, Taiwan decided not to be taken by surprise again and created a central command center of epidemics, TIME reports.\n\nWhile other countries worldwide were still building the scaffolding to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan was out of the blocks with action items, policies, communications and health-care plans at the ready.\n\nIt used high tech and big data to track patients, identify hot zones and pinpoint supplies, reports ABC News.\n\n“In a single day, Taiwan's government was able to combine data from the National Health Insurance Administration and Immigration Agency to identify patients' 14-day travel history. In addition, with data from citizens' household registration systems and foreigners' entry cards, individuals at high risk were identified, self-quarantined and monitored through their cellphones.\n\nWhile big events were generally cancelled, the schools closed for two weeks but opened again on Feb. 25, The Times authors noted.\n\nAuthorities created a toll-free national hotline for people to report suspicious symptoms in themselves and others and provided support for families dealing with infection, reports the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\n“…as the disease progressed, this hotline has reached full capacity, so each major city was asked to create its own hotline as an alternative. It is not known how often this hotline has been used. The government addressed the issue of disease stigma and compassion for those affected by providing food, frequent health checks, and encouragement for those under quarantine.”\n\n* * *\n\nThree population centers at high-risk in this pandemic are proving the upward trend lines of the novel coronavirus are not a given - that smart, aggressive human intervention can save lives and spare national health systems the devastation of this global emergency.\n\nITALIANS ARE AT VIRUS OVERLOAD AND THEY'RE TALKING TO US\n\nIn Europe, Italy is enduring the largest outbreak of COVID-19, with 15,113 people infected and 1,016 deaths.\n\nTwo Italian academics, one a doctor, one an engineer, have published their observations of the enormous strain the new coronavirus is putting on the health-care system in northern Italy.\n\nEven as Italy has put in place strong measures to cut off social contact among its population, the infection trend lines continue moving upwards so sharply they are on the verge of overwhelming the health-care system, write Giuseppe Remuzzi, chairman of the Department of Transplantation at Bergamo Hospital in Bergamo, Italy, and Andrea Remuzzi, professor in the School of Engineering, University of Bergamo.\n\n“If the change in the slope of the curve does not take place soon, the clinical and social problems will take on unmanageable dimensions, which are expected to have catastrophic results,” they write in the British Medical Journal “Lancet”.\n\nThe two report that 9% to 11% of all infected patients in Italy between March 1 and March 11 had to be placed in intensive care units, putting enormous strain on hospitals.\n\nThey predict given current trends Italy will need an extra 2,500 ICU beds in a week to treat the most serious coronavirus patients. You can sense their frustration with Italian bureaucrats who still haven’t figured out the gravity of the situation inside the hospitals:\n\n“In the meantime, the government is preparing to pass legislation that will enable the health service to hire 20,000 more doctors and nurses and to provide 5,000 more ventilators to Italian hospitals. These measures are a step in the right direction, but our model tells us that they need to be implemented urgently, in a matter of days. Otherwise, a substantial number of unnecessary deaths will become inevitable. Intensive care specialists are already considering denying life-saving care to the sickest and giving priority to those patients most likely to survive when deciding who to provide ventilation to. This attitude has already been criticized by the current President of the Italian Comitato di Bioetica (Bioethics Committee) who, in a recent declaration to lay press stated that the Constitution recognizes the right of every individual to receive all necessary health care. They might not recognize that the reality is that intensive care wards are overflowing with patients and that COVID-19 is not a benign disease. Our doctors and nurses are modern heroes in an unexpected war against a difficult enemy. In the near future, they will have no choice. They will have to follow the same rules that health-care workers are left with in conflict and disaster zones.”\n\nToday, The New York Times is reporting that epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and universities around the world began building scenarios on how the coronavirus outbreak might affect the United States:\n\n“Between 160 million and 214 million people in the U.S. could be infected over the course of the epidemic, according to one projection. That could last months or even over a year, with infections concentrated in shorter periods, staggered across time in different communities, experts said. As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die. \"And, the calculations based on the C.D.C.’s scenarios suggested, 2.4 million to 21 million people in the U.S. could require hospitalization, potentially crushing the nation’s medical system, which has only about 925,000 staffed hospital beds. Fewer than a tenth of those are for people who are critically ill.”\n\nThose projections would be altered by the actions of states, businesses and individuals to employ social distancing and other measures to slow the spread of the virus, The Times reports.\n\nFACING A PANDEMIC: 'THERE ARE NO EASY OPTIONS'\n\nWednesday was a watershed moment in the United States as a torrent of news on the new coronavirus shook the American people from their slumber and the fantasy that this is just another flu bug.\n\nThese were the stunning news items in a single day:\n\nGerman Chancellor says up to 70% of Germans could get infected.\n\nWorld Health Organization declares a pandemic.\n\nNBA game is shut down, fans sent home.\n\nNBA season indefinitely suspended.\n\nNBA player infected with COVID-19.\n\nActor Tom Hanks and wife announce they are infected.\n\nTrump suspends travel from Europe.\n\nOn Wednesday, coronavirus finally got America's attention.\n\nToday, the prevailing strategy in the western world is to flatten the coronavirus curve, to put in place social distancing (reduce public interaction) and stop the rapid spread of disease. The goal is to make COVID-19 run its course more gradually so it does not overwhelm hospitals and health-care systems.\n\nProfessor Neil Ferguson, an expert on infectious disease and vice-dean of academic development at Imperial College London, talked about the limits of the containment strategy, now in place in China, and the mitigation strategy. The United States is doing a mix of both.\n\nAs you will see, there are enormous, “dislocating” consequences to both and “no easy options.” Listen in particular to how long he believes the containment strategy, now in place in China and recommended by the World Health Organization, would have to remain in place.\n\nThe relevant portion of this video begins at 01:30. Transcript below.\n\nTranscript (01:30 on)\n\n“I think kind of fundamental decisions have to be made by countries as to whether they’re going to follow what WHO (World Health Organization) is recommending and what the Chinese did, namely to attempt to suppress all transmissions or alternatively try to mitigate, sometimes control an epidemic, but short of completely stopping its spread. “It’s an important distinction because in the former case effectively that’s the strategy, in theory if it works, could largely prevent deaths from this infection, but would really have to be kept in place for 12-18 months until we have a vaccine available at scale. That has enormous feasibility issues and can you actually have any society really maintain those sort of controls for that long? It clearly has huge economic and social issues associated with it. “I mean the alternative is in some sense no easier, the idea of kind of mitigating an epidemic which is though fundamentally allowed to run its course until basically it stops because it runs out of people and develops herd immunity – not everybody in the population get infected. We estimate the best you can do is that half the population though get infected. We’re still talking about an enormous epidemic in each country, and even if we do our best to protect those most vulnerable, the elderly, people with pre-existing health conditions, it still could potentially have a very high health burden, both in terms of deaths and in terms of demands on hospitals and health-care systems. So there are no easy options here. In the next few months you’re going to see, almost regardless of these particular strategies adopted, we’ll see many countries in the world, if not all countries in the world, see kind of major, dislocating social changes, just as a result of the interventions that need to be put in place.”\n\nWHAT'S IT FEEL LIKE TO GET COVID-19?\n\nPatients are experiencing a range of reaction to Coronavirus. From mild illness to extreme illness and death.\n\nHere's how one young man describes the experience:\n\nIt began like a cold, then I felt better and then it got a lot worse ...\n\nCan Coronavirus heal America's political divide?\n\nSomething extraordinary happened on Monday. Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of the State of California, leader of the land that calls itself “The Resistance” to the Republican White House in Washington, D.C., had many nice things to say about Donald Trump.\n\nYou have to watch the video to understand the depth of Newsom’s words, but they are genuine and heartfelt.\n\nThe federal government had been working with California to repatriate passengers from the coronavirus-infected Grand Princess cruise ship. And now media were teeing up questions for Newsom to drive Trump into the stratosphere.\n\nInstead, Newsom left his driver in his golf bag and described his discussion with the president thus:\n\n“We had a private conversation, but he said, 'We're gonna do the right thing' and 'You have my support, all of our support, logistically and otherwise.’ … He said everything I could have hoped for. And we had a very long conversation and every single thing he said, they followed through on.\"\n\nIt seems improbable that the new coronavirus could bring Democrats and Republicans together, especially in a presidential election year, and especially after the White House is widely believed to have squandered precious days and weeks when it might have produced and widely distributed reliable test kits.\n\nBut America is awakening to a kind of slow-moving earthquake, that judging from China, South Korea and Italy, will soon escalate to a rapidly moving calamity that will require all of our wiles and cooperation to manage.\n\nIn Italy, where coronavirus has infected 10,149 and killed 631 people, a nation divided politically and culturally between north and south is rallying around a fragile coalition government to get it through what can now be called a disaster.\n\nNorthern Italy is desperately trying to provide care to rising numbers of infected patients and dying elderly. Doctors in Italy are warning other nations, including our own, to resist complacency and reject soothing notions that this is no worse than the flu.\n\nAnd what is truly extraordinary is that the tables have turned on a country in which the north for decades has sneered at the south for its so-called dirty ways – an attitude exacerbated by a cholera epidemic in 1973 that plagued southern Italy, reports The Times of London.\n\n“The snobbery was best expressed in 2009 by the politician Matteo Salvini when he was filmed joining fellow northerners in a song accusing Neapolitans of being ‘cholera sufferers’ who never washed with soap. “‘Smell that stink, even the dogs are fleeing, the Neapolitans are arriving,’ sang the group gathered around Mr Salvini, who was an advocate of secession for Italy’s wealthy north at the time, before he became a latter-day patriot when he took over the anti-migrant League party, which is now in opposition.”\n\nMr. Salvini, who has become more popular, is decidedly taking a back seat to the more boring leaders of the coalition government. A survey of his countrymen last week showed that 58% want opposition parties to rally around the government, The Times reported, while only 12% backed Salvini’s proposal to form a new national unity government.\n\nIn Italy, the stirring of national fellowship expressed itself when tourists from northern Italy were found to be infected while visiting Sicily in the south. They were treated “wonderfully well” in a southern hospital, The Times reported.\n\nDiscussions have begun about transferring patients with conventional ailments from hospital beds in the north to beds in the south to clear more beds for coronavirus patients in desperate northern hospitals.\n\nMeanwhile the nation’s physicians, the virus experts that the Italian newspaper La Stampa has dubbed “The Magnificent Eight,” have become Italy’s new superheroes as they keep their country informed on the coronavirus.\n\nAs Newsom demonstrated on Monday, we’re in a moment when we need to try to put aside simmering animosities, and start working together to help all of our fellow Americans. That attitude needs to begin on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nWHY CORONAVIRUS IS NOT THE 1918 SPANISH FLU\n\nTake a moment and appreciate how much better off we are than our ancestors who in 1918 had to manage a much more deadly pandemic without the wonders of advanced medicine.\n\nThe New York Times has noted that many comparisons have been made to the Spanish Flu of 1918 and the Coronavirus of 2019-20. But the differences are profound.\n\nBack then …\n\n“Doctors knew viruses existed but had never seen one — there were no electron microscopes, and the genetic material of viruses had not yet been discovered. Today, however, researchers not only know how to isolate a virus but can find its genetic sequence, test antiviral drugs and develop a vaccine. “In 1918, it was impossible to test people with mild symptoms so they could self-quarantine. And it was nearly impossible to do contact tracing because the flu seemed to infect — and panic — entire cities and communities all at once. Moreover, there was little protective equipment for health care workers, and the supportive care with respirators that can be provided to people very ill with coronavirus did not exist.”\n\nThe Times points to the recent data from South Korea, which is enduring one of the worst Coronavirus epidemics and is doing the most aggressive testing of any country.\n\nAwash in new data, South Korea reports a fatality rate of .65%. The Spanish Flu had a fatality rate of at least 2.5% and killed 50 million people (the equivalent of 200 million today).\n\nBut if modern medicine is our armor, modern connectivity is our challenge.\n\nDrawing on the same numbers from South Korea, British historian Niall Ferguson in The Wall Street Journal compares the new coronavirus to the more recent H1N1, also known as swine flu, that killed 12,469 people in 2009. Its fatality rate was 0.02%.\n\nIf as many Americans catch COVID-19 as caught swine flu, the death toll could exceed 440,000, writes Ferguson. He further cautions:\n\n“Standard epidemiological models tend to understate the threat posed by a virus such as 2019-nCoV, because they don’t take account of the topology of the social networks that transmit it. ... we now understand the extraordinary power of modern transportation networks combined with the social-network hubs known as “superspreaders.” “Network effects are the reason it is anything but dumb to worry about the novel coronavirus. Not only is it spreading much faster than most Americans realize; it is also disrupting global manufacturing supply chains as well as all the economic activities that depend on travel and proximity. It could set off a cascade of defaults in the corporate bond market, disrupting the global financial network. “… That aspect of the panic is indeed dumb. But that doesn’t make it smart to underestimate the scale of the Covid-19 pandemic — a perfect illustration of the vulnerability and fragility of our networked world.”\n\nIRISH PHYSICIAN TO HER GOVERNMENT: DON'T SQUANDER THIS MOMENT\n\nDr. Carmen Regan, a senior lecturer in Obstetrics and Gynecology with a clinical base in Coombe Women’s Hospital, Dublin, has been warning the Irish government to stop flights from Italy, where Coronavirus has infected large swaths of the population.\n\nIn an open letter to the government, she begins:\n\n“I write as a consultant specialist in maternal medicine with 30 years of experience in caring for high-risk pregnant mothers. I have never written to the media nor made public comment on matters of policy in relation to healthcare. I do so now out of grave concern.”\n\nShe goes on to say…\n\n“We are only at the beginning of this journey. I, for one, do not want to look back with regret at what I should have done on behalf of our people in the early stages of this epidemic.”\n\nShe's a compelling voice. Listen to her interviewed here:\n\nTHE GLOBAL FORCES THAT SHAPE OUR POLARIZED NATION\n\nI went on KJZZ to discuss “WhiteShift,” a book by University of London political scientist Eric Kaufmann. He connects the dots on Brexit and Donald Trump, framing the big picture on today’s right-wing populism and polarized politics. You can hear my discussion with KJZZ’s Mark Brodie here.\n\nWe invited Kaufmann to write for The Arizona Republic’s Sunday Viewpoint section. He tailored his piece to Arizona.\n\nHis book describes the worldwide influences that have created political upheaval in western societies. I find his thesis optimistic, that in time the immigration wars will settle down and we'll have a multi-ethnic society that generally embraces a national identity and that gets a long. Eventually all Americans will be multi-ethnic and multi-racial.\n\nDEMOCRATS HAVE A BIG PROBLEM: THEIR BORDER POLICY IS LOCO\n\nYou didn’t expect this discussion to start in The New York Times, but here it is:\n\nThe American left is headed for the jagged rocks of 2020 electoral defeat if it doesn’t soon find its bearings on border issues. If not, it may lose the White House because of immigration radicalism.\n\nIn a long essay headlined “The Open Borders Trap,” Times senior writer Jason DeParle reminds readers that in 2008 the Democratic Party platform argued, “We cannot continue to allow people to enter the United States undetected, undocumented and unchecked. We need to secure our borders.”\n\nThat now “sounds like an artifact of a long-ago age,” writes DeParle, because the “progressive vanguard” since then has been proposing a series of extreme policies that would move aside long-standing laws and policies and open wide the border.\n\nDeParle catalogues the promises 2020 Democrats have made to immigration rights groups. Taken together they’re breathtaking:\n\nDecriminalize border crossing.\n\nBan deportations.\n\nEnd detention.\n\nAbolish ICE - Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\n\nProvide undocumented immigrants universal health insurance.\n\nProvide free college.\n\nExpand school meals.\n\nExpand other safety net programs.\n\nAdds DeParle:\n\n“Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, the progressive standard-bearer, likens detention facilities to “concentration camps.” Eight advocacy groups have released an immigration plan they call “Free to Move, Free to Stay,” a slogan that suggests no limits. “… what’s notable about the progressives’ stance isn’t just the retreat on enforcement. It’s also the lack of an affirmative case for immigration — an argument for how it strengthens the economy, invigorates the culture and deepens ties to the world.\"\n\nDeParle believes the left has abandoned these significant arguments for why immigration is important to the country: “It has powered the rise of Silicon Valley, brought entrepreneurs to the inner city and staffed hospitals in the reddest and bluest of states.”\n\n“Yet some on the left say economic arguments commodify immigrants or denigrate the native work force.\"\n\nThe looms of progressive activism are weaving an immigration policy that cannot be sustained, given the economic imbalance between North and Latin America. It is creating a moral dilemma, writes DeParle:\n\n“There are more potential migrants than the country can accept. To the extent that they’re fleeing poverty and violence, it’s unfair to keep them out. But with nearly two billion people living on less than $3.20 a day, it’s impossible to let them all in. Hence the need to set limits and enforce them humanely.”\n\nMany on the left believe Trump’s cruel border policies are turning votes against him, particularly his mistreatment and separation of migrant children, argues DeParle.\n\n“But the more immigration becomes part of the culture wars, the more its supporters have to lose. Immigration propelled Britain from the European Union and left Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany a lame duck. Immigration’s value can’t be assumed. It has to be defended.”\n\nEnergized by DeParle’s essay, political scientist and Democratic strategist Ruy Teixeira writes on his blog:\n\n“I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Once it comes time to face Donald Trump in the general election, Democrats will need much clearer and more salable positions on immigration than the ones Democratic candidates drifted into in the primary season. Otherwise, Trump will do real damage to the Democratic nominee on the issue.\"\n\nTeixeira, made famous by his 2002 book “The Emerging Democratic Majority,” derides the immigration-rights activists that DeParle quotes in his essay for taking “one nutty position after another on various immigration issues. You read through them and just shake your head: what planet are these people living on?\"\n\n“The Democratic nominee in 2020 needs to decisively reject the open borders talk and utter lack of realism on border security and what a workable immigration system might look like that appears to dominate these advocates’ thinking. Otherwise Trump will have a field day and immigrants will be worse off, not better off.”\n\nTHE VIEW ON MARS\n\nThe latest images from the Curiosity Mars Rover sure look familiar. I half expect to see a saguaro.\n\n'ELECTION NIGHT 2016' WITH THE PROGRESSIVES\n\nIt's an American conceit that every generation believes its cast of \"Saturday Night Live\" is the best of all time. I'm a child of the Seventies so, of course, I stand by John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray. I've never seen anything Will Ferrell did that I found funny.\n\nYeah, I'm a Boomer.\n\nBut I have to admit this bit from SNL's more recent past is pretty darned great.\n\nWHAT WOULD A CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK LOOK LIKE IN ARIZONA? WASHINGTON STATE TELLS US\n\nThe Coronavirus got a beachhead in the United States in the state of Washington, scene of the first large U.S. outbreak of COVID-19. As of Friday, there have been 79 confirmed people infected in four Washington counties and 15 deaths, according to the Washington State Department of Health.\n\nThe World Health Organization hasn't yet labeled the Coronavirus a pandemic, but many epidemiologists are convinced it is and are calling it that.\n\nIf COVID-19 behaves in the Pacific Northwest the way it has in other parts of the world, the infections will radiate outward. We can’t know what will happen in Arizona, but we have to prepare for the possibility that such an outbreak could occur here.\n\nHere’s the picture in Washington State:\n\nHEALTH SYSTEM STRESSED\n\nThe Seattle Times reports, “Less than a week after diagnosed cases of COVID-19 grew rapidly in the Seattle area, health care providers say medical supplies are growing scarce, threatening to further stress a system already scrambling to control the coronavirus outbreak.”\n\nValley Medical Center in metro-Seattle put out an email telling its health workers:\n\n“Limit mask use to on the patient only. …Staff will no longer wear masks, unless providing a care procedure requiring removal of the patient’s mask. …Masks are in critical supply (and) “due to disaster conditions VMC will be implementing alternate standards of care to conserve masks for critical and surgical use.”\n\nHealth-care authorities fear emergency rooms, clinics and community health centers could be overrun with requests for testing. They’re telling everyone to call ahead if they suspect they have COVID-19, the Times reports.\n\nFEAR IN HOSPITALS\n\nHealth care workers are beginning to worry about their own health as more and more patients are admitted with the disease. Olga Ramirez, a nurse at Seattle’s Harborview Medical Center, told The Times she is worried about ending up in a hospital bed. “I’m human, too — it does make me nervous. I have underlying health care issues. I have asthma, I have diabetes and some heart problems. So, I’m concerned that going to work is going to somehow affect me medically, physically, mentally.”\n\nLOST CONVENTIONS\n\nOrganizers have canceled three major events at the Washington State Convention Center, including the Emerald City Comic Con, reports The Times.\n\n“The cancellations and postponement represent a significant economic loss for the downtown hospitality sector, which has already been hit by a wave of cancellations since the deaths last week of Seattle-area residents from the coronavirus outbreak, the first in the U.S.”\n\nVULNERABLE POPULATIONS STAY HOME\n\nPeople older than 60 and pregnant women are being urged to stay at home and avoid contact in public, reports the Everett, Wash. Herald.\n\nPUBLIC SCHOOLS\n\nK-12 officials are weighing whether to close the public schools in affected counties. Some 13,000 people have signed petitions demanding the schools be closed, The Herald reports.\n\nUNIVERSITIES\n\nA number of the universities are now operating remotely, providing online classes while cancelling on-campus classes and events, including commencement.\n\nTECH EMPLOYEES WORK FROM HOME\n\nAbout 10,000 people employed at Amazon’s buildings in Seattle and Bellevue are now working from home. The buildings are almost entirely empty, The Times, reports.\n\nLEGAL FIGHT OVER QUARANTINE\n\nThe City of Kent, Wash. called a press conference and filed a restraining order to stop King County from using a vacant motel in its community to begin quarantining people exposed to the virus. The courts eventually denied the City of Kent’s petition, reports The Times. The county is using the motel to quarantine 10 potentially infected Kirkland Firefighters who had answered the call to a nursing home where the infection was present.\n\nCITY COUNCIL GOES REMOTE\n\nThe Seattle City Council is planning to conduct its regular City Council meetings remotely and has cancelled all committee meetings until further notice, The Times reports.\n\nMAJOR LEAGUE HOME OPENER COULD MOVE\n\nThis may concern Arizona. The sports pages of the Seattle Times are reporting that the Seattle Mariners still intend to play their home opener March 26 against the Texas Rangers at T-Mobile Park. But Times sports writer Ryan Divish reports that contingency planning is underway.\n\n“What could the Mariners do if Seattle is deemed an unsafe location to open the season? Sources indicate a variety of contingencies have been discussed on the periphery but nothing concrete. There could be games without fans in attendance. The Mariners and Rangers could remain in Arizona and play those games in the area at a spring-training facility. “The Arizona Diamondbacks also open the season at home. So Chase Field in Phoenix will be used. But if the need for an MLB field is demanded, the Mariners and Rangers could play day games there.”\n\nOUR BEST POLITICAL HUMORIST SINCE MORRIS UDALL\n\nYears ago, I was telling our then national-political reporter Dan Nowicki that the best writer on Twitter is a guy named @exjon. Funny and really smart.\n\nDan said to me, “He’s local. He’s Phoenix. He’s Goldwater (Institute).”\n\n“No way!” I said.\n\nNot long after, one of our then Opinions editors, Carrie Watters, had the great good sense to recruit him as a guest columnist for The Arizona Republic Opinions pages.\n\nJon Gabriel is the best political humorist in Arizona and every bit on par with the late, great Morris Udall. Their styles are similar. Usually easy-going. Always fall-down funny.\n\n@exjon is so skilled at wielding 140 characters he has a national following on Twitter. He’s been retweeted by the president of the United States, and, as you’ll see in this response to U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar today, he’s apt to go viral:\n\nSign up to his Twitter feed here.\n\nAs for the legendary Arizona congressman Morris Udall, here's a sample of his humor over the years:\n\n“Let's turn inflation over to the post office. That'll slow it down.”\n\n“Presidential ambition is a disease which can only be cured by embalming fluid.”\n\n“I have learned the difference between a cactus and a caucus. On a cactus, the pricks are on the outside.”\n\n“If you are a United States senator and are not under indictment or in detoxification, you automatically consider yourself as a potential candidate for the presidency.”\n\nBERNIE WORLD IS ALREADY HERE AND IT’S A DISASTER\n\nWonder what the country would look like if Bernie Sanders ever got the levers of power to construct his socialist paradise?\n\nWonder no more, writes National Review columnist Christopher F. Rufo. The socialists have taken over one of the great cities of the Pacific Northwest and have begun their reordering of society.\n\n“Seattle has effectively become the nation’s laboratory for socialist policies,” writes Rufo.\n\n“Since the beginning of the year, the socialist faction on the Seattle City Council has proposed a range of policies on taxes, housing, homelessness, and criminal justice that put into practice the national democratic-socialist agenda. \"In the most recent session, socialist councilwoman Kshama Sawant and her allies have proposed massive new taxes on corporations, unprecedented regulations on landlords (including rent control and a ban on “winter evictions”), the mandated construction of homeless encampments, and the gradual dismantling of the criminal justice system, beginning with the end of cash bail.”\n\nThe progressive bloc of the City Council is already consolidating authority, reports Rufo, with bans on corporate spending in local elections and with $100 taxpayer-funded “Democracy Vouchers” that Seattle residents can use to support their local candidates. The vouchers “are easily collected by unions, activists, and socialist groups.\"\n\nLooming in the background are “black-bloc activists and Antifa militants” who “intimidate any potential opposition by disrupting events, vandalizing homes, and even orchestrating death threats against political adversaries.”\n\nAmerican business needs to wake up, stop appeasing political ex and start understanding that socialism will need to be opposed on many fronts, he argues.\n\nCORONAVIRUS YANKS THE SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nOn Feb. 28, the Harvard Business Review forecast that in mid-March the impact of the COVID-19 virus would be felt on global supply chains, “forcing thousands of companies to throttle down or temporarily shut assembly and manufacturing plants in the U.S. and Europe.”\n\n“The most vulnerable companies are those which rely heavily or solely on factories in China for parts and materials. The activity of Chinese manufacturing plants has fallen in the past month and is expected to remain depressed for months.”\n\nOn Thursday, The Daily Breeze in Torrance, Calif. reported the supply chain at nearby Southern California ports has already been seriously yanked.\n\n“Jobs on the docks are drying up, leaving many workers without steady work, as empty cargo containers stack up at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, officials said this week. “It’s all a casualty of an ongoing drop in ship calls from Asia as the coronavirus continues spreading. Factories in China have remained closed or operated at below-capacity levels for weeks now as the virus has taken its toll. About half of the cargo coming into the ports comes from China.\n\nThe ports together have seen a more than 50% job loss over 2019, said Ray Familathe, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union, reports The Daily Breeze. “It’s a tremendous loss of cargo.”\n\nPort of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka disputed those numbers.\n\n“It is substantial, but we have not eliminated half the jobs at the port,” he said, referring to the union’s 50% figure.\n\nForty-one ships have canceled cargo deliveries scheduled between mid-February and early April, Seroka said.\n\nWILL ARIZONA’S SUMMER HEAT KNOCK DOWN COVID-19?\n\nPeople in warm-weather climes in the United States and around the world are asking if their hot weather can be the firewall to the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nArizonans are asking the same.\n\nWe all dread our Arizona summers and the triple-digit heat. Will this be the first time we actually appreciate it?\n\nThe answer at the moment is unclear.\n\n“Unfortunately, no one knows for sure — and even experts can't seem to agree on whether or not warmer weather will slow down the coronavirus,” reports Health.com.\n\nBut if COVID-19 behaves like normal viruses it will be vulnerable to heat.\n\nInfluenza and cold infections trend sharply downward during summer months, reports TIME magazine. “Warmer temperatures lead to more rapid virus degradation,” says Elizabeth McGraw, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nWe don’t have enough information to know if high temperature will knock down COVID-19, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, as reported by The Dallas Morning News.\n\nHowever, we do know that its opposite – cold weather – weakens the immune system.\n\nDr. Susan Mathai, a pulmonologist at Baylor Scott & White Health, told The Morning News that cooler weather has the following effects on the human body:\n\n\"For one, cellular strands in the respiratory system, called cilia, are less effective during cold weather. Cilia work to keep airways clean. She said that’s important because when people breathe, particles in the air can get caught in their noses. But if the strands are less effective, more particles get caught, including germs. \"The body’s immune system also doesn’t function as well in cold weather. Drier air, which can come with cooler temperatures, can increase the viscosity of the normal mucus your body needs, making it less efficient in fighting off disease by building up in the sinuses. “‘We think of mucus as a bad thing, but it’s actually super important in keeping our bodies healthy,’ Mathai said.\"\n\nOf course, Arizona summers are extremely dry when we're not in monsoon. Would that be a detriment? Again, too early to know.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, apparently with little scientific evidence, said COVID-19 will die in warmer summer temperatures. “The heat generally speaking kills this kind of virus.”\n\nSpeculation of this sort is actually detrimental at this point, said.Thomas Bollyky, director of the Global Health Program at the Washington D.C.-based Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n“Policymakers and health officials should not rely on warmer temperatures to save us from COVID-19. The only things that can do that are public health preparedness and level-headed policies to reduce the number of people infected, protect health-care workers, and improve the diagnosis and treatment of those who do get ill.”\n\nThat hasn’t stopped government leaders and other stakeholders around the world from asserting their hot weather has made a difference.\n\nINDONESIA\n\nIndonesia officials credit their lack of COVID-19 outbreak to their warm climate, TIME reports. But Health officials there are more guarded.\n\nThat’s unknowable until we better understand the characteristics of COVID-19, Vivi Setiawaty, head of a biomedical research center at Indonesia’s Health Research and Development Agency, told the Jakarta Post.\n\n\"She said that although viruses would be inactivated at temperatures between 50 and 70 degrees Celsius (122 and 158 degrees Fahrenheit) and that more cases were confirmed in countries with cooler weather, there had also been confirmed cases in tropical countries with similar weather to Indonesia. The Philippines, for instance, had recorded the first death from the novel coronavirus outside of China.\"\n\nAFRICA\n\n“Some observers have pointed to the fact that Africa has relatively few cases of Covid-19 and that this may be a response to hotter conditions there,” reports The (London) Guardian. “The virus cannot take the heat, in other words.”\n\n“The disease has only just arrived in Africa and it is far too early to tell how it will behave there,” Mark Woolhouse, a professor at Edinburgh University told The Guardian. “We will just have to wait and see.”\n\nHe further added,\n\n“I would not be surprised if we now have a virus that we will have to deal with forever. However, in such cases the first major outbreak is always the worst one. After that it should settle down and become part of a regular repertoire of winter viruses, I would imagine.”\n\nINDIA\n\nOne of that nation’s health-care officials is highly optimistic, perhaps too optimistic, that India’s climate will stop the pathogen.\n\nK.K. Aggarwal, president of Heart Care Foundation of India, told the Economic Times that India is largely safe because its weather acts as a defense.\n\n“Aggarwal, also a former president of the Indian Medical Association, traces the origin and spread of the epidemic thus: Viruses prefer lower temperatures, which is why they have spread speedily in cooler and less humid areas like Japan and South Korea. In India's case, an outright outbreak seems unlikely because of the heat and humidity, he says.”\n\nOther international experts reject that kind of thinking.\n\nThe National Geographic reports:\n\n“Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch doesn’t think any weather changes will put a big dent in how the virus spreads. COVID-19 has now been documented around the world. If the virus is anything like a typical flu virus, it may worsen in Southern Hemisphere regions as the seasons change. “David Heymann from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says not enough is known about this new virus to predict how it will change with different weather conditions. “‘The risk of making predictions without an evidence base is that they could, if they prove to be wrong, be taken as verity and give a false security,’ Heymann says via email. ‘The emphasis today should continue to be on containment to elimination where possible,’ he cautions.”\n\nATTACKING THE CORONAVIRUS - TEXAS STYLE\n\nLESSONS FROM A PANDEMIC A CENTURY AGO\n\nST. LOUIS VS. PHILADELPHIA – LEARNING FROM THE 1918 FLU\n\nAs we prepare for the larger outbreak of Coronavirus, there are lessons to be learned from the Spanish Flu of 1918 that killed some 50 million people worldwide, writes Claire Lehmann, British journalist and founding editor of the libertarian online magazine Quillette.\n\n“In early October 1918, when the Spanish flu hit the east coast of the United States, the health commissioner of St Louis, Max Starkloff, ordered the closure of schools, movie theaters, saloons, sporting events and other public gathering spots. While the measures were protested by some citizens, the quarantine went ahead. A month later, as the pandemic raged on, he ordered the closure of all business, with a few exceptions, such as banks. “While drastic quarantine measures were being implemented in St Louis, the health commissioner of Philadelphia, Wilmer Krusen, gave permission for a parade for the war effort to go ahead in his city. It is reported that within 72 hours of the parade, every bed in Philadelphia’s 31 hospitals was filled, and in the week ending October 5th, 1918, 2,600 people in Philadelphia had died, with the figure almost doubling a week later. At the end of the outbreak, St Louis had the lowest recorded death rate in the U.S., while in Philadelphia mortuaries overflowed and “bodies [were] piled up on sidewalks.”\n\nQUOTE: \"PANIC IS WHEN...\"\n\n“These bureaucrats and politicians who think panic is lines at Costco and angry parents when a school is closed, may find out that panic is when you are taking mom to the emergency room and she dies in the parking lot because no one can see her. I hope this does not happen and we get lucky, but all signs point the other direction.”\n\n- Robert Nelson, biomedicine expert and managing director and co-founder of ARCH Venture Partners, a biotech venture-capital firm, to Quillette\n\nHOW ONE NATION PREPARES FOR CORONAVIRUS\n\nFive interesting factoids from today's Times of London:\n\n1. “With six million — one in five UK employees — likely to be sick during the worst of the outbreak, ministers are looking at changing sick pay rules that unions say risk public health by encouraging employees to work while unwell.”\n\n2. “Hospitals have been told to see as many patients as they can via video calls because their beds will be needed to treat coronavirus sufferers.”\n\n3. “The sickest patients could have treatment withdrawn to prioritize those with a higher chance of survival.”\n\n4. “The virus ‘could occur in multiple waves,’ potentially causing a second severe outbreak in the future.”\n\n5. “Perhaps more likely, the virus will become like seasonal flu and return every winter.”\n\nBARBRA STREISAND GOES SCORCHED EARTH, AGAIN\n\nBarbra Streisand is coming unglued as she imagines the horror that will descend on America if it elects a Republican for president.\n\nThe GOP hopeful is Donald Trump, so many will sympathize. But Streisand has gone scorched earth on every GOP nominee of the last two decades.\n\nOne of them, John McCain, got his revenge.\n\nDONALD TRUMP – “IT CAN’T BE WORSE” (2020)\n\n“Every morning I wake up, holding my breath while I turn on my phone to see the latest news. I think to myself, “It can’t be worse than yesterday.” But when the news loads, I think, “Ohhhhh, yes, it is worse.”\n\n- Barbra Streisand (Variety)\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH - “SUCH A DESTRUCTIVE MAN” (2001)\n\n\"Look at his ratings - how could such a destructive man be so popular with the American people? Not only is he poisoning our air and water by withdrawing his promise to enforce emissions standards and arsenic regulations, but he's poisoning our political system as well.”\n\n- Barbra Streisand (The Guardian)\n\nMITT ROMNEY - “AS EXTREME AS IT GETS” (2012)\n\n“Gov.

You can see the merits in this. O’Rourke has the look of RFK and electrifies young people the way Bobby once did. He's also a beacon to Latino voters who adore him.\n\nBut bringing Beto on the journey, no doubt to try to win the Texas primary, means you also bring his baggage, and Beto accumulated a lot in his short-lived run for president.\n\nExamples:\n\nGUNS\n\nModerator: \"Are you proposing taking away their guns?

When white racists blew up the porch of his home in Montgomery, Alabama, a number of his lieutenants began gathering weapons to defend him. He told them to put the guns away.\n\nMy former Republic colleague Jennifer Dokes posts many interesting black-history stories on her Facebook page. Those have led to reading and discovery.\n\nFor instance, I didn’t know that six years after Martin Luther King, Jr.’s assassination that his mother was murdered by a gunman:\n\nIn 1974, as she played the organ during Sunday services at Ebenezer (Baptist church), Alberta Williams King was shot by Marcus Chenault, a 21-year-old man from Ohio who claimed, “All Christians are my enemies.\" Alberta Williams King died later that day at the age of 70.\n\nThat led to this Medium article about how Martin Luther King, Sr., MLK’s father, was held hostage with other Morehouse College trustees by a group of college-student activists. Among them was a guy named Samuel L. Jackson, yes, that Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nThe future actor was part of a radical Black Power group that was gathering guns for the struggle ahead, reports Parade Magazine.\n\n“In 1969, Jackson and other radical students held members of the Morehouse College board of trustees hostage on campus, demanding reform in the school’s curriculum and governance. The college eventually agreed to change, but Jackson was expelled. He stayed on for the summer in Atlanta, where he got to know Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown and others in the Black Power movement. ‘I was in that radical faction,’ Jackson said. ‘We were buying guns, getting ready for armed struggle. “‘All of a sudden,’ he said proudly, ‘I felt I had a voice. I was somebody. I could make a difference. But then one day,’ he added quietly, ‘my mom showed up and put me on a plane to L.A. She said, ‘Do not come back to Atlanta.’ The FBI had been to the house and told her that if I didn’t get out of Atlanta, there was a good possibility I’d be dead within a year. She freaked out.’”\n\nHis life changed dramatically (so to speak).\n\nHe talks briefly about the hostage taking here (begin at 04:00)\n\nHere is Jackson in the 2005 Parade article explaining how he seethed at the white-dominated, racist culture of his childhood:\n\n“I had anger in me. It came from growing up suppressed in a segregated society. All those childhood years of ‘whites only’ places and kids passing you on the bus, yelling, ‘******!’ There was nothing I could do about it then. I couldn’t even say some of the things that made me angry—it would have gotten me killed. But I had a dream of my own. I was determined to get out and make my family proud.”\n\nThere's another great story that depicts the intersection of guns and Martin Luther King, Jr. that shows his strength of character as a young seminary student. Stephen B. Oates tells it in his marvelous biography \"Let the Trumpet Sound\":\n\n\"...at the seminary, King had another brush with violence when a North Carolina white student came banging on his door one day. The student was well known for his racial views: he couldn’t accept Negroes as his schoolmates and called them “darkies.” Somebody had messed up his room—a prank called a “room raid”—and he blamed King. He was in a tirade, shouting at King, hurling maledictions at him. Then he drew a pistol and threatened to shoot King dead. But King would not be rattled. Looking the maddened student in the eye, he calmly denied having anything to do with the room raid. By now the racket had attracted other students: they yelled at the North Carolinian, made him put his gun down. Afterward they brought the matter before the student government; but to everybody’s surprise King refused to press charges. With students and faculty alike clamoring against him, though, the North Carolinian publicly admitted he was wrong and extended King an apology.\n\nAfter that King became the most popular student at Crozer, widely admired not only for his scholarship, but for his courage and grace as well.”\n\nTHE CORONAVIRUS RUN ON DRUG- AND GROCERY STORES\n\nSOUTH KOREA\n\nGovernment officials in South Korea are warning its citizens to not “hoard” face masks and hand sanitizers as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus — which has caused a sharp rise in demand for such items — continues to spread. Officials with the South Korean Ministry of Economy and Finance on Tuesday approved the stricter penalties, which went into effect on Wednesday and will be enforced until April 30, The Korea Herald reported. Those who are accused of hoarding such products could see up to two years of jail time or a fine of 50 million won, about $42,000.\n\n- FOX News\n\nJAPAN\n\nJapanese officials tried to flush away “rumors” of a coronavirus-fueled toilet paper shortage in the country Friday, according to reports. Residents should quit stockpiling rolls because the country’s supply is strong — despite reports that it has been nearly wiped out, industry ministry officials said, according to the local outlet NKH. Last week, panicked Japanese folks rushed to stores to buy the bathroom staple.\n\n- New York Post\n\nGERMANY\n\nGerman magazine Der Spiegel reported (link in German) on Feb. 28 that the “first signs of (hoarding)” had been seen in Germany, citing discount retailers Aldi and Lidl. Among the items being hoarded are tinned goods and pasta, as well as toilet paper and disinfectants.\n\n- Quartz\n\nIRAN\n\n…The hoarded supplies, including 28 million medical gloves, were found in two warehouses in Kahrizak, a town about 25 km south of Tehran, a Revolutionary Guards commander, Hassan Hassanzadeh, told the Fars news agency. Pharmacies are short of gloves and other supplies. Anyone found hoarding medical supplies will be dealt with harshly, Iran's judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi said on Monday, according to Mizan, the news site of the judiciary.\n\n- VOA News\n\nHAWAII\n\nWorries over coronavirus have people in Hawaii stocking up on supplies. At a Costco store in Honolulu on Thursday, there was a long line of people just trying to buy toilet paper. It took between 10 to 15 minutes just to get into the store's parking lot. Then there was a huge wait just to get into the store, with a line extending out of the door. People across the island are continuing to rush to stores since the health department urged people to prepare an emergency supply kit for coronavirus. Costco was limited toilet paper purchases to five packs per person.\n\n- FOX 5 – New York\n\nMARIE OSMOND'S LIFE IMITATES ART\n\nSo Marie Osmond announces she'll be leaving none of her fortune to her children.

Nonetheless, fear is changing the way people go about their daily lives, writes Beppe Severgnini, editorial writer and editor at “Corriere della Sera” (“Evening Courier”) in Milan. In today’s New York Times, he explains:\n\n“We see more masks on TV and online than on the streets of Milan — half-deserted streets, with many people staying home. Schools and markets are closed, and many events canceled. “...People have stopped shaking hands, let alone greeting each other with a kiss. If you sneeze or cough in public, people jerk away and show genuine alarm. Conversation is monopolized by coronavirus, and in the absence of clear rules, companies and organizations behave randomly.”\n\nCoronavirus will probably not be stopped from gaining a foothold in the United States, reports The Atlantic Online, after talking to leading U.S. epidemiologists.\n\nEfforts to quarantine cities, as the Chinese have done, or to quarantine yourself are probably fruitless. They just delay the misery. The majority of us are going to be exposed, health-care experts tell The Atlantic.\n\nEventually, the magazine reports, Covid-19 is likely to become a seasonal bug.\n\nTIP: A great site for following the real-time global advance of Coronavirus is the Johns Hopkins University Interactive Map.\n\nTHINK OUR SUMMER HEAT WILL BURN OFF CORONAVIRUS? THINK AGAIN\n\nThe Philadelphia Enquirer reports that summer heat isn't likely to slow the spread of Coronavirus as it moves deeper into the United States.\n\nUnlike with the seasonal flu, the change of seasons may not matter much to the coronavirus. ...While it is possible that this virus, like many other respiratory viruses, will not survive as readily in warm temperatures, it will be encountering a “completely susceptible” U.S. population, said Maciej F. Boni, an associate professor of biology at Penn State University. Hardly anyone in this country has been exposed to the new virus, so there’s been no chance to develop immunity. That means the coronavirus has plenty of opportunity to infect people and get passed along, Boni said.\n\n15 HEADLINES THAT TELL YOU YOU’RE LIVING A DISASTER MOVIE\n\n“THE CORONAVIRUS GOES GLOBAL”\n\n- The New York Times\n\n“DOW PLUNGES NEARLY 1,200 POINTS AS CORONAVIRUS FEARS SEND MARKETS DIVING”\n\n- NBC News\n\n“CORONAVIRUS SPREADS IN THREE CONTINENTS: MARKETS BRACE FOR GLOBAL RECESSION”\n\n- Rueters\n\n“THE CORONAVIRUS SEEMS UNSTOPPABLE.

Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan is writing about her fears again. Some 22 years ago, she almost dead-on predicted the Sept. 11 attacks, three years before they happened. Today she is worried about Coronavirus and its eventual impact on the United States:\n\n“Punditry 101: It’s bad when you don’t write about what you’re thinking about. All week I was taking notes knowing I’d be looking at South Carolina, Super Tuesday and this week’s debate. …But my mind kept tugging in another direction. So I’ll write what I’m thinking, and it may be ragged but here goes. “…I’ve got a feeling the coronavirus is going to be bad, that it will have a big impact on America, more than we imagine, and therefore on its politics. …If coronavirus becomes a formally recognized world-wide pandemic, and if it hits America hard, it is going to change a lot—the national mood, our cultural habits, the economy. “…In a public-health crisis the role of government is key. The question will be—the question is—are the president and his administration up to it? Our scientists and health professionals are. …Is Donald Trump? Or has he finally met a problem he can’t talk his way out of? I have written in the past questioning whether he can lead and reassure the nation in a time of crisis. We are about to find out. …It is in crisis that you see the difference between showmanship and leadership.”\n\nHere's why you shouldn't dismiss Noonan's fears: In the summer of 1998, well before the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, she wrote forebodingly about a terror mega-strike on the United States in the Nov. 30, 1998 “Big Issue\" of Forbes maga\n\n“Something's up. And deep down, where the body meets the soul, we are fearful. We fear, down so deep it hasn't even risen to the point of articulation, that with all our comforts and amusements, with all our toys and bells and whistles . . . we wonder if what we really have is . . . a first-class stateroom on the Titanic. Everything's wonderful, but a world is ending and we sense it. “I don't mean: \"Uh-oh, there's a depression coming,\" I mean: We live in a world of three billion men and hundreds of thousands of nuclear bombs, missiles, warheads. It's a world of extraordinary germs that can be harnessed and used to kill whole populations, a world of extraordinary chemicals that can be harnessed and used to do the same. “Three billion men, and it takes only half a dozen bright and evil ones to harness and deploy. What are the odds it will happen? Put it another way: What are the odds it will not? Low. Nonexistent, I think. “When you consider who is gifted and crazed with rage . . . when you think of the terrorist places and the terrorist countries . . . who do they hate most? The Great Satan, the United States. What is its most important place? Some would say Washington. I would say the great city of the United States is the great city of the world, the dense 10-mile-long island called Manhattan, where the economic and media power of the nation resides, the city that is the psychological center of our modernity, our hedonism, our creativity, our hard-shouldered hipness, our unthinking arrogance. “If someone does the big, terrible thing to New York or Washington, there will be a lot of chaos and a lot of lines going down, a lot of damage, and a lot of things won't be working so well anymore.”\n\nOAKLAND'S WARNING FLARE TO PHOENIX\n\nThe timing could not be more striking. The city of Phoenix approved a plan to create a citizen’s commission to watchdog its police department at the very moment the City of Oakland, Calif. was turning sulfuric with the actions of its own independent police commission.\n\nA week ago, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf announced she was firing Oakland Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick, the person she had hired in 2017. She was firing her “without cause” and praising her lavishly on the way out.\n\nWhat?\n\nPressed by Bay Area media to explain, Schaaf said Kirkpatrick had lost the confidence of Oakland’s 7-member independent police commission. The commission is very powerful, she said, made so by the voters of Oakland, and it is incumbent on any police chief of Oakland to maintain the trust of the commission.\n\nThe now terminated chief was stunned. “The mayor praises me but I’m terminated. I don’t understand. …I am saddened. I’m embarrassed. I’m humiliated by it,” she told San Francisco’s ABC 7 News.\n\n“I like my mayor but leaders stand up for their people, they stand up for you when they are serving you well,” Kirkpatrick told The Mercury News. “I came with these mandates to reduce crime and to have these culture shifts, to stabilize this police department. I have more than exceeded those expectations.”\n\nNo doubt playing into the chief’s departure was the 2018 police-involved shooting of a homeless man. Reports the Mercury News:\n\n“Kirkpatrick’s relationship with the commission, which represents Oakland residents and has authority over the chief and police force, has been frosty for months. Police commissioners had called for the firing of five officers involved in the fatal 2018 shooting of Joshua Pawlik, challenging the suspension recommended by Kirkpatrick, Internal Affairs and the department’s Executive Force Review Board.”\n\nOakland Police Commission Chair Regina Jackson explained that the police department had failed “to increase compliance with the court-ordered reforms required under the Negotiated Settlement Agreement.”\n\nThe department has been under federal court oversight since the 2003 settlement of a civil rights lawsuit that accused officers of assaulting suspects and planting evidence.\n\nKirkpatrick said, “Even the federal monitor, who was here with me three weeks ago, says to me in his closing meeting, one-on-one; he said, ‘Anne, you are deep in the red zone. If you are a football fan like I am, it means you’re real close to the goal line.”\n\nAfter the city fired Kirkpatrick, hundreds of Oakland police officers and support staff gathered to say their goodbyes to her and to criticize the mayor and independent commission for removing a leader they respected.\n\nToday the city of Oakland faces the following:\n\nTheir former chief is weighing a lawsuit against the city.\n\nShe has called on the U.S. Justice Department to investigate.\n\nPolice department morale is spiraling downward, and one employee tells ABC 7 News that others in the department are considering leaving with the ex-chief.\n\nKirkpatrick is now revealing in 2018 she feared retaliation from one commission member because she rebuffed her demands to drop the commissioner's towing fees. The then-chief was so concerned she made a record of it with the city’s personnel department, the Mercury News reports.\n\n“In claiming retaliation from the commission over the towing fee dispute, Kirkpatrick and (her crisis manager Sam) Singer pointed to a 2018 internal city document recently made public that states police Commissioner Ginale Harris demanded the department and the chief pay her back for towing fees Harris owed the city. Kirkpatrick notified city officials at the time, and the request was included in an investigation of Harris that had been initiated by City Administrator Sabrina Landreth. At the time, the chief told the lead investigator she was concerned about retaliation, according to the document.”\n\nIn an interview with ABC 7 News the former chief was asked what she would say to anyone contemplating becoming the next Oakland P.D. chief:\n\nA: “Do not come to Oakland because they won’t have a job for long.”\n\nQ. Is it toxic?\n\nA. “Yes.”\n\nPUBLIC REACTS TO END OF ENDORSEMENTS\n\nAs we reported on azcentral this morning, The Arizona Republic will no longer endorse candidates for office. Executive Editor Greg Burton and I explain why here.\n\nHere’s a sample of reaction:\n\nDavid Boyles, ASU instructor\n\n\"As endorsing Republican candidates has become morally and intellectually untenable, Arizona's largest newspaper, which has historically been a mouthpiece for the state's GOP power structure, has decided to punt and no longer endorse candidates at all.

Times\n\n\"Bold move by the Arizona Republic.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS STORIES THAT GOT OUR ATTENTION\n\nPREGNANT WOMEN NEGLECTED\n\nThe New York Times reports that expectant moms in China are being neglected by a health-care system overwhelmed by Covid-19.\n\n“In the city of Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, pregnant women have faced the daunting prospect of figuring out where to give birth. Their community hospitals are closed, the city’s public transport is shut down and no one is allowed to leave because of quarantine rules.”\n\nAs of Wednesday, the toll in China is 80,000 people sickened, 2,600 killed.\n\nCHILDREN SPARED\n\nThe Times of London reports that Coronavirus is behaving differently than other bugs. Deaths do not follow the classic U-shaped curve in which the young and old face the highest mortality rates.\n\n“With coronavirus the death rate is not u-shaped. Yes, it rises sharply among the old but among those under 40 it is 0.2 per cent. Among those under ten it is zero. “With coronavirus something else is going on and researchers confess that they are stumped. It may be that the old are succumbing not so much because their immune systems can’t cope but because their bodies can’t. Afflicted with dodgy hearts and weakened lungs, in a way that newborns are not, they are an easier target. The more robust newborns on the other hand, even without strong immune systems, can weather the virus.”\n\nS. KOREAN HEALTH WORKERS ARE QUITTING\n\nThe Republic of Korea is now in a full-fledge epidemic that is stressing hospitals and health-care workers. The Wall Street Journal looks at the enormous stress they face.\n\n“In the hard-hit city of Daegu, South Korea, hospitals warned that they don’t have enough doctors, nurses and medical investigators to keep up with the constant stream of infected and at-risk patients. Government measures aimed at reducing infection, like discarding bedsheets and blankets after a single use, have depleted critical supplies. Employees are quitting as their families beg them to resign. “‘We can’t last long like this. All medical staff will burn out,’ said Nam Sung-il, a doctor treating patients at two Daegu hospitals. ‘Space is so scarce at one of them,’ Dr. Nam said, ‘that nurses have nowhere to rest but on the floor.’”\n\nTHE PRICE OF STOKING RESENTMENT\n\nIf you want to see where’s America’s obsession with identity politics can lead, look north to Canada, where protesters for three weeks have paralyzed the national rail system and cut people of from fuel to heat their homes, food to feed livestock, chemicals to clean drinking water, etc. etc.\n\nFinally Prime Minister Justin Trudeau demanded the removal of railroad barricades that indigenous protesters and radical environmentalists erected. But when one barricade goes down another goes up. Much of the protest centers on historic wrongs committed against First Nation peoples.\n\nJonathan Kay, columnist for the National Post, writes “While it’s convenient to blame Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s indecisive leadership for the crisis, these events do not arise in a vacuum. Rather, they follow on years during which our political, academic and journalistic elites denounced Canada itself as an ugly scar on traditional Indigenous lands. Trudeau himself has spent much of his time in office pledging himself to somehow absolve Canada of this original sin.”\n\nCanadian nationhood is wobbling, and Kay asks the essential question, “Is it possible for Anglo Canada to rebuild some kind of positive national identity:\n\n“If so, I think we will need to take stock of how our modern self-conception fell to pieces in the first place. Until roughly the late 2000s, Canada’s identity was rooted largely in the idea that we were a poorer but more conscientious sidekick to America. Our whole multilateral (and occasionally pacifistic) shtick on the world stage, not to mention our system of cultural subsidies, was based on the conceit that our relative smallness and poverty compared to the United States masked some kind of well-hidden reserve of moral superiority. It was an insecure, passive-aggressive posture that often expressed itself as peevish anti-Americanism. But at the very least, it acted as a binding agent for an English-speaking Canadian intellectual establishment whose common culture otherwise was confined to hockey, cold weather and universal health care. “But during the Obama years, all of this was thrown into confusion, because the housing-loan crisis smashed America without much affecting Canada. Suddenly, we were no longer the poor cousin. At almost exactly the same time, Barack Obama’s election in the United States, coupled with Stephen Harper’s rise in Canada, reversed the left-right political valence that had powered Canadians’ sense of moral superiority since the early years of the Cold War. Suddenly, we were the bad guys, and the whole organizing principle of Canadian intellectual life began to collapse. Into this vacuum came Idle No More, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the MMIWG report, the Indigenous backlash to Canada 150 — and Trudeau, whose political instincts are rooted in the confessional, self-lacerating spirit of political correctness that began to infect campus life at McGill University (and elsewhere) in the late 1980s and early ’90s. Twenty years ago, we bashed America. In 2020, we bash us.”\n\nTHE STEEL TO CONFRONT THE CAMPUS MOB\n\nHeather Mac Donald is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute think tank and person of real stature. She’s a lawyer with degrees from Stanford, Cambridge and Yale. She has written widely against extreme ideologies and concepts that range from radical feminism to critical race theory to implicit bias to social justice to transgender radicalism.

Doug Ducey gave in to supporters of “sanctuary cities” and pulled the brakes on a proposed constitutional ban on the designation.\n\nChris Herstam, a liberal commentator and partisan who opposed Ducey’s ban, decided this was the moment to rub the governor’s face in it.\n\n“So, once again, Ducey rolled out the immigration controversy,” Herstam wrote in the Arizona Mirror. “And, once again, an Arizona governor stained Arizona’s reputation and potentially harmed our economy.”\n\nAt the Capitol, about 40 Latino activists and lobbyists gathered to spike the football.\n\n“The response from the governor last night shows the power we have after 1070 and the power we have now,” said Hugo Polanco, a lobbyist for Living United for Change Arizona, to the Arizona Mirror.\n\nPeople are entitled to their moment of triumph, but what greater purpose does it serve? My guess is they only harden their opponents for the next round and ensure their noses get rubbed in the ground when it’s their turn to retreat.\n\nThis stuff happens because both left and right do it. Both sides are guilty.\n\nI understand why Latinos were furious when Republicans Eddie Farnsworth and Kelly Townsend silenced them in committee rooms. That was wrong, and their righteous anger was felt in the community and no doubt moved the governor to reverse.\n\nBut once Ducey conceded the point, why not send the signal that every time you move in our direction we’ll thank you, not punish you.\n\nTo do so would also signal that politics doesn't always have to be in-your-face.\n\nCORONAVIRUS MAY SOON BE A LOCAL STORY\n\n“Coronavirus disease 2019” or “Covid-19” is spreading rapidly from its epicenter in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and radiating out to 32 other countries and counting, reports the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.\n\nWhile the United States has reported less than 50 cases, health officials here are awakening to the likelihood that the disease will eventually spread widely in our country.\n\nIn a striking essay at Atlantic Online headlined “You’re likely to get the Coronavirus,” staff writer James Hamblin, MD, begins with an observation that Harvard epidemiology professor Marc Lipsitch is a man extremely cautious with his words.

WWE's year-end goal is 1 million subscribers, but some stockholders found the early subscriber count underwhelming.\n\nThen, investment manager Lemelson Capita weighed in, saying World Wrestling Entertainment shares remain top heavy.\n\n\"WWE is facing multiple challenging factors, including underwhelming subscription figures for their WWE network in addition to a multi-year negative earnings trend, suggesting that the firms' intrinsic value is materially lower than the current stock price,\" said Lemelson Capital chief investment officer Emmanuel Lemelson.\n\nWWE had been on a roll for much of the past year, surging from $8.56 to $31.98 by last month on prospects for WWE Network, the Internet streaming service which augments ending distribution agreements with several broadcast and cable TV networks. (WWE also has a new deal with Britain's BSKB network).\n\nThe faux sport, which turned Hulk Hogan, The Rock, John Cena and even WWE CEO Vince McMahon into very real cross-over film and entertainment stars, continues to have a wide following. According to company filings, 256 live North American events in 2013 attracted more than 1.5 million fans, another 382,000 at 56 events overseas.\n\nWWE conceded in its annual statement that it lacks expertise in its subscription model and \"could experience significant setbacks\" monetizing the service. The company posted a fourth-quarter operating loss of $12.2 million, compared to income of $2.6 million in the year-ago quarter, due mostly to investments in WWE Network.\n\nAmong Wall Street stock analysts, at least two have sell ratings on WWE. And Lemelson says despite this week's slide, the stock is fairly valued at no more than $11.88 a share.\n\nStill, others remain on the buy side of the ring, seeing promise because WWE Network offers 24/7 content and includes offerings such as Wrestlemania and other marquis TV events that previously cost fans up to $59.95.\n\n\"The subscription numbers for the new WWE network are very solid and healthy,'' says Kim Opiatowski, an analyst for The Vertical Group. \"The stock may have gotten a little ahead of itself, and a lot of momentum names have been fading. And people may have also taken money off the table.\"\n\nOpiatowski, who has had a buy rating on the stock since mid-January, is maintaining a $33 price target.\n\nOpiatowski, however, warns that 2014 could be as volatile as a hyped up ring battle.\n\n\"Results for 2014 could vary dramatically from our estimates depending upon the company's success and timing in signing up subscribers and resulting cannibalization of its pay per view base,'' she says. \"Another area of concern is the cost of creating original content to air on the 24/7 WWE network and the balance between content costs and the addition of new subscribers.\"\n\nTweet Strauss @gbstrauss.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2023/04/01/wrestlemania-39-match-card-start-time-live-stream/11578571002/", "title": "WrestleMania 2023: Live stream, card, start time, how to watch 39", "text": "Pro wrestling’s biggest spectacle returns to Hollywood this weekend.

The pay-per-view event quickly became the pinnacle of pro wrestling. WrestleMania I was held at Madison Square Garden and featured top superstars Hulk Hogan and “Rowdy” Roddy Piper, among others. The event also had guest appearances from the likes of Mr. T and Cyndi Lauper.\n\nSince the inaugural event, WrestleMania has become a staple in the wrestling community. Fans tune in each year to celebrate the culmination of WWE’s biggest storylines.\n\nWhat time is WrestleMania 39?\n\nWrestleMania 39 will begin on April 1 at 8:00 p.m. ET. Night 1 will feature seven matches as both Cena and Paul are expected on the card.

WWE will have six championship matches during the event, and there will be major matches including 2023 WWE Hall of Famer Rey Mysterio facing his son, Dominik Mysterio, and Brock Lesnar facing 7-foot-3 giant Omos.\n\nWhat are the biggest WrestleMania 39 storylines?\n\nThe biggest storyline revolves around The Bloodline faction. This group includes real-life family members Reigns and his cousins Jimmy Uso, Jey Uso and Solo Sikoa.\n\nThe Bloodline has dominated the WWE product for nearly three years. They own the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship and the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championships.\n\nReigns has feuded with Rhodes in recent months. The second-generation wrestlers have a lot of similarities as both their fathers are WWE royalty. Rhodes earned his title shot by winning the 2023 WWE Royal Rumble.\n\nThe Usos will defend their tag team championship against Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens. Both Zayn and Owens have feuded with the faction this year. In fact, Zayn was known as the “Honorary Uce” before turning his back on The Bloodline at the Royal Rumble.\n\nOther storylines to watch include Paul looking to earn his WWE respect against veteran wrestler Seth Rollins.

The \"Smackdown\" switch is such a big deal that the “People’s Champ” – better known as Hollywood star Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson – will make an appearance on Friday's Fox debut.\n\nThere's some serious competition, though. Upstart league All Elite Wrestling made its TNT debut this week, and longtime indie player Impact Wrestling has a new home on the small AXS TV cable network. You can’t even turn the channel these days without being dropkicked in the face by a flurry of faces and heels. (That’s good guys and baddies, in wrestling parlance.)\n\nHardcore fans lap up all the extra screen time, but it might be a bit much for those wanting to dip their toes into this entertaining landscape of soap opera, fabulous fisticuffs, insane aerial moves, theater of the absurd and the occasional person being thrown through a table. That’s why we’re here to help with a handy guide to each show, and which one might be the right fit for you.\n\n‘WWE SmackDown’ (Fox, Fridays, 8 EDT/PDT)\n\nThe show where you’re apt to find WWE’s most acrobatic wrestlers and technical phenoms will no doubt see a lot more star power under the network spotlight. The Rock’s cousin Roman Reigns is one “SmackDown” stalwart, alongside formerly cheery and now slightly villainous women’s champ Bayley. The biggest draw will probably be whoever makes it out of Friday’s David-vs.-Goliath title match between beastly Brock Lesnar and fan favorite Kofi Kingston.\n\n‘WWE Raw’ (USA, Mondays 8 EDT/PDT)\n\nFor those more into over-the-top shenanigans, “Raw” is home to one “Who’s the father?” mystery and another scenario involving a case of potential infidelity: They take lot of big swings over three hours, sometimes resulting in seriously fun moments. Real-life couple Seth Rollins and Becky Lynch (nicknamed “The Man”) are the main titleholders, though one man’s taken the show by storm: Bray Wyatt, a twisted Mister Rogers-type character – complete with sweater! – who has a masked horror-villain alter ego, The Fiend.\n\n‘Impact Wrestling’ (AXS TV, Tuesdays 8 EDT/5 PDT)\n\nUntil new episodes return Oct. 29, “Impact” airs greatest-hits matches and profiles personalities to get newcomers up to speed. Old-school fans will recognize familiar faces Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer, and their main heel faction has the cool name oVe (shorthand for Ohio Versus Everything). Like WWE, \"Impact\" has a deep roster of talented women, led by third-generation star Tessa Blanchard, who wrestles male and female performers and is a contender for the league’s signature X Division title.\n\n‘All Elite Wrestling: Dynamite’ (TNT, Wednesdays 8 EDT/PDT)\n\nOne of the most enjoyable things about pro wrestling is diving in and figuring out feud and storylines on the fly, but if you truly want to get in on the ground floor, follow the new cool kids. The nascent bunch features former WWE talent, including AEW champ – and “Dancing With the Stars” alum – Chris Jericho; Jon Moxley; and Cody Rhodes, one of the league's founders, alongside the high-flying Young Bucks and super-popular Kenny Omega. It’s the only show where you’ll find Jungle Boy (aka Jack Perry, son of late “90210” star Luke) and his partner Luchasaurus, a guy in a dinosaur mask with a master’s degree.\n\n‘WWE NXT’ (USA, Wednesdays 8 EDT/PDT)\n\nOnce a developmental league and feeder system for “Raw” and “SmackDown,” \"NXT\" has become just as essential, especially for those who want to really feel like they’re at a live event. There’s a little something for everyone, whether you dig fiery underdog heroes (Johnny Gargano), a gang of guys you love to hate (The Undisputed Era, which holds every men's title); super-bros such as Matt Riddle, who wrestle in their bare feet; women not to be trifled with unless you want an arm ripped off (NXT women’s champ and former MMA competitor Shayna Baszler); and the wrestling equivalent of Prince (the ultra-flamboyant Velveteen Dream).", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/04/25/sneak-peek-seth-green-camp-wwe/83487094/", "title": "Sneak peek: Seth Green imagines kid wrestlers for 'Camp WWE'", "text": "Brian Truitt\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDwayne “The Rock” Johnson, “Stone Cold” Steve Austin and John Cena are superstars in a pro wrestling ring, but Seth Green is on a mission to make their kid selves just as entertaining while toasting marshmallows and driving grownups crazy.\n\nThe actor and longtime wrestling fan is reimagining grapplers as 8-year-old boys and girls at summer camp in the adult animated series Camp WWE. The show premieres on demand May 1 on the WWE Network streaming service.\n\nGreen and his team at Stoopid Buddy Stoodios regularly tackle pop culture with series such as Robot Chicken and SuperMansion, but with Camp WWE, Green says, “getting to introduce these characters to a different audience (and) a new generation in a way they’ve never seen before is like a unique kind of privilege for me.”\n\nThe summer camp is headed up by Vince McMahon — with the WWE chairman, president and CEO voicing himself — though he’s an even more over-the-top persona than in the ring, as he rides giraffes and takes swigs from McMahonade. His daughter Stephanie McMahon and Triple H are 15-year-old camp counselors, while “Nature Boy” Ric Flair and Sgt. Slaughter are activity supervisors for the kids.\n\n“Everybody can relate to the concept of being at camp,” Green says, “and it gives us an age to explore these characters that you’d never get to see.”\n\nMost of the cast consists of actors playing young versions of current superstars like Roman Reigns, Sasha Banks, Kevin Owens, Becky Lynch, Seth Rollins and the Undertaker. Yet Green’s been able to snag Flair, Slaughter and Jake “The Snake” Roberts to voice their own animated characters.\n\n“It’s all pinch-me moments,” Green says. “I just calm myself enough that I can do the job I’ve been brought there to do. When you get the opportunity to work with your heroes, you want to make sure you’re doing your best.\"\n\nWhile WWE weekly programming such as Monday Night Raw (which Green hosted in 2009) tends more toward PG-rated, family-friendly fare, the goal of Camp WWE was to do something for more mature audiences that feels like a South Park or Archer, according to Green. So Vince McMahon lets loose with the four-letter words, and little Steve Austin — just like his real-life counterpart — is fond of giving middle-finger salutes.\n\nBut Green wants to showcase the in-ring personas fans love in a completely new and nuanced light. For example, instead of the animated Big Show being played as oafish, “we’ve made him a very complicated character full of intellectual curiosity and questions about the universe.\"\n\nHe also had fun crafting the cartoon take on Cena, a champion and winner loved by many but who also gets “Cena sucks!” chants every time the wrestler takes the WWE stage.\n\n“We wanted to play with the can-do spirit of an 8-year-old who always has a shoulder for you to cry on and always has some encouraging message but also just gets annoying,” Green explains. “He’s great at everything in the show but the other campers are like, ‘Ah, John, you know none of us like you, right?’ ”\n\nOne of Green’s favorite aspects of Camp WWE? Just getting to work closely with McMahon in a creative fashion.\n\n“He takes directions very, very well,” Green says. “He’s got a keen sense of understanding the comedy and the emotional disposition.\n\n“I don’t think girls between 14 and 29 are prepared for how much they’re going to love Vince McMahon after they watch this cartoon.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/03/17/wwe-tag-champs-usos-hope-represent-pensacola-first-wrestlemania-moment/429527002/", "title": "WWE tag champs 'The Usos' look to represent Pensacola at ...", "text": "Jake Newby\n\nPensacola News Journal\n\nIn their nine years in World Wrestling Entertainment, Pensacola-bred professional wrestlers and twin brothers \"The Usos\" have never appeared on the main show of WrestleMania.\n\nBut they're confident that streak will come to an end when WWE's flagship event comes to New Orleans on April 8.\n\n\"I don't think it could happen, it's gonna happen. Me and my bro keep saying, 'This is the year,'\" said Jey Uso in a recent phone interview with the News Journal. \"And if for some reason we're not on the main card, we're doing the people wrong, man. The WWE Universe ain't getting their money's worth. We're the best thing running right now, straight out the 8-5-0, right down the street from WrestleMania, man.\"\n\nJey and Jimmy Uso are the current WWE \"Smackdown Live\" Tag Team Champions and are garnering more attention and respect among wrestling fans than ever before.\n\nMore:Wrestling legend Jimmy Hart drops by Pensacola to promote WWE WrestleMania\n\nIn September 2016, the former Escambia High School football standouts \"turned heel,\" and became bad guys for the first time in their WWE careers. They ditched their kid-friendly bright colors, face paint and crowd participation chants and started wearing black or white jeans, tank tops and Nike Air Force Ones. They developed a mean streak and started mean mugging their way to the ring. Their characters grew arrogant. They threatened to lock wrestlers in \"the Uso penitentiary,\" claiming they had the tag team division \"locked down.\" It was a refreshing character change to many fans who felt their good guy shtick had become stale.\n\n\"The heel change would have never worked if that baby face phase didn't go as long as it did,\" Jey Uso said, referring to their seven-year run as good guys. \"The heel change just made it more real. We get to be us, we could talk the way we want to, dress the way we want to, it was like the ball was in our court now. And it took a lot of hard work to finally get the ball, you feel me?\"\n\nUp to this point, the Usos have only wrestled on WrestleMania pre-shows. It'd be a storybook moment for them to finally earn their WrestleMania moment just a couple hundred miles away from Pensacola, where they both grew up and where one of them still lives. Jey Uso, whose real name is Joshua Fatu, moved to Atlanta in December. But he hasn't forgotten about some of his favorite hangout spots in Pensacola.\n\n\"When me and the wife kick it downtown, we go to Blend or World of Beer, I don't mess around at Seville Quarter anymore because I feel like, damn, I've been going there since I was in high school,\" said Jey Uso, a father of two sons. \"My favorite though, when we're real hungry and wanna get away from the kids, we'll go to Grand Marlin or Peg Leg Pete's, those are my favorite places out there on Pensacola Beach.\"\n\nJimmy Uso is married to fellow WWE superstar Naomi, whose real name is Trinity Fatu, and they both reside in Pensacola. They keep a pretty low profile when they're home, but Jimmy said he and Naomi like to eat at Khon's sushi restaurant when they do go downtown. Since WWE performers are mostly confined to eating fast food while on the road traveling from state to state and venue to venue, he said it's always great to relax with a home-cooked meal.\n\n\"We never get the luxury of that homecooked meal so when I come home, man, I shut everything off — Uso on the road, daddy when I'm home,\" said Jimmy, also a father of two. \"So I keep it grounded. I cook something good for my family. I spend as much time as I can with the kids, you know, take them to practice — do the type of things parents do that I can't do on a day-to-day basis.\"\n\nWhenever they are forced to eat on the road, their preferred cuisine of choice is everyone's favorite Southern staple: Waffle House.\n\n\"When everything's closed after the show we gotta hit that Waffle House and put in work over there,\" Jey Uso said. \"I'm actually at a Waffle House right now. Texas cheese steak, double-bacon-egg and cheese around here, man. Anytime I'm with my family out west it's In-N-Out Burger, but when they're over here I'm taking everybody to Waffle House. Most people hate Waffle House down here 'cause that's all we got. But man, you can't get tired of Waffle House.\"\n\nMore:WWE superstar Charlotte Flair is leading the way for women's wrestling\n\nEvery year during WrestleMania season, the brothers spend time booking flights and hotels for family members. But as they look to finally lock down their WrestleMania moment, they said they're not so concerned with that this time around.\n\n\"Every year we're flying people in, thinking this will be our year, but like I was just telling my brother, I don't think I'm flying anybody in,\" said Jimmy Uso, whose real name is Jonathon Fatu. \"I think I need to take this time to really bunker down. I'm just gonna focus. This year is it, man. I don't wanna have no distractions.\"\n\nIf there was ever a year for the Usos to be rewarded with a main card WrestleMania match it's 2018. The brothers pride themselves on \"stealing the show,\" or, having the most entertaining match on the card. And the consensus was they did just that multiple times in 2017 against their rivals \"The New Day,\" one of WWE's most popular acts. The Usos also adopted a unique promo style in which they finish each other's sentences as they taunt other wrestlers. Jey Uso calls it \"twinning.\"\n\nBut as spectacular as they were in 2017, the Usos could still be an afterthought come April 8, even as tag team champions. It has, after all, happened to them twice before.\n\nThe Usos entered WrestleMania as tag champs the last time WWE came to New Orleans in 2014 and again last year in Orlando, and neither time cracked the main card. They have wrestled on five of the last six WrestleMania pre-shows, where performers historically throw down in front of half-empty football stadiums as fans file in to watch WWE's answer to the Super Bowl. Until 2014, pre-shows were not televised. Now they air on WWE's video streaming service, the WWE Network. The Usos were left off the card completely at WrestleMania 29 in 2013.\n\n\"This year is probably hands down one of our hottest years,\" said Jimmy Uso. \"WrestleMania changes by the hour, by the minute, so I'm nervous about it.\"\n\nTypically, WWE stars of yesteryear return to the ring at WrestleMania. Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, The Undertaker, Goldberg and others have assumed top spots on the WrestleMania main card over the years because of their drawing power and mainstream notoriety. That business model tends to bump some of WWE's regular performers, like the Usos, off the card, because it's not easy to fit a roster of 100 wrestlers onto a four-hour show.\n\nBut as the 34th incarnation of WWE's biggest show approaches, the Usos are as popular with fans as they've ever been. They feel like they're on the cusp of the WrestleMania moment that every WWE superstar dreams about. And if it happens, they plan to put Pensacola on the map with one of the best performances of the night.\n\n\"You know 8-5-0, that's the home team right there, all day,\" Jey Uso said, referencing Pensacola's area code. \"How you not gonna have the best tag team in the world at WrestleMania? Come on, we on there this year. And, we're gonna retain (the tag titles). We're gonna steal the show like we always do.\"\n\nJake Newby can be reached at jnewby@pnj.com or 850-435-8538.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/03/25/survive-dating-wrestling-fan-wrestlemania-season/70392712/", "title": "How to survive dating a wrestling fan during WrestleMania season", "text": "Justin L. Mack\n\njustin.mack@Indystar.com\n\nThe Super Bowl. The World Cup. The Olympics. WrestleMania.\n\nOK, pro wrestling's biggest spectacle might seem a little out of place in the company of those other major sporting events. But trust me, for millions of wrestling fans worldwide, the greatest time of year is upon us.\n\nAs WrestleMania 31 prepares to invade TV screens Sunday night, what does that mean for people newly dating card-carrying members of the WWE Universe? It means you are about to be immersed in the culture like never before.\n\nHere are a few tips to help you survive the \"Showcase of the Immortals.\" The show starts at 7 p.m. on the WWE Network and pay-per-view.\n\nAsk questions\n\nAnd be prepared to listen. If there is one thing wrestling fans love as much as watching it, it's talking about it, so ask anything. Favorite wrestler, favorite match, favorite era — just be prepared to listen.\n\nAsking questions also shows you're taking interest in something that is important to your better half, and that's always a positive thing.\n\nUnderstand the importance\n\nRemember when I compared WrestleMania to the Super Bowl and the World Cup? Well, there is good reason. WrestleMania is easily the most important event on the calendar of a wrestling fan. It provides the payoff for so many small story lines and feuds that have been rolling all year long, and typically, the quality of the event is head and shoulders above everything else the WWE does for the rest of the year.\n\nWrestleMania also continues to do big numbers for the company. Now that the event is streamed on the WWE Network, the pro wrestling equivalent to Netflix that costs $9.99 per month, more fans can afford to watch. The event sells for about $60 on pay-per-view.\n\nLast year, 690,000 people bought the show and an additional 667,000 had access to it on WWE Network, giving WrestleMania a potential combined viewership of more than 1.3 million people. WrestleMania 28, which pit The Rock vs. John Cena in the main event, holds the pay-per-view record of more than 1.2 million buys.\n\nSo, please, understand that this is a big deal for your mate. If you have an errand you need run, wait until the final bell. If you have a cute dog or cat video you want to share, just bookmark it. We'll be ready to check it out later.\n\nWatch out for flying emotions\n\nWrestling events, especially WrestleMania, prey on the emotions of fans. It's one of the reasons more than a million people now subscribe to the WWE Network and why WrestleMania in a matter of minutes sells out massive venues — this year the 75,000-seat Levi's Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers. Wrestling fans care about the product. A lot.\n\nSo be on the lookout of emotional outbursts. Screams of joy when a match has a perfect ending. Shock and anger when something disagreeable goes down. \"Oos\" and \"ahs\" on a particularly impressive match. It's all part of the show.\n\nDon't get jealous\n\nWrestling is often compared with soap operas in many ways. The drama. The year-round story lines. The sometimes questionable acting. But also like soaps, there is no shortage of attractive superstars for fans to enjoy.\n\nSo fellas, don't get all twisted and turned into knots when your WWE-loving girlfriend starts swooning over Roman Reigns or Randy Orton. And ladies, forgive your man if he pays a little too much attention to matches featuring the likes of the Bella Twins or AJ Lee. You're still the world heavyweight champ of his or her heart.\n\nGive it a chance\n\nSeriously, you might like it. I've been watching since I was a kid, so my girlfriend always has been supportive of my love for wrestling and wouldn't run out of the room when \"RAW\" or \"Smackdown\" came on. And over time, I noticed something. She could recite the wrestler's names, moves and recap story lines almost as well as I could. There may be a budding fan in our midst.\n\nModern World Wrestling Entertainment often tries to provide a little something for everyone. Gone are the blood-soaked, profanity heavy days of Stone Cold Steve Austin and the \"Attitude Era.\" The brand now promotes a safer in-ring style in the wake of recent pushes for concussion awareness, so you won't see dangerous moves like the piledriver or competitors being struck in the head with steel chairs in today's WWE. Overall, the tonal shift moves the product closer to the golden age of the mid-80s when Hulk Hogan was telling kids to say their prayers and eat their vitamins.\n\nYou might be surprised to see something at WrestleMania that clicks with you, provided you give it a fair shake.\n\nDon't call it fake!\n\nLike, never. Don't do it. Trust us, we know. Scripted? Yes. Predetermined? Obviously. Not a \"real\" sport? Probably not. It actually has more in common with the ballet or the opera.\n\nBut calling it fake is a cheap dig at how much effort the men and woman on the WWE roster put into pulling off a good show. A wrong move or miscommunication in the ring could lead to tragedy. Need proof? Look no further than the tragic death of Lucha Libre star Perro Aguayo Jr. during a match earlier this month.\n\nYes, the fighting is \"fake,\" but the risks are very real.\n\nReady for the big show this Sunday?

In addition, Netflix rolls out three original flicks – including a multigenerational Asian tale, a high-concept British comedy and a pro-wrestling family flick – and Josh Duhamel is back as a romantic lead (and he milks goats!).\n\nHere's a rundown of which new movies are hitting streaming on Friday for every cinematic taste.\n\nIf you can’t stop the feeling (to dance, of course): ‘Trolls World Tour’\n\nAfter saving all of Troll kind in the first film, Poppy (voiced by Anna Kendrick) and Branch (Justin Timberlake) return in the animated sequel to learn all sorts of new things including that each tribe of Trolls is connected with a certain genre of music. They also get a couple of new metal-loving foes in Barb (Rachel Bloom) and her dad King Thrash (Ozzy Osbourne). Your quarantined kids will be rocking out to this for a while.\n\nWhere to watch: iTunes, Vudu, Fandango Now\n\nIf you’re in need of a redemptive family story: ‘Tigertail’\n\nFans of “The Funeral” – and anyone needing an emotional pick-me-up – will appreciate this excellent and heart-tugging drama from Alan Yang, the co-creator of Netflix’s “Master of None.” A stoic Taiwanese man (a great Tzi Ma), needing to connect with his struggling workaholic daughter (Christine Ko), revisits his childhood as an enthusiastic youngster and a fateful decision to leave love behind to travel to America in search of a better life.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nIf you’re cool with quirky Brits: ‘Love Wedding Repeat’\n\nThere’s a little bit of “Groundhog Day,” “Love Actually” and “Clue” in the DNA of this rom-com with multiple endings and crazy shenanigans. An English dude (Sam Claflin) is in Rome to make sure the wedding day for his sister (Eleanor Tomlinson) goes off without a hitch. He has to juggle the many ways that day could go wrong between his angry ex (Freida Pinto), his sibling’s American friend (Olivia Munn) he’s had the hots for and one pesky missing sedative.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nIf your kids are ready to rumble: ‘The Main Event’\n\nIt’s “Like Mike” with pro wrestling, a love letter to the WWE that walks a fine line between sweet family film and cheese-fest. Leo (Seth Carr) is a gawky 11-year-old wrestling super-fan who comes across a mysterious luchador mask at an estate sale. The headgear turns out to be magical: When Leo puts it on, he becomes Kid Chaos and, imbued with extraordinary abilities and a deeper voice, and has a chance to get his family out of financial straits. While fairly predictable, it’s got some fun wrestler cameos and an unbreakable feel-good vibe.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nIf you like a little horror with your metal: ‘We Summon the Darkness’\n\nIn the middle of a satanic panic with murderers on the loose in their 1980s-set Midwestern locale, Alexis (Alexandra Daddario) and her girlfriends (Maddie Hasson and Amy Forsyth) go to a rock show and befriend three dudes (Logan Miller, Keean Johnson, Austin Swift) and then head back to the estate of Alexis’ televangelist dad (Johnny Knoxville), where things get bloody when the pentagrams and chainsaws come out. You can see the twists coming (yes, there’s more than one), though “Darkness” does take an intriguing stab at exploring cults of personality.\n\nWhere to watch: iTunes, Fandango Now, Google Play\n\nIf you want to squirm for the rest of the day: 'Sea Fever'\n\nThe indie sci-fi horror flick is chock-full of familiar influences (see: \"Alien\"), yet to its credit offers some seriously unnerving imagery. Hermione Corfield is a marine-biology student on board a European fishing trawler, full of a crew (including Connie Nielsen) weirdly superstitious of her red hair. But they have bigger fish to fry – or, as the case may be, icky parasites – when their boat and drinking water are invaded by an otherworldly organism that infects the sailors and turns them mad. Good luck sleeping after seeing wormy weirdness coming out of an exploded eye!\n\nWhere to watch: iTunes, Vudu, Fandango Now\n\nIf you’re in the mood for romance: ‘The Lost Husband’\n\nMore Lifetime-y weeper than rom-com, “Lost Husband” stars Leslie Bibb as Texas widow Libby, who moves her kids out of Houston and away from her haughty mother Sharon Lawrence to a rural farm run by her aunt (Nora Dunn). Libby’s a hot mess at first, milking goats and doing chores, and she butts heads with rugged farm manager James (Josh Duhamel). However, he has his own tragic past that helps foster a friendship and then (obviously) something more in Vicky Wright’s adaptation of Katherine Center’s novel that goes overboard with the melodramatic subplots.\n\nWhere to watch: iTunes, Vudu\n\nIf you're yearning for a mind-bending emotional drama: 'The Roads Not Taken'\n\nDirected by Sally Potter (\"Orlando\"), the drama has a neat conceit that wavers in its execution. Javier Bardem stars as a New York man with dementia seemingly lost in his thoughts during a busy and tumultuous day with his protective daughter (Elle Fanning). But part of the odd behavior is because he's living through two other parallel timelines in his mind, where he's made different choices and ended up with different people. The narrative isn't always focused in its direction, but the movie explores with nuance the idea that our lives are defined by who we love and not just by what we do.\n\nWhere to watch: Bleecker Street Media virtual theater", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/2018/07/27/wwe-nxt-star-johnny-gargano-im-total-nerd/839834002/", "title": "WWE NXT star Johnny Gargano: I'm a total nerd", "text": "Millennials, they say, are breaking down old barriers between white and black, straight and gay. Well, add one more obsolete divide: jocks vs. nerds.\n\nJohnny Gargano, the 30-year-old professional wrestler with the WWE’s NXT brand, says he bonded with his wife of less than two years, fellow NXTer Candice LeRae, over their mutual love of all things geeky.\n\n“I’m looking around our apartment, and there’s landspeeder there, there’s a lightsaber there, all kinds of ‘Star Wars’ stuff,” Gargano says. “I just went crazy on ‘Spider-Man’ the animated series, like old-school action figures from the early ’90s, I bought all those. So our apartment is glass cases filled with toys and helmets and things like that.\n\n“EBay is very dangerous to me.”\n\nNXT's old-school vibe\n\nGargano will be in Phoenix on Sunday, July 29, for a live show at Comerica Theatre, along with his wife and his nemesis, the bushy-bearded NXT Champion Tommaso Ciampa (long storyline there, folks).\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment launched NXT in 2010 as a developmental territory in Florida, but the league has grown into a third brand alongside \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" — although you can still only watch NXT on the WWE Network, the company’s streaming service.\n\nWrestling fans have been drawn to NXT for its old-school vibe, which Gargano says reminds him of his days on the independent wrestling circuit.\n\n“Some of the most hardcore, nitty-gritty fans in the world are independent-wrestling fans, and I think a lot of those came with us to NXT,” he says.\n\nGargano fell in love with wrestling, and with geek culture, at a young age. He first got into the ring at age 8, at an event held in the parking lot behind his dad’s catering business. And he was 16 when he had his first pro match.\n\n“Being a Power Ranger or being a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle weren’t real-life jobs that I could do, but I could be a professional wrestler,” he says.\n\nHow he met Candice LeRae\n\nHe was still working the independent circuit when he met LeRae at an event in California.\n\n“I remember she brought her cousin to the back, and they were just hanging out talking, and I decided I was going to try to get to her by talking to her cousin about her cellphone,” he says. “It didn’t really work that well, but we developed a friendship.”\n\nGargano and LeRae: Nerds at heart\n\nAdding to the couple's geek credentials, they married Sept. 16, 2016, at Disneyland.\n\nAnd no, the toys aren’t all his. Take the aforementioned landspeeder, for example.\n\n“Toys‘R’Us was going out of business, and my wife wanted one of the landspeeders. And I was like, ‘I don’t think you’re going to fit in it,’ because it’s for little kids. But she’s like, ‘No, I only weigh like 110 pounds, I can definitely fit in that.’ So I said, ‘OK, if it gets slashed to 50 percent off,’ I’ll go buy you one of those little-kid landspeeders that you can drive around our apartment.\n\n“And she actually does.”\n\nReach the reporter at kerry.lengel@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.

Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris superimposed over images of buildings on fire. Text overlays of quotes purportedly from last summer's BLM protests are attributed to each.\n\n\"Direct quotes when BLM was BURNING down cities and killing people in the streets! 'Peaceful protests' the media called it,\" user Kyle Rubenstein wrote. His post has over 600 shares.\n\nActions taken by insurgents who infiltrated the Capitol on Wednesday while results of the 2020 presidential election were certified were labeled differently, according to Rubenstein.\n\n\"Trump supporters take to the capital, dont burn or loot. News calls it domestic terrorism. This is why we are fed up!!!!\" the caption ends.\n\nIn an email response to USA TODAY, Rubenstein elaborated on his post.\n\n\"Let's see all the lies the media 'news' has been feeding the country about the political non sense going on in the world today and the fact you fake fact checkers are hiding or trying to hide the truth or blocking freedom of speech just bc one agrees with oneside not the other seems some folks need to put their big boy pants on and grow up,\" Rubenstein wrote.\n\nA similar meme was posted to Facebook on Jan. 8 using the same quotes; it has received 3,500 shares.\n\nAnother posted that day to the page American Kool-Aid Drinkers included additional remarks from former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and CNN host Chris Cuomo. All quotes are compared to an excerpt from Trump's now deleted tweet to his supporters on Jan. 6: \"Go home with Love & in Peace. Remember this day forever!\"\n\n\"Much of our material is, 'unoriginal,' in that it comes from another source, i.e. various social media sources. With that said, AKD is more an aggregator of humorous memes, Mike Hunt American Kool-Aid Drinkers told USA TODAY.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the other user for comment.\n\nMore:Fact check: NPR posted story early, updated live amid Capitol riot\n\nQuotes taken out of context\n\nThe claims were posted after violence at the U.S. Capitol that led to the deaths of five people. Clashes between Trump supporters and Capitol police recalled images from Black Lives Matter-led racial justice demonstrations last summer, some of which turned violent.\n\nSeveral incidents preceded the BLM protests, including the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor — two unarmed Black citizens — at the hands of police and the killing of Black jogger Ahmad Aubrey by white supremacists early last year, according to USA TODAY.\n\nBut the quotes used in the claims are either related to BLM protests and incomplete, or have nothing to do with them at all.\n\nHere's a breakdown of circumstances surrounding each quote.\n\nVice President-elect Kamala Harris\n\nHarris has gone on record as supporting peaceful anti-violence demonstrations after police officers in Kenosha, Wisconsin, shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, several times in the back on Aug. 23.\n\nHarris said that \"protesters should not let up!\" according to the claim. That abbreviated quote has been fodder for social media claims before, USA TODAY has reported.\n\nMore:Fact check: Kamala Harris said protests aren't going to stop, but condemns violence\n\nThe full statement is more nuanced. During a June 17 interview on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" Harris told Colbert that protests — not riots — should not let up.\n\nColbert observed that reporting on protests happening in major cities across the country appeared to be dwindling, to which Harris responded: \"That's right. But they're not gonna stop. They're not gonna stop, and this is a movement, I'm telling you.\n\n\"They're not gonna stop, and everyone beware, because they're not gonna stop,\" she continued. \"They're not gonna stop before Election Day in November, and they're not gonna stop after Election Day.\n\n\"Everyone should take note of that, on both levels, that they're not going to let up — and they should not. And we should not,\" Harris concluded, according to USA TODAY.\n\nThe vice president-elect made a distinction between rioting and protesting in a rebuttal to Trump's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in September, CBS News reported.\n\n\"We must always defend peaceful protest and peaceful protesters. We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence, including the shooter who was arrested for murder,\" Harris said. \"Make no mistake, we will not let these vigilantes and extremists derail the path to justice.\"\n\nRep. Ayanna Pressley\n\nPressley's statements about last summer's BLM protests were similarly taken out of context.\n\n\"There needs to be unrest in the streets,\" Pressley said, according to the claim.\n\nThe quote, grabbed from Pressley's Aug. 15 interview on MSNBC's \"AM Joy,\" is incomplete. A clip with her full remarks was posted to BlackEnterprise.com.\n\nMore:Rep. Ayanna Pressley: 'What do you do when your very existence is resistance?'\n\n\"Don’t let up, send emails, make phone calls,\" the congresswoman told host Tiffany Cross in reference to the protests. \"There needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest in our lives. And unfortunately, there's plenty to go around,\" she concluded.\n\nPressley's statement was shared widely in conservative social media circles. After the interview, thousands of messages, some \"ominous,\" were sent to her office, according to The 19th News.\n\nMore:Fact check: Joe Biden has condemned protest-related violence from the left and the right\n\nRep. Maxine Waters\n\nUnlike Harris and Pressley, Waters' charged statement about \"pushing back\" against Cabinet officials predates last year's BLM protests.\n\n\"If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gas station, you get out and create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere,\" Waters said, according to the claim.\n\nThe California congresswoman's remarks were in response to the Trump administration's 2018 \"zero tolerance\" family separation policy at the U.S.-Mexico border, CNN reported on June 25, 2018.\n\nWaters called for reuniting migrant families in her full statement.\n\n\"Let’s make sure we show up wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them. And you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere. We’ve got to get the children connected to their parents,” she said, according to CNN.\n\nTrump said Waters called for \"harm to his supporters\" in a tweet later that day.\n\n\"Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!\" the president tweeted.\n\nWaters made no reference to Trump's supporters and underscored that she had no sympathy for members of the current administration in an MSNBC interview that same day.\n\n“The people are going to turn on them. They’re going to protest. They’re going to absolutely harass them until they decide that they’re going to tell the President, ‘No, I can’t hang with you,’” Waters said of administration officials, according to CNN.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi\n\nPelosi was also referring to the Trump administration's family separation policy with her statement about nationwide uprisings.\n\n\"I just don't know why there aren't uprisings all over the country. Maybe there will be,\" Pelosi said, according to the claim.\n\nDuring a June 14, 2018, press conference, Pelosi was asked about former House Speaker Paul Ryan's comment about legislation being the best way to change the separation policy. She disagreed.\n\n\"This is an act of the administration. They have been planning this for a while,\" Pelosi said, according to a video provided by C-SPAN.\n\nNear the end of a lengthy response, Pelosi expressed surprise that there weren't uprisings in the street.\n\n\"When we had a had a hearing on a subject related to this asylum seeker, refugees, etc., the (National) Association of Evangelicals testified that refugees and asylum ... they called it the crown jewel of America's humanitarianism,\" she said. \"And in order to do away with that crown jewel, they're doing away with children being with their moms.\n\n\"This is ... I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all over the country. Maybe there will be,\" Pelosi continued.\n\nThe remarks about uprisings were in no way tied to BLM protests.\n\nOur rating: Missing context\n\nWe rate this claim MISSING CONTEXT, based on our research. Two quotes attributed to members of the Democratic Party that allegedly referenced last summer's Black Lives Matter protests actually predate the events. The two remaining quotes were not provided in full.

Here are a few things", "text": "Alia E. Dastagir\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe U.S. government once asked women what they wanted. It was 1977, and the eyes of the nation turned to Houston as an estimated 20,000 people — Gloria Steinem and Coretta Scott King, Democrats and Republicans, lesbians and straight women, those who were born in America and some who were not — gathered for the only federally-funded women’s rights conference of its kind in U.S. history.\n\n\"We promise to accept nothing less than justice for every woman,\" Maya Angelou told the exuberant attendees in a poem she composed for the occasion.\n\nThe National Women’s Conference called for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, which would explicitly ban discrimination based on sex. The women asked for affordable childcare, equal pay for equal work and that the federal government fund abortions for women who could not afford the procedure. They stressed the importance of national healthcare. They called for an end to discriminatory rape laws. They demanded the nation stop deporting immigrant mothers of American-born children.\n\nIn 2017, the government didn't ask women what they wanted, but hundreds of thousands of them spoke up anyway. They poured into the nation's capital for the Women's March on Washington, flooding the streets to articulate many of the same demands as those women in Houston 40 years ago — and to insist that what rights had been granted remain protected. They called again for the Equal Rights Amendment to be included in the Constitution. They emphasized again the need for \"affordable childcare,\" \"equal pay\" and \"access to safe, legal, affordable abortion and birth control.\" They said women have a right to live \"free of all forms of violence against our bodies\" and that \"it is our moral duty to keep families together.\"\n\nWhile the demands were echoes of 1977, the mood was different in 2017, tinged with trepidation over the election of President Trump, whose treatment of women raised eyebrows before and during the campaign, and led some Republicans to denounce him. Ultimately, enough voters decided they either did not believe the sexual assault accusations against Trump, or they did not care.\n\n“The power of men to decide what the world is going to look like, what counts and what doesn't, hasn't really been terribly disrupted in a generation,” said feminist legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw.\n\nWomen have made undeniable advances — from American boardrooms and courts of law, to universities and sports arenas — but disparities remain, especially in poor or rural areas and in communities of color.\n\nThough feminism seems pervasive — democratized by the Internet and popularized (and commodified) by high-profile women such as Beyoncé and Ivanka Trump — women’s rights remain in flux depending on who's in power. Women's rights are expanding in some states — New York in 2016 enacted 12-weeks of paid family leave — and rolling back in others — Ohio recently banned abortions at 20 weeks, which violates the viability threshold set by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade. Ohio's law does not include exceptions for rape or incest.\n\n“There is a lot of work to be done before culture and policy can align toward progress,” said Vicki Shabo, vice president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, a non-partisan advocacy group.\n\nAs Women’s History Month kicks off, here's a look at where a number of women’s issues stand:\n\nHealth: From gains to wait-and-see\n\nAcknowledging women's roles as primary caregivers, the 1977 conference named national health care as one of its federal priorities. In 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, expanding coverage to millions of women, forbidding the denial of coverage based on gender and guaranteeing access to birth control, maternity care and breastfeeding supplies. The National Partnership for Women & Families called the ACA \"the greatest advance for women’s health in a generation.\" Trump and Republicans in Congress vow to repeal and replace it.\n\nSexual and domestic violence: Still too common\n\nThere is more awareness and condemnation of violence against women than ever before, yet statistics still paint a grim picture. One in 3 women have been a victim of some form of physical violence by an intimate partner, according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, and one in six American women will be the victim of an attempted or completed rape, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. The Department of Justice reports that rates are even higher for transgender and bisexual women.\n\nIt is unclear how the Trump administration will enforce existing federal legislation to protect survivors: During her confirmation hearing, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos avoided directly answering whether she will uphold Title IX's federal guidance instructing colleges to combat campus sexual assault, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions did not support the most recent authorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which he is responsible for enforcing.\n\n\"The point of feminism is you shouldn't have to be a man to be treated with equal respect,\" Crenshaw said. \"You shouldn't have to be a man to be able to walk down the street without worrying about being sexually abused.\"\n\nPaid family leave and childcare: Behind other countries\n\nThe United States is an outlier among developed countries when it comes to paid family and medical leave, which allows people time off to care for a newborn, help a sick family member or recover from a serious illness. The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave, but according to the National Partnership for Women & Families fewer than 40% of workers qualify for it. Some employers offer paid family leave, but the group says it covers only 14% workers. California, New Jersey and Rhode Island have implemented paid family leave laws and New York and the District of Columbia are in the process of enacting them.\n\nIn Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, the president said: \"My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women's health.\"\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump introduced a plan for paid maternity leave, championed by his daughter Ivanka, which proposed the federal government guarantee six weeks of paid maternity to some birth mothers. Democrats said only offering leave for mothers, not fathers, stresses the notion that raising children is women's work. Republicans expressed concern about costs and the burden on businesses.\n\nSome studies, however, suggest leave policies are good for business, because they lead to happier employees and less turnover. Family leave also has significant positive effects on young children's health, fathers' involvement and breastfeeding rates, studies show.\n\nThe U.S. also does not offer universal pre-K, though research shows paying for early childhood development leads to lower rates of high school dropouts, criminal activity, teen pregnancy, drug and alcohol abuse and other health problems, all of which create a burden on society — and taxpayers.\n\n\"When you raise a law-abiding studious child you are producing economic value,\" Ann Crittenden, author of The Price of Motherhood, said in urging taxpayers to look at the long game.\n\nAbortion was legal then and now. But ...\n\nFollowing the 2010 elections, more anti-abortion politicians seized power in state legislatures, leading to a proliferation of abortion restrictions across the country. State laws like Arkansas' 48-hour waiting period create significant hurdles for rural and poor women, advocates say. There are only three licensed abortion providers in Arkansas, according to the state's department of health. A limited number of clinics means a woman may have to travel long distances to access the procedure, and a waiting period means she incurs two days of transportation and lodging costs compounded by two days of missed wages, as well as two days of possible childcare (according to the Guttmacher Institute, nearly 60% of women obtaining an abortion are already mothers). Planned Parenthood says an in-clinic abortion can cost up to $1,500 in the first trimester.\n\nThe president and vice president are against abortion, and advocates of abortion rights view Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, as a threat.\n\n“It's not a settled issue in the U.S.,\" said Carol Sanger, author of the forthcoming, About Abortion: Terminating Pregnancy in the 21st Century. With a few more appointments, she said, it is possible Roe v. Wade could be overturned.\n\n'Equal pay for equal work'\n\nThe wage gap is narrowing, but has barely budged in the last decade, according to the non-profit Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR). Overall, women earn 80 cents for every dollar earned by men, according to the National Partnership for Women & Families, with black women earning 63 cents and Latinas earning 54 cents. Critics argue these figures do not reflect factors such as occupation or experience. One can't, they say, compare the salary of a female teacher to that of a male lawyer. But economists say even when those controls are present, a wage gap persists. Female doctors, for example, are paid about $20,000 less a year than male doctors.\n\n\"The majority of the current earnings gap comes from within occupation differences in earnings, rather than from between occupation differences,\" Claudia Goldin, a Harvard University labor economist, wrote in a 2014 paper.\n\nThe Equal Pay Act forbids sex-based wage discrimination, but women's rights advocates say it's poorly enforced.\n\nThe wage gap is worse for women with children, who face a steep \"mommy tax.\" Motherhood is tied to a 4% decrease in earnings per child, while fatherhood is tied to a 6% increase, according to a 2014 study by UMass Amherst sociology professor Michelle Budig, and the penalty for mothers is worse for low-income women who can least afford to pay it.\n\nWomen are also less likely to ask for high compensation and studies show they are penalized more than men for trying to negotiate.\n\nAt the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway noted a time she struggled to define her worth during her career. Years ago, she said was asked her speaking fee for an event that would feature herself and a male speaker. \"I froze because I knew no matter what I said in return to the question of 'what is your speaking fee, what are you worth, what is your value to do this,' no matter what I said I was going to undercut myself. I was going to be that self-denying girl who grew up in that house of all women, a giver not a taker ... It's not his fault if I undercut my value,\" Conway said. What she decided to do was to say: \"I'll have what he's having,\" requesting the same rate as the male speaker.\n\nCritics of equal pay interventions often frame the debate around women's personal choices, while equal pay advocates say it should focus on how the structure of American work does not align with the realities of American life. According to the Pew Research Center, women make up nearly half the workforce, and are breadwinners in 40% of households with children, yet they are more likely than men to make compromises when the needs of children and family members collide with work, which they say negatively impacts their careers.\n\n\"There are long-standing beliefs that there are separate worlds and responsibilities for women. Women are different and so they make these choices and some part of this inequality is simply the product of choices women make,\" Crenshaw said. \"You can't blame all of the inequality women face on difference. It's not difference, it's a matter of power — who gets to decide what a worker is, who gets to decide what the implications of reproduction are, in whose vision is a worker basically somebody who has no childcare responsibilities?\"\n\nPolitical representation: At this rate, women will reach parity in 100 years\n\nThe number of women in politics is increasing — sluggishly. Women are 51% of the population, but make up 19% of Congress and only a quarter of state legislatures. Women are on course to reach parity with men by 2117, according to IWPR. Research shows women have different legislative priorities than men, and are more likely to introduce bills addressing the needs of women and children. Jennifer Lawless, author of Women on the Run: Gender, Media, and Political Campaigns in a Polarized Era, said the chief reason for unequal political participation is that women, perceiving bias, are less likely to run than men. When they do, she said, they are elected at the same rates.\n\nFrom a voter perspective, the IWPR said more women are turning out to the polls, but many states are passing measures that make it harder to vote, including reducing polling sites and enacting strict voter ID laws, which disproportionately affect vulnerable communities. Fewer polling places mean longer lines, a burden on less advantaged voters who tend to have less flexibility with work and childcare arrangements.\n\n“My right to vote as an upper-class white woman with multiple college degrees is not in jeopardy,\" said Nancy Young, a political historian at the University of Houston, \"but what about a working class African American woman or Hispanic woman?”\n\nWomen are not a monolith\n\nThe 1977 women’s conference formed with bipartisan support, but in the decades since, women's issues have grown increasingly politicized. Marjorie Spruill, author of Divided We Stand: The Battle Over Women’s Rights and Family Values That Polarized American Politics, said a major factor was the rise of a potent conservative women’s movement, led by activist Phyllis Schlafly, which denounced the feminist agenda and successfully mobilized to defeat the Equal Rights Amendment. The conference “made people really line up on extreme sides,” Spruill said. While feminists debated at the Houston Civic Center, conservatives held a dueling Pro-Life, Pro-Family Rally at the city's Astro Arena.\n\nIn 2017, a conservative view of feminism acknowledges gender inequality, to varying degrees, but does not share progressives' ideas to combat it. Sabrina Schaeffer, executive director of the conservative Independent Women's Forum (Kellyanne Conway has a seat on the board), said addressing inequity is important, but top-down mandates may not be necessary or economical. She said the Republican party must rethink its approach to women's issues to attract new voters, but she rejects the Democratic narrative that she argues turn women into victims and ignores that some disparities are caused by the choices individual men and women make.\n\n\"Gender is not the whole story,\" Schaeffer said.\n\nAmerican women share common struggles, but differ greatly in their experiences, which is why \"women's rights\" remain so divisive and why its tent is so broad. Karla Holloway, a professor of English and Law at Duke University who focuses on African American cultural studies, said conversations that fixate on the achievements of Hillary Clinton come at the expense of mothers working minimum wage jobs to keep their families above the federal poverty line. As some women become more visible, others disappear.\n\n\"Women who are elevated are still vulnerable,\" she said. \"Women who have been erased are drowning.\"\n\nAlia Dastagir writes about media and culture for USA TODAY.

She paused.\n\nIn the early 2000s, she worked as a cosmetologist and frequently used the products to straighten her hair and other women’s as well. Back then, she says, cosmetology schools rarely offered lessons in how to take care of Black women’s natural hair – those interested in learning had to teach themselves.\n\n“It wasn’t a place where natural hair could thrive. It was a tough environment to stay rooted in – no pun intended,” she says.\n\nEris Eady Courtesy Eris Eady\n\nEady says that every time she straightened her hair, she developed sores on her scalp. Against her mother’s advice, who feared she’d be discriminated against, she stopped putting chemicals on her hair and went natural. But her short natural hair came at a cost: people would hurl homophobic slurs at her.\n\nNearly two decades later, Eady says she worries about the health consequences of that hair-straightening period in her life. Her anxiety spiked this week when she read about the new study and how Black women may be more affected due to their higher use of relaxers and other hair-straightening products.\n\n“I had relaxers for a long time, so it could still impact me,” says Eady, who works as a diversity leader at a nonprofit in Cleveland, Ohio. “I’m 38 and I don’t have a child. So when I saw it, I was like ‘damn, could this be the reason’? I’ve not been trying to get pregnant, but I’ve not been trying not to get pregnant either.”\n\nThe study leaves women who use the products questioning whether to reduce their usage or stop it altogether.\n\nIt also reinforces a dilemma facing many Black women, some of whom use hair-straightening products to conform to White standards of beauty. Research has shown Black women with natural hairstyles – including afros, twists, braids and dreadlocks – can face racial discrimination in the workplace.\n\nSo what to do? Go natural and potentially harm your career? Or straighten your hair and risk your health?\n\nSome Black women say they feel social and economic pressure to straighten their hair\n\nThe research published Monday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found a connection between using certain hair straighteners, such as chemical relaxers and pressing products, and an increased risk of uterine cancer – the most common cancer of the female reproductive system.\n\nThe association between hair-straightening products and uterine cancer cases was most pronounced for Black women, who made up 7.4% of the study participants but almost 60% of those who reported ever using straighteners.\n\n“The bottom line is that the exposure burden appears higher among Black women,” says Chandra Jackson, an author of the study and researcher at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\n\nThe findings follow a similar study in 2019 that linked use of permanent hair dye and chemical hair straighteners to a higher risk of breast cancer. The risk was more than six times higher for Black women.\n\nExperts say several factors lead women to use hair-straightening products, including Eurocentric standards of beauty and a desire for versatility in changing hairstyles and self-expression.\n\nResearch suggests hair straighteners contain chemicals that may be harmful. Adobe Stock\n\nBut some Black and Latina women also say they feel social pressure to wear their hair in a style that reduces microaggressions and discrimination in workplace settings.\n\nA 2020 Michigan State University study found about 80% of Black women say they alter their hair from its natural state because they consider it essential to social and economic success.\n\nStudies that same year by researchers at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business found that Black women with natural hairstyles are less likely to get job interviews than White women or Black women with straightened hair. Participants in the studies said they perceived natural Black hairstyles as less professional.\n\nBut with the health risks associated with hair-straightening chemicals, the choice for some women comes down to picking the lesser of two evils, says Nsenga Burton, a cultural critic and co-director of film and media management concentration at Emory University.\n\n“Black women should not have to choose between elevating dominant standards of beauty in order to stay employed and risking their lives to do so,” Burton says. “It’s more than a catch-22 – it’s madness and discrimination.”\n\nBurton says that while attitudes are shifting and people are becoming more accepting of Black natural hairstyles, bias continues to be an issue in the workplace.\n\nBurton went natural in the 2000s, and wears her hair in locs, a style in which individual strands of natural hair are twisted together. She plans to keep her hair that way.\n\n“If it may save your life, then that’s all the more reason to do it,” she says.\n\nOne author says attitudes about natural hair are changing\n\nJasmine Cobb, professor of African and African American Studies at Duke University and author of “New Growth, The Art and Texture of Black Hair,” wonders whether glorifying straight hair is a remnant of a culture that’s long since shifted. Cobb says she stopped putting chemicals on her hair in the 2000s.\n\n“I question whether straightening hair still comes with social benefits in the 21st century, or if we are holding on to ideas about the value of straight hair from more than 50 years ago,” she says.\n\nEither way, one concept has not evolved much, she says: “Society continues to promote long and flowing locks, whether hair is straight or textured.”\n\nThe normalization of long, straight hair starts at an early age – even from childhood cartoons, says Keisha L. Bentley-Edwards, an associate professor of medicine at Duke University.\n\nBentley-Edwards says she cut her hair short years ago and then later switched to dreadlocks. Most people were more comfortable with her locs – because they were long and flowing – than with her short hair, she says.\n\nMany Black women prefer more natural hairstyles -- although those can come with their own pitfalls. Adobe Stock\n\nBut one thing that has changed since both women started to wear their natural hair about two decades ago is the wealth of resources available now for people who opt to go natural – including new natural products and social media influencers who promote natural beauty.\n\nAnd in 2019, US legislators drafted the CROWN Act, which prohibits racial discrimination based on hairstyles and hair texture, including braids, locs or twists. At least 18 US states, including New York, California and Maryland, have passed the law, whose name stands for Create a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair.\n\nWith studies linking hair-straightening products to health risks, the act’s legal protections cannot come fast enough, experts say.\n\nA 2016 study by the Environmental Working Group found that one in 12 beauty and personal care products marketed to African-American women in the US contained “highly hazardous ingredients.” The report cited relaxers, hair colors and bleachers as the most dangerous products.\n\n“The evidence about the chemical impact of straightening is growing and starting to outweigh the presumed social benefits attributed to straightened hair,” Cobb says. “The devastation of cancer outweighs the stress of satisfying shifting societal norms around beauty.”\n\nSome women say straight hair is more ‘manageable’\n\nSome women maintain they straighten their hair for reasons unrelated to conforming to a specific standard of beauty.\n\nMercy Owusu, an NGO consultant from Ghana based in the Finnish city of Espoo, says she applies relaxer on her hair regularly to make it easier to manage.\n\n“Most times, I love to hold it in a ponytail and I can’t do that with my natural hair – it won’t look as neat since I have very tough hair,” she says.\n\nMercy Owusu Courtesy Mercy Owusu\n\nOwusu says she hasn’t paid much attention in the past to studies linking hair chemicals to cancer. Part of the reason she’s continued straightening her hair is the lack of resources to manage natural hair, she says.\n\nBut after hearing of the latest study, Owusu says she plans to reduce the number of times she relaxes her hair. And she will not be using any chemicals on her 8-year-old daughter’s hair, she says.\n\nCobb, however, disagrees with the notion that Black hair is not manageable without hair-care products.\n\n“Why do we believe Black hair, in its natural state, is unmanageable?” she says. “Straightening hair costs time and money, especially for upkeep. When we say straight hair is more manageable, we are discounting the costs and the physical consequences associated with a regular straightening regimen.”\n\nFor Black women, these health concerns add another complication to daily life\n\nBentley-Edwards, the Duke professor, says the recent study should give Black women pause, especially those with additional risk factors such as family history of reproductive cancers. She said that in a 2011 study, researchers also found a relationship between hair relaxers and uterine fibroids, or tumors.\n\n“More needs to be understood in how hair-straightener ingredients interact with the reproductive system, and other aspects of health,” she says. “What are the biological mechanisms at play?”\n\nAll the women CNN spoke to say the new study’s findings are a major concern, for many reasons.\n\nAnd they say the research adds another layer of complication for Black women in America, who sometimes must make compromises just to stay afloat.\n\n“I don’t think we’ve ever not taken these studies seriously,” Eady says. “We’ve just done what we needed to do to survive. And sometimes that means changing who we are to be able to matriculate through life. It’s a survival tool.”", "authors": ["Faith Karimi", "One Author Says Attitudes About Natural Hair Are Changing"], "publish_date": "2022/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/17/football/brands-sponsors-david-beckham-world-cup-2022-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Brand it like Beckham: How has this World Cup affected the 'brands ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTraditionally billions of viewers watch the World Cup, and as they concentrate on what is happening on the pitch, the names of some of the world’s biggest companies flash behind the players on a rolling, technicolored loop – Budweiser, Visa, Coca-Cola, Qatar Airways, Adidas, McDonalds, Wanda, Vivo, Hyundai Kia.\n\nBut Qatar 2022 is different. Many of these brands, particularly those with Western world roots, have become caught in the geopolitical crosshairs of this tournament, balancing their sponsorship with criticisms levelled at FIFA, soccer’s world governing body, and Qatar, the host, notably around human rights issues.\n\nNot that it is affecting FIFA’s bottom line.\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino said on Friday at a news conference that the organization has earned a record $7.5 billion in revenue through commercial deals tied to the 2022 World Cup, $1 billion more than what it earned from the 2018 World Cup.\n\nAnd during the next cycle building up to the 2026 World Cup held in the United States, Mexico and Canada, Infantino forecasts a revenue of $11 billion.\n\nIt is not just companies who have aligned their ‘brand’ to this World Cup.\n\nThere are many ex-players, including Tim Cahill, Cafu, Samuel Eto’o and Xavi, who have accepted ambassador roles for the tournament.\n\nMost prominently, David Beckham has been criticized for becoming a tournament ambassador, facing accusations that it could tarnish his own ‘brand.’\n\nBeckham has been a high-profile ambassador of the Qatar World Cup. David Ramos/FIFA/Getty Images\n\nBeckham’s brand is arguably as recognizable as many multinationals. As well as his ambassadorship with Qatar, Beckham has endorsements with Adidas, the Tudor watch brand and his own whiskey brand, Haig Club. Beckham is also part of the ownership team at MLS soccer club Inter Miami.\n\n“I think when engaging in any form of commercial relationship, but certainly a sponsorship or an endorsement [or] an ambassadorial role, carries with it geopolitical risk,” Simon Chadwick, professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, tells CNN Sport.\n\n‘Big global brands’\n\nEver since it was named in 2010 as the host nation of the 2022 World Cup, Qatar’s human rights record has been in the spotlight – from the death and conditions endured by migrant workers to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nMuch of the criticism towards FIFA and Qatar has come from countries more able to freely do so, in Western Europe and North America, but only a fraction of the tournament’s sponsors are headquartered in these regions.\n\nBrands associated with these countries, such as Adidas or McDonald’s, have consumer bases all around the world, encompassing consumers with varying freedoms to criticize human rights issues.\n\n“When the marketing teams within these big global brands are looking at the split of their customer base, ethical consumers in Western Europe or in North America, as an example, only form a part of that. And they would have gone into the tournament knowing that,” Ben Peppi, head of sports services at JMW Solicitors, tells CNN Sport.\n\nFIFA’s shift towards companies based outside of Western Europe and North America was accelerated by the exodus of some sponsors following the 2015 corruption scandal involving FIFA, but also reflects the globalization of Asian consumer brands, Peppi adds.\n\nWanda, a conglomerate based in China, Qatar Airways and Qatar Energy all belong to FIFA’s top tier of sponsors and are unlikely to be balancing the same brand perception dilemmas as their Western counterparts.\n\nWanda's logo is visible behind Morocco's Yassine Bounou during his team's quarterfinal against Portugal. Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images\n\nAs Chadwick points out, Qatar Airways is state owned and “not going to start engaging in a consumer activism campaign against its own government.”\n\nThe four Chinese brands that sponsor the tournament – Wanda, Vivo, Mengniu Dairy and Hisense – are unlikely to take a particularly strident activist stance on an issue such as LGBTQ rights since that “turns a spotlight on China,” Chadwick adds.\n\nSome brands, however, have addressed the human rights issues surrounding Qatar 2022. Denmark’s kit manufacturer Hummel provided the team with “toned down” kits in response to the alleged human rights violations that have occurred in Qatar, although FIFA later forbade the Danish national team from wearing these shirts at the World Cup.\n\nMeanwhile, German supermarket chain Rewe ended its partnership with the German Football Association after FIFA’s decision to punish players wearing “OneLove” armbands that aimed to promote inclusivity.\n\nBut aside from these examples – notably taken by national team sponsors rather than tournament sponsors – companies have remained relatively quiet during this month-long competition, one of the biggest, most lucrative events in sport.\n\nFIFA divides its tournament sponsors into three tiers – “partners” composed of Coca-Cola, Adidas, Visa, Wanda, Qatar Airways, Qatar Energy and Hyundai Kia; “World Cup sponsors,” including Budweiser, McDonald’s, Mengniu Dairy and Hisense; and “regional supporters.”\n\n“The reality is, a lot of [FIFA’s partners] have stayed very quiet,” Peppi says.\n\n“The FIFA World Cup is one of the most valuable pieces of intellectual property within sport, if not the most valuable and, as a result of that, is very tightly controlled and governed,” Peppi adds.\n\nIn July, three human rights organizations – Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Fair Square – wrote to FIFA’s 14 corporate partners and World Cup sponsors “urging them to call on the football body to remedy abuses of migrant workers linked to preparations for the World Cup.”\n\nIt is difficult to verify how many migrant workers have died as a result of work done on projects connected to the tournament.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nIn an interview with Piers Morgan, which aired on TalkTV in November, Hassan Al-Thawadi, Secretary General of the Supreme Committee, an organization charged with organizing the World Cup, said that between 400 and 500 migrant workers have died as a result of work done on projects connected to the tournament – a greater figure than Qatari officials have cited previously.\n\nAl-Thawadi said in the same interview that three migrant workers had died in incidents directly connected with construction of World Cup stadiums, and 37 deaths were attributed to other reasons.\n\nAccording to Amnesty, four sponsors – AB InBev/Budweiser, Adidas, Coca-Cola, and McDonald’s – stated their support for financial compensation to migrant workers and their families who suffered death or injury, wage theft or debt from illegal recruitment while preparing the tournament.\n\nThe other 10, Amnesty says, did not respond to written requests to discuss tournament-related abuses.\n\nCoca-Cola sponsor the World Cup Trophy Tour. Karim Sahib/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCNN has reached out to McDonald’s, Hyundai, Visa, Budweiser, Qatar Airways, Wanda and Vivo for comment as to how they balance these sponsorship campaigns in relation to the discussion of human rights’ issues surrounding Qatar 2022, but at the time of publication had not yet received a response.\n\nHowever, Adidas told CNN that it had “been engaged with partners – including the Qatari government, the Supreme Committee for the delivery of the World Cup, the International Labor Organization (ILO), international human rights and labor advocacy groups, and trade unions – to improve the human rights situation. The progress achieved includes the establishment of an independent ILO office as a local monitoring body, strengthening the rights of migrant workers and a national minimum wage.”\n\nCoca-Cola said in a statement to CNN that “it has played an instrumental role in the creation of the FIFA Human Rights Advisory Board, the first such entity created by a global sports governing body.”\n\n“Today, we continue to work with FIFA and the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy to build on Qatar’s development of a regulatory and remedy framework for the protection of migrant worker rights…While these efforts have been groundbreaking, we recognize that more can be done to ensure respect for the human rights of all workers involved in the Qatar World Cup, including providing effective remedy to those who are unable to access avenues for redress.”\n\n‘Now Beckham’s brand is not consumer brands’\n\nFormer England captain David Beckham is another ex-player who has performed an ambassadorial role for Qatar 2022. Beckham’s association with this World Cup was brutally put under the spotlight by British comedian Joe Lycett, who last month challenged the widely held assumption that the former England captain was an LGBTQ ally.\n\n“Beckham was the commercialization of late 20th century sports personified. If he was doing then what he’s doing now, I would be concerned about the value of his brand but … now, he’s a sports entrepreneur, and his brand is not consumer brands,” Chadwick says.\n\n“He’s trying to market himself to decision makers and financiers who are involved in elite professional sport around the world. What he’s interested in is making sure that his [Inter Miami] franchise in the United States is financially sustainable.”\n\nBeckham’s spokesperson told CNN via a statement Friday that: “David has been involved in a number of World Cups and other major international tournaments both as a player and an ambassador and he’s always believed that sport has the power to be a force for good in the world.”\n\n“We hope that these conversations will lead to greater understanding and empathy towards all people and that progress will be achieved.”\n\nSome brands sponsoring the Qatar World Cup drape their logos in rainbow flags and run inclusive campaigns during Pride Month – when LGTBQ communities celebrate the freedom to be themselves – as a show of support towards LGBTQ people.\n\nJoe Lycett posted a video of himself apparently shredding £10,000 ($12,000) in protest against David Beckham.\n\nCoca-Cola was an official sponsor of London and Brighton Pride 2022. Earlier this year, the Visa Everywhere Initiative LGBTQ+ Special Edition Competition recognized LGBTQ+ founders transforming the FinTech Industry.\n\nAdidas has produced rainbow clothing ranges for Pride; McDonald’s has committed itself to “supporting and championing the LGBTQ+ community during Pride and beyond”; Budweiser has produced Pride cups; while Hyundai-Kia said in an advert that it supports “the journey of the LGBTQ+ community. Not just during Pride Month, but 365 days a year.”\n\nAdidas said in a statement to CNN that: “We have strongly advocated for unrestricted access for all visitors regardless of nationality, religion, sexual orientation or ethnic background. We expect the World Cup to be fully accessible to all visitors. If there are any infringements, we are pursuing the matter.”\n\nCoca-Cola said in a statement to CNN that it strives for “diversity, inclusion and equality in our business, and we support these rights throughout society as well. Our experience has shown that change takes time and must be achieved through sustained collaboration and active involvement.

She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery.\n\nFacts: Brown was a social reformer and educator who traveled the Oregon Trail and assisted in the founding of Tualatin Academy, which became Pacific University in Forest Grove. She turned to teaching to support four children after her husband, a minister, died. She was 66 when she crossed the plains in 1846 with her son and suffered much hardship. At one point on the journey, she was left alone on the trail in the bitter cold with her ailing 77-year-old brother-in-law. She pulled them through, despite being near starvation. Once in Oregon, she traveled between Oregon City and her daughter's home in Salem, and eventually settled in Forest Grove. Her first job was sewing gloves to sell. She later helped start a home and school for orphan children and became affectionately known as \"Grandma Brown.\" The log church she used for the school was officially established as Tualatin Academy in 1848, and the following year became what is now Pacific University.\n\nNotable: Honored in 1987 by the Oregon Legislature as the \"Mother of Oregon.\"\n\nQuotable: \"I rode through (the Umpqua Mountains) in three days at the risk of my life, on horseback, having lost my wagon and all that I had but the horse I was on.\"\n\nSOURCES: Pacific University, Salem Online History, RootsWeb.com, The Brown Family History II\n\nAbigail Scott Duniway\n\nBorn: Oct. 22, 1834, near Groveland, Ill.\n\nDied: Oct. 11, 1915. She is buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nFacts: Duniway was a novelist, newspaper publisher, teacher, pioneer, milliner and suffragist. She came to Oregon in 1852 and wrote a novel based on the overland experience. Her mother and brother died during the grueling trek. Her family settled near Lafayette, where she began a career as a schoolteacher. She married Benjamin Duniway, and they had four children spaced less than two years apart. She endured the loss of their Yamhill County farm because of her husband's faulty business decisions. Later, he became an invalid. In order to support the family, she returned to teaching as well as running a hat shop in Albany. Her experiences convinced her that women needed the right to vote. She campaigned for suffrage throughout the Northwest, and in 1871, started a newspaper in Portland called The New Northwest. She masterminded the suffrage campaigns in Idaho and Washington, but her efforts to win the right to vote in her home state proved more demanding. From 1884 to 1910, Oregon's male voters defeated suffrage five times at the polls. Finally, in 1912, the initiative passed. She was the first woman to register to vote in Multnomah County.\n\nNotable: Duniway was the first woman to speak before the Oregon Legislature and the state's first woman publisher.\n\nQuotable: \"The young women of today, free to study, to speak, to write, to choose their occupation, should remember that every inch of this freedom was bought for them at a great price.

She is buried at Ocean View Cemetery in Warrenton.\n\nFacts: A physician, teacher, feminist and social reformer, she was the first woman west of the Mississippi to hold a medical degree. Her family crossed the Oregon Trail in 1843, and she did not begin her formal education until she was 12. She was married at 14 to one of her father's farm hands but divorced her abusive husband by 16. She turned to millinery to earn her living and raise her son, George, who also became a doctor. Her business was successful, but after six years she decided to pursue a career in medicine. She attended an eclectic school in Philadelphia and then University of Michigan Medical School, finishing her degree in 1880, at age 40. She returned to Portland the following year and became the first woman to practice in Oregon. She married Col. John Adair in 1884, and the couple moved to Astoria, where she continued to practice medicine and help with the family farm.\n\nNotable: She thought insanity and criminal action were hereditary and argued for mandatory sterilization of the criminally insane. Her famous work on the subject, \"Human Sterilization: Its Social and Legislative Aspects,\" was published in 1922. Three years later, the sterilization statute was adopted as state law in Oregon.\n\nQuotable: She was not afraid to drive great distances alone in her carriage to reach a patient. \"At no time did I ever refuse a call, day or night, rain or shine.\"\n\nSources: Oregon Historical Society, Findagrave.com, Dameron-Damron family newsletter\n\nLola Greene Baldwin\n\nBorn: 1860\n\nDied: June 22, 1957. Buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nFacts: On April 1, 1908, she was sworn in as the first female police officer in the United States. Her primary mission was to protect young women from prostitution. She began this type of work in 1905 as an employee of Portland's branch of the Traveler's Aid organization during the Lewis and Clark Exposition. The goal of the organization was to encourage women who flocked to the city to avoid the pitfalls of prostitution. Her unit with the Portland Police Bureau, the Women's Protection Division, made a priority of protecting women from the effects of vice, rather than punishing them for it. She reportedly maintained an office away from the police department and declined to work in uniform. She also was involved in organizing a juvenile court in Portland. On May 1, 1922, she resigned her commission after influencing local, regional and national women's policing activities for 17 years, 14 of them as a paid municipal officer.\n\nNotable: To learn about Baldwin, read \"A Municipal Mother,\" by Gloria E. Myers. A Portland-based foundation that helps women who are recovering from prostitution is named in her honor.\n\nQuotable: Baldwin's goal was \"to make the path safe for the feet of the girl who desired to lead a clean, honest, useful life.\"\n\nSources: Lola Greene Baldwin Foundation, \"A Municipal Mother\"\n\nMercedes Deiz\n\nBorn: 1917\n\nDied: Oct. 5, 2005, in Portland\n\nFacts: She became the first black female lawyer in Oregon when she was admitted to the bar in 1960. She attended Northwestern School of Law at night while married and raising three children and working as a legal assistant. She finished fourth in her class and years later credited her husband with taking a large part in raising their children. \"I am not a dependent woman,\" she said. \"But I could not have done the things I did without Carl.\" In November 1969, then-Gov. Tom McCall appointed her as a district court judge, making her the first woman of color to become a judge in Oregon. The following May, in the primary, Multnomah County voters elected her to the post outright and she became the first black woman to be elected to the bench in Oregon. Oregon Women Lawyers give an annual award in her name to someone who makes an outstanding contribution to promoting women and minorities in the legal profession and in the community.\n\nNotable: In 2000, on the 40th anniversary of her admission to the bar, she was recognized with the Award of Merit, the Oregon State Bar's highest honor.\n\nQuotable: \"Black has nothing to do with the color of the skin; it's a question of ethnicity.

Buried at Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Duerksen was one of the founders of Deaconess Hospital, a predecessor of Salem Hospital. A group of Mennonites came to Salem in 1916 and opened a 12-bed hospital in an old hotel on Winter Street. Sister Anna, a graduate of Evangelical Deaconess Hospital School of Nursing in St. Louis, Mo., was one of four Mennonite sisters on the Board of Trustees. The sisters worked 20-hour days and received no salary until Social Security was launched in 1935. To them, it was a calling, not a job. Duerksen served as the hospital's only anesthetist. She lived in the basement and not only cared for patients, but cooked and did housekeeping. She married the hospital's gardener and worked at the hospital into the 1950s. In 1947, the Mennonites turned the hospital over to a board of Salem citizens, and the name was changed to Salem Memorial Hospital. It merged in 1969 with Salem General Hospital to create the hospital that exists today.\n\nNotable: In 1957, Duerksen was recognized by the Oregon Nurses Association with a life membership for her long leadership in providing health care.\n\nQuotable: Her legacy is well-documented in the annals of Salem Hospital. Ted Stang, a longtime local hospital administrator, met Duerksen after he came to Salem in 1968. She was in her 80s. He also heard many stories from the grandson of Deaconess Hospital's first administrator. \"She was diminutive, quiet, unassuming,\" Stang said. \"But boy, was she a powerhouse. People listened to what Sister Anna had to say, even though she was not the administrator. Sister Anna carried a lot of weight at that institution.\"\n\nSources: Salem History Online, Oregon Statesman, Salem Hospital\n\nSarah Winnemucca\n\nBorn: About 1844\n\nDied: Oct. 17, 1891\n\nFacts: Historians have referred to Winnemucca as the most famous Native American woman on the Pacific Coast. She used her language skills to try to be a peacemaker and was the first Native American woman to publish in English. Her book, \"Life Among the Piutes: Their Wrongs and Claims,\" is an autobiographical account of her people and their contact with explorers and settlers. She was born and raised in Nevada but spent much of her life in southeastern Oregon as an interpreter for an agent at Malheur Reservation and as a scout and mediator for the Army during the Bannock War. She learned to read and write when her grandfather placed her in the home of a white family in Nevada. By the time she was 14, she could speak three Indian dialects, English and Spanish. She married at least twice, to an Army lieutenant and then an Indian Department employee. After the Bannock War, she received national attention by campaigning for Native American education programs and reservation reform — making more than 400 speeches. She even pleaded her cause to President Rutherford B. Hayes in Washington, D.C., where she reportedly received promises that were later broken. Winnemucca also opened and ran the first school in the West where Native American children could remain with their families and were not forced to stop speaking their native language.\n\nNotable: On March 9, 2005, a bronze statue of her representing Nevada was unveiled in the National Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. A town in Nevada carries her family name.\n\nQuotable: \"I would place all the Indians of Nevada on ships in our harbor, take them to New York and land them there as immigrants, that they might be received with open arms ...\"\n\nSources: Oregon Historical Society, Wikipedia, \"Native Peoples\"\n\nChloe Clarke Willson\n\nBorn: April 16, 1818, in Connecticut.\n\nDied: July 2, 1874. She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Willson was the first teacher at the Oregon Institute, which was founded by Methodist missionaries and later became Willamette University. She devoted her life to bringing religion and education to Oregon, and particularly to educating the young women of Salem. She traveled with about 50 new missionary recruits to the Oregon Territory in 1839. The following year, at a new mission outpost in the Puget Sound, she met her husband, William H. Willson. In 1844, the couple was asked to move to the settlement called Chemeketa Plains, which would become Salem. Chloe had been chosen to open the Oregon Institute.\n\nShe was both teacher and housemother for five primary-grade students and remained the only teacher the first two years. The board of the institute chartered \"Wallamet University\" in 1853 and began offering higher education. Chloe left Salem for a time after her husband died, but she returned in 1863 to serve as Governess of the Ladies Department at Willamette University, the equivalent of Dean of Women.\n\nNotable: Her husband is remembered as the founder of Salem because he filed the first plat of the city and held the original title to the land that now comprises Willamette University, the state Capitol and downtown Salem. Their name lives on today in Willson Park, directly west of the Capitol.\n\nQuotable: \"I feel the weight of responsibility which rests upon me in giving character to this infant institution,\" she wrote on Aug. 13, 1844, the first day of classes at the Oregon Institute. \"O my Father ... thou seest the desire of my heart for the prosperity of this institution, but without thy blessing it can never prosper.\"\n\nSources: Salem Online History, \"Journals of Brewer and Clarke\"\n\nHallie Parrish Hinges\n\nBorn: Jan. 30, 1868.\n\nDied: Jan. 25, 1950. She is buried at Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Hinges was a vocal performer in Oregon for nearly 60 years, most famous for her performance during President Theodore Roosevelt's visit to Salem on May 21, 1903. Roosevelt called her the \"Oregon Nightingale\" when he heard her sing, and the nickname stuck. She studied music at Willamette University, graduating from the Willamette Conservatory when she was 18. She also studied in New York for a year. Music always was a big part of her life. She performed at her first public concert when she was 6, in the basement of First Methodist Church. Her audiences later expanded to political dignitaries. In 1891, she sang for President Benjamin Harrison, and in 1900, she performed for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan. But her biggest moment came when Roosevelt visited Salem. Thousands gathered at Willson Park to see the president. Before he spoke, the 35-year-old soprano sang the national anthem. Roosevelt told Gov. George Chamberlain that Hinges had one of the most beautiful voices he had ever heard and asked if she would sing again. Hinges responded with a favorite of the time, \"The Flag Without a Stain,\" and witnesses claimed that the president wiped tears from his eyes.\n\nQuotable: \"Truly, she is the Oregon Nightingale,\" Roosevelt said.\n\nNotable: Hinges' grandfather was Methodist missionary Josiah L. Parrish, whom Parrish Middle School is named after.\n\nSource: The Statesman Journal, Salem Online History, \"Marion County History,\" Volume XV\n\nThelma Payne Sanborn\n\nBorn: July 18, 1896, in Silverton\n\nDied: Sept. 7, 1988, in Los Angeles\n\nFacts: She was the first Oregon woman to compete in the Olympics and the first to win a medal. She won the bronze in the 3-meter springboard diving competition at the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, Belgium. The U.S. swept the medals in that event, with Payne missing silver by seven-tenths of a point. She was the U.S. women's springboard champion in 1918, 1919 and 1920, and trained at Multnomah Athletic Club in Portland. She reportedly incorporated ballet into her training regimen. After competing in the Olympics, she was a longtime swimming and diving coach at the Los Angeles Athletic Club. She taught the children of several famous people to swim, including John Wayne and Bing Crosby. Payne was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of fame in 1983, among one of the early classes that included Bobby Doerr, Mel Renfro and Steve Prefontaine.\n\nNotable: Sanborn said in a 1987 interview that she was one of the models for the red-suited diving girl introduced by Jantzen in 1920 and later plastered on billboards.\n\nQuotable: \"In those days, we had nothing to go by. We had to actually see someone perform a dive and then try to do it ourselves. It was the only way.\"\n\nSources: Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles, The Associated Press, Oregon Sports Hall of Fame\n\nCornelia Marvin Pierce\n\nBorn: Dec. 26, 1873, in Monticello, Iowa\n\nDied: Feb. 12, 1957\n\nFacts: Marvin was the leader of the Oregon State Library for 24 years, almost singlehandedly building one of the finest state library systems in the nation. She came to Oregon in 1905 for the position of secretary of the Oregon Library Commission, which later became the State Library. She instituted many innovative programs, including the first books-by-mail service in the country. In a day when many Oregonians lived isolated lives without telephones, newspapers and other regular sources of information, her innovation was a lifeline for thousands of rural Oregonians, particularly women. She resigned as State Librarian in 1928 to marry Gov. Walter M. Pierce. He was elected in 1932 to Congress, and she became his secretary, researcher and speech writer. Their political partnership was one he readily recognized, often reminding his constituents that they had two representatives for the price of one.\n\nQuotable: \"The only thing I have ever done to make the world a better place to live is to promote libraries.\"\n\nNotable: At the end of her life, she bequeathed most of her estate to Reed College, a private Portland liberal-arts school. The $300,000 gift still supports a Cornelia Marvin Pierce chairmanship in American history at Reed.\n\nSources: \"Cornelia Marvin Pierce: Pioneer in Library Extension,\" \"Library Trends,\" Oregon State Library\n\nMaurine Brown Neuberger\n\nBorn: Jan. 9, 1907, in Cloverdale, Tillamook County.\n\nDied: Feb. 22, 2000, in Portland.\n\nFacts: She remains the first and only woman from Oregon to serve in the U.S. Senate. She and her husband, Richard, were known as a political team. They gained notice in 1951 as the first married couple in the nation to serve together in a legislature — he in the Oregon Senate and she in the House. He won a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1954, and she served as his aide. When he died from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1960, she won a special election to fill the vacancy and then the general election to serve the next term. She focused on environmental and health issues, including sponsorship of one of the first bills to require warning labels on cigarette packaging. Back home, she took on Oregon's then-powerful dairy industry about a law forbidding the sale of yellow margarine. She donned a striped apron, pulled out a mixing bowl and showed her colleagues in the House — all men — just how much work it took to mix food coloring into the lard-white butter substitute. The ban was lifted, and her demonstration became part of the state's political lore.\n\nQuotable: \"Before she puts her name on the ballot, she encounters prejudice and people saying, 'A women's place is in the home.' She has to walk a very tight wire in conducting her campaign. She can't be too pussyfooting or mousy. Also, she can't go to the other extreme — belligerent, coarse, nasty.\"\n\nNotable: After serving in the U.S. Senate, she taught at Boston University and Radcliffe and was part of the social and academic circle surrounding the Kennedy family.\n\nSources: Oregon History Project, Harvard Square Library\n\nMercedes Bates\n\nBorn: 1916\n\nDied: Aug. 16, 1997, in Minneapolis\n\nFacts: Bates is one of the most important women to graduate from Oregon State University. She is credited with helping make Betty Crocker a household name. She was a vice president of the General Mills food company, in charge of the Betty Crocker division. The fictional character was created in 1921 and evolved into an American cultural icon under Bates' direction. After graduating from Oregon State in 1936 with a degree in food and nutrition, Bates began working at the Southern California Gas Co. and became supervisor of home service. She then moved to the Globe Mills food company before opening her own business in Hollywood as an advertising food consultant. She later joined the staff of McCall's magazine as food editor before moving to General Mills in 1964 as director of the Betty Crocker kitchens. Two years later, she rose through the ranks to become vice president and the first female corporate officer of General Mills. She held that title until retiring in 1983.\n\nNotable: She donated $3 million to Oregon State in the early 1990s, helping establish a nationally renowned Bates Family Study Center on campus. At that time, it was the largest one-time donation ever made to OSU. The facility opened in 1992 and was the first of its kind in the United States. It houses programs of research, instruction and outreach designed to benefit individuals and families.\n\nSources: Oregon State University, OSU Alumni Association\n\nNan Wood Honeyman\n\nBorn: July 15, 1881.\n\nDied: Dec. 10, 1970.

She was a state representative from 1935 to 1937 before being elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Congress. Her bids for re-election in 1938 and election in 1940 failed. While working in the Pacific Coast office of the U.S. Price Administration, the Multnomah County commissioners appointed Honeyman to the Oregon Senate in 1941 to fill a vacancy, and she served until her resignation in 1942. She was U.S. collector of customs in Portland from 1942 to 1953.\n\nNotable: After graduating in 1898 from St. Helens Hall (later incorporated in the Oregon Episcopal School), she continued her education at the Finch School in New York City, where she began a lifelong friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nSources: Oregon Blue Book, Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\n\nCarolyn Shelton\n\nBorn: Around 1877.\n\nDied: Unknown.\n\nFacts: Shelton was governor for a day in 1909, according to the Capital Journal. The newspaper ran a banner headline proclaiming her head of state Feb. 27, 1909, following the resignation of Gov. George E. Chamberlain and the delay in swearing in Secretary of State Frank W. Benson, the next in line. Chamberlain resigned his seat after being elected to the U.S. Senate. In a hurry to get to Washington, D.C., he left his resignation with his private secretary, Shelton, about 9 a.m. that Saturday. The papers weren't to be filed until 4 p.m. Monday, and Benson couldn't be sworn in right away, so there effectively was no governor except Shelton. The Capital Journal pronounced her \"the first woman to govern any state.\" The newspaper reported Sunday that Benson assumed control at 10:10 a.m. Nowhere in state records is Shelton mentioned as governor. Barbara Roberts officially would become the first female governor of Oregon when she was elected and served from 1991 to 1995.\n\nQuotable: \"I want to fill the governor's shoes, and he really has a small foot,\" Shelton was quoted as saying in the Capital Journal. \"I fear the principal trouble will be in trying to fill his hat.\"\n\nNotable: \"Time\" magazine reported July 26, 1926, that Chamberlain, 72, married Carolyn B. Shelton, 49, in Norfolk, Va. Shelton was clerk to the Senate Military Affairs Committee when Chamberlain was chairman during World War I.

She left Salem after graduating at age 22, and launched her practice in the small Eastern Oregon town of Condon, where her brother and future governor of Oregon, Jay Bowerman, practiced law. Purvine returned to Salem after four years and began a medical practice specializing in obstetrics. She and her husband, Ellis, had three children. Her son, Ralph, followed in her footsteps and became a doctor. Mary Purvine was a member of the staffs at Salem General and Salem Memorial hospitals. She maintained a practice in Salem for more than half a century, working for many years out of her home on University Street SE. She practiced medicine until she was well into her 70s.\n\nNotable: Her book, \"Pioneer Doctor,\" was published in 1958.\n\nQuotable: \"Woman doctors were few in the early days of my practice.

The Native American woman, who married a white settler named Frank Riddle, was rewarded a government pension of $25 per month for helping save lives during the Modoc War of 1872-73. She and her husband acted as interpreters, messengers and mediators between her people and the U.S. Army. She is perhaps best known for having warned Gen. Edward Canby about the Modoc plot to kill him during peace negotiations. The general ignored the advice and was killed April 11, 1873. On the same day, Winema was credited for saving the life of Alfred Meacham, a Methodist minister and the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Oregon. Meacham was wounded and about to be scalped when Winema yelled that the soldiers were coming, sending the Modoc warriors running. Meacham was the one who pressed Congress to give her a pension, which she received until she died.\n\nNotable: The Winema National Forest in Southern Oregon was established in 1961 and named after her.\n\nSources: Trover Studio collection, courtesy of the Oregon State Library\n\nElizabeth Lord and Edith Schryver\n\nElizabeth Lord\n\nBorn: Nov. 12, 1887, in Salem.\n\nDied: Oct. 9, 1976.

They designed more than 250 gardens from Eugene to Seattle. Schryver was considered the design genius and Lord the plant expert and businesswoman with connections. Lord grew up in Salem and was the daughter of a former Oregon governor, William Lord. Schryver grew up in New York and attended the Lowthrope School of Landscape Architecture in Massachusetts, where Lord also studied. A few years after Schryver graduated, she set sail for a garden tour of Europe, where she met Lord. The friends traveled and studied together for several months and then Lord brought Schryver to Salem.

She was editor of The Advocate, an African-American newspaper published in Portland between 1903 and 1936, regularly challenging racial discrimination and becoming the unofficial spokeswoman for the city's small black community. She helped found the Portland chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, known as the NAACP, and craft the state's first civil-rights legislation, which would have mandated full access to public accommodations without regard to race. Although that piece of legislation failed, in 1925 she worked on the successful campaign to repeal Oregon's notorious exclusion laws, which prohibited African Americans from settling in the state.\n\nQuotable: \"Not even the pulpit has been as effective for the advancement of our group, and for justice, as the press.\"\n\nNotable: She ran for state representative in May 1932 but was not elected.

She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Corbett.\n\nFacts: Green was a Democrat in the United States Congress who helped push through legislation that led to Title IX. A former school teacher, radio commentator and lobbyist, she became an important figure in Oregon politics when she was elected to Congress in 1955. She served 10 terms and focused on women's issues, education and social reforms. In her first term, she proposed the Equal Pay Act to ensure that men and women were paid equally for equal work. The bill was signed into law eight years later. She is most noted for her work developing the legislation that was to become Title IX, which prohibited sex discrimination in federally funded educational institutions. She introduced a higher-education bill that contained provisions regarding gender equity in education. The hearings on that bill, together with significant input from Rep. Patsy Mink and Sen. Birch Bayh, eventually resulted in the passage of Title IX in 1972.\n\nQuotable: Sen. Mark Hatfield called Green \"the most powerful woman ever to serve in the Congress.\"\n\nNotable: Linfield College annually presents the Edith Green Distinguished Professor award to a faculty member who has demonstrated outstanding performance in teaching and related faculty roles.

She is interred at City View Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Eyre was a revered educator who taught for 40 years at Salem High School. Among the 6,000 or so students who sat in her classes were current teachers and politicians, including retired U.S. Sen. Mark Hatfield. She was a strong role model for a generation of up-and-coming women including Norma Paulus, who praised Eyre's work for equal rights for women, open government meetings and the preservation of historic buildings. Eyre came to Salem in 1904, when she was 6. She graduated from Willamette University in 1918 and began her teaching career in Salem in 1922. She taught history and government, economics and sociology, retiring in 1962. In addition to her contributions as an educator, she was involved in local government. She was a precinct committee member and president of the local chapter of the League of Women Voters, and ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic candidate for the state Senate in 1962.\n\nQuotable: She said she ran for the legislative office because she \"wanted to try out some of the things I had been teaching over the years.\"\n\nNotable: The Salem-Keizer School District named an elementary school in her honor in 1977. Mary Eyre Elementary is in Southeast Salem.\n\nSources: Statesman Journal, Salem Online History\n\nFern Hobbs\n\nBorn: May 8, 1883\n\nDied: April 10, 1964\n\nFacts: Hobbs was sent by Gov. Oswald West in January 1914 to declare martial law in Copperfield, perhaps Oregon's most notorious \"bad\" town. Copperfield was established in 1908 to house the mining and railroad crews working at Snake River. It had three saloons, including one owned by the mayor and another by a city councilman, and a population of 84 when Hobbs was dispatched. West had vowed personally to clean up the vice-ridden town but was warned that he would be shot if he tried, so he sent his private secretary. Described as a diminutive woman — 5-foot-3 and less than 100 pounds — Hobbs arrived with a small National Guard contingent and read the governor's orders to close the saloons and resign from city council. The orders were refused, Hobbs left town that afternoon and the National Guard placed the town under martial law. More troops eventually arrived and confiscated liquor and gambling devices. The town, about 75 miles northeast of Baker City, later was destroyed by fire and today is known as Oxbow.\n\nSources: Oregon State Archives, The Oregon Journal, The Oregon Statesman\n\nMarie Dorion\n\nBorn: Unknown\n\nDied: Sept. 5, 1850. She was reportedly buried at St. Louis Catholic Church in Gervais.\n\nFacts: She was the only woman among the overland expedition financed by John Jacob Astor in 1811-12 to establish a fur-trading post at the mouth of the Columbia River. The courageous Native American accompanied her husband and two small children on the journey. Like her predecessor on the Lewis and Clark expedition, Sacagawea, Dorion earned respect from the men. She never complained about the hardships along the journey and kept pace despite caring for two children and giving birth to a third. The epitome of Dorion's courage was noted after the expedition had reached what would later be named Astoria. She and her family returned with a trapping party to the Snake River, where Indians attacked and killed all but her and her two sons. They escaped by hiding in the brush. In the wake of the tragedy, including the death of her husband, she and the boys survived more than 50 days in the bitter cold of the Blue Mountains.\n\nQuotable: Roger Howard, who lives near the church in Gervais, on the legend of Marie Dorion: \"She should be as famous as Sacagawea.\"\n\nSource: Statesman Journal\n\nBetty Roberts\n\nBorn: Feb. 5, 1923.\n\nNow: June 25, 2011.\n\nFacts: Roberts was the first woman appointed to the Oregon Court of Appeals (1977) and the first woman appointed to the Oregon Supreme Court (1982). She was married and raising four children in the 1950s, when she signed up for college courses and graduated from Portland State University in 1958. She taught high school and by 1962 had a master's degree in political science from the University of Oregon. She then enrolled in the night program at Northwestern School of Law at Lewis and Clark College, continued to teach and was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives. She graduated from law school in 1966, the same year one daughter graduated from Stanford University and a son from high school. She married a lawyer and legislative colleague two years later, and they established a successful legal practice. She then became the lone woman in the Oregon Senate and in 1974, ran a strong statewide campaign for governor but was narrowly defeated in the primary. The Democratic Party named her to fill a vacancy on the ballot for the general election against U.S. Sen. Bob Packwood, and again she was narrowly defeated. The Oregon Women's Political Caucus named her the 1975 \"Woman of the Year\" for setting a precedent for other women to run for statewide office.\n\nNotable: She helped found Women's Investment Network-PAC to recruit and support women to run for the Legislature and Oregon Women Lawyers to promote women and minorities in the profession.

She was active in her neighborhood association and the local transit district board before running for office. She defeated two sitting city councilors (one man and one woman) in the primary and then went on to serve three terms. Being the first female mayor didn't seem like a big deal at the time, perhaps because Norma Paulus had laid the groundwork for women to become political leaders in Salem. Paulus served in the Oregon Legislature before becoming the first woman in Oregon history to win a state office in 1976, when she was elected Secretary of State. \"If Norma hadn't been so successful,\" Miller said, \"it would have been a lot harder. She had kind of tilled that ground for others to follow, and I've always thanked her for that.\" As mayor, Miller was most noted for her work in helping the city purchase 22 acres of waterfront property on the Willamette River, which today is Riverfront Park.\n\nQuotable: \"It was an amazing privilege to be mayor of Salem. I will always be indebted to the people who allowed me to do that.\"\n\nNotable: She helped start Abiqua School, a private Salem elementary school that opened in 1993.\n\nSources: Sue Miller, Salem Online History\n\nMaj. Gen. Jeanne Holm, USAF\n\nBorn: June 23, 1921.\n\nDied: Feb. 15, 2010, in Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nFacts: Holm was the first female general in the Air Force and the first two-star general in the Armed Forces. A native Oregonian, she was among the first women to enlist in the military in 1942, in what was called the Women's Army Corps (WAC). She started as an Army truck driver but soon became an officer. She spent most of World War II training thousands of WACs. She left active duty after the war and went to Lewis & Clark College in her hometown of Portland. She then returned to active duty and joined the Air Force. She was the war plans officer at one of the major bases in Europe during the Berlin Airlift and began her rise through the ranks. She was Director of Women in the Air Force from 1965 to 1973. She was promoted to brigadier general in 1971, the first woman to be appointed to that grade in the Air Force. Two years later, she became the first woman in any branch of service to reach the rank of major general, or two-star general. She retired in 1975 after a 33-year career in the Air Force and went on to serve as Special Assistant on women's issues for President Gerald Ford. She also held positions during the Carter and Reagan administrations and is recognized as a driving force behind women achieving opportunities and equal rights in the military.\n\nNotable: Holm authored three books.\n\nQuotable: \"There was an enormous desire to be part of the war effort. My father had been in the Marine Corps in World War I. My two brothers already had been called to active duty, both in the Navy. I realized I would like to serve in the military if there was a way I could do it.\"\n\nSources: Veterans History Project, Air Force Link, Jeanne Holm, National Women's Hall of Fame\n\nNorma Paulus\n\nBorn: March 13, 1933.\n\nDied: Feb. 28, 2019. She is interred at Belcrest Memorial Park in Salem.\n\nFacts: Paulus was the first woman in Oregon history to win a state office in 1976, when she was elected Secretary of State. She served two terms and instituted the first vote-by-mail system in the nation. Her three decades as an elected official began in 1970, when she served in the Oregon Legislature. She sponsored environmental legislation, civil rights and ethical changes. She was the Republican candidate for governor in 1986, but lost in a closely-contested race to Neil Goldschmidt. Four years later, Paulus was elected Superintendent of Public Instruction and led a comprehensive restructuring of the state's public school system. She spearheaded work to set rigorous academic standards for all students and to increase accountability with state testing standards. In 1996, U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley named her to the National Assessment Governing Board. A New York Times profile described Paulus' work in Oregon as the most cutting-edge school reform in the country.\n\nQuotable: \"I know I have made government more accountable. It's been a really rewarding experience to be involved in Oregon's state government because in our state, one person can still make a difference.\"\n\nNotable: Paulus never went to college. She was admitted to Willamette Law School in 1956, based on her test scores and the personal recommendation of State Supreme Court Justice Earl C. Latourette. She was his private secretary, and he encouraged her to apply. She continued to work full time and graduated with honors in 1962.\n\nSources: Oregon Blue Book, Statesman Journal, Salem Online History\n\nBarbara Roberts\n\nBorn: Dec. 21, 1936, in Corvallis.\n\nNow: The Portland resident continues to serve on the boards of several nonprofit organizations.\n\nFacts: Roberts was inaugurated as Oregon's first woman governor on Jan. 14, 1991. The descendant of Oregon Trail pioneers and a fourth-generation Oregonian, she began her career in public service as an advocate for the educational rights of her autistic son. Her efforts resulted in one of the nation's first special-education laws and propelled her rise in politics to the governorship. She served on the Parkrose School Board, the Mt. Hood Community College Board and the Multnomah County Commission before her election to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1981. During her second term, she became Oregon's first woman House majority leader. In 1984, she was elected secretary of state, the first Democrat elected to that post in more than 100 years. She was re-elected in 1988. She ran unopposed in the Democratic primary for governor in 1990, and was elected to succeed Gov. Neil Goldschmidt. During her four-year term, Roberts was recognized as an advocate for public education, human rights and services, environmental management and streamlining state government.\n\nQuotable: \"You are looking at a woman who raised two children - one of them autistic - by herself. You are looking at a person who struggled for years to make ends meet. You are looking at a part-time student still working and committed to earning my college degree. And you are looking at a woman who got actively involved because she saw a wrong that needed to be righted. And today you are looking at the governor of the greatest state in the union. Am I proud? You bet I am. Will I make a difference for Oregon? I've never wished more for anything.\" - Excerpt from her inaugural address in 1991.\n\nNotable: During her term, Oregon was recognized in 1993 by financial World Magazine as the seventh-best managed state in the nation.

She lives in Portland.\n\nFacts: Allison was the first American woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest in 1988. She grew up in Woodburn and graduated from Oregon State University in 1984. Her first climbing lesson was on a 50-foot Douglas fir on the Corvallis campus, and she was hooked. She tackled rocks first, then mountains. She was part of the first successful women's ascent of Ama Dablam in 1983. From the summit, she could see the rising crest of Everest and set her sights on the world's tallest mountain. Her first attempt was unsuccessful because of a snowstorm that left the climbing party trapped in a snow cave for five days. But the following year, in 1988, she was triumphant. On Sept. 29, at the age of 29, after 29 days on the mountain, she made history by becoming the first American woman to stand on top of the 29,035-foot mountain. She went on to lead a successful expedition in 1993 at K2, the world's second tallest mountain.\n\nQuotable: \"Climbing has inspired me, shaped my life, and changed it. Climbing has given me confidence and strength. It has taught me how to be resourceful, how to challenge myself and trust myself enough to take risks.

Prior to entering politics, she enjoyed a career as a broadcast journalist. She graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in communications and worked for Oregon Public Radio and later for KVAL-TV in Eugene. Her political career began in 1996, when she was appointed by the Lane County commissioners to fill a vacancy in the Oregon Senate, then won re-election in 1998. She became vice-chairwoman of the Education Committee, dealing with such issues as charter schools, teacher tenure and school reform. She served in the Senate through 2002, and then was elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction. She held that office from 2003 to 2012, overseeing a department serving more than a half-million students in more than 1,200 schools. She was an advocate for students of color and those from low-income households, supporting increased Head Start coverage, full-day kindergarten, and English for second-language learners. After resigning, she joined the nonprofit education organization Project Lead the Way as its western regional vice president.\n\nQuotable: \"I grew up in a household where my mother dropped out in the eighth grade and was very challenged throughout her life on the kind of work that was available to her.

In some cases, she allegedly participated in the abuse herself.\n\nMaxwell's attorneys have said she \"is not Epstein.\" She's not. But many find her case equally horrifying, dismaying – and something else, too: confounding.\n\nThe Maxwell case shocks people because it defies stereotypes about predation, gender and class. Many don't think of women as perpetrators of sexual violence, especially not women who are part of the British aristocracy. But sexual violence experts say the case underscores how incorrect and incomplete our ideas are about how sexual abuse happens and who commits it.\n\n\"This is not a behavior that we associate with women. There's this understanding that women would protect other women, or that women would protect children, and that is unfortunately not the case,\" said Laura Palumbo, communications director at the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. \"People from all walks of life commit sexual abuse and harm.\"\n\nResearch on female perpetrators is limited. The Rape Abuse and Incest National Network said the Maxwell case has prompted it to look more deeply at female offenders, but they are difficult to study because they aren't often caught.\n\n\"Partly as a result of this case, it's prompted our research team to start going back through our hotline data, to identify cases where there was a female perpetrator and see if they can learn anything or see any patterns,\" said RAINN President Scott Berkowitz.\n\nDefying the stereotype of a woman\n\n\"Nurturing\" and \"empathy\" are among the top traits society values in women, a 2017 Pew Research Center survey found. Women are not generally thought of as violent. Shock at Maxwell in part reflects stereotypes about women being gentle, emotional, in need of protection. We don't expect women to harm, and certainly not with the degree of cruelty Maxwell is accused of.\n\nNegative stereotypes of masculinity include violence, dominance, uncontrollable sexual urges. But it's an erroneous idea that a sexual offender must be aggressive, experts say. It's why men with \"good guy\" reputations may be overlooked as abusers, as was the case with Bill Cosby and Matt Lauer.\n\n\"One of our psychological defenses against feeling vulnerable ourselves is to create this idea that it must take some kind of monster to commit sexual assault or any of these other types of sexual offenses,\" said Sherry Hamby, a University of the South psychology professor and founding editor of the American Psychological Association journal Psychology of Violence.\n\nThese stereotypes are also why male victims of sexual assault or abuse struggle to come forward, according to RAINN. Feelings of shame are compounded by the belief they should have been “strong enough” to stop their perpetrator or, if the perpetrator is female, that they should have enjoyed it. Female victims of female perpetrators also face stigmas regarding sexuality.\n\nKristen Houser, a nationally recognized expert in sexual abuse, said the invisibility of female perpetration is a widely recognized problem. Men are more likely to commit sexual violence, but that doesn't mean women don't. Our understanding of female sexual abusers, however, is often confined to tropes, like a female teacher abusing a teenage male student.\n\n\"We often think about it within a teacher-student relationship ... but it's certainly not limited to that just because that's what we pay the most attention to,\" Houser said.\n\nThe media may be partly to blame. Authors of a 2019 study looking at the \"culture of denial\" around female sex offenders theorized that media reports reinforce gender stereotypes and limit awareness of sexual offenses committed by women.\n\nA 2017 study analyzing data from four large-scale federal agency surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Bureau of Justice Statistics found gender stereotypes can obscure the prevalence of female sexual perpetration and minimize its impact.\n\nIn a 2002 study on lesbian and bisexual victims of female-perpetrated sexual violence, one victim stated: “(W)hen I said to her, ‘You raped me,’ she just laughed at me. She said, ‘That's impossible.'” The study also found internalized gender bias can lead victims to dismiss abuse, with one victim saying, “The fact that it was from another woman also made me realize how much more I was willing to accept from her in the form of abuse.\"\n\nViolence against LGBTQ community:She was sexually assaulted within months of coming out. She isn't alone.\n\nA 2015 study on the differences between male and female sex offenders found females offended against a victim of the same sex in nearly half of their crimes and offend with male accomplices, as was the alleged case with Maxwell and Epstein, in 30% of their sexual crimes.\n\nDefying the stereotype of a socialite\n\nIn court filings ahead of Tuesday's bail hearing, prosecutors reasserted their claim that Maxwell represented a serious flight risk, citing her vast financial resources and citizenship in multiple countries. They said Maxwell has a track record of living in hiding and has not been forthcoming about details of her wealth, which they said would reveal her financial means to escape. The judge ordered her to be held without bond.\n\nHer father, Robert Maxwell, was a publishing tycoon and former member of the British Parliament who died in 1991 after falling overboard from his luxury yacht, Lady Ghislaine, named after the youngest of his nine children.\n\n\"No one is thinking of a British socialite when they're thinking about who's a predator of sexual abuse and violence,\" Palumbo said.\n\nBut it may be part of how Maxwell allegedly groomed victims. Court documents describe Maxwell and Epstein allegedly accompanying victims on shopping trips and movie outings, designed to put the girls at ease.\n\n\"Having developed a rapport with a victim, Maxwell would try to normalize sexual abuse ... by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was undressed and being present for sex acts involving the minor victim and Epstein,\" prosecutors allege.\n\nMaxwell and Epstein enticed and lured victims to Epstein’s homes scattered across the United States and abroad, “which Maxwell knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse,” the federal grand jury indictment charged.\n\nIf Maxwell was the one recruiting girls, experts say it was a powerful strategy. A child is much less likely to see a woman as having abusive intentions.\n\nExperts say people often fail to acknowledge victimization can be perpetrated by and happen to the ultra rich.\n\n\"That's part of why her role in this story is so shocking to people, because we let class cloud reality for us,\" Houser said. \"If you stop and think, we all can probably point to numerous places where wealth and prestige and power contributed to abuse and did not protect against abuse. So let's just assume that those things exist no matter who you are.\"\n\nIn cases of men, class is often initially used in their defense, as in \"he could get any woman he wants, why would he rape?\" or \"she's making it up because he's rich and she wants money.\" These arguments persist despite women coming forward against famous, wealthy men being met with public condemnation and even death threats.\n\nThe cost of rape:Stress, trust, sleep and about $122,000\n\nClass also matters in how victims are targeted. Sex traffickers often target victims who are poor, lack support networks and live on the margins of society, experts say. They especially target children with a history of abuse and neglect, according to the CDC.\n\nIn 2018, Miami Herald reporter Julie Brown identified 80 victims Epstein abused from 2001 to 2006. The Herald spoke with eight of the accusers and found \"most of the girls came from disadvantaged families, single-parent homes or foster care. ... Many of the girls were one step away from homelessness.\"\n\nEpstein's alleged targets:'The more vulnerable the better,' investigator says\n\n'Their stories matter more'\n\nSexual violence experts are careful not to speculate about Maxwell's history or intentions, but they do note that sexual violence involves complex dynamics.\n\nWith grooming, for example, a victim may align with the victimizer as a way to protect themselves. Research also shows female sex offenders have a high incidence of physical, sexual and emotional abuse in their histories and female juvenile sexual offenders are more likely to have experienced sexual abuse in childhood.\n\nIt's unknown whether Maxwell was ever a victim of sexual abuse herself. Maxwell remains a mystery. We may never know her motivations, and some would say we don't have to. But we do have to confront our own biases, experts say, to recognize the harm sexual violence causes regardless of gender or social class.\n\n\"We have so many people who have come forward and provided rather explicit inventories of her role in recruiting, in abusing and making people feel trapped,\" Houser said. \"Whatever her story was, their stories matter more.\"\n\nIf you are a survivor of sexual assault, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800.656.HOPE (4673) or visit hotline.rainn.org/online and receive confidential support.\n\nIf you've seen what could be human trafficking or if you need help, the National Human Trafficking Hotline 1-888-373-7888 is confidential, toll-free and available 24/7 in more than 200 languages.

But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers.

In 1980, three separate complaints were made against him. The complaints asserted that Soderlund had engaged in sexual acts with three different children. The children were aged 12 to 13 years old. The Diocesan record, a \"summary of case\" relating to Soderlund, generalized the sexual conduct without referencing specific acts or crimes.\n\nOn June 11, 1980, a meeting was held at the Chancery during which photo albums were examined depicting nude photographs of a young boy engaged in sex acts with Soderlund. Soderlund admitted to Chancery officials that he engaged in sexual activity with the three young boys. While documents created at the time of the admission minimized the conduct, the facts became available through a detailed account of the abuse obtained from a victim in 1997 by the Diocese. The victim reported that: he was not a willing participant, but Soderlund threatened to harm or kill him.\n\nSoderlund also took pictures of the victim engaged in sexual acts and threatened to use them to embarrass him. Soderlund offered to leave the priesthood if the victim would go away with him.

On April 29, 2004, Yarrosh was removed from priestly ministry and entered St. John Vianney Hospital for evaluation and treatment. 2004, the Pennsylvania State Police filed charges against Yarrosh, specifically, 110 counts of sexual abuse of children after discovering hundreds of child pornography photos, books, magazines, videos, and DVD's in his possession. As law enforcement began its prosecution, Diocesan Support Services conducted an audit and determined that Yarrosh embezzled approximately $23,000.00 from the parish.\n\nCharges were filed related to this theft. On April 27, 2005, Yarrosh entered a plea of guilty to charges of theft and possession of child pornography. Yarrosh was sentenced pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement to imprisonment for three to 23 months, $250.00 in fines, and restitution to the parish.\n\nOn July 21, 2005, Yarrosh left St. Francis Villa and moved into a motel.

Yarrosh was also found to be in possession of pornography in violation of his court supervision. The Schuylkill County Court of Common Pleas subsequently sentenced Yarrosh to four to ten years in state prison for violating the terms of his supervision.\n\nFinally, in June 2007, the Diocese dismissed Yarrosh from the priesthood.\n\nJoseph A.

While in the ninth grade, the victim met Father Joseph A. Zmijewski. She was in a new school and was experiencing unhappiness. The victim began regular counseling sessions with Zmijewski.\n\nZmijewski proposed a course of alternative treatment. He directed the victim to come to his personal residence where he could help the victim through hypnosis. The victim complied and attended four hypnosis sessions with Zmijewski at his residence. After the first three attempts were unsuccessful by Zmijewski to hypnotize her, she agreed to a fourth session. In an effort to expedite her \"treatment,\" she faked hypnosis during her fourth session. While she pretended to be hypnotized, Zmijewski instructed her to take off one piece of clothing after another. The victim was scared and complied until she was nude. Zmijewski then left the room for a short period of time and upon his return, he instructed the victim to get dressed. The victim never returned for any further \"treatment\" and kept the incident to herself into adulthood.\n\nDavid Connell, Timothy Johnson, and Jim Gross\n\nNo further details of their employment history were listed.\n\nSummary: David Connell and Timothy Johnson were Carmelite priests and Jim Gross was a lay person. in September 2007, a known victim reported he had been sexually abused by Gross, a basketball coach at St. Patrick's in Pottsville.

In the summer of 1984, Gross resigned from teaching at St. Francis School in Minersville, Schuylkill County.\n\nIn the narrative of his last evaluation from June 1984, the victim also reported that he was sexually abused by a Carmelite priest named Father David Connell and physically abused by a Carmelite brother named Timothy Johnson while attending Nativity High School. The abuse was reported to the Provincial of the Carmelites, Father Michael Kissane, in October 2007. The victim stated that his family's house had burned down and the Carmelites took him and his brother in and had them live in a priory. During the time he was living in the priory, the victim was sexually abused by Connell. The victim remembered drinking juice that Connell gave him and the next memory the victim had was waking up in his own bed naked, with Connell in the room. The victim had no memory of the prior evening but, on waking, he was bleeding from his rectum.\n\nThe victim told Johnson he was going to also report the abuse to the police. Johnson told the victim not to report the abuse to the police but the victim insisted on reporting. At this point Johnson began to severely beat the victim with a big leather belt and told the victim that, if he reported the abuse to the police, he would beat him even worse.\n\nMichael S.

When he said he did not have the proper clothes, Kondzielski suggested that they lift weights naked. They then proceeded to lift weights together while they were naked. When he told his parents about the naked weight lifting incident, they were shocked and told him to stay away from Kondzielski.\n\nWhen confronted with this allegations, Kondzielski claimed he did not remember the incident, but did not deny it because it could have happened.\n\nGerard Krebs\n\nWhere he served:\n\n7/26/1964 - 6/3/1970: Secondary Education Venango Christian, High School, Oil City, PA\n\n7/26/1964 - 6/3/1970: Weekend Assistant, St. Stephen's, Oil City, PA\n\n6/3/1970 - 9/8/1970: Parochial Vicar, Our Lady Queen of the Americas, Conneaut Lake, PA\n\n6/3/1970 - 9/8/1970: Resident, St. Stephen's Rectory, Oil City, PA\n\n9/8/1970 - 12/6/1978: Parochial Vicar, Erie, St. John the Baptist\n\n12/6/1978 - 1/27/1983: Pastor, Holy Cross Church, Brandy Camp, PA\n\n1/27/1983 - 6/30/1990: Pastor, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n3/1/1990 - 5/4/1990: Health Leave, Guest House, Rochester, MN\n\n6/30/1990 - 1/6/1992: Pastor, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n1/6/1992 - 12/31/2003: Director of RCIA, Diocesan Office, Erie, PA\n\n1/6/1992 - 2/4/1994: Resident, Blessed Sacrament, Erie, PA\n\n2/4/1994 - 3/27/2004: Resident, St. Joseph/Bread of Life, Erie, PA\n\n4/10/1996 - 10/1/1996: Chaplain, Soldiers & Sailors Home\n\n11/17/1996 - 5/8/1997: Weekend Assistant, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n11/22/1996 - 12/31/2003: Director of Activities/Coming Millennium, Diocesan Office, Erie, PA\n\n1/1/04 - 5/25/2005: Retired, Priest Retirement Residence, Erie, PA\n\nSummary: Three known victims came forward indicating that they were sexually abused by Father Gerard Krebs.\n\nOne victim alleged that Krebs led him through \"a series of sexual rituals to both prove my faith and the fact that I was not a homosexual.\n\nThe grand jury found no documentation indicating that law enforcement was ever notified about any of Krebs interactions with his victims.\n\nJerry (John) Kucan\n\nWhere he served:\n\n1952-1954: St. Anthony's, Sharon, PA\n\n1954-1961: St. Joseph's, Bethlehem, PA\n\n1961-1972: St. Mary's, Steelton, PA\n\n1972-1973: Our Lady of Peace Friary, Beaver Falls, PA\n\n1973-1977: St. Anthony's, Sharon, PA\n\n1977-1978: Sacred Heart, Milwaukee, WI\n\n1978-1979: Beaver Falls Friary, Beaver Falls, PA\n\n1979-1982: St. Mary's, Steelton, PA\n\n1982-1985: St. Jerome' s, Chicago, IL\n\n1985-1986: Sacred Heart, Milwaukee, WI\n\n1986-1988: St. Anthony's, Chicago, IL\n\n1988-1994: St. Augustine' s, West Allis, WI\n\n1994-1995: Sacred Heart, Chicago, IL\n\n1995-2005: St. Anthony's Friary, Chicago, IL\n\nSummary: In February of 2005, a 29 year old man wrote a letter to the Diocese of Erie in which he stated that he had attended St. Anthony's School in Sharon, Pennsylvania and that in\n\n1974 he began serving midnight mass. Victim #1 stated that \"Father Jerry\" began an inappropriate relationship with him at that time. They would have special meetings together. Kucan told the victim that if he ever told anyone about their relationship, his mother would lose her job in the school kitchen and he would be kicked out of school. The victim wrote in the letter that he would go to confession weekly to confess his sins and that Kucan would tell him that the slate was wiped clean.\n\nKucan would perform oral sex on the-then eight year old. The letter also alleged that Kucan would have a brother in a brown robe present on some occasions and that this brother would also perform oral sex on the victim.\n\nFather Kucan was taken out of the ministry in March 2005, when the Order received its first complaint against him. The Order settled with the victim filing the complaint. The file note also indicated that Kucan was then in his mid- eighties and in the early stages of dementia.\n\nThere is nothing contained in this file that shows that any actual correspondence between the Church and the District Attorney occurred.\n\nLouis Lorei\n\nWhere he served:\n\n9/1981 - 9/1985: Pastor, Our Lady of Peace, Erie, PA\n\nUnknown: Possibly Gannon University\n\nSummary: In December 2009, Father Mark Hoffman called the Bishop's office to report an allegation involving child sexual abuse by Monsignor Louis Lorei. The parents of a boy had approached him to report that their son stated he \"was touched by Monsignor Lorei\" in the early 1980's. Bishop Trautman later met with the victim.\n\nThe victim stated that about 1980 or 1981, he was a student, roughly age 11 to 13, at Our Lady of Peace school. He was also an altar server during early mass with Lorei. On one occasion, Lorei invited him into the rectory and into his bedroom. Lorei had the victim sit on the bed while Lorei sat next to him and hugged and kissed him on the lips. This would occur several days in a row, stop, and then begin again. The victim eventually refused to serve mass with Lorei.\n\nLorei was soon removed by then -Bishop Murphy. In his own handwritten words, Trautman expressed the personal belief that Lorei' s sudden departure may likely have been indicative of some kind of significant event. Trautman offered the victim counseling services. Financial assistance was also discussed. In a memorandum dated March 30, 2007, Hoffman also documented an additional victim of Lorei. Hoffman found out through the father of the second victim that his son was allegedly abused by Lorei. The victim reportedly described the incident during a United Methodist retreat in 2000.\n\nA small note in the file states \"Review Board found no merit in processing since supposed victim did not come forth even after requests.\"\n\nIt is unknown who the request refers to.\n\nSalvatore P.

Luzzi was moved to St. Mark's Seminary, where he filled several roles. Over the course of his 30 year ministry, he was accused of sexual misconduct by eight male victims ranging in age from early teens to early twenties. Some of these victims were groped, inappropriately kissed, hugged, and/or fondled. He also faced allegations of responsibility for the suicide of a former student/victim.\n\nLuzzi worked extensively with young would-be priests at St. Mark's where he and fellow priest Leon Muroski served as Spiritual Directors to the seminarians. Luzzi's inappropriate touching and fondling of at least two seminarians prompted the Diocese to settle with those seminarians for large sums of money. The first former Seminarian's case was settled in civil court for $34,500 and this individual received several thousand dollars over the course of the many years that the Diocese paid for his counseling and medication costs.\n\nSeveral other former juvenile victims of Luzzi received letters or phone calls of apology from the Diocese. These victims were counseled by the Diocese through correspondence or in person interviews wherein Luzzi's behavior was dismissed as \"Sal's way of expressing himself and his \"touching approach\" to ministry was attributed to his Italian upbringing.\n\nIn 1994, Bishop Trautman sent both Luzzi and Muroski to St. Luke's Institute for therapy. The Diocese publicly announced that Luzzi was going on an extended sabbatical for \"personal, spiritual and academic growth.\" Once Luzzi was discharged, the Bishop welcomed him back into pastoral ministry by letter on February 14, 1995. However, the welcome also came with several conditions and a Penial Precept, a formal notification in the church that restricts ministry.\n\nTrautman directed Luzzi to refrain from all contact with youth under 19 years of age and to avoid travel and social interaction with such parishioners. Later that same year, in September 1995, Trautman had Luzzi' s faculties as a priest removed and Luzzi began residing in a private residence, where he remains today.\n\nRicahrd D. Lynch\n\nWhere he served:\n\n6/01/1963 - 5/26/1972: Secondary Education Bradford Central Christian High School, Bradford, PA\n\n5/26/1972 - 2/18/1983: Headmaster, Secondary Education Bradford Central Christian High School, Bradford, PA\n\n2/18/1983 - 8/30/1999: Pastor, Erie Holy Rosary, Erie, PA\n\n1984-1994:Dean, East Erie Deanery, Erie, PA\n\n8/31/1999 - Death: Pastor, St. Mark's the Evangelist, Erie, PA\n\nSummary: The victim claims Lynch slammed him into the wall and this resulted in a trauma to his head.\n\nIn a letter dated June 3, 2016, the victim stated that he wanted to write the Bishop to get some things off his chest. He alleged that Father Richard Lynch was responsible for the sexual abuse that he went through while attending Bradford Central Catholic Christian High School 1978-1979. He said he told Bishop Trautman about some physical abuse, but was too ashamed to talk about the sexual abuse.\n\nDaniel Martin\n\nWhere he served:\n\n1943 - 1945: Parochial Vicar, Sacred Heart, Sharon, PA\n\n1945 - 1962: Faculty, Erie Cathedral Preparatory High School, Erie, PA\n\n1948 - 1962: Assistant Headmaster, Erie Cathedral Preparatory, Erie, PA\n\n1950-1962: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College\n\n1962-1970: Pastor, St. Boniface, Kersey, PA\n\n1962-1970: Headmaster, Elk Co.

Calvary, Erie, PA\n\n1987: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College for Religious women\n\n2003: Blessed Sacrament, Residence\n\nSummary: Monsignor Daniel Martin was a priest the in the Diocese of Erie for 43 -three years who faced two known allegations of sexual abuse. The grand jury's review of his files found very little documented evidence of his abuse of a teenager who was an alter server in his parish. That victim would go on to become a priest himself and appeared in front of the grand jury to tell his story.\n\nHe reported that when he was upset over the troubles of his life, he would seek Martin's counsel. He testified that Martin sexually fondled him on at least sixteen occasions between the ages of sixteen and nineteen.\n\nOther victims came forward with similar encounters.\n\nRedacted – pending litigation\n\nThe name of the priest, where he served and the exact incident was entirely redacted in the grand jury report.\n\nLeon T. Muroski\n\nWhere he served:\n\n6/11/1960 - 9/01/1967: Parochial Vicar, St. Luke, Erie, PA\n\n3/30/1961 - N/A: Chaplain, Erie County T.B.

This ministry lasted from 1982 until1995, but was abruptly halted when in the early 1990s Muroski was accused of sexual misconduct while he was a Spiritual Director at the seminary. Muroski was sent to St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland, for individual psychotherapy in 1994 after he admitted to inappropriate contact with the seminarians under his watch. These seminarians were all male, eighteen to twenty-three-year olds, when Muroski would counsel them. This counselling included allegations of full body massages, kissing, masturbation and fondling of the seminarians' buttocks and genitals. Muroski would eventually be placed back into ministry after therapy at St. Luke's and served in the Diocese of Erie and in The Christophers program in New York City.\n\nIn 2001, Muroski returned to the Diocese of Erie from The Christophers and was retired. Muroski was permitted to move into the retired priest home in 2002, which is where he still resides. In 2016, the Diocese rostered a list of all the retired clergy living in the home and made it public. Muroski was not listed as a resident. It was at this residence that the grand jury found him living in 2017, however.\n\nEdmundus Murphy\n\nNo further details regarding where he served were provided.\n\nSummary: On December 21, 2007 an e-mail communication was sent to Monsignor Robert Smith, Vicar General of the Diocese of Erie from the Society of the Divine Word in Techny, Ilinois. The purpose of the e-mail was to inform Smith that a victim was sexually abused by a staff member while he was a minor at Sacred Heart High School in 1964. This school was operated by the Society of the Divine Word Missionaries in Girard.\n\nThe victim claimed that during the summer between his freshman and sophomore years of high school, Brother Edmundus Murphy, who was 33 years of age at this time, was the wrestling coach at the school. Murphy encouraged the victim to join the team and, under the pretense of teaching him some wrestling moves, the two wrestled naked \"as the ancient Greeks and Romans did.\" The victim alleged that during these \"wrestling\" sessions he was sodomized by Murphy.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the victim asked Murphy what he was doing and, according to the victim, Murphy sat on the floor and began to cry.\n\nThe grand jury investigation found no documentation that the Diocese notified local law enforcement or the District Attorney's Office about Murphy's behavior. The only note in the file was a handwritten notation on top of the printed out e-mail which read; \"not responsible-Priest/Deacon only.\"\n\nJohn L.

Sergei Skripal was jailed in Russia for spying for Britain, but was released as part of a spy swap and moved to Salisbury in 2010.\n\nBritain blames Russia for the poisonings but Moscow denies any involvement.\n\n“We will not be applying to Russia for the extradition of these men as the Russian constitution does not permit extradition of its own nationals,\" said prosecutor Sue Hemming in a statement.\n\n“We have, however, obtained a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) which means that if either man travels to a country where an EAW is valid, they will be arrested and face extradition on these charges for which there is no statute of limitations.”\n\nMetropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said authorities were seeking to circulate Interpol red notices about the two suspects, who he said are aged about 40 and likely to have traveled under aliases. He said they flew from Moscow to London and traveled by train to Salisbury to allegedly carry out the attack.\n\nThe Skripals were taken to the hospital in critical condition and released weeks later. A police officer, Nick Bailey, was hospitalized after coming into contact with the nerve agent while searching Sergei Skripal's home and was also later released. In July, months after the initial poisonings, Dawn Sturgess, a 44-year-old woman from Salisbury, died a week after she and her partner Charlie Rowley, 48, were found unconscious in Amesbury, a town about 10 miles from Salisbury. British authorities said they were also poisoned with Novichok.\n\nPolice believe the nerve agent was smuggled to Britain in a fake Nina Ricci perfume bottle and put on the front door of Sergei Skripal’s house. Rowley found the bottle months later and gave it to Sturgess, who is believed to have sprayed the substance on herself. Rowley spent weeks in hospital before being discharged.\n\nSturgess was exposed to at least 10 times the level of Novichok that the Skripals came into contact with, Britain's Press Association news agency reported.\n\n\"We have now linked the attack on the Skripals and the events in Amesbury which affected Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley. It now forms one investigation,\" Basu said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"We do not believe Dawn and Charlie were deliberately targeted, but became victims as a result of the recklessness in which such a toxic nerve agent was disposed of,\" he added.\n\nBasu urged people in the Salisbury area not to pick up unknown items.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nMore:Police identify Russian suspects in UK nerve agent attack, report says\n\nMore:Who is Sergei Skripal?

Her classroom, with its black-and-white images of Martin Luther King Jr. and Che Guevara and a \"Resist Patriarchy\" sign, was piled high with colorful rolls of poster paper, the whiteboard covered with plans for pep rallies.\n\nA post from poet Shawn William caught her eye. \"On the day that Trayvon would've turned 24, Liam Neeson is going on national talk shows trying to convince the world that he is not a racist.\" While promoting a revenge movie, the Hollywood actor confessed that decades earlier, after a female friend told him she'd been raped by a black man she could not identify, he'd roamed the streets hunting for black men to harm.\n\nFor Wysinger, an activist whose podcast The C-Dubb Show frequently explores anti-black racism, the troubling episode recalled the nation's dark history of lynching, when charges of sexual violence against a white woman were used to justify mob murders of black men.\n\n\"White men are so fragile,\" she fired off, sharing William's post with her friends, \"and the mere presence of a black person challenges every single thing in them.\"\n\nIt took just 15 minutes for Facebook to delete her post for violating its community standards for hate speech. And she was warned if she posted it again, she'd be banned for 72 hours.\n\nWysinger glared at her phone, but wasn't surprised. She says black people can't talk about racism on Facebook without risking having their posts removed and being locked out of their accounts in a punishment commonly referred to as \"Facebook jail.\" For Wysinger, the Neeson post was just another example of Facebook arbitrarily deciding that talking about racism is racist.\n\n\"It is exhausting,\" she says, \"and it drains you emotionally.\"\n\nBlack activists say hate speech policies and content moderation systems formulated by a company built by and dominated by white men fail the very people Facebook claims it's trying to protect. Not only are the voices of marginalized groups disproportionately stifled, Facebook rarely takes action on repeated reports of racial slurs, violent threats and harassment campaigns targeting black users, they say.\n\nMany of these users now think twice before posting updates on Facebook or they limit how widely their posts are shared. Yet few can afford to leave the single-largest and most powerful social media platform for sharing information and creating community.\n\nSo to avoid being flagged, they use digital slang such as \"wypipo,\" emojis or hashtags to elude Facebook's computer algorithms and content moderators. They operate under aliases and maintain back-up accounts to avoid losing content and access to their community. And they've developed a buddy system to alert friends and followers when a fellow black activist has been sent to Facebook jail, sharing the news of the suspension and the posts that put them there.\n\nThey call it getting \"Zucked\" and black activists say these bans have serious repercussions, not just cutting people off from their friends and family for hours, days or weeks at a time, but often from the Facebook pages they operate for their small businesses and nonprofits.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, Black Lives Matter organizer Tanya Faison had one of her posts removed as hate speech. \"Dear white people,\" she wrote in the post, \"it is not my job to educate you or to donate my emotional labor to make sure you are informed. If you take advantage of that time and labor, you will definitely get the elbow when I see you.\" After being alerted by USA TODAY, Facebook apologized to Faison and reversed its decision.\n\nEven former employees are not immune. In November, former Facebook partnerships manager Mark Luckie called out Facebook for how it treats black users and black employees. \"One of the platform's most engaged demographics and an unmatched cultural trendsetter is having their community divided by the actions and inaction of the company,\" he wrote in a Facebook post. \"This loss is a direct reflection of the staffing and treatment of many of its black employees.\"\n\nFacebook deleted his post, then hours later said it “took another look” and restored it.\n\n'Black people are punished on Facebook'\n\n\"Black people are punished on Facebook for speaking directly to the racism we have experienced,\" says Seattle black anti-racism consultant and conceptual artist Natasha Marin.\n\nMarin says she's one of Facebook's biggest fans. She created a \"reparations\" fund that's aided a quarter million people with small donations to get elderly folks transportation to medical appointments or to pay for prescriptions, to help single moms afford groceries or the rent or to get supplies for struggling new parents. More recently, she started a social media project spreading \"black joy\" rather than black trauma.\n\nShe was also banned by Facebook for three days for posting a screenshot of a racist message she received.\n\n\"For me as a black woman, this platform has allowed me to say and do things I wouldn’t otherwise be able to do,\" she says. \"Facebook is also a place that has allowed things like death threats against me and my children. And Facebook is responsible for the fact that I am completely desensitized to the N-word.”\n\nSeven out of 10 black U.S. adults use Facebook and 43 percent use Instagram, according to the Pew Research Center. And black millennials are even more engaged on social media. More than half – 55 percent – of black millennials spend at least one hour a day on social media, 6 percent higher than all millennials, while 29 percent say they spend at least three hours a day, nine percent higher than millennials, Nielsen surveys found.\n\nThe rise of #BlackLivesMatter and other hashtag movements show how vital social media platforms have become for civil rights activists. About half of black users turn to social media to express their political views or to get involved in issues that are important to them, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nThese hashtag movements, coming against the backdrop of an upsurge in hate crimes, have helped put the deaths of unarmed African Americans by police officers on the public agenda, along with racial disparities in employment, health and other key areas.\n\n\"If I were to sit down with Mark Zuckerberg, the message I would want to get across to him is: You may not even realize how powerful a thing you have created. Entire revolutions could take place on this platform. Global change could happen. But that can’t happen if real people can’t take part,\" Marin says. \"The challenge for these companies is to see black women as valuable resources. This is the wealth on the platform, the people pushing the platform forward. If anything, they should be supported. \"There should be policies and community standards that overtly support that kind of work,\" Marin says. \"Maybe Mark Zuckerberg needs to sit down with a bunch of black women who use Facebook and just listen.\"\n\nHow Facebook judges what speech is hateful\n\nFor years, Facebook was widely celebrated as a platform that empowered people to bypass mainstream media or oppressive governments to directly tell their story. Now, in the eyes of some, it has assumed the role of censor.\n\nWith more than a quarter of the world's population on Facebook, the social media giant says it's wrestling with its unprecedented power to judge what speech is hateful.\n\nAll across the political spectrum, from the far right to the far left, Facebook gets flak for its judgment calls. To help sort what's allowed and what's not, it relies on a 40-page list of rules called \"Community Standards,\" which were made public for the first time last year. Facebook defines hate speech as an attack against a \"protected characteristic,\" such as race, gender, sexuality or religion. And each individual or group is treated equally. The rules are enforced by a combination of algorithms and human moderators trained to scrub hate speech from Facebook. From July to September 2018, Facebook removed 2.9 million pieces of content that it said violated its hate speech rules, more than half of which was flagged by its technology.\n\nThe tag team of algorithms and moderators frequently makes mistakes when flagging and removing content, Facebook acknowledges. And it has taken steps to try to make its system more accountable. Last year, Facebook began allowing users to file an appeal when their individual posts are removed. This year, the company plans to introduce an independent body of experts to review some of those appeals.\n\nThere are just too many sensitive decisions for Facebook to make them all on its own, Zuckerberg said last month. A string of violent attacks, including a mass shooting at two mosques in New Zealand, recently forced Facebook to reckon with the scourge of white nationalist content on its platform. \"Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech,\" Zuckerberg wrote, \"and frankly I agree.\"\n\nIn late 2017 and early 2018, Facebook explored whether certain groups should be afforded more protection than others. For now, the company has decided to maintain its policy of protecting all racial and ethnic groups equally, even if they do not face oppression or marginalization, says Neil Potts, public policy director at Facebook. Applying more \"nuanced\" rules to the daily tidal wave of content rushing through Facebook and its other apps would be very challenging, he says.\n\nPotts acknowledges that Facebook doesn't always read the room correctly, confusing advocacy and commentary on racism and white complicity in anti-blackness with attacks on a protected group of people. Facebook is looking into ways to identify when oppressed or marginalized users are \"speaking to power,\" Potts says. And it's conducting ongoing research into the experiences of the black community on its platform.\n\n\"That's, on its face, the type of speech we want to encourage, but words and people aren't perfect, so it doesn't always come across as that. We are exploring additional refinements to our hate speech policy that will perhaps help remedy some of these situations,\" he says.\n\nFacebook wants to make sure its policies \"reflect how people speak about these topics.\" \"That's the biggest thing,\" Potts says, \"making sure we are in tune with this community and the way they actually speak about these topics, and making sure our policies are in line and in touch.\"\n\n'Just another slap in the face'\n\nAyo Henry, a mother of four from Providence, Rhode Island, says Facebook's policies could not be more out of touch.\n\nLast year, Henry was cut off by a kid on a bike wearing a confederate sweatshirt when she pulled into the parking lot of a sandwich shop. She honked her horn. He responded twice with a racial slur.\n\nShe restrained herself in front of her children, but a few weeks later after leaving roller derby practice, Henry spotted the kid again, wearing the same sweatshirt. The boy tried to pedal away. She pulled out her phone. \"I don't know what came over me. It was an impulsive decision,\" she says. \"But I wanted to let him know that it wasn't OK.\"\n\nHe apologized, explaining he \"wasn't in a good mood that day.\" She realized how young he was as his body trembled and hands shook. She tried to offer him some motherly advice on why he should not use racial slurs.\n\nHenry's video of the exchange was viewed more than 2 million times on Facebook. Within 48 hours, Facebook took the footage down, saying it ran afoul of its hate speech rules. Henry appealed the decision but Facebook refused to reverse it.\n\nIn the meantime, her Messenger inbox filled with hundreds racial slurs, derogatory messages and threats that she would be raped or killed. Yet each time Henry tried to privately share the video with her friends on Messenger, Facebook blocked her.\n\nOffers of support that poured in from around the country helped Henry develop a network of black activists. Starting last summer, she says they all began noticing that just typing the phrase \"white people\" into a Facebook post could get their post flagged and their accounts suspended. Henry says Facebook has suspended her several times, once for calling on white women to get on board with a broader, more intersectional, form of feminism.\n\nIt wasn't a Facebook post, but a comment on that post that triggered her longest suspension from Facebook.\n\nHer Facebook post drew attention to an antique store in nearby Massachusetts that refused to remove racist memorabilia hanging on its walls, including a vintage advertisement for smoking tobacco with a caricature of two black men. \"Still perpetuating white supremacy through 'nostalgia,\" she wrote.\n\nOne person challenged whether the image was in fact racist so Henry replied with a similar image of a jigsaw puzzle box from the same era which was labeled \"Chopped Up N------.\"\n\nThat comment, which Facebook deleted, sent her to Facebook jail for a month. Henry appealed the suspension but Facebook would not relent. She says she knows of no one in the black community who has had a post reinstated by appealing.\n\n\"Black people in this country, and people of color in general, we endure a daily battle just to exist. Now we have to be careful not to complain too much about the various types of oppression publicly because, if you do, then you are going to be suppressed,\" she says. \"It's difficult to navigate the framework of social media as a black person, just because racism is systemic and, when you realize it's ingrained so deeply in a system that is so influential on our country, then it's almost like a whole second burden to bear.\"\n\n\"Social media is supposed to be a way that people can come together and be able to communicate relatively freely,\" she says. \"For us, it has become just another slap in the face.\"\n\nCivil rights groups push for audit, accountability\n\nEarly on, the Black Lives Matter social justice movement turned to Facebook as an organizing tool. Yet their organizers say they were soon set upon by bands of white supremacists who targeted them with racial slurs and violent threats. In 2015, Color Of Change, which was formed after Hurricane Katrina to organize racial justice campaigns on the internet, began pressuring Facebook to stop the harassment of black activists by hate groups.\n\nChanelle Helm, a Black Lives Matter organizer from Louisville, Kentucky, says the threats intensified in the form of doxxing – posting organizers' addresses, phone numbers and photos on the internet. Faison, founding member of the Sacramento chapter of Black Lives Matter, was stalked. \"It got a lot more serious,\" Helm says. \"They were threatening folks with doxxing of family members.\"\n\nFacebook removed a group responsible for some of the harassment, but Color Of Change and other civil rights groups say they struggled to get the company to address other complaints. Late last year, The New York Times reported that Facebook had hired a Republican opposition research firm to discredit Color Of Change and other Facebook critics.\n\n\"What we continue to see time and time again is what's framed as race-neutral decision-making ends up being overtly hostile to the communities most in need of some of those free speech protections,\" says Brandi Collins-Dexter, senior campaign director at Color Of Change.\n\nThe Center for Media Justice began probing why content from people of color was being removed from Facebook in August 2016 when, at the request of law enforcement, Facebook shut down the video of a Baltimore woman, Korryn Gaines, who was live-streaming her standoff with police. Gaines was later shot and killed by a police officer in front of her 5-year-old son who was also struck twice by gunfire. At the same time, Black Lives Matter activists and Standing Rock pipeline protesters in North Dakota were reporting that their content was being removed, too.\n\nIn 2016 and again in 2017, civil rights and other groups wrote letters urging Facebook to conduct an independent civil rights audit of its content moderation system and to create a task force to institute the recommendations.\n\nLast May, Facebook agreed to an audit as it was trying to control the damage from revelations that a shadowy Russian organization posing as Americans had targeted unsuspecting users with divisive political messages to sow discord surrounding the 2016 presidential election. One of the main targets of the Internet Research Agency on Facebook were African Americans. The same day Facebook gave in to demands from civil rights groups, it announced a second audit into allegations of anti-conservative bias led by former Senator Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican.\n\nThere are few signs of progress in how Facebook deals with racially motivated hate speech against the African American community or the erasure of black users' speech, says Steven Renderos, senior campaign manager at the Center for Media Justice.\n\nLast summer, after Nia Wilson, a black teenage girl, was stabbed to death by a white man wielding a knife at an Oakland, California, train station, black women gathered on Instagram to mourn.\n\n“As we see another one of us being murdered to bleed out in the streets we can’t help by think: that could be me, that could be my daughter, a sister, my best friend,” black activist Rachel Cargle wrote. “You okay sis? I get it if you’re not. At this moment I feel heavy and distant and numb. I feel angry and deflated and heartbroken.”\n\nCargle asked that only women of color respond. \"I needed to give us this space to check in on each other.\" Comments from black women poured in. “I’m scared. For my family, for my friends, for myself and for all the other black women out there,” one wrote.\n\nSome white women objected to being left out of the conversation. Soon Instagram removed Cargle’s post, saying it violated guidelines on hate speech.\n\n\"There were hundreds of comments of black women being seen and heard by their peers, being loved and cared for by their sisters, being consoled and loved exactly as they needed it,\" Cargle wrote at the time. \"DO YOU SEE THIS? DO YOU SEE HOW NOT ONLY ARE WE KILLED IN THE STREETS WE ARE ALSO PUNISHED FOR GRIEVING.\"\n\nInstagram later reversed the decision.\n\nCivil rights organizations say they've largely given up on Facebook voluntarily taking steps to protect black users, calling instead on Congress and the Federal Trade Commission to regulate the company. Color Of Change has asked Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg to take part in a civil rights summit this spring, but they have not agreed to take part. Color Of Change is also pushing a resolution at Facebook’s shareholder meeting in May to replace Zuckerberg as chairman of the board.\n\n\"At the end of the day, Facebook hasn't tackled one of the biggest issues of most interest to the civil rights community, which is how it deals with content moderation and how the platform will become a place that civil rights are protected,\" Renderos says. \"We, and a lot of organizations that we work with, are frankly tired of waiting for Facebook to decide what changes it's going to make for itself.\"\n\n'I don't think Facebook cares'\n\nShaun Saunders, who works in public relations, says he doesn't think Facebook cares. Saunders is someone tech companies seek out when they want to tell their story to the media. He uses Facebook to connect with journalists. He's also been suspended from Facebook three times for speaking his mind about racism.\n\n\"I am exhausted by the notion that a platform can arbitrarily cut you off. I am not only cut off from my family and friends, I am cut off from my job and my craft. That's the part that really gets me,\" Saunders says. \"It's not OK that black people are dying. Black people should not shut their mouths for identifying these things that are always happening.\"\n\n\"I would love to ask Mark Zuckerberg: 'What the hell are you guys doing? You guys are a hot mess.' I would say it to him just like that.\"\n\nIt's not just black people who have their posts removed. Andy Marra, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, says allies of black people run into trouble, too.\n\nMarra's Facebook post in late January calling on Asian Americans to protect \"black and brown who face the brunt of white supremacy\" was removed by Facebook.\n\nTwice Marra appealed the decision to take down her Facebook post, which shared an article from a popular blog showing an Asian man throwing up \"white power\" signs to antagonize Black Lives Matter protesters. \"This post is expressing condemnation to anti-black racism. The post also articulates critical feedback about how other people of color – specifically those in the Asian community, including myself as an Asian person – should oppose racism in all of its forms,\" she wrote in one appeal that Facebook denied.\n\nIt was only when friends reached out to Facebook to plead her case that Marra's Facebook post was reinstated. Critics say having those kinds of connections is the only way that Facebook corrects content moderation errors, but it's not a channel available to just anyone seeking redress.\n\nTake Samreen \"Sammie\" Lewis and Erica Morales, two activists of color, who say their Facebook page, Three Token Brown Girls, has been deleted three times, once just for the logo.\n\nThey say they each have been personally banned repeatedly, sometimes barely serving out one suspension before being hit with another. Lewis estimates she's been suspended from Facebook for half of the past year. Their protests go unheard, and, each time they have to rebuild their Facebook page from scratch, they lose followers.\n\n\"It basically says that we don't matter. The harm being caused to us perpetually, constantly is nothing to (Facebook),\" Lewis says. \"They'd much rather shut us up for their own comfort than acknowledge the harm they are causing.\"\n\nIn 2017, DiDi Delgado, a poet and black liberation organizer and activist, captured the growing anger in the black community with a Medium post provocatively titled: \"Mark Zuckerberg Hates Black People.\" At the time, Delgado was simultaneously serving two Facebook bans for alleged hate speech.\n\n\"That means bigoted trolls lurked my page reporting anything and everything, hoping I’d be in violation of the vague 'standards' imposed by Facebook,\" Delgado wrote. \"It’s kinda like how white people reflexively call the cops whenever they see a Black person outside. Except in this case it’s not my physical presence they find threatening, it’s my digital one.\"\n\nAsked what has changed since she published the viral post, Delgado says nothing. \"Black, LGBT, non-male and women identified users are still disproportionately banned for speaking out against oppression,\" she says.\n\nThese days, Delgado spends less time and energy on Facebook and, at times, refrains from speaking her mind there. \"Sometimes it’s more important to keep that direct line of communication open than to risk getting banned with a public post,\" she says.\n\nIn the end, Wysinger made that same calculation. In February, Wysinger decided not to risk being booted off Facebook by republishing her post about Neeson, the actor. Just days before her 40th birthday, she did not want to get thrown in Facebook jail and miss the chance to celebrate with family and friends. But, she says, she wants Facebook to know that, in silencing black people, the company is causing them harm.\n\n\"Facebook is not looking to protect me or any other person of color or any other marginalized citizen who are being attacked by hate speech,\" she says. \"We get trolls all the time. People who troll your page and say hateful things. But nobody is looking to protect us from it. They are just looking to protect their bottom line.\"\n\n\"Anything that I share, I'm sharing because it's something personal that happened to me. That's what Facebook has always built its platform on,\" she says. \"It used to ask: How are you feeling? Well, today, I am feeling targeted by CIS hetero white men.\"\n\nRead more:USA TODAY coverage of inclusion, diversity and equity in tech\n\nMore on Facebook and race:Facebook takes down ads mentioning African-Americans and Hispanics, calling them political\n\nRussians targeted Hispanics on Facebook:Russian Facebook ads inflamed Hispanic tensions over immigration after Trump election", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/24"}]}

That should not be anybody’s solace that this outbreak is done,” David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, said at a briefing Tuesday.\n\n“We still have to ramp up our efforts to respond to this outbreak. And there are many, many data questions, clinical care questions, research questions that remain to be answered about this very unusual outbreak of a known virus over the decades that is presenting itself very differently in the United States.”\n\nDeaths from monkeypox are extremely rare and often affect babies, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, such as from HIV. This year, the World Health Organization has reported 22 deaths among about 58,000 cases. About 22,000 of those cases have been reported in the US.\n\n“Back in July, CDC estimated that it took eight days for cases to double nationwide. By mid-August, the doubling rate was 25 days, showing encouraging signs of progress,” Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the White House’s assistant monkeypox response coordinator, said last week.\n\nBut Harvey and other public health leaders warned Tuesday that people on the front lines of the response – including local health departments, epidemiologists and clinics that deal with sexually transmitted infections – do not have adequate resources to ensure continued improvement.\n\nAnd there is a “very important immunocompromised population in the United States” who will be at high risk if the outbreak continues, Dr. Cesar Arias, a board member of the Infectious Disease Society of America and chief of infectious diseases at Houston Methodist Hospital, said at the briefing.\n\nOther key areas of concern cited by US public health leaders at Tuesday’s briefing include inequitable vaccination, access to testing and incomplete surveillance data.\n\nThey called on Congress to make significant funding immediately available to address the outbreak, defending the Biden administration’s request that about $4 billion in funding be allocated to the monkeypox response in the next government funding bill as one of “four critical needs,” along with support for Ukraine, Covid-19 response and natural disaster recovery.\n\nThe push for funding comes a day before federal leaders – including US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci – are scheduled to speak to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions about the federal response to the monkeypox outbreak.\n\nNeed for equitable protection\n\nPublic health leaders attribute the slowing rate of new cases to vaccination and behavior changes among those most at-risk. Men who have sex with men have been disproportionately affected in the outbreak, and about half have reported taking steps to protect themselves and their partners, according to the CDC.\n\nBut for the hopeful trend to continue, continued work and investment is needed – especially in reaching underrepresented groups, health leaders say.\n\n“In many ways, the initial and easy work has been done. Now, local health departments are needing to be more creative, to reach more deeply into their communities hardest to reach with messaging, education, vaccine, testing and treatment,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nData from the CDC shows that people of color make up a disproportionate share of cases but are underrepresented among those vaccinated.\n\nMore than half of new monkeypox cases over the past two months have been among Black and Hispanic people, but only about a third of first vaccine doses have gone to individuals in these groups, according to a CNN analysis of CDC data.\n\nThe White House Monkeypox Response Team addressed these inequities last month, highlighting efforts to offer vaccinations at large-scale events and festivals as one strategy to curb them.\n\n“With supply of vaccine increasing, I think we have a new opportunity in strategy which is bringing vaccine to people as opposed to trying to have people find vaccines,” Daskalakis said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLast week, Daskalakis noted that case rates were slowing in parts of the country that have been hardest-hit, including New York, Texas, California and Illinois.\n\nBut local public health leaders emphasized the need for a broader perspective.\n\n“We cannot take our foot off the gas simply because major cities have the means to mount a robust response, leaving smaller rural communities to fend for themselves,” Harvey said.", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/15/health/pandemic-lessons-public-health-khn/index.html", "title": "Health departments apply lessons learned from Covid to other ...", "text": "KHN —\n\nLIVINGSTON, Mont. — Shannan Piccolo walked into a hotel with a tote bag full of Narcan and a speech about how easy it is to use the medicine that can reverse opioid overdoses.\n\n“Hopefully your business would never have to respond to an overdose, but we’d rather have you have some Narcan on hand just in case,” Piccolo, director of Park City-County Health Department, said to the hotel manager.\n\nThe manager listened to Piccolo’s instructions on how to use Narcan, the brand name of the drug naloxone, and added four boxes of the nasal spray to the hotel’s first-aid kit.\n\nShannan Piccolo, with the Park City-County Health Department in Montana, talks with a hotel manager about how to use Narcan nasal spray to reverse a drug overdose. Katheryn Houghton/KHN\n\nThe transaction took less than 10 minutes. It was the third hotel Piccolo had visited that hot July day in Livingston, a mountain town of roughly 8,000, where, as in much of the nation, health officials are worried about a recent rise in the use of the synthetic opioid fentanyl.\n\nIt was the first time the local health department offered door-to-door training and supplies to prevent overdose deaths. The underlying strategy was forged during the pandemic when public health officials distributed rapid tests and vaccines in high-risk settings.\n\n“We learned this from covid,” said Dr. Laurel Desnick, the county’s public health officer. “We go to people who may not have time to come to us.”\n\nDr. Laurel Desnick, public health officer for the Park City-County Health Department in Montana, prepares to deliver boxes of Narcan to local hotels. The free distribution of Narcan, the brand name of the drug naloxone, which can reverse opioid overdoses, is one public health strategy borne out of the covid-19 pandemic. Katheryn Houghton/KHN\n\nThe pandemic laid bare the gaps and disparities in the U.S. public health system, and often resulted in blowback against local officials trying to slow the coronavirus’s spread. But one positive outcome, in part fueled by a boost in federal dollars, is that health workers have started adapting lessons they learned from their covid-19 response to other aspects of their work.\n\nFor example, in Atlanta, where the county health department planned to mail out at-home kits to test for diseases, a program modeled on the distribution of covid rapid tests. In Houston, health officials announced this month they’ll begin monitoring the city’s wastewater for monkeypox, a tactic broadly used to gauge how far and fast covid spread. And in Chicago, government agencies have tweaked covid collaborations to tag-team a rise in gun violence.\n\nSome of these adaptations should cost little and be relatively simple to incorporate into the departments’ post-pandemic work, such as using vans purchased with covid relief money for vaccine delivery and disease testing. Other tools cost more money and time, including updating covid-borne data and surveillance systems to use in other ways.\n\nSome public health workers worry that the lessons woven into their operations will fall away once the pandemic has passed.\n\n“When we have public health crises in this country, we tend to have a boom-and-bust cycle of funding,” said Adriane Casalotti, with the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nSome federal pandemic relief funding is scheduled to last for years, but other allocations have already run dry. Local health workers will be left to prioritize what to fund with what remains.\n\nMeanwhile, historically short-staffed and underfunded health departments are responding to challenges that intensified during the pandemic, including delayed mental health treatment and routine care.\n\n“You’re not just starting from where you were 2½ years ago, there’s actually a higher mountain to climb,” Casalotti said. “But places that were able to build up some of their systems can adapt them to allow for more real-time understanding of public health challenges.”\n\nIn Atlanta, the Fulton County Board of Health has offered to mail residents free, at-home tests for sexually transmitted diseases. The state has historically had some of the highest rates of reported STDs in the nation.\n\n“This program has the power to demonstrate the scalable effects of equitable access to historically underserved communities,” Joshua O’Neal, the county’s director of the sexual health programs, said in a press release announcing the kits.\n\nThe changes go beyond government. University of Texas researchers are trying out a statewide program to crowdsource data on fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses. Those working on the project are frustrated the national effort to track covid outbreaks hasn’t extended to the overdose epidemic.\n\nDr. Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said her team is expanding the covid data-driven approach to track and report neighborhood-level data on opioid drug overdoses. Nonprofits and city agencies that have worked together through the pandemic now meet each month to look at the numbers to shape their response.\n\nArwady said the city is trying to use the pandemic-driven boost in money and attention for programs that can last beyond the covid emergency.\n\n“Every day, we’re having these debates about, ‘How much do we continue on? How big do we go?’” Arwady said. “I feel like it’s such a moment. We’ve shown what we can do during covid, we’ve shown what we can do when we have some additional funding.”\n\nThe city also opened a new safety center modeled on its covid-response base to counter gun violence. Employees from across city departments are working together on safety issues for the first time by tracking data, connecting people in highest-risk areas to services, and supporting local efforts such as funding neighborhood block clubs and restoring safe spaces.\n\nSeparately, neighborhood-based organizations created to handle covid contact tracing and education are shifting focus to address food security, violence prevention, and diabetes education. Arwady said she hopes to continue grassroots public health efforts in areas with long-standing health disparities by using a patchwork of grants to retain 150 of the 600 people initially hired through pandemic relief dollars.\n\n“The message I’ve really been telling my team is, ‘This is our opportunity to do things that we have long wanted to do,’” Arwady said. “We built some of that up and I just, I’m gonna kick and scream before I let that all get dismantled.”\n\nBack in Montana, Desnick said not every change relies on funding.\n\nWhen flooding destroyed buildings and infrastructure in and around Yellowstone National Park in June, the Park County health department used a list of contacts gathered during the pandemic to send updates to schools, churches, and businesses.\n\nDesnick posts regular public health video updates that began with covid case counts and broadened to include information on flood levels, federal cleanup assistance, and ice cream socials for people to meet first responders.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nPiccolo, the county’s health director, spent roughly an hour on that day in July going to hotels in Livingston’s core to offer opioid overdose response training and supplies. Three hotel managers took the offer, two asked her to come back later, and one scheduled an all-staff training for later that week. Piccolo plans to extend the program to restaurants and music venues.\n\nIt’s that kind of adaptation to her job that doesn’t require the continuing flow of covid aid.

Dr. Scott Harris, the state health officer, said excluding backlogged cases, the state reported more than 3,000 additional virus cases Wednesday, a new daily record. The state also reported having 1,801 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the highest number since the pandemic began. “There is simply a great deal of community transmission occurring right now in most parts of Alabama. Now, more than ever, we hope that Alabamians can avoid large gatherings, wear masks in public and try to maintain a 6-foot distance from other households whenever possible,” Harris said. About 1 in 3 patients in intensive care units in the state has COVID-19, said Dr. Don Williamson, the former state health officer who now heads the Alabama Hospital Association. Only 10% of the state’s 1,634 intensive care beds were available Monday, Williamson said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A second inmate at a prison experiencing a coronavirus outbreak has died from complications related to COVID-19, as the total number of active cases at the state’s largest prison has reached 480, the Alaska Department of Corrections said Tuesday. The 77-year-old with underlying health issues, who was serving sentences for sexual abuse and release violations, died Monday after being taken to a Palmer hospital Nov. 22, the department said. Both prisoners who’ve died of the virus in the state were inmates at Goose Creek Correctional Center near Wasilla, which has been experiencing an outbreak. The department said it offered tests to about 1,300 inmates at the prison to try to find undetected cases. Results brought the facility’s active case count to 480, with results in 120 cases pending and another roughly 190 inmates considered recovered, the department said. Sarah Gallagher, a department spokesperson, said it “can only offer and recommend testing” – not require it – but she said there were few refusals to be tested.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Top hospital officials across Arizona urged the state Wednesday to take more action to stop the spread of COVID-19, making a bleak projection that the health care system could go beyond capacity later this month. Gov. Doug Ducey acknowledged that “the numbers in Arizona are heading in the wrong direction,” but he declined to order a statewide mask mandate, curfew or business lockdown. “I don’t think the right answer is to throw hundreds of thousands of Arizonans out of work right before the holidays,” Ducey said. Better enforcement of existing restrictions on restaurants, bars and gyms, along with local mask mandates and good hygiene, are sufficient, he said. Businesses that skirt safety protocols will face closure after a second offense, he said. Banner Health, the state’s largest health system, is predicting it could surpass its hospital bed capacity as early as next week and 125% of bed capacity by mid-December.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A White House panel said in a report released Wednesday that Arkansas remains in the “red zone” for new coronavirus cases as the state set a new record for COVID-19 hospitalizations for the fourth day in a row. The White House Coronavirus Task Force said Arkansas last week ranked 24th in the country for new cases per capita. The state’s test positivity ranked 30th, according to the panel. The panel said 88% of the state’s counties have moderate or high levels of community transmission of the virus. The report said cases may be reaching a plateau in Arkansas, but the percentage of nursing homes with at least one coronavirus-positive staff member and positive residents is increasing. The panel again recommended restaurants in the state limit indoor dining capacity to less than 25%, a proposal Gov. Asa Hutchinson has previously rejected. The number of people hospitalized because of COVID-19 increased Wednesday by 14 to a new high of 1,088, the Department of Health said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state will likely order most of its businesses to close or limit capacity in the coming days, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday, as part of new rules triggered when less than 15% of beds are available in intensive care units for regional hospital networks. Newsom said four of the state’s five regions – excluding the San Francisco Bay Area – will meet that threshold within a day or two. When they do, the state will order the closure of all hair salons and barbershops; bars, breweries and distilleries; casinos; and indoor and outdoor playgrounds. Restaurants would be limited to takeout and delivery only, while retailers must limit customers inside their stories to 20% capacity during the busy holiday shopping season. California on Wednesday reported more than 20,000 new coronavirus cases, the most ever in one day. A record 8,500 people are in hospitals, including more than 2,000 in intensive care units, leaving the state with fewer than 2,000 available intensive care beds.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The ACLU of Colorado and a county sheriff’s office have reached an agreement to implement measures at the county’s jail to better protect inmates from the coronavirus pandemic. Weld County Sheriff Steve Reams and the ACLU have asked a federal judge to enter a consent decree between the two sides to officially implement the changes and provide federal oversight. The ACLU had filed a lawsuit in April alleging that the sheriff’s office had failed to meet public health orders related to the pandemic and did not sufficiently protect inmates, jail staff and the public. As part of the agreement, the jail is required to promote social distancing, require and distribute masks to all people in the jail, conduct coronavirus testing pursuant to U.S. Centers for Disease Control guidelines, and isolate medically vulnerable inmates while monitoring them regularly. The jail also agreed, with limited exceptions, to prevent inmates charged with misdemeanor, municipal or petty crimes from being held in the facility. The county sheriff will also be required to regularly advise officers to minimize custodial arrests.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Lyme: Nearly two dozen inmates at the state’s only women’s prison recently tested positive for the coronavirus, prompting a partial lockdown, Department of Correction officials said. There were 14 infected inmates with symptoms at York Correctional Institution in East Lyme and another nine inmates who tested positive but had no symptoms as of Wednesday evening, department spokeswoman Karen Martucci said. All of them were in medical isolation, she said. The partial lockdown at York, which houses nearly 500 inmates, includes restrictions on prisoners’ movements and a temporary suspension of in-person, non-contact social visits. Martucci said inmates are still able to use the phone and take showers every day, and free video conferencing has been made available. The facility was undergoing a deep cleaning, officials said. Statewide, more than 290 inmates and nearly 140 employees currently have COVID-19. Since the pandemic began, nearly 1,750 state inmates have tested positive for the virus, and eight have died, according to the latest Correction Department data. More than 9,200 inmates are detained in state prisons.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Several key indicators of the spread of COVID-19 in the state have reached or eclipsed spring records. Delaware on Thursday reported 754 new cases, the most ever in a single day. The greatest single-day case count in the spring was 487 on May 10, and that number has been surpassed nine times this fall. The seven-day average of daily confirmed cases has set a record in each of the past five days, climbing to 555.7 on Thursday. The recent spike cannot be solely attributed to increased testing. Although Delaware has administered about 7,000 tests per day over the past week, a dramatic increase over the roughly 1,500 tests performed daily in May, the percentage of tests that are positive is rising, too. The state reported a seven-day average of 8% of tests that are positive as of Nov. 30, the highest it’s been this fall. A week earlier, the figure was 6.1%. There are currently 277 people hospitalized in Delaware due to COVID-19, the most since May 12. At his weekly COVID-19 press briefing Tuesday, Gov. John Carney said the state is considering implementing new restrictions.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: For the second time in a week, D.C. has tallied more than 300 new cases of the coronavirus in a single day, WUSA-TV reports. Thursday marked only the third time ever that the district’s daily COVID-19 case count has exceeded 300. And for the first time ever, the city is now averaging more than 200 new cases of the virus a day. There are also indications that the city’s coronavirus testing capacity hasn’t been able to keep pace. The average positivity rate for tests has been steadily rising and now sits at 5.6%, 2.6 percentage points higher than it was a month ago. Since Nov. 21, average wait times for test results have increased by a full day. Some of that may ease as labs work through the glut of tests from the Thanksgiving holiday, but since labs nationwide are reporting difficult keeping up with testing demand, it’s likely wait times will remain elevated for the near term.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Residents in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities will be the first to get a coronavirus vaccine when the state begins receiving it later this month, Gov. Ron DeSantis said. The Republican governor’s priorities, announced in in a video Wednesday evening, largely reflect the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We want to get as much vaccine for our citizens as possible, but we know we will not, nor will any state, have enough to vaccinate everyone right off the bat,” DeSantis said in the three-minute video. He said long-term care residents are most vulnerable to the virus. Through Tuesday, there have been 7,376 confirmed deaths from the virus among residents and staff at long-term care facilities. Overall, COVID-19 is blamed for more than 19,000 deaths in Florida and more than 1 million confirmed infections. On Thursday, the state reported 10,870 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 100 new deaths from COVID-19. There were 4,280 people hospitalized, up 75 from the day before.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Leaders of some of the state’s hospitals told Gov. Brian Kemp in a meeting Wednesday that they’re seeing increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients, although they said in some cases those infected with the coronavirus do not appear as gravely ill as patients who were hospitalized in earlier waves. The Republican governor continued to express optimism about Georgia’s level of infection compared to other states, as well as about vaccines on the horizon. But some hospital leaders warned that they expect things to keep getting worse, while many said that they struggle to hire nurses and that staff members are exhausted nearly nine months into the pandemic. “I think it’s important for all of us to stay grounded that this third surge is very different than the first and the second ones,” said Bryce Gartland of Atlanta-based Emory Healthcare. “This one is much more insidious in nature. It’s much more building in nature.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A seniors advocacy group has called on the state Department of Health to release more information about nursing home inspections after a coronavirus outbreak at a veterans home caused at least 27 deaths earlier this year. Kokua Council asked the state to put all its inspection reports of long-term care facilities on the health department’s website. The inspection report for the Yukio Okutsu State Veterans Home, where at least 71 residents and 35 employees were infected with the virus, has not yet been made public. The facility had been fined twice since 2018 for health violations. The owners of Yukio Okutsu were accused of improperly restraining residents who did not require restraints, failing to adequately supervise residents showering, serving expired food, allowing a resident to fall off a bed and break a hip, and incidents in which staffers accidentally caused minor injuries. Several residents were found to have left without supervision, including one case in which a resident in a wheelchair was found 3 miles away before anyone realized the resident was missing, according to a 2018 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services inspection.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Residents will have increased access to broadband service following a state investment of nearly $50 million in federal coronavirus recovery funds. Idaho paid for 102 projects with the money, which will connect about 40,000 Idaho households to broadband service, Boise State Public Radio reports. The state funded projects to provide free wireless internet in schools and public spaces, including downtown areas and parks, plus more than 50 rural libraries. A report by the Pew Research Trusts said Idaho was one of a handful of states without a broadband grant program before the pandemic. Georgia Dimmick, disaster recovery coordinator at Region IV Development in Twin Falls, helped several communities apply for broadband grants over the summer. Eden, a community of 400 residents in Jerome County, received nearly $3 million to bring service to more homes to address the impact of the pandemic and the lack of broadband service for its youth. “There was like 20 or 30 kids out on the front yard at the high school because they didn’t have internet at their house, and they had to get their homework done,” Dimmick said.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: State public health officials reported 10,959 newly confirmed cases of coronavirus illness Thursday and a second consecutive day of near-record deaths. The 192 fatalities from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, matched the toll from May 13, at the height of the initial wave of the disease in Illinois. That total is second only to the 238 reported Wednesday. The Illinois Department of Public Health said some data reported this week was delayed by the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Illinois has now suffered 12,830 deaths among 759,562 coronavirus infections. Hospitalization numbers continue to decrease slowly, good news particularly because the state’s health care front is bracing for another rush of cases in coming weeks after Thanksgiving travel and congregations.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: As the state faces a longer stretch of COVID-19 illnesses and deaths, the governor and top state health official on Wednesday pinned improvement on personal responsibility and the looming first arrival of vaccines rather than reinstating more statewide precautions. Nearly all of Indiana remained in the greatest-risk categories for coronavirus spread in a state health department update that also showed a new high for average daily COVID-19 deaths for the state. Health officials across the state are worried about hospitals being overwhelmed by the growing number of severely ill patients and a possible new surge tied to Thanksgiving gatherings last week. Indiana hospitals were treating more than 3,400 COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday – about a 350% increase since late September, when the state’s steep increase in hospitalizations and deaths began.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state added another 70 deaths Thursday to the tally of people who died with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours – the largest one-day increase since the pandemic arrived in the state. The state has reported 2,519 total deaths related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. That was an addition of 2,449 since Wednesday, according to the state’s Coronavirus.Iowa.gov website. Prior to Thursday, the largest one-day death increase was 47, which was reported Nov. 25. Although the deaths were reported since Wednesday, none occurred in December. Since noon Monday, an additional 107 deaths in November have been reported, bringing that month’s total to 718. The majority of the 70 newly reported deaths – 61 – happened in November, according to the Iowa Department of Public Health. Eight additional deaths were reported from October. The earliest death that is newly reported is from Aug. 26.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Shawnee County on Thursday rejected part of the new federal and state guidelines for shortening the time people are quarantined after they’re possibly exposed to COVID-19. New guidance Wednesday from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said people who’ve been exposed to coronavirus and show no symptoms but don’t get tested can end their quarantines after 10 days, instead of 14. The new guidance also said a person without symptoms who tests negative can end a quarantine after seven days. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment adopted that guidance, though its top administrator, Dr. Lee Norman, said it is still urging people to remain quarantined for 14 days. Shawnee County will allow people without COVID-19 symptoms who’ve not been tested to shorten their quarantines to 10 days, Dr. Gianfranco Pezzino, the county’s health officer, said Thursday. But he said it will not allow people who’ve tested negative to leave quarantine after seven days. Pezzino said the testing system is stressed in the county, home to Topeka, and the county does not want to overload it. Also, he said, the spread of COVID-19 remains “uncontrolled” locally.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s death toll from the coronavirus surged Wednesday after another daily record, and some hospitals are being stretched “to the brink” as virus cases escalate, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Beshear reported 37 more virus-related deaths, eclipsing the previous record of 35 deaths posted Tuesday, as the state’s total death count since the start of the pandemic approached 2,000. The latest deaths included people ranging in ages from their 40s to their 90s. Six were under the age of 60. Back-to-back days of record virus deaths underscored the need for people to wear masks and follow other health guidelines, the Democratic governor said. He recently announced new restrictions on in-person gatherings at restaurants, schools and event venues to combat the virus. Those actions sparked criticism from Republican lawmakers, business owners and private schools. “We are not surrendering. We are fighting back,” Beshear said Wednesday. “That’s not always going to be popular. It’s going to be difficult.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A health care worker and an academic are warning that testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections is being neglected during the coronavirus pandemic. Joseph Olsen, an HIV testing manager at a clinic in New Orleans, told WDSU-TV on Wednesday that the clinic has performed 2,000 HIV tests since the pandemic began. Before the virus outbreak, he said the clinic usually did up to 12,000 tests in a year. “Coronavirus parallels HIV. They do not care who you are; they just do what viruses do and spread,” Olsen said. Some HIV testing sites have closed as clinics shifted to telemedicine during the pandemic, said Meredith Clement, a professor at Louisiana State University’s Health Sciences Center. Olsen said his clinic, Crescent Care, has increased at-home testing kits and is offering walk-up testing.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Gov. Janet Mills said Wednesday that the number of doses of the new coronavirus vaccine that the state could receive later this month is disappointingly low. Mills, a Democrat, said Maine is slated to get about 12,600 doses of a vaccine by the middle of December. The vaccine requires two doses, which means the shipment could allow the state to vaccinate some 6,300 people. The people at the front of the line for the new vaccine would be health care workers. Mills called the number of doses “far less than what is needed.” She said the state hoped for closer to 36,000 doses in the initial shipment. Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Nirav Shah has said the number of vaccine doses the federal government could ship to the state is a preliminary number that could change.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will receive about 155,000 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine during the first wave of distribution – an amount that will not even cover half of the front-line health care workers who are slated to receive initial immunizations. “That’s a tiny fraction of what we need,” Gov. Larry Hogan said at a news conference Tuesday in Annapolis. “It doesn’t get anywhere near what we need in phase one.” He said state officials learned details of the first phase Tuesday. It’s still unclear whether the 155,000 will represent complete doses of two separate injections or individual injections. Hogan said about 50,000 will come from Pfizer and the remainder from Moderna. “The good news is they have vaccines that are years ahead of schedule, and we’ll get some relatively fast,” Hogan said. “The bad news is it’s not enough. So we have some difficult decisions ... about the implementation and rollout of the plan.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A 220-bed field hospital at a sports and convention center in Worcester is scheduled to open Sunday, and the state is already working on establishing a second to care for an expected torrent of coronavirus patients, Gov. Charlie Baker said Thursday. “Field hospitals play a critical role in our preparedness strategy that helps us alleviate pressure on the health care system generally and enable hospitals to focus on non-COVID patients,” the Republican governor said after touring the field hospital set up at the DCU Center in Worcester and run by UMass Memorial Health Care. The visit came a day after the state reported 4,613 new cases of the coronavirus, the highest single-day total since the pandemic began, with nearly 1,300 patients in the hospital. In addition to all the medical equipment and amenities its needs to care for patients, the Worcester facility also has some features aimed at helping patients dealing with the isolation they often feel because family can’t visit, including common areas and exercise bicycles, said Dr. Eric Dickson, president of UMass Memorial Health Care.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Thursday that her administration may extend portions of a three-week partial shutdown of schools and businesses next week because of the “sheer volume” of coronavirus cases in Michigan. The Democratic governor said no decision had been made, but hospitals can’t be overrun with COVID-19 patients. Although the infection curve has leveled off, it is a “dangerous moment” for the state, she said. “As we get a few more days of information under our belts, we’ll be in a much stronger position to really assess if there are some things that maybe are safer to do,” Whitmer said during a news conference in which she reported continued progress addressing virus-related racial disparities. The state health department’s order closed high schools to in-person instruction, stopped organized sports, prohibited indoor restaurant dining, and closed various entertainment businesses such as movie theaters and bowling alleys. It will end late Tuesday unless extended, which was commonplace for stay-at-home and other restrictions earlier in the pandemic.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz and public safety officials pleaded Wednesday for Minnesotans to follow coronavirus safety guidelines to protect their local police, fire and ambulance services, which have been hit hard by staff shortages amid the surge in cases. Jay Wood, a firefighter from Plato, a town of about 300 people about 45 miles west of Minneapolis, said his 20-person all-volunteer department had to shut down last month because most members had tested positive for the virus or been exposed. One had to be hospitalized. And he said departments large and small across Minnesota face similar challenges. “Just like we preach about fire safety, one little spark can cause a fire. And that’s exactly what happened to us,” Wood said at the governor’s briefing. “COVID-19 sparked an outbreak at the Plato Fire Department. Before we knew it, over three-quarters of our fire department had been affected in one way or another from the virus.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state reported its single-day record of nearly 2,500 new coronavirus cases Wednesday as the state health department issued an advisory saying people should avoid social gatherings, including weddings, funerals, sporting events and in-person religious services. “Where we are in the pandemic right now, just to be very clear, it’s nonessential social activities that are absolutely undermining the health and well-being of our state,” Dr. Thomas Dobbs, the state health officer, said during a news conference. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves has declined to reinstate a statewide mask mandate that expired two months ago, but he has issued mask mandates for 54 of the state’s 82 counties where virus transmission is highest. Many physicians have called on the governor to require masks statewide in public places. Dobbs said Wednesday that the mask conversation “is distracting from the real threat” of spreading the virus through nonessential gatherings. He said people let down their guard and hug others at parties or funerals, often without their faces covered.\n\nMissouri\n\nLiberty: The state plans to bring in hundreds of health care workers from other states to help provide care as already-stretched hospitals prepare for a possible increase in COVID-19 cases resulting from the Thanksgiving holiday. Gov. Mike Parson and Herb Kuhn, president and CEO of the Missouri Hospital Association, announced Wednesday that the state will partner with Vizient, a private national health care company, to recruit up to 760 more health care workers for Missouri. Kuhn said the partnership comes as early data have raised concerns about a possible surge in new COVID-19 cases because of Thanksgiving travel. He said data showed Missourians’ travel for recreation and retail increased an average of 40% daily from Nov. 23 to Thanksgiving Day. The workers will include registered nurses, respiratory therapists and certified nurse assistants. When fully deployed, the plan will add nearly 600 hospital beds to Missouri’s statewide bed capacity, Parson said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock said Wednesday that the state could receive about 9,750 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine developed by drug company Pfizer as soon as Dec. 15. Both Pfizer and Moderna have applied for emergency authorization for their vaccines. Once it’s granted, the state is slated to receive thousands of additional doses in subsequent weeks, Bullock said. The state has between 45,000 and 60,000 health care workers and 10,000 residents and staff members at long-term care facilities, who will have first access to the vaccine once it is available. The focus of the first allotment will be health care workers, the governor said. Bullock said during a news conference that the state is slated to use all $1.25 billion in federal coronavirus relief allocated to the state in the spring, and he called on Congress to pass another relief measure to help the state address economic and health-related challenges once the deadline for spending the original allocation passes at the end of the month. “This is a storm that cannot be weathered without federal support,” Bullock said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: City leaders across the state find they’re left with the onus of whether to require masks as the governor continues to resist issuing a statewide mask mandate in the face of a raging coronavirus pandemic. The Omaha suburb of Papillion was slated to vote Thursday on a proposal to require masks in public buildings, after two consecutive nights of public debate over the proposal. The Papillion Board of Health has recommended the mask mandate, and several medical workers and educators – two professions hit particularly hard by the outbreak – spoke in favor of a mandate at meetings Tuesday and Wednesday, the Omaha World-Herald reports. More than a dozen people spoke against the proposal, including laundromat owner Peter Mayberry, believed to be the first person in Omaha ticketed for violating that city’s mask mandate. In Grand Island, police made clear this week that they will enforce the city’s mandate passed last week, including charging violators with public nuisance counts. On Wednesday, the state reported 48 more coronavirus deaths and 2,336 new coronavirus cases.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The state reported 48 new deaths from the coronavirus Thursday, marking the deadliest day since the onset of the pandemic. Nevada also reported 2,536 new confirmed virus cases, bringing the statewide totals to 159,532 cases and 2,249 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Nevada is more than a week into what Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak coined a “statewide pause” involving virus prevention measures, with the number of customers businesses can accept and the number of people allowed in gatherings reduced to 25% of fire codes limit. Meanwhile, state officials said they plan to revise their coronavirus vaccine distribution plan to align with interim recommendations that a U.S. Centers for Disease Control committee issued Tuesday. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that the first available doses go to nursing home residents and health care workers. In Nevada, where tourism and hospitality fuel the economy, officials initially assigned residents of long-term care facilities third-tier priority, behind retail workers, teachers, police officers and airport operators.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Senate Democrats are pressing Republican Gov. Chris Sununu to address a COVID-19 outbreak at the New Hampshire Veterans Home that has left 15 residents dead. Senate Minority Leader Donna Soucy and Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, both of Manchester, sent a letter to the governor Thursday saying they are deeply disturbed by what they view as a lack of action at the 250-bed nursing home in Tilton. Since the virus was first detected at the home Nov. 10, 53 residents and 64 staff members have tested positive, and 15 veterans have died. The senators called for the implementation of a plan to prevent further spread of the virus, address staffing shortages and ensure the availability of personal protective equipment. “The staff at the New Hampshire Veterans Home are risking their health and safety simply to do their jobs and care for our veterans,” they wrote. “This is unacceptable.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s COVID-19 caseload surged Thursday to levels not seen even during the height of the spring outbreak, with Gov. Phil Murphy and experts warning things could get worse. The state recorded about 4,900 new cases overnight as New Jersey weathers another wave of the outbreak, Murphy, a Democrat, said Thursday in a tweet. The increase comes as weeklong averages of new cases have climbed steadily for weeks. The Democratic governor also reported 64 new deaths overnight, putting the toll at 15,373. Murphy said Wednesday he’s keeping “all options on the table” when it comes to closing parts of the state’s economy again, as he ordered in the spring. He urged people to be especially vigilant with Christmas coming up. “This is Grinch times five. Don’t travel,” he said Wednesday, urging people even to keep their distance from Santa. “Santa’s got to wear a face covering; you’ve got to wear a face covering.” New Jersey’s hospitalizations topped 3,000, Murphy said – a level not seen since May.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: City officials are planning a crackdown on illegal street racing and other disruptive driving that has accompanied the coronavirus pandemic and say they’ll seek new regulations to help them. It’s just one of many safety concerns as state health officials on Wednesday reported a record-setting 40 virus-related deaths across New Mexico. Interim Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina said Wednesday during a telephone town hall event that the city is expanding late-night patrols in response to reckless driving including racing and will lobby state lawmakers for stiffer penalties for repeat offenders on par with sanctions for driving while intoxicated. He described a rash of complaints about drag racing, loud mufflers and tire-squealing maneuvers. Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller believes the speedway phenomenon extends to many communities nationwide. “This is happening all over the country, and it’s because of COVID,” Keller said.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city is setting up plans to distribute COVID-19 vaccines starting this month, including making sure hospitals have the ultracold freezers needed to store the Pfizer vaccine, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that he hopes to receive 170,000 doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine Dec. 15, with additional vaccine shipments from Pfizer and Moderna within weeks. Health care workers and nursing home residents and workers will be prioritized in the first wave of vaccinations, Cuomo said. New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi noted that while the Moderna vaccine can be stored at normal freezer temperatures, the Pfizer vaccine requires ultracold storage at minus 80 degrees Celsius. Chokshi said more than 50 city hospitals either currently have access to ultracold storage or will have ultracold freezers delivered soon, for a total citywide storage capacity of at least 1.5 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nYoungsville: The town is planning to hold a Christmas parade despite concerns from county health officials that the event could facilitate the spread of the coronavirus. The Raleigh News & Observer reports Youngsville plans a mile-long parade with up to 300 people watching. Those who are expected to attend include a volleyball team, a plumbing company and a hair salon. The town has faced repeated warnings from the Franklin County Health Department, which warned that COVID-19 cases are reaching record highs locally. The county also said the parade would violate Gov. Roy Cooper’s executive order limiting crowds. Town Manager Phil Cordeiro told county officials that Youngsville’s parade falls under the same First Amendment exemption that allowed Raleigh protests this year. He also said the parade is a permitted religious service because it starts in the parking lot of a church. “It’s just been a really bad year, and we’re trying to do something to lighten people’s spirits and give them a little hope,” Mayor Fonzie Flowers told the newspaper. “We don’t want it to be a situation where people don’t feel safe.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State lawmakers decided Thursday to require masks at the Capitol, despite opposition by far-right members of the Republican-controlled Legislature. Senate and House lawmakers approved rules Thursday for the session that convenes Jan. 5. House Majority Leader Chet Pollert and Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner said they support a mask mandate at Capitol legislative spaces to help protect lawmakers and the public. A memo written to the Legislature by its lawyers said the lawmakers have the authority to impose restrictions on areas of the Capitol controlled by the legislative branch. Lawmakers who ignore the mandate may be removed by law enforcement and charged with a misdemeanor crime or expelled from the Legislature. Gov. Doug Burgum imposed a mandate in November after months of refraining from such an order, hoping to stem a coronavirus surge that is among the worst in the U.S. and threatens to overwhelm the state’s hospitals.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state will receive close to 100,000 doses of the coronavirus vaccine by mid-December, Gov. Mike DeWine announced during a briefing Thursday. The brief but promising details provided the first look at what vaccine distribution will look like in Ohio as the number of cases, deaths and hospitalizations continue to rise at staggering rates. The Pfizer drug requires two doses for each person taking the vaccine, meaning the initial distribution will only affect about 49,000 Ohioans. Also Thursday, DeWine made good on earlier threats and vetoed a bill that would restrict the state Health Department’s abilities to issue public health orders during emergencies. The governor said he would provide further details about the state’s vaccine plan Friday but disclosed the partnership the state will have with CVS and Walgreens pharmacies to provide the vaccine to nursing home patients and staff. “This is a huge, logistical operation made particularly more challenging by the necessity of keeping the vaccine super cold,” DeWine said during the briefing. “We’re going to report the best we can about the progress. We’ll be transparent.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The first shipment of a coronavirus vaccine is expected in the state in about 10 days, with health care workers and long-term care providers and residents receiving the first doses, state health commissioner Dr. Lance Frye said Thursday. Federal health officials are also working to provide vaccine to long-term care facility staff and residents, according to deputy health commissioner Keith Reed. Frye said emergency use approval of the vaccine developed by Pfizer is expected Dec. 11, and 33,000 initial doses should arrive in Oklahoma two or three days later, with shipment of a second, required dose expected about three weeks later. Emergency approval of a similar vaccine developed by Moderna is also anticipated, and about 10,000 doses are expected by the end of December, Frye said. The state’s plan places first responders such as paramedics, police officers and firefighters in addition to the elderly and those at high risk in the second phase of people to receive the vaccine. School students, teachers and staff are in the third phase of those to receive the vaccine, then the general public.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: An 11-person COVID-19 outbreak at the Wilsonville office of the Oregon Employment Department will likely cause further delays in handling claims, officials said. The outbreak “will cause real disruptions in our ability to get work at the pace we have been,” said David Gerstenfeld, acting director of the department, which has already been dealing with a backlog. Agency officials said many of the office’s 600 employees will soon work from home. Health authorities have not advised the office to close, Gerstenfeld said. But Gov. Kate Brown’s COVID-19 safety orders require employers to allow work-from-home options when possible. The department has made significant progress in enabling remote work and establishing safety protocols, Gerstenfeld said. He said he expects hundreds of Wilsonville employees to work from home in the future, but some lack adequate internet service. As part of Brown’s proposed budget and policy agenda announced Tuesday, she wants $146 million to replace the employment department’s computer systems and implement a new paid family and medical leave program.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Hospital beds are filling up, and medical staffs are being stretched to the limit, as Pennsylvania’s health care system copes with a growing number of seriously ill COVID-19 patients. Nearly half of all hospitals in the south-central region of the state and a third of those in the southwest anticipate staffing shortages within a week, according to the state Department of Health. Nurses in the Philadelphia area say they’re overloaded with COVID-19 patients, limiting the quality of care they can provide. And Pennsylvania’s top health official, Dr. Rachel Levine, said Thursday that she’s worried about modeling that shows the state will run out of intensive care beds this month. More than 85% of the state’s ICU beds are occupied amid an enormous statewide spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations this fall. The health secretary added that she’s even more concerned about hospital staffing. While medical-surgical beds can be converted into ICU beds, the supply of medical workers is “not infinite.” On Thursday, Pennsylvania reported more than 5,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the state’s highest point in the pandemic and up from a statewide average of about 450 at the end of September.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Nearly 30,000 doses of coronavirus vaccines will arrive in the state before the end of month, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Thursday. The term-limited Democrat also declared she wouldn’t be President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for health and human services secretary, dispelling speculation that’s ramped up in recent weeks as Biden forms his Cabinet. “My focus is right here in Rhode Island,” the governor said near the end of her weekly coronavirus briefing. Meanwhile, early reports from the state’s two-week economic “pause” imposed Monday are encouraging, Raimondo said. She said restaurants and bars appear to be following the new rules on their industry, which include reduced capacity limits for in-person dining and shuttering bar areas to patrons. Raimondo also said road travel appeared lighter, and officials have received no credible reports of large parties. She said she’s hopeful the restrictions will lead to a decline in COVID-19 cases in the next couple of weeks. At the same time, Raimondo said, she hasn’t ruled out extending the temporary restrictions, currently slated to run through Dec. 13.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s Republican leaders made no major changes Wednesday to their main House committees, and the group that handles the budget remains stuck with the same problems, only this time it’s looking at steep cuts due to the coronavirus pandemic. Republican Rep. Murrell Smith of Sumter was reelected chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, two years after House Speaker Jay Lucas wielded his power to make committee assignments for all members and kicked Rep. Brian White off the powerful panel he led for eight years. Smith told his committee they will have to immediately deal with the budget, as economists can’t guarantee that tax and other revenue estimates slashed by the COVID-19 economic downturn will be enough to avoid budget cuts before this spending plan ends in June.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s COVID-19 death toll surged past 1,000 on Thursday, with 38 additional deaths, the Department of Health reported. The additional deaths brought the total to 1,033, and they included a person between 20 and 29 years old, which has been a rarity. So far, three people in that age range have died with COVID-19, while 15,656 in that age range have tested positive for the coronavirus. The new deaths brought December’s total to 87 so far, after a November in which deaths went from 425 to 946. The department reported 1,145 new coronavirus infections, along with 490 newly recovered infections. The number of active infections increased to 15,474. The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 rose from 531 to 538. The peak for hospitalizations was set Nov. 10, with 607.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials have expanded a mental health hotline during COVID-19 times to extend support to teachers. The Department of Education says the hotline provides free and confidential support from trained volunteer mental health professionals to people experiencing increased anxiety and stress due to the pandemic. Officials say the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services set up the hotline in May for health care workers and first responders on the front lines of the pandemic. The department partnered with the Mental Health Active Response Team; the Tennessee Association of Alcohol, Drug, and other Addictions Services; and the Tennessee chapter of the National Association of Social Workers. With the expansion, educators are now eligible for the services as well. The hotline is available at 888-642-7886 daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Central time.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Mayor Steve Adler went on vacation to Mexico with family in November as he urged people to stay home amid worsening coronavirus caseloads in Texas, at one point recording a video during the trip in which he told residents back home that now was “not the time to relax.” The trip revealed Wednesday is the latest example of a public official who has pleaded for vigilance in the face of rising cases and hospitalizations across the U.S. seeming not to heed their own guidance. Hours after the story was published, Adler issued a statement apologizing for the trip. “While I violated no orders or guidelines, I regret this travel,” Adler said. “I wouldn’t travel now, didn’t over Thanksgiving and won’t over Christmas. But my fear is that this travel, even having happened during a safer period, could be used by some as justification for risky behavior. In hindsight, it set a bad example, for which I apologize.” The trip to Cabo San Lucas came after Adler hosted an outdoor wedding and reception with 20 guests for his daughter at a hotel near downtown. Adler said the attendees had to take a rapid COVID-19 test and maintain social distancing. He acknowledged, however, that although masks were distributed at the wedding, all guests were “probably not” wearing them all the time.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Gary Herbert said Thursday that the state plans to prioritize front-line health care workers after it receives its first round of coronavirus vaccine doses that could arrive as early as mid-December. The first doses in Utah will go to front-line workers such as doctors and nurses in emergency departments, urgent care facilities and COVID-19 units, as well as housekeeping workers, said Dr. Jeanmarie Mayer, chief of infection prevention at the University of Utah Health hospital. “It’s just so incredibly important to make sure that we keep our health care systems intact and able to care for the most vulnerable in our populations,” Mayer told reporters. Public health experts have warned that if people do not follow masking and social distancing guidance, COVID-19 hospitalizations will further overwhelm the state’s already strained health care system. In Utah, 1 in 173 people was diagnosed with COVID-19 over the past week, and the state is ranked eighth in the country for new cases per capita, according to data from Johns Hopkins.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state’s tax department is forecasting a 9% increase in education property taxes, mostly because of the pandemic. The forecast assists lawmakers and administration officials in planning for a budget and gives them a preview of education tax yields for homeowners and the non-homestead tax rate for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The forecast indicates a lack of spending at local stores, restaurants and hotels translates to an estimated $40 million shortfall in the education fund. Tax Commissioner Craig Bolio called it “one of the largest-single year increases in the average homestead rate in the last decade.” But he said the numbers aren’t final, and the economic picture could improve depending on how the state does in curbing the virus and getting more people back to work. “The governor and administration do not believe this is a tenable tax increase for Vermonters who are working hard to recover from the pandemic, nor for the Vermont economy which continues to struggle due to the pandemic-related disruption,” Bolio wrote.\n\nVirginia\n\nRustburg: Officials in Campbell County have passed a resolution expressing opposition to the governor’s new safety guidelines that aim to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The Lynchburg News & Advance reports the county’s supervisors on Tuesday declared it to be a “First Amendment sanctuary.” The resolution is considered mostly symbolic and is similar to a Second Amendment sanctuary resolution passed by the county’s board more than a year ago. Gov. Ralph Northam’s executive order limits indoor and outdoor gatherings to no more than 25 people. It also directs restaurants and bars to halt alcohol sales at 10 p.m. and close by midnight. The county’s resolution claims the Democratic governor’s mandate is in violation of the state’s constitution and seeks to oppose enforcement of his executive order. It asks the sheriff’s office to “not assist any state law enforcement officer, state health agent or federal agent” attempting to enforce the order. The Virginia Department of Health enforces the governor’s mandates, not local law enforcement agencies.\n\nWashington\n\nLittle Boston: A COVID-19 outbreak on the Port Gamble S’Klallam Reservation in North Kitsap has spread to at least 13 people and forced nearly 50 close contacts into isolation. The tribe said in an announcement that the 13 positive tests had come over the weekend through Tuesday, saying nearly 10% of the households on the reservation needed to quarantine. “It did not need to be this way,” the tribe said in a pointed update on its Facebook page, connecting the spread of the virus on the reservation to group gatherings during Thanksgiving week. “This past week, people got complacent,” the announcement said. “They had dinners. They got together with loved ones. We’re now seeing the consequences of those actions. If you’re one of the affected, this notice is not meant to shame – we hope for a quick and uneventful recovery. It is important though that we all, as a community, learn from where we find ourselves right now.” The tribe was an early adopter in setting up a community testing site in May and has continued to test its employees and community members since then.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state debuted a partnership for free home-based saliva coronavirus testing Wednesday. The testing kits from Vault Health can be requested on the state’s coronavirus website. Results are expected in 24 to 48 hours after individuals send their test sample back in the mail. Officials said there are no restrictions on who can request the tests. Gov. Jim Justice announced the news as the state reported 20 additional deaths linked to COVID-19, bringing the total to at least 778 deaths. There were 678 new confirmed cases, for a total of 49,905. Forty-seven of the state’s 55 counties are classified with the state’s most severe infection rate with 25 or more positive cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said he expects the first doses of a coronavirus vaccine from Pfizer to reach the state Dec. 14. He acknowledged that a focus on increasing testing in the state has not brought the outbreak under control.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers told President Donald Trump and the state’s congressional delegation Thursday that Wisconsin needs $466 million by April to pay for vaccine distribution, coronavirus testing, contact tracing, hospitals and a public health awareness campaign. Evers, a Democrat, made the plea amid talks with Republican state lawmakers on COVID-19 proposals but with no agreement or immediate action in sight. Evers also wrote to the head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services asking that Wisconsin be prioritized for vaccine distribution so the state’s 450,000 health care workers can be vaccinated. Wisconsin is expected to receive nearly 50,000 doses of vaccine within weeks. The state is nearing 400,000 total cases of COVID-19 even as new positive tests begin to slow from a peak in mid-November. There were 4,618 new cases reported Thursday, bringing the total to 399,708 cases. There were 60 new deaths, for a total of 3,562.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: An oil and gas stimulus program in the state has shown promising initial results in helping operators recover from the economic downturn caused in part by the pandemic, officials said. Gov. Mark Gordon created the Wyoming Energy Rebound Program to give companies money needed to complete specific projects placed on hold because of the pandemic, including plugging and abandoning wells, as well as drilling uncompleted wells, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Republican governor announced last month that he would dedicate $15 million in federal coronavirus relief funds to create the program. He later doubled the amount to $30 million in response to high demand. “This is a great and appropriate use of CARES Act money to respond to the devastating effects of the pandemic on our economy,” Randall Luthi, chief energy advisor to Gordon, said in a statement. “The oil and gas operators responded quickly and they need to act quickly in the near future.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/01/12/back-class-late-night-shots-library-hero-news-around-states/115283634/", "title": "Back in class, late-night shots: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: The top academic officer at Auburn University is facing a no-confidence vote this week by faculty members over lingering dissatisfaction with his handling of class scheduling around the coronavirus pandemic. The Opelika-Auburn News reports the University Senate is scheduled to meet Tuesday to address complaints against Provost Bill Hardgrave, who is being defended by President Jay Gouge. More than 500 faculty members met in a virtual gathering in November to discuss their concerns about Hardgrave and his insistence on returning to primarily in-person classes in the spring. Economics professor Mike Stern said Wednesday that his concerns still haven’t been adequately addressed. Hardgrave and other officials need to better assess teaching spaces and how to follow health guidelines about social distancing, he said. “I volunteered to teach face-to-face in the fall and spring (of the 2020-21 school year) and they promised it would be safe,” Stern said. “Then, they did the opposite.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The usual transportation difficulties in rural Alaska have presented unique obstacles for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, officials said. Dozens of remote villages lack hospitals and road connections, while ultracold freezers required for storage of specific varieties of the vaccine are essentially nonexistent, Alaska Public Media reports. Tribal health care providers responded by mobilizing a massive effort delivering thousands of doses to remote areas. Providers airlifted vaccine to villages using a fleet of chartered planes, while the medicine also was delivered over choppy seas on a water taxi. Some clinicians were shuttled around villages on sleds pulled behind snowmachines. Dr. Ellen Hodges encountered the unforeseen difficulty of Alaska being too cold in some places to vaccinate front-line health care workers. “It became immediately apparent that the vaccine was going to freeze in the metal part of the needle,” said Hodges, who contended with subzero temperatures on a remote Southwest Alaska airport tarmac. Hodges ultimately kept doses tucked in her shirt until they were injected.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: No individuals in the Phoenix metropolitan area’s 12 largest cities have been cited for violating mask mandates. The laws, which have been in place for six months to halt the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, have not been cited at all by Tucson and Flagstaff law enforcement. The Phoenix area police and the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office have cited or referred fewer than 75 businesses out of more than 3,500 total complaints. The city of Scottsdale has cited the most businesses, followed by Tempe and Phoenix. Avondale, Buckeye, Glendale, Goodyear, Peoria and Surprise have also not cited any person or business for violating mandates. The Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health has received more than 400 complaints related to workplace safety as a result of potential violations of state orders, but the agency has not cited any employers to date as of Monday. Meanwhile, the state has among the highest rates of coronavirus cases in the country, and some Phoenix metro hospitals have begun to refuse emergency transports.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of active coronavirus cases in the state remained above 27,000 on Sunday after hitting a record the day earlier. A state health official has said the record-high number of active cases is likely to signal that hospitalizations will increase in coming days. The Arkansas Health Department’s count of active cases was at 27,492 on Sunday, a decline by 330 from a record high of 27,822 on Saturday. Arkansas reported 3,330 new confirmed and probable cases of the coronavirus Sunday, though Gov. Asa Hutchinson said more than 2,000 of those cases were from late reporting months ago. “Regardless, they reflect how this virus impacts all of us,” Hutchinson wrote on Twitter. Researchers from Johns Hopkins University say there were 1,253.5 new cases per 100,000 people in Arkansas over the past two weeks, which ranks sixth in the country for new cases per capita. One in every 148 people in Arkansas tested positive in the past week. The state’s hospitalizations Sunday were at 1,340. The state reported 33 more deaths, bringing the death toll to 4,043.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The state’s coronavirus catastrophe reached a staggering new level Monday as Johns Hopkins University data showed California has recorded more than 30,000 deaths since the pandemic started. Deaths have exploded since a COVID-19 surge began in October. It took the state six months to record its first 10,000 deaths. But in barely a month, the total rose from 20,000 to 30,000. Over the weekend, state officials reported a two-day record of 1,163 deaths. Hospitalizations also have exploded, and many hospitals are stretched to the limit. Over the weekend, Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said the virus’s “immense” spread reflected unsafe things people did during the holidays, making any activity outside a household much more risky. “This is just not the time to go to the shopping mall or to a friend’s house to watch a basketball or football game,” Ferrer said. Meanwhile, the county announced it will stop using Curative COVID-19 tests at pop-up testing sites after a U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert that the test could produce false negatives. And the city announced Sunday that its huge COVID-19 testing site at Dodger Stadium will be transformed into a vaccination center by the week’s end.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Despite some closures due to the pandemic and price increases, state parks recorded a nearly 23% increase in visitors in 2020, with some data from November and December still yet to be logged. The 18.3 million visitors Colorado state parks have reported were up from the 14.8 million total in 2019, The Gazette reports. The record figure is about 53% higher than the agency’s 2013-14 fiscal year, when 11.9 million visitors were counted at the 41 state parks. At Castlewood Canyon, there were a total of 263,744 visitors through November, up more than 56% from a then-record 2017. Lake Pueblo recorded the most visitors with a record 2.7 million people registered from January through October. The state’s other most popular parks were Chatfield, which logged 2.1 million visitors through October, and Cherry Creek State Park, which is expected to log more than 2 million visitors for the first time in its history.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz is under quarantine after a member of her staff tested positive for the coronavirus. Contact tracing is underway, and all members of Bysiewicz’s staff who had been in close contact with the unidentified staffer will also quarantine, said her chief of staff, Adam Joseph. Bysiewicz tested negative Thursday and will work remotely while self-isolating, Joseph said. This is the first known case of coronavirus within her office. The staffer who tested positive has not exhibited any symptoms and is at home in isolation.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: A county library employee who went above and beyond the call of duty during the COVID-19 pandemic has landed a prestigious honor from Sussex County government. Kristin Cooper, assistant director at South Coastal Library in Bethany Beach, is the county’s 2020 Employee of the Year, as selected by the Shining Star Employee Recognition Committee. Cooper was selected from a pool of seven candidates, all quarterly winners or notable honorable mentions, from the past year. She was an honorable mention in the fourth quarter of 2020. The annual honor was announced by Karen Brewington, Sussex County’s human resource director, during last week’s Sussex County Council meeting. Brewington said Cooper was unanimously chosen by the committee because “she went above and beyond to keep the community engaged, strengthened and hopeful during such unprecedented times of COVID.” Cooper was lauded for, among other things, her efforts to keep library patrons connected through virtual resources and programs. As the 2020 honoree, she receives a one-week vacation bonus.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. Public Schools is gearing up to return some students to the classroom next month, and teachers have already received their assignments via email, WUSA-TV reports. When the term starts Feb. 1, teachers will either remain virtual or be assigned to in-person learning, according to the emails. Educators who cannot or will not return to the classroom can apply for leave either through the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Family and Medical Leave Act, DCPS said in a statement. Parents are expected to find out this week if their child meets the high-need criteria for an in-person seat, according to DCPS. Vaccinations for DCPS staff are expected to begin this month. A December survey from the school district showed parents almost evenly split over whether they want to send their children back to school for in-person learning in the new year.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The state’s coronavirus cases remain at record highs, with more than 11,000 new cases reported Monday, along with 163 deaths. The Florida Department of Health reported 11,576 new cases and said the seven-day average for the state is about 15,000 per day. That is about 40% higher that the previous peak of 11,000 reached in July. There were 7,650 people hospitalized in Florida with COVID-19 on Monday morning, a jump of about 150 from Sunday. The state has reported approximately 140 coronavirus deaths per day over the past week – the weekly average peaked at 183 per day in August but had fallen to 40 in November before the latest rise began. Increases in the death rate usually follow jumps in cases by about a month. For comparison, heart disease and cancer, the state’s two largest causes of death by far, each kill an average of about 125 Floridians per day. The jumps in cases and deaths come as the state tries to roll out its vaccination program. Gov. Ron DeSantis has emphasized immunizing those 65 and older, front-line medical workers and nursing home patients.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s plan to expand access to a COVID-19 vaccine to people over 65 got off to a rocky start Monday, with the websites of at least two public health districts crashing and other districts reporting overwhelming demand for appointments. The state was already struggling with its vaccine rollout before the latest woes. The Coastal Health District, which includes Savannah, stopped scheduling appointments after an “overwhelming response from residents ages 65 and older interested in COVID-19 vaccination,” the district said in a news release. The district – one of 18 in the state – said health officials in the eight counties it covers have enough requests to schedule appointments through February and, in some cases, into March. “We know people are frustrated because the process is moving more slowly than they would like, and if we could vaccinate everyone today, we’d do that,” Lawton Davis, the district’s health director, said in a statement. “But your health departments are stretched thin and doing what they can to move forward.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s doctor shortage has worsened during the coronavirus pandemic, and experts say the chances of a rebound hinge on Hawaii’s ability to help doctors stay in business. More than 400 doctors say COVID-19 has forced them to close their practices, reduce hours or switch to telehealth services, Hawaii Public Radio reports. That brings the state’s overall doctor shortage to more than 1,000, according to the latest Hawaii Physician Workforce Assessment released by the University of Hawaii’s John A. Burns School of Medicine. “So what it means is that if you need a doctor urgently, you might die because you might not be able to access that,” said Dr. Kelley Withy, director of the Hawaii and Pacific Basin Area Health Education Center at the Honolulu medical school. “And if you need a specialist chronically to help you manage your condition, you may have to travel to get to that specialist, and it may be by air travel, which of course is especially difficult right now.” The shortage is greater in the communities beyond Oahu, said Dr. Elizabeth Ann Ignacio, an intervention radiologist on Maui. Hawaii has more than 10,000 licensed doctors, but only about 3,200 are active, Ignacio said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Monday described 2020 like a damaging and deadly tornado but said Idaho is strong heading into the new year with strong finances and a COVID-19 vaccine now available. The Republican governor’s state of the state speech is considered the kickoff to the legislative session and is usually heavy on budget matters. He usually gives the speech to a joint session in the House of Representatives attended by all 35 senators and 70 representatives, as well as members of the Idaho Supreme Court and other statewide elected office holders. But his speech Monday was delivered remotely to avoid spreading the virus. He spent much of it talking about the coronavirus that has killed more than 1,500 residents, and he asked for a moment of silence for those who died. He also championed front-line health care workers and the challenges they’ve faced.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Chicago Public Schools students began their return to the classroom Monday as school doors opened to thousands of pre-kindergarten and some special education students. The nation’s third-largest district, with about 355,000 students, plans a gradual return to in-person instruction after going remote last March due to the coronavirus pandemic. “It is our city’s first day of embarking on our path to returning to in-person learning,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said at a Southwest Side elementary school, where students wore face coverings, and desks had sneeze guard barriers. Nearly 40% of eligible students, about 77,000, expressed interest in returning, with about 6,000 students in pre-kindergarten and special education expected Monday. The Chicago Teachers Union has opposed reopening over safety concerns. Union officials claim the district hasn’t done enough to protect teachers from COVID-19, proposing to continue distance learning until teachers are vaccinated. District officials argue distance learning doesn’t work well for all, particularly many Black and Latino students who make up the majority of the district. The district’s safety plan includes purchasing classroom air purifiers and a testing program.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state has identified a case of a new coronavirus strain, first seen in the United Kingdom, that spreads more easily. The new variant, which is not thought to carry a higher risk of severe disease or death, is behind England’s latest lockdown. Like other states, Indiana has been monitoring testing samples to determine whether this variant is circulating. Indiana Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratories confirmed the presence of the strain in the state, health officials said Monday. “It’s common for viruses to mutate, and we are seeing that occur with COVID-19,” State Health Commissioner Dr. Kris Box said in a statement. “Because this strain of the virus can be transmitted more easily, it’s more important than ever that Hoosiers continue to wear their masks, practice social distancing, maintain good hygiene and get vaccinated when they are eligible.”\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: New clinical trials began last week at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics for a COVID-19 vaccine that officials there hope will be even more viable for global distribution. “To really get (COVID-19) under control, we need the world vaccinated,” said Dr. Patricia Winokur, executive dean at the University of Iowa’s Carver College of Medicine and principal investigator for the UI site of the clinical drug trial. UIHC began enrolling participants in the Novavax trial last Monday, and Winokur said it’s still accepting more. Winokur estimated 30,000 individuals would be enrolled at sites across the country, all told. So far, roughly a sixth of those spots have already been filled. While the Novavax vaccine – like Pfizer’s and Moderna’s – will require two doses, Winokur said she expects it could be easier to distribute around the world because of the temperature at which the vaccine is stored. While early data suggests Novavax can be stored at “refrigerator temperature,” the Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at close to -100 degrees Fahrenheit to remain effective, and Moderna’s must be kept at -4 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Kansas State and Washburn universities will begin the spring semester online as the coronavirus pandemic rages. The plan is for the first two weeks to be virtual at Kansas State, but it isn’t clear when in-person learning will resume at Washburn. Dr. JuliAnn Mazachek, vice president of academic affairs at Washburn, said in a statement that the decision about classes will be reviewed weekly and that “the university will return to face-to-face classes as soon as possible.” Kansas State said in a statement that the goal was to mitigate continued spread of COVID-19. “As we anticipate a surge in positive cases as people return to our campuses, this action will help us keep safety protocols in place,” said Richard Myers, Kansas State’s president.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state House of Representatives will form a committee to consider a petition to impeach Gov. Andy Beshear over his COVID-19-related orders. Speaker of the House David Osborne, R-Prospect, said under law the House doesn’t have a choice but to take action after receiving the petition, which includes multiple allegations that the governor violated both the state and U.S. constitutions in a series of executive orders responding to the pandemic. Osborne said Saturday that he hadn’t read the petition yet and didn’t know if the accusations were serious, but “for someone to propose undoing an election of a state executive ... it’s a very, very serious accusation.” Crystal Staley, a spokeswoman for Beshear, said the action is “silly and completely unjustified,” and “the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled every step the governor has taken is legal.” The petition referenced steps the governor took after declaring a state of emergency in March, including ordering nonessential businesses to close to in-person traffic, instituting a travel ban, ordering churches to close to in-person services and expanding voting procedures to allow mail-in voting during the 2020 elections.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Families are eligible for a 15% boost in their food stamp benefits through June, under a federal coronavirus aid package passed by Congress. The state said any increases due to people receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program started being transferred to benefit cards Friday. The latest federal coronavirus legislation didn’t expand eligibility for food stamps. But The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports that state officials said several key provisions will increase SNAP’s reach. Shavana Howard, an assistant secretary for the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services, said the program will no longer count federal extended unemployment benefits as income, which previously put SNAP out of reach for 44,165 applicants between March and July and ousted 2,185 households receiving benefits. Howard said many students who also did not qualify for food stamps because a portion of their parents’ income was counted against them will qualify this time. Hunger has soared in Louisiana since the onset of the pandemic, and the problem worsened as the state was hit with storm after storm during a record 2020 hurricane season.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The Legislature will consider a proposal that would require insurance companies to cover COVID-19 tests and immunizations and waive any co-payments related to them. Senate President Troy Jackson and Speaker of the House Ryan Fecteau, who are both Democrats, unveiled the “COVID-19 Patient Bill of Rights” on Monday. The proposal will be the first bill of the new session of the Maine Legislature, Democratic leaders said. Lawmakers were sworn in last month. Jackson said the proposal is about making sure patients around the state maintain access to critical health care services during the pandemic. “The COVID-19 Patient Bill of Rights brings us closer to the end of this crisis and the hold COVID-19 has had over our lives,” he said. The proposal also includes provisions that ease requirements for telehealth visits. And it’s designed to allow residents to get larger supplies of their prescriptions to reduce the number of visits to a pharmacy. The Maine Legislature Office of the Presiding Officers said the proposal “is about making sure nothing prevents Mainers from getting the health care they need to protect themselves, their families and loved ones from this serious virus.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, lawmakers will gather for their annual legislative session this week to focus largely on helping the state recover from the pandemic and to take up policing reforms. Gov. Larry Hogan announced a $1 billion COVID-19 relief plan Monday that will require legislative approval. It includes tax relief and payments of up to $450 for individuals and $750 for families in need who have claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit. Hogan also is proposing ending local and state income taxes on unemployment benefits. The plan includes $300 million in tax relief to help Maryland restaurants and small businesses by allowing them to keep up to $12,000 of sales tax over the next four months. On Wednesday, senators will convene for the first day of the 90-day session behind transparent enclosures that have been built around their desks. In the House, a quorum of delegates will convene in the House chamber, while others will gather in a nearby office building and participate remotely. The Capitol will be closed to the public for the session, as delegates who are immune-compromised will sit socially distanced in the gallery where members of the public usually sit.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Thousands of police officers, firefighters and other first responders in the state were scheduled to get their first dose of COVID-19 vaccines Monday. About 60 sites have been set up around the state to vaccinate an estimated 45,000 people over several weeks, state officials said. The city of Worcester has turned its senior center into a mass vaccination site for first responders from the city as well as the surrounding communities of Shrewsbury, Millbury, Leicester, Holden, Grafton and West Boylston. To make sure there are enough qualified people to administer the vaccines, students in UMass Medical School’s Graduate School of Nursing spent Saturday training more than 160 medical school students in intermuscular injection. “With COVID, we haven’t really been able to do that much recently, so having an opportunity like this is great for me to actually learn a skill,” medical student Charles Feinberg said. “It’s also fun to be a part of ending this pandemic that has ravaged our country.” The state so far has limited vaccinations to medical professionals and nursing home residents.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state is ready to buy 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses directly from the manufacturer, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Monday, in a move she says would help the state ramp up its vaccination efforts. It comes as county health departments and hospital systems say the unpredictable and inadequate supply of vaccines has kept them from getting shots into arms. The request coincides with the state drastically expanding eligibility for the vaccine against the disease caused by the coronavirus. Although all Michiganders 65 and older – along with teachers, police officers and many more first responders – are eligible to receive the vaccine, a litany of challenges at every level of government means it will likely be some time before people seeking an appointment are actually injected. Whitmer sent a letter to Alex Azar, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, asking for permission to buy the doses from Pfizer. Currently, federal health officials coordinate the delivery of doses to every state in the country.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Bars and restaurants were permitted to resume indoor service with capacity limits Monday as COVID-19 cases and deaths across the state continue to fall. The Minnesota Department of Health on Monday reported 980 new infections and four deaths, marking the second time since October that single-day cases dipped below 1,000 and the first time since early November that the state reported single-digit deaths. The state’s totals now sit at 437,552 cases and 5,711 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Deaths and hospitalizations continue to decline, with the seven-day average of daily deaths dropping from 42.43 on Dec. 27 to 39.57 deaths per day Sunday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 numbered about 686 as of Sunday, including 141 in intensive care. Restrictions on bars and restaurants imposed by Gov. Tim Walz in the fall had generated sharp pushback, with some bars and restaurants defiantly reopening in recent weeks, risking fines and losses of their liquor licenses. The state has gone to court against several violators.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: The mayor says he won’t seek reelection this year, citing demands the coronavirus pandemic has placed on his day job as a physician. Dr. Steve Demetropoulos made the announcement on his Facebook page, WLOX-TV reports. “Thank you for all of your support and words of encouragement while I have been in office,” Demetropoulos said in a posted video. “I will continue to work hard on your behalf until my term ends.” For decades, Demetropoulos has worked as a physician and emergency medical director at Singing River Health Services. He was elected mayor of Pascagoula last year in a special election to fill the unexpired term of Dane Maxwell, who left to take office a state public service commissioner.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson began a new term in office Monday with an inaugural ceremony marking the start of Missouri’s bicentennial celebration but without a traditional party because of coronavirus precautions. The Republican governor was sworn in at a midday event on the grounds of the recently refurbished Capitol, with church bells ringing and artillery guns firing a salute – just as they have for past governors. He swore on a Bible given to him by his wife, and a B2 bomber flew low over the Capitol after Parson took the oath. He said he would work to provide the tools needed for doctors and nurses, law enforcement officers, farmers and teachers and said his job is to make life better for every Missourian. “I will care for the unborn to the elderly, the rich to the poor, regardless of the color of your skin,” he said. State officials hope that by August enough people will have been vaccinated against COVID-19 to safely hold a more elaborate celebration. It would coincide with the 200th anniversary of Missouri’s official admittance to the United States on Aug. 10, 1821.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: New data released by the Montana Food Bank Network shows more than 40% of respondents to a survey needed food assistance for the first time in their lives since the coronavirus pandemic began. While in 2019 only 1 in every 10 Montana residents needed food assistance from a pantry in the Montana Food Bank Network, in 2020, that figure could jump at least 29%, the Missoulian reports. “The number of people receiving food assistance for the first time after the COVID crisis was pretty astounding,” said Lorriane Burhop, the chief policy officer of the Montana Food Bank Network. The survey conducted from June to July garnered 917 responses across 30 counties in the state. The report said 70% of adults lost income or were furloughed as a result of the economic fallout from the pandemic. Burhop said that reveals how many people were making ends meet, but “the loss of just one or two paychecks all of a sudden pushes those households into crisis, and they need to turn to a local food pantry for help.”\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state appears to have avoided a post-Christmas spike in coronavirus cases that many had feared, although it’s not entirely clear why, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Monday. It may be because people followed virus safety guidelines warning against attending holiday gatherings, Ricketts said during a news conference. “I think a lot of Nebraskans made modifications to their holiday get-togethers,” he said. “I’d also say there’s also a lot of we don’t know about this virus.” The Republican governor said the decision not to impose a statewide lockdown may also have played a role because it helped avoid pandemic fatigue that leads some people to break the recommendations. Other states, such as California, have reported large increases in cases in December. “We tried to strike a balance in Nebraska,” Ricketts said. Nebraska has imposed restrictions on crowd sizes and public spaces but has never imposed a stay-at-home order or a statewide mask mandate. The state saw a sharp increase in virus hospitalizations in mid-November, raising concerns about bed space and burnout among hospital workers. The numbers have since declined, although public health officials say it’s important for residents to continue following social distancing safety guidelines.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The state has surpassed 250,000 coronavirus cases as of Monday morning, according to recent data from the Nevada Health Response COVID dashboard. Nevada Health Response reported 1,866 new COVID-19 cases Monday. In December, the Department of Health and Human Services first reported more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases, a little over seven weeks after the diagnosis of its 100,000th case Oct. 30. There have also been a total of 3,500 COVID-19-related deaths as of Monday morning. The 14-day test positivity rate is at 21.1%, significantly higher than the World Health Organization’s recommended 5% for economic reopening. Health officials are expecting to see the full impact of the New Year’s Eve related exposure and testing in the coming days, said Julia Peek, deputy administrator of Community Health Service, in a press conference Monday morning.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s failure to provide home health care services to qualifying elderly and disabled people puts them at risk of ending up in nursing homes that have been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic, according to a lawsuit filed against health officials Monday. The lawsuit was filed by New Hampshire Legal Assistance, Disability Rights Center-New Hampshire, AARP Foundation and the Nixon Peabody law office on behalf of four people enrolled in a Medicaid waiver program, called “Choices for Independence,” meant to help participants stay in their homes. “When CFI participants are deprived of the community-based long-term care that the state concedes they need and are entitled to, they face grave health risks,” AARP Foundation Senior Attorney M. Geron Gadd said in a statement. “Failure to properly administer the CFI Waiver not only deprives participants of their right to live as they choose, but also greatly increases their chances of exposure to COVID-19 in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.” Pamela Phelan, litigation director for the disability rights group, said the plaintiffs are “one crisis away” from unnecessary institutionalization.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state opened its second mass testing site for administering the COVID-19 vaccine Monday. Gov. Phil Murphy and Senate President Steve Sweeney, both Democrats, toured the facility at Rowan College in Gloucester County. A similar site opened Friday at a mall in Rockaway, Morris County. The sites, which are designed to vaccinate more than 2,000 people a day, are open now just for health care workers, police and fire officials. More than 100,000 doses of the vaccine of the roughly 400,000 the state has received have been set aside for long-term care staff and residents. Murphy also said Monday that more than 200,000 people have been vaccinated in the state so far, double the number from a week ago. There are also 200 sites at pharmacies, hospitals and urgent cares across the state that are dispensing the vaccine as well, but Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said the state has greater demand than supply of the shot. “We’re asking for your patience as we await a larger supply,” she said. More than 1 million people have signed up for the vaccine on the state’s preregistration site, she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The New Mexico Public Education Department is working with school districts and internet providers to expand broadband access in rural areas struggling with remote learning, according to lawyers for the state. In a response filed in court last week, the lawyers also said school funding hasn’t been cut since the pandemic started. The filing comes after plaintiffs in a landmark education lawsuit argued that the state’s attempts to provide internet access and learning devices were “woefully insufficient.” In a motion filed in December, the plaintiffs asked state District Judge Matthew Wilson to order the state to connect more children to online learning by immediately identifying students who lack laptops or tablets and providing internet vouchers for at-risk households. With in-person learning currently off limits, the inability to access remote classes has been a challenge for many rural and low-income students, particularly Native American children living on tribal lands. Court documents show the Public Education Department distributed about 6,200 laptops and 700 residential hot spots, all of which went to tribal communities.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New Yorkers are rushing to sign up for late-night COVID-19 vaccination slots as the city ramps up efforts to get people inoculated against the coronavirus, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday. Midnight-to-4 a.m. appointments at the two 24-hour vaccination sites the city has set up so far were quickly snapped up, de Blasio said at his daily coronavirus briefing. “So you can see New Yorkers are going to take advantage of this,” the mayor said. “The city that never sleeps, people are immediately grabbing those opportunities to get vaccinated.” More sites are being set up around the city, with the goal of administering 1 million doses this month, he said. De Blasio said the city is speeding up vaccinations, with more than 160 sites now open. He said nearly 101,800 shots were administered last week – about as many as the total from mid-December, when the first COVID-19 vaccine was approved for emergency use, through early January. State officials also announced new vaccination sites Monday, including one at the the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the Manhattan facility that was used as a field hospital last spring, and one at Jones Beach on Long Island.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Reports of sexual assaults against children in Asheville and Buncombe County rose sharply in 2020, and some experts attribute the increase to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a new state mandatory reporting law. The Buncombe County Sheriff’s Office had 35 sexual assault reports involving minors in 2019, which jumped to 65 reports through mid-December of 2020, an 86% increase, said spokesman Aaron Sarver. The Asheville Police Department reported a 55% increase, with 29 cases of sexual assaults on a juvenile in 2019 and 45 through mid-December, said spokeswoman Christina Hallingse. “The new law is resulting in more reports, and we are thankful to have it in place,” Sheriff’s Detective Sgt. Bryon Crisp said. But some experts fear the law has gone largely unnoticed, since it started gaining momentum just as COVID-19 hit and was mostly focused on the removal of the consent aspect of sexual assault. “School personnel are our No. 1 reporters, and if not for COVID and school being out for parts of this year, the numbers would likely have been higher,” Crisp said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s COVID-19 update released Monday showed no deaths for a third straight day – a mark that hasn’t been seen in nearly six months, although health officials noted that virus reports are typically sporadic over the weekend. The two previous days of no fatalities did not change the state’s death toll ranking of sixth-highest per capita in the country at about about 178 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the COVID Tracking Project. A total of 1,352 North Dakotans have died from complications due to the coronavirus. Health officials have confirmed 16 deaths this month, after 272 on December and 494 in November. “I’m cautiously optimistic,” state Health Department spokeswoman Nicole Peske said. “Typically we do have a lag in reporting from over the weekend, so we’ll see what tomorrow brings.” The state reported 121 new positive cases since Sunday, for a total of 94,830 cases since the start of the pandemic. The tracking project ranks that 48th in the country for new cases per capita. One in every 454 people in North Dakota tested positive in the past week.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Another 7,892 coronavirus cases were confirmed Monday – more than the three-week average of 7,410 new cases reported per day, according to the Ohio Department of Health. An additional 75 COVID-19 deaths were reported. So far, the virus has killed 9,702 Ohioans, state data shows. The pandemic has hit older Ohioans particularly hard, with 93% of deaths occurring in people age 60 and older, according to the state. The seven-day average positive test rate remained at 14% Saturday, the most recent day for which data is available. As the vaccine rollout continues, 304,976 Ohioans have received at least their first of two doses, marking an increase of 8,367 over the previous 24 hours. About 2.6% of Ohio’s 11.7 million residents have been vaccinated so far, according to the state. By Monday, 219 more Ohioans were hospitalized with COVID-19, less than the three-week average. There were 4,236 Ohioans hospitalized with the virus Monday, including 1,033 in intensive care units and 632 on ventilators, according to the health department.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Revenue collections for the calendar year 2020 declined by 3.8% as the pandemic swept the state, Treasurer Randy McDaniel said Friday. Oklahoma collected nearly $13.2 billion in taxes and fees for the year, $520.9 million less than the previous year. “The state’s economy declined in 2020,” McDaniel said in a statement. “Hopefully, we will see improvement in the months ahead as the (COVID-19) vaccine becomes widely available.” December collections of $1.16 billion were 0.4% below December 2019, an improvement from the 2% decline in year-to-year numbers reported in November, the treasurer reported. Tax collections on hard-hit oil and gas production for the year fell the most, down $396.3 million, or 38.6%, to a total of $630.1 million.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Two men are accused of converting for personal use more than $2.2 million in loans meant to help small businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. Andrew Aaron Lloyd, 50, of Lebanon, and Russell A. Schort, 38, of Myrtle Creek, are charged with wire fraud, bank fraud and money laundering in federal court in Eugene, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The FBI investigated after receiving information that the men fraudulently obtained Paycheck Protection Program loans. Between April 7 and May 8, financial records showed both applied for and received at least three loan payments using three different entities, according to a criminal complaint filed in court. Lloyd is accused of transferring at least $1.8 million from the loans to a personal online brokerage account and buying securities, the complaint says. His investments increased in value over several months and became worth over $10 million at the time of their seizure, according to prosecutors.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will soon begin vaccinating people 75 years and older and “essential workers” like police officers, grocery store clerks and teachers, the state health secretary said Monday. Pennsylvania remains focused on giving the COVID-19 vaccine to health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities – a group that numbers about 1 million – but is making plans to move to the next stage of its vaccination plan, Dr. Rachel Levine said at a media briefing. She was not more specific about the timing but said that second group, dubbed 1B, will be eligible to receive the vaccine before everyone in the first group has been inoculated. Phase 1B of the state’s coronavirus vaccination plan includes people 75 and older as well as front-line essential workers, a huge and diverse group that includes clergy, first responders, prison guards, school staff, and food, manufacturing, postal, public transportation and grocery store workers. Some providers are already vaccinating people in the second group when they don’t have someone in the first group readily available to receive it. Levine said that’s OK. “We don’t want any vaccine wasted,” she said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state is paying more than three-quarters of a million dollars to help Rhode Island College deal with a $10 million deficit brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. New York-based Alvarez & Marsal was hired by the state Council on Postsecondary Education on Dec. 14 and will earn $76,000 a week until its contract expires Feb. 28, The Boston Globe reports. “The need for this analysis stems from operational and financial challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated structural issues at the college,” according to the contract. The school announced last summer that the deficit would lead to executive pay cuts, layoffs and a hiring freeze. Council Chairman Tim DelGiudice defended the contract, saying the board is “concerned about the magnitude of the deficit at RIC,” and the consultant is getting paid fairly. Democratic State Rep. William O’Brien called the contract “absolutely ridiculous” and said the Legislature struggled to find an extra $600,000 for the school in the last budget. The money should have been spent on student scholarships, he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state will let people ages 70 and older schedule appointments for the COVID-19 vaccine starting Wednesday. Officials said Monday that they were confident the majority of people in the state’s earliest phase who wanted to be vaccinated – health care workers and those living and working in long-term care facilities – had already received their shots or scheduled appointments. “Because we’ve seen a dramatic acceleration in vaccine usage and appointments in the last week, we have decided to speed things up again,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement. “We know that those 70 and older are at the greatest risk of dying from COVID-19. Making sure they have expedited access to the vaccine will help save lives.” Officials estimate about 627,800 South Carolinians are 70 or older, and many have already received the vaccine because they were eligible earlier. Those who meet the age requirement are now eligible regardless of health status or preexisting conditions. Across the state, more than two-thirds of COVID-19 deaths have been among people ages 70 and older.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state is seeing coronavirus infections level off at a time many of its counterparts are experiencing their worst weekly death tolls yet. The South Dakota Department of Health announced 181 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday and 5,102 active cases. No new deaths were reported, with the total number of South Dakotans killed by the disease remaining at 1,585. Hospitalizations statewide increased by five to 242, with data showing just more than 41% of hospital beds and just fewer than 43% of adult intensive care unit beds available. And as many states are stumbling to enact vaccination plans, South Dakota came out of the gate hard, following the Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization for two mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna. At one point last week, more South Dakotans had received vaccinations as a percentage of the population than in any other state, according to tracking done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Monday, 45,667 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine had been administered to 38,360 people.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee is urging seniors who contract COVID-19 to ask their health care providers about certain drugs that could prevent them from getting so sick that they wind up in the hospital. Lee told reporters Friday that monoclonal antibodies are available and very effective, especially for people who are 65 or older and have underlying health conditions that make them more susceptible to the virus. He said many people do not ask their health care providers about the treatment option. He said the drugs are effective when someone becomes sick but has not deteriorated enough to be hospitalized. State Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey said the therapeutics are 85% to 95% effective at preventing progression to severe disease. “We have not used our entire inventory, nowhere close to that,” Piercey said. “And so we really are trying to get the word out to seek treatment early once you test positive.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic has left a nearly $1 billion deficit in the state budget as the nation’s energy capital remains hampered by a slow recovery and a half-million fewer jobs than a year ago. The forecast Monday by state officials is far brighter than bleaker projections last summer, when Republican Comptroller Glenn Hegar estimated the shortfall could be four times as worse. Still, the deficit could result in cuts to state services as the GOP-controlled Legislature returns to work Tuesday. Lawmakers are coming back to the Capitol at a moment when spread of the virus has never been worse in Texas. More than 13,000 patients with COVID-19 are hospitalized, and the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in Texas is more than 23,000. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has kept some business restrictions in place but has ruled out more lockdowns. Hegar said the hospitality sector has been hardest-hit during the pandemic. He said a rebound in oil prices and production substantially improved the economic outlook in Texas from just a few months ago.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Spencer Cox presented his first budget proposal Monday, focusing on pandemic relief and further developing rural infrastructure. Cox, a Republican, stressed the importance of equity as he unveiled the proposed $21.7 billion budget from his administration’s new rural affairs office at Southern Utah University in Cedar City. The proposal would allocate at least $250 million toward fighting the coronavirus pandemic and $125 million on rural infrastructure, including expanding broadband access and electric vehicle charging stations. “It was critical that everyone in Utah felt like they were represented in this budget proposal, and certainly rural is a big piece of that,” Cox told reporters during a virtual briefing. The budget also includes a boost in education funding for higher education and K-12 schools, as well as spending for rural schools. Cox said he also supports putting $112 million toward providing $1,500 bonuses for all teachers in the state, a measure that has already been endorsed by state lawmakers. The governor’s proposal will be considered by the Legislature during its upcoming session, which starts next week.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: As officials work to gauge the impact of the recent holidays on the state’s COVID-19 trends, residents are once again prohibited from having gatherings among multiple households. Gov. Phil Scott had loosened restrictions to allow Vermonters to gather with one trusted household between Dec. 23 and Jan. 2. “While we’re providing a narrow path to very small holiday gatherings, we’d rather you not do it at all,” Scott said at the time. “But we’ve improved our numbers in Vermont, all other prevention measures will remain in place, and we understand that mental health has to be considered alongside physical health.” Vermont saw some higher coronavirus case numbers last week. On Jan. 6-7, new cases exceeded 200 each day. During the rest of the week, they did not drop below 100 a day, according to Health Department data. Before last week, cases for most days stayed below 100. “The teams are not finding evidence that significant outbreaks have occurred related to the types of gatherings that were allowed for the holidays and far more evidence of isolated cases related to community prevalence,” Levine said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Lawmakers are set to start this year’s legislative session focused on COVID-19 relief efforts and legalizing marijuana. The 2021 session will kick off Wednesday, with legislators meeting away from the Capitol as the state continues to wrestle with the impacts of a global pandemic that’s shut down schools, closed businesses and left more than 5,000 Virginians dead in the past 10 months, including a state senator. The House of Delegates plans to meet remotely, while the Senate will meet at a large conference center near the Capitol. This will be the second regular legislative session controlled by Democrats since they won control of the General Assembly for the first time in a generation in 2019. Republicans, upset that the House is meeting remotely and that lawmakers held an extended special session last year, have signaled they will limit what’s normally a 45-day session to only 30 days. Democrats can extend the the number of legislative working days by having Gov. Ralph Northam call a special session. State Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg said a top priority will be ensuring that schools have “robust” funding, including money for extra counselors, to help teachers deal with the fallout from the coronavirus once students return to the classroom.\n\nWashington\n\nRenton: One person has died in the midst of a coronavirus outbreak at a hotel where more than 200 homeless are sheltered, according to King County officials. A post-mortem coronavirus test found that the person was positive, according to the King County Medical Examiner, the Seattle Times reports. There have only been four deaths of COVID-19 among people staying in shelters, according to a King County online dashboard. The Renton Red Lion experienced an outbreak of 35 cases last month among its homeless guests and housed staff, in the middle of a spike in cases at homeless shelters, housing facilities and day programs across the county. It’s the most seen since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic at any of the hotels the county is using to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among homeless people. The Red Lion Hotel in Renton was opened by the county to keep them out of crowded bunk-bed or mats-on-the-ground shelters where officials feared COVID-19 could spread like wildfire.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new peak in confirmed coronavirus cases and a record 206 COVID-19-related deaths last week. Health workers also administered nearly 40,000 vaccine shots, doubling the pace of vaccinations. As the pandemic hits new deadly peaks, the state is now up to 92,070 vaccine doses administered. It closed the week leading the nation on number of doses per 100,000 residents. It next plans a big push to vaccinate teachers ahead of Gov. Jim Justice’s goal to restart in-person education at as many schools as possible Jan. 19. A record 7,888 positive cases were reported last week, up 4% from the previous week. West Virginia has set weekly virus records in eight of the past 11 weeks. “We’re getting close to really making some real headway with this terrible killer,” Justice said Monday. Urging residents to wear masks and get tested, he told them to “just help yourself and help your loved ones.” Meanwhile, Justice announced that high school basketball practices can start Feb. 15 for counties that have in-person classes. Games can begin on March 3, three months after the season originally was supposed to start.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Police and firefighters will be eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine starting Jan. 18, state health officials said Monday, while Gov. Tony Evers estimated that members of the general public won’t be vaccinated until June. Evers renewed his call for faster distribution of the vaccine from the federal government Monday, and state Republicans introduced a new, scaled-back response bill and scheduled it for a vote Tuesday. While Evers laid blame at the federal government for slow distribution of the vaccine, Republicans amped up their criticism of the midterm Democrat for not acting urgently enough. U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, a Republican from Janesville, accused Evers of having a “stunning lack of urgency in getting people the life-saving help they need.” For now, Wisconsin is focused on vaccinating more than 500,000 health care workers and nursing home residents. As of Monday, 151,502 people had been vaccinated, the state said. Assisted living residents were to be vaccinated starting in two weeks.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Campgrounds at Grand Teton National Park are expected to begin using an online reservation system later this month. Campgrounds on the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway will also begin taking reservations online beginning Jan. 26, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. Campgrounds in the park near Jackson previously operated on a first-come, first-served basis, the National Park Service said in a statement. The change to an advanced reservation system is expected to make accessing the campgrounds and the park easier by allowing visitors to plan their camping experiences without worrying about securing campsites. The system is also expected to mitigate traffic congestion and eliminate long lines. Members of the public had requested a reservation system for the campgrounds, parks service Public Affairs Officer Denise Germann said. “People would come before the break of dawn waiting for someone to leave or wait in line for hours,” Germann said. Grand Teton National Park recorded more than 3 million recreational visitors in 2019, the park service website said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/12/24/liquid-oozes-onto-highway-red-squirrels-rising-floods-oysters-exploding-atm-news-around-states/40882385/", "title": "50 States roundup", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nRogersville: It’s unknown when a popular north Alabama state park that was hit by a tornado on Dec. 14 will be fully reopened. The lodge, marina and some other sections of Joe Wheeler State Park are operating following the strike by what forecasters determined was an EF-1 twister. But the campground and day-use areas were badly damaged, and park officials said clearing away fallen trees and other debris will take time. The park is on the Tennessee River at Rogersville. The weather service said it was struck by a twister with 110 mph maximum winds that left a trail of damage as wide as 500 yards.\n\nAlaska\n\nWillow: At least six homes were evacuated after an ice jam caused a creek to flood in a subdivision north of Anchorage, emergency officials said. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough Department of Emergency Services responded to flooding reports in Willow around 11 p.m. Saturday, The Anchorage Daily News reported.No injuries were reported. Residents near the Willow Creek and Deneki Road areas were evacuated late Saturday and early Sunday. A large chunk of ice jammed at the Deneki bridge and restricted water flow, which caused upstream flooding, a National Weather Service flood advisory said. The American Red Cross opened a temporary shelter at the Willow Community Center, although some residents chose to remain in their homes, officials said. The Willow Fire Department, Alaska State Troopers and Mat-Su Water Rescue Team responded to provide assistance in the community about 70 miles north of Anchorage, the borough said. The water began to recede Sunday, but a layer of ice formed and cars were frozen in place.\n\nArizona\n\nSafford: After a devastating 2017 wildfire nearly wiped the species out, the Mount Graham red squirrel, the nation’s rarest small mammal, continues its slow climb out of the danger zone. The annual survey of the bushy-tailed rodents found at least 78 squirrels living on the upper slopes of Mount Graham in southeastern Arizona, a 4% increase from 2018. The survey was conducted by the Arizona Game and Fish Department, Coronado National Forest, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Arizona Center for Nature Conservation at the Phoenix Zoo, and the University of Arizona. Although the species’ growth this year was much smaller than the 91% rise noted in the year after the 2017 Frye Fire, biologists are still encouraged that the half-pound critters are on the comeback. But a report released Nov. 18 suggests that the tiny mammal – which has survived fire, construction, introduced competitors and drought – faces a foe that could finally do it in: climate change. The report in the journal Nature Climate Change found that virtually all the of country’s 459 endangered species, including the red squirrels, have at least some vulnerabilities to long-term alterations like drought, increasingly intense storms and temperature rise.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: The Baxter Regional Medical Center officially broke ground Wednesday on the hospital’s outpatient surgery center. The 23,000 square-foot facility, which will be located along Beard Drive southeast of the hospital, is estimated to cost $8.7 million and should be completed in early 2021. The hospital presently performs close to 8,000 surgeries a year, medial center CEO Ron Peterson said, with about 65% percent of those outpatient procedures. The hospital expects the outpatient surgery center to perform about 3,000 procedures in its first year of operation, and it has the capacity to perform about 7,000 a year at full capacity.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Barbara: A shark reportedly bit a surfer Saturday afternoon off Southern California in a “truly terrifying situation,” the Coast Guard said. The 37-year-old man had been surfing near Santa Rosa Island, one of the Channel Islands, during the attack, according to a news release. A friend aboard a nearby boat applied a tourniquet to his leg and called the Coast Guard for help, the release stated. A helicopter crew flew the man to the Santa Barbara airport for treatment and he was in stable condition Saturday night. Coast Guard video footage posted on Twitter showed the man, wearing a full-body wetsuit, being hoisted up from the boat into the helicopter. “This was the best possible outcome to a truly terrifying situation,” Coast Guard Lt. Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said in the release.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The city’s water utility said it will speed up the removal of lead pipes from homes across the metro area. Denver Water said it expects the program to launch in 2020 and take 15 years at a cost of $500 million, Colorado Public Radio reported. The public agency estimated there are between 64,000 and 84,000 lead service lines in the system. Denver Water said it committed to removing at least 4,500 lines annually under an agreement with the EPA and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Lead exposure can lead to kidney and brain damage, as well as developmental issues for children. Homes built before 1951 are more likely to have lead service lines, Denver Water said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A police officer grabbed onto a driverless SUV that had rolled into traffic and stopped it from potentially hitting a group of children, authorities said. Surveillance video posted online by news outlets showed Bridgeport School Resource Officer Carlos Carmo Jr. running toward the moving vehicle and using his body to slow and stop the car. A group of Harding High School school students was walking on the sidewalk near the path of the SUV. There were two passengers in the car – one in the passenger seat and one in back – but no driver, when it somehow slipped out of park and rolled away, officials said. It had been parked on the street on a downward slope. Carmo was treated at a hospital for minor injuries, authorities said. No other injuries were reported. Mayor Joe Ganim said Carmo will be honored for his actions.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: Two weekend events recently brought a group of Satanists and hundreds of Christian worshippers together in the middle of town. Hundreds of people attended a live nativity Saturday night in Georgetown, while a group of Satanists held a quiet vigil nearby, The News Journal reported. The Satanist organizers said their vigil marked the winter solstice and celebrated religious diversity and equal rights during the holiday season. The group describes itself as a “nontheistic Delaware-based modern Satanic group.” A group called the Good Ole Boy Foundation is sponsoring the nativity scene each night until Christmas. “Everybody has the right to celebrate whatever they celebrate,” Georgetown resident Katie Rohlfing told the newspaper.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Advocates for homeless people marched through the streets of the nation’s capital with an empty coffin as part of an annual vigil to the honor those who have died. City data showed at least 117 homeless people have died in the district this year, The Washington Post reported. Data showed about 52 of the deaths were considered accidents, including 44 that involved intoxication and three that involved the person being hit by a car. Of the remaining deaths, 26 causes were still pending, two were suicides, eight were homicides and 27 were considered natural, including several that involved alcoholism or cardiovascular disease. The seventh annual vigil hosted by the People for Fairness Coalition opened late Thursday with attendees singing hymns in front of the coffin at a local church before carrying it to Freedom Plaza. After the overnight vigil, participants attended a ceremony at another church where the names of those who died were read aloud.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: Sheriff’s deputies were searching for a suspect who they believe exploded an ATM in an unsuccessful effort to steal money. In a news release, the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office reported that an ATM exploded early Sunday just after surveillance cameras caught the male suspect spray-painting the exterior cameras black at the Pilot Bank. The Tampa Bay Times reported the suspect was unable to get through the ATM’s internal safe so no money was taken. Authorities said a similar incident took place at another bank in nearby Oldsmar in November.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The National Park Service plans to place a more storm-resistant roof on a historic building that serves as its staff headquarters at Fort Pulaski on the Georgia coast. The building wasn’t an original part of the Civil War-era fort east of Savannah. It was constructed just before World War I as an attendant’s quarters for a nearby quarantine station. The station was used to treat people with highly contagious diseases between 1889 and 1937. The park service is seeking public comment on its plan to replace the existing asphalt shingle roof with one made of steel, the agency said in a news release. The current roof suffered damaged from Hurricanes Matthew and Irma in 2016 and 2017. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is the last surviving building associated with the former quarantine station. The park service said Georgia’s state historic preservation office determined a steel roof would adversely affect the building’s historic character because it would lack the appearance of the original shingle roof. The park service said it plans to minimize the new roof’s impact by applying steel in a diamond shingle pattern that mimics the original design.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: New U.S. Navy contracting terms have resulted in a pullout by a major contractor that is expected to result in the loss of hundreds of jobs at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, officials said. BAE Systems PLC will no longer perform Navy surface ship repair at Pearl Harbor, eliminating about 325 jobs, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The Navy contracts with private shipyards and other firms for maintenance on nonnuclear surface ships. The multinational security, aerospace and ship repair firm was the prime contractor for repair projects through which subcontractor surface ship work was funneled. BAE announced a five-year multiship, multioption contract in 2014 for modernization and maintenance on nine destroyers and cruisers at Pearl Harbor. But multiship, multioption contracts using cost-reimbursement have been replaced nationally by a Navy strategy called “multiple award contract-multi order,” officials said. The new system uses firm-fixed-price contracts that do no allow adjustments for cost overruns, officials said. BAE cannot bid on smaller, $1 million to $2 million contracts under the new Navy format, but can seek major ship projects that can be $50 million to $100 million, officials said.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene: A state Supreme Court ruling has upheld a lower-court decision regarding ownership of a launch on Lake Coeur d’Alene. The Dec. 11 ruling said the Eastside Highway District does not own a park boat launch in Coeur d’Alene’s Boothe Park, The Coeur d’Alene Press reported. The highway district had appealed a decision establishing a boundary on the park’s east side. The case has led to a debate over who can access the boat launch and whether the district and the public are allowed lake access at the park, district administrators said. The state Supreme Court affirmed the lower-court decision that Gregory and Ellen Delavan own the launch. The court found that any boundary agreement between the couple and the highway district no longer exists, regardless of whether an agreement existed between the district and previous property owners. The Supreme Court also ruled the summary judgment granted to the Delavans by the district court must be readdressed. The park was established around 1955 when it was conveyed to the Coeur d’Alene Highway District, the precursor to the Eastside Highway District.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: New HIV diagnoses in Chicago continue to go down and have declined for four consecutive years, according to figures released by Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the city’s health department. The 734 new diagnoses reported in 2018 among Chicago residents are the lowest number since 1988, health officials said Monday. Chicago Department of Public Health’s 2019 HIV/STI surveillance report showed 23,580 people were living with HIV through the end of 2017, the year for which most current data is available. The health department’s HIV Services Portfolio is awarding more than $40 million annually to more than 60 community-based and health care organizations. Although HIV rates are declining in Chicago, other sexually transmitted infections are rising. More than 30,600 cases of chlamydia, nearly 12,700 cases of gonorrhea and 877 primary and secondary cases of syphilis were reported to the health department in 2018.\n\nIndiana\n\nFishers:A 4-year-old girl who sledded Saturday onto a frozen pond that was rapidly melting was rescued by firefighters as the ice began to crack while they pulled her to safety. The incident happened at 10 a.m. Saturday in the girl’s backyard, according to a post on the fire department’s Facebook page. The sled was parked near the house but the snowy backyard led directly to the retention pond on a downward slope. Firefighters said the child hopped on the sled before the parents could react, and it carried her onto the pond. The ice did not crack and the parents did not try to walk out to the sled, which firefighters said was the right thing to do because the ice was brittle. Instead, they called 911 and waited for the fire department. The rescuers arrived quickly as the child waited on the sled, according to the post. They used equipment to scoot onto the ice and grab the girl. As they did, firefighters heard the cracking but “luck held that the ice could support the weight,” according to the Facebook post. Officials with the fire department could not be reached immediately for comment but they warned on Facebook that ice-covered ponds will continue to melt this week as temperatures remain above average.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Twice within an hour on the afternoon of Dec. 9, police said a Des Moines woman intentionally struck young pedestrians with her SUV, later telling authorities that she targeted a teenage girl because she was Latino. The other victim is a black male. Nicole Marie Poole Franklin, 42, is accused of hitting a 12-year-old boy with her SUV as he walked on a sidewalk within an apartment complex property in the 6000 block of Creston Avenue in Des Moines. Franklin is charged with attempted murder in the incident, which occurred at 3:54 p.m. on Dec. 9, according to a news release from Des Moines police. Witnesses told police the SUV accelerated before striking the boy, who suffered minor injuries. About 30 minutes later, Clive police said Franklin drove off the roadway and struck 14-year-old Natalia Miranda as she walked on a sidewalk along Indian Hills Drive. Franklin faces an attempted murder charge in the hit-and-run. Clive Police Chief Michael Venema said Franklin told police that she targeted Miranda because the girl \"is Mexican.\" Miranda suffered several injuries but returned to school less than a week after the incident. She told KCCI after the crash that she remembers the vehicle coming toward her, but doesn't recall being hit. About an hour after Miranda was hit, West Des Moines police were called to a Conoco gas station where Franklin allegedly stole merchandise and referred to employees and customers by racial and ethnic slurs. West Des Moines police on Sunday said Franklin would face a felony hate crime charge – assault in violation of individual rights – for the Conoco incident, on top of previous charges of theft and public intoxication.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Shawnee County has an extra $75 in its coffers because of a former thief with a guilty conscious. The Topeka Capital-Journal reported that someone anonymously sent the money to Shawnee County along with a letter dated Dec. 18. The letter stated that the sender is in a 12-step program and working to make financial amends. It stated that many years ago, the writer stole a receptacle meant for cigarette ashes that was in front of the courthouse. County Commission Chairman Bill Riphahn said the letter was accompanied by three $20 bills, a $10 bill and a $5 bill.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State Police collected more than 236 tons of food for Kentucky families with the 10th annual “Cram the Cruiser” food drive. Post 16 in Owensboro collected the most this year with a total of 60,925 pounds of food. Post commander Capt. Brenton Ford credited Master Trooper Corey King for organizing the drive and also recognized the support of local people and businesses, a state police news release said. State police initiated the program in 2010 to help families in need in local post and region areas. Since then, the agency has contributed nearly 2 million pounds of food to shelters, food banks and churches around the state.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: At least one bald eagle, and possibly a second, might have been killed in northwest Louisiana, according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Agents believed it happened in the Lake Claiborne area, though they don’t think it was in the state park there, enforcement division spokesman Adam Einck said in an email Monday to the Associated Press. Einck said he couldn’t provide any details because agents are still investigating. The birds are no longer endangered but remain protected by two federal laws. Under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, a first offense of killing a bald eagle can bring up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine. The other law is the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The number of bald eagle nests being used for eggs and nestlings fell to at most seven in the early 1970s. A survey in southeast Louisiana, where the birds are most numerous, found 264 active nests in 2018.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A Maine lobstering group has promised to fight the approval of an oyster farm off the state’s southern coast that has become part of a protracted fight over access to the water. The Maine Department of Marine Resources approved a lease of about 35 acres on Maquoit Bay on Dec. 19 for the Mere Point Oyster Company. The state uses a leasing system to allow people raising seafood to use state-owned waters to grow shellfish such as oysters and mussels. Many Maine lobster fishermen opposed the application because they fear it will take away their access to the bay bottom, where they trap lobsters. Some have also said the project is symptomatic of an aquaculture industry they think is growing too fast for the state and will make it difficult to catch Maine’s signature seafood. Opponents of the project are filing an appeal in court to attempt to stop it. Representatives for the Mere Point Oyster Company did not return calls seeking comment.\n\nMaryland\n\nRidge: The state’s first formal stock assessment supported claims by environmentalists that oyster numbers have experienced a sharp decline in the Chesapeake Bay – down 50% since 1999. The study estimated market-size oysters dropped from 600 million in 1999 to about 300 million in the Maryland portion of the bay in 2018. The University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science collaborated in the study at the request of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources after the state legislature mandated it. Oysters play an important role in the bay’s ecosystem because of their water-filtering capabilities. They also create reefs for habitat for other bay life. DNR chief Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio said the stock assessment provides “the best available science” to move forward. She also said the state’s oyster management plan has been updated, with the goal of creating a sustainable oyster fishery in eight to 10 years.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A federal judge is hearing arguments in a case challenging how Massachusetts prisons treat inmates with opioid addiction. The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts is seeking a temporary restraining order compelling the state Department of Correction to provide three prisoners their prescribed medication for opioid addiction while they serve out their sentences. The ACLU and the law firm Goodwin Procter filed suit Friday alleging that the three inmates had been prescribed addiction treatment medication before being incarcerated but were told by prison officials that they would only receive them for up to 90 days, after which they would be withdrawn. The organizations argue the policy violates the U.S. Constitution’s Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act’s protections for people suffering from opioid addiction. The organizations said the inmates are effectively being forced to go through painful withdrawal and face an increased risk of relapse, overdose, and death without their medication. The Correction Department has said it doesn’t have a policy restricting the dosage or length of treatment for opioid addiction medications. It said any decisions about maintaining or discontinuing medications are made by the company it contracts for inmate health care service.\n\nMichigan\n\nMadison Heights:The state said there is no immediate health threat as crews continue to clean up a greenish-yellow chemical ooze that ran onto I-696 in Madison Heights on Friday, apparently seeping from a nearby chemical plating plant that was closed three years ago. The underground plume is not impacting air quality or the drinking water, Jill Greenberg, spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy said Sunday. The contaminated water is migrating underground and working its way to the freeway, she said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which is working with the state, determined the liquid likely was groundwater contaminated with hexavalent chromium. Samples results from the site are expected this week, Greenberg said. The spill has been traced to a nearby, closed electro-plating company in Madison Heights whose owner was convicted of storing dangerous chemicals in leaky containers. Hexavalent chromium is the same chemical Pacific Gas and Electric Company was accused of contaminating the drinking water in a California town in the famous lawsuit brought by activist Erin Brockovich.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMillerville: Authorities said two brothers are dead after being overcome by fumes in a grain silo on a western Minnesota farm. The Star Tribune reported the victims were identified as 47-year-old Curt F. Boesl and 49-year-old Steven T. Boesl. Authorities said an 11-year-old son of Curt Boesl’s, Alex, also fell ill to the fumes late Saturday morning and was taken by air ambulance to a Twin Cities hospital. His condition has not been released. Authorities said Boesl and his son were working in the top of the silo and “were apparently overcome by fumes.” Another son outside the silo saw what happened and called 911. He also called his uncle, Steven, who arrived and went to the top of the silo to try and rescue his brother and nephew. Authorities said Steven Boesl also was apparently overcome by fumes. By the time deputies arrived, all three were unconscious. Emergency responders removed them from the silo. Ambulance personnel declared Steven Boesl dead at the scene. Curt Boesl died Sunday morning.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Average wait times have tripled at Mississippi’s driver’s license stations over the past two years, according to a report by a state legislative watchdog agency. The Legislative Committee on Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review report released Dec. 18 attributed the spike in waits to reasons including vacancies, malfunctioning kiosks and clients being provided outdated or inaccurate or incomplete information. Other reasons include the adoption of a computer system that the report said increased processing times for routine transactions by 40% to 50%, news outlets reported. The state Department of Public Safety is working to lessen wait times, the report said. Changes include implementing appointment scheduling, filling vacant positions and improving online services, the report and Public Service Commissioner Marshall Fisher said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Clair: Authorities said two boys have died after plunging through a frozen pond near their home in eastern Missouri. The Missouri State Highway Patrol said the 7- and 8-year-old boys were found Sunday afternoon in the private pond in Franklin County. The search began after the boys didn’t return from a bicycle ride. The patrol said a family member found one of them floating in the pond. A diver then located the second child. The report didn’t say how long they had been in the water. They were pronounced dead several hours later. Their names weren’t immediately released.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: US officials transferred 33 disease-free bison from Yellowstone National Park to a Montana Indian Reservation as part of efforts to reduce the slaughter of bison that migrate out of the park. Robert Magnan with the Fort Peck Tribes said a trailer carrying the animals left the park Monday morning. It was expected to arrive at the reservation in northeastern Montana later in the day. The animals were to be released into a pasture on Tuesday. The shipment includes bison and their descendants who were trapped to prevent the spread of the disease brucellosis. They have been tested repeatedly to make sure they are disease-free. Brucellosis can cause pregnant animals to prematurely abort their young. It has been eradicated in the U.S. except for the Yellowstone area, where it persists in herds of elk and bison. Yellowstone has captured thousands of bison and sent them to slaughter for disease control over the past few decades. Monday’s transfer was done under a program that puts some captured animals through a quarantine to make sure they do not carry brucellosis. The quarantine program has been in place for more than a decade, but struggled in its early years in part because of opposition from the livestock industry due to worries about cows becoming infected.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Prison officials have canceled Christmas Eve visits to the Nebraska State Penitentiary to fight a prison system flu outbreak. Nearly four dozen flu cases have been confirmed and a higher number are suspected at five prison facilities, the Department of Correctional Services said in a new release Sunday. The penitentiary in Lincoln has the highest number of confirmed and suspected cases, said prisons director Scott Frakes. The department is taking several steps to help stop the outbreak, including providing face masks for staffers and inmates and encouraging inmates to get flu shots.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:State water officials want to pause the approval of groundwater for new developments in Cold Spring Valley north of Reno, which has seen thousands of new homes in recent decades. They want to know more about the sustainability of the valley’s groundwater supply before signing off on new projects. On Friday, state engineer Tim Wilson, Nevada's highest-ranking water official, signed an order declaring a moratorium on approving new subdivision maps if the development would rely on groundwater pumped from the Cold Spring Valley. The order makes exceptions for developments that would import water via pipeline, such as the proposed 5,000-unit Stonegate development. Pumping to support existing homes in the valley isn't affected by the order. Wilson and his boss, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Director Bradley Crowell, are concerned the amount of water rights approved exceed the rate at which nature replenishes the underground aquifer.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State lawmakers will be considering two bills to crack down on vaping this session. Last session, the Legislature added vaping to state’s tobacco laws and raised the minimum age for cigarettes and vaping products to 19. Next year, lawmakers will consider a bill to go even further and raise the minimum age for vaping to 21. Lawmakers also will take up a bill that would ban all flavored vaping products except for menthol. Democratic Rep. Jerry Knirk told New Hampshire Public Radio that he believes it’s a public health issue and that lawmakers should be doing everything they can to stop teens from vaping. But Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said he would not support banning sales of any vaping products.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold Township:About 200 people rallied Saturday for Stephanie Parze, a 25-year-old missing Freehold Township woman, an effort by her family to keep a light burning for her. The group stood outlined in yellow police tape shaped into a heart as a tower ladder from the East Freehold Fire Company hoisted photographers over the crowd. Parze was last heard from on Oct. 30 after a night out with family. Her on-again, off-again boyfriend, John D. Ozbilgen, 29, was named by police as a person of interest. He took his own life on Nov. 22, hanging himself in the garage of his parents’ Freehold Township home. That was two days after he was released from Monmouth County Jail, where he was held for 11 days on a child pornography charge that resulted from a review of his cellphone in connection with Parze’s disappearance. Suspicion hung over Ozbligen up to his death. He was accused of choking and beating other women and posting Facebook messages and sending texts that alluded to abuse, violence and homicide. Parze’s father, Ed, said the outpouring of support has been surprising. One woman delivered 21 baskets of gifts worth thousands of dollars that she collected from neighbors to be auctioned off at a fundraiser. The family is continuing to schedule searches and fundraising events. A search will be staged at 9 a.m. Sunday at 333 Route 522 in Manalapan.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: President Donald Trump signed legislation Friday that extends federal grant programs aimed at preserving indigenous languages and expands eligibility so more tribes can participate. The legislation was named after Esther Martinez, a traditional storyteller and Tewa language advocate from northern New Mexico’s Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo who died in 2006. Her family, tribal leaders and members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation said reauthorization of the programs through 2024 marks a commitment by the federal government to keeping Alaska Native and American Indian languages alive. Dozens of tribes from Alaska to Hawaii, Arizona, New Mexico, Montana and Massachusetts have benefited from the programs over the years. There are more than 40 active grants totaling more than $11 million that are being used for language preservation and immersion efforts.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The most popular baby names in New York City last year were Liam and Emma, according to data released by city health officials Monday. Of the babies born in New York City in 2018, there were 779 Liams and 501 Emmas, according to the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s birth certificate records. The number of births in the city decreased from 117,013 in 2017 to 114,296 in 2018, according to the city’s data. Liam has been the top name for boys since 2016, and Emma has been the top name for girls since 2017. Some New Yorkers opted for rarer names: There were a handful of girls named Aminah, Ida and Zadie and boys called Bentley, Lucian and Warren. Nine of the top 10 boy names from 2017 remained on the list in 2018. Jayden was dropped from the 2018 list while Alexander was added as the 10th-most popular name. Eight of the top girl names stayed on the top 10 list for 2018. Amelia and Chloe joined the list as the ninth- and 10th-most popular names in 2018 respectively.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWaynesville: Authorities said a man impersonating a police officer pulled a woman over and told her to get out of her car at gunpoint. The man is still at large. The Haywood County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that the incident happened Sunday. The sheriff’s office said the man was driving a silver Dodge Charger with dark-tinted windows and white strobe lights. The woman thought it was a police vehicle and pulled over. The sheriff’s office said the man wore a black button up collared shirt, cargo pants and silver badge. He also had a gun on his belt. Authorities said the man pulled out his gun and told the woman to “get out of the car.” The woman drove off only for the man to briefly chase her in his car.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A landslide closed a road in the Bismarck area, but authorities said no one was injured. A driver called authorities Sunday afternoon about the impassable River Road. It wasn’t immediately known what caused the landslide that blocked both lanes of traffic. Burleigh County highway department engineers were assessing the situation and how best to reopen the road.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: Aerospace fans who have trouble fitting a museum visit into daytime hours will have the opportunity next year to make evening visits to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. The extended schedule once a month will give busy families and other people with time crunches more options to see and experience the museum’s exhibits, museum officials said. The museum is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. but will remain open until 8 p.m. on the first Thursday of each month beginning next year. Visitors on select evenings will get up-close looks at different vintage aircraft in the museum’s collection with volunteer experts on hand to discuss and answer questions. The museum near Dayton plays host to some 800,000 visitors a year who can see more than 350 aerospace vehicles and thousands of artifacts. It also shows movies and offers simulators and other attractions. Admissions and parking are free.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: An iconic building in downtown Tulsa that was once the world headquarters for televangelist Oral Roberts’ ministries is losing its distinctive diamond-shaped facade for safety reasons. The Tulsa World reported workers are removing the diamond-shaped slabs of granite that cover the Abundant Life Building, The building was originally constructed in 1958 but has been vacant since the 1980s. Its ownership has changed hands several times over the years. It’s now owned by Sharp Development. Brian Elliott, with Sharp Development, on Friday said several of the diamonds have fallen on their own. Preservation Oklahoma chose the windowless structure as one of 2016’s most endangered historic places. Preservationists said the building exemplifies at-risk midcentury architecture and is woven into the fabric of Tulsa’s past. The building had been subject to several nuisance violations between 2004 and 2014. A trespasser died in 2013 after falling down an elevator shaft.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:A group of homeless people followed up on a plan to set up tents on the state Capitol grounds Monday after being displaced from downtown under a camping ban passed by the City Council earlier this month. About 25 people with about a dozen tents occupied the park before State Police and Parks and Recreation Department officials arrived. State officials and Salem Housing Authority staff told the homeless they had two hours to leave the Oregon Capitol State Park. At least one camper was arrested on an outstanding warrant. City officials briefly revisited an idea to allow sanctioned tent camping Friday, but they have backed away from that proposal. Instead, they are redoubling efforts to find a space to operate a 90-day warming shelter after Salem First Presbyterian Church decided not to participate.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGladwyne: Joseph Segel, a “quintessential entrepreneur” who founded the home-shopping network QVC, has died, the company that owns the channel announced. He was 88. Segel died Saturday in Gladwyne because of congestive heart failure, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. He was remembered as an innovator for creating QVC, short for “Quality Value Convenience.” It launched in 1986 and was played by nearly 60 cable stations. It now reaches 380 million homes throughout the world, according to a press release from Qurate Retail Group. In 1993, Segel retired as chairman of QVC. He stayed on as a company adviser until 2013. Segel’s entrepreneurial streak wasn’t just limited to QVC. He also founded the Franklin Mint, a private mint company that produces commemorative coins and other collectibles. It is now owned by Sequential Brands Group.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBurrillville: State environmental officials have cited two people and are looking for four others they said were deer hunting out of season over the weekend. Environmental officers responded to Burrillville on Sunday after getting reports of out-of-season hunters, according to Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management posts on social media. The first officer on the scene made contact with two people they described as poachers, but four others fled into the woods. A department dog was brought to the scene and found three shotguns hidden under the snow and leaves. One was still loaded. A fourth hidden shotgun was located by officers searching another area of the woods. No names were released.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: Nearly 1,200 city employees are getting early Christmas presents in the form of January pay raises. The Spartanburg Herald-Journal reported that the County Council recently adopted the county’s first pay restructuring in more than a decade, which includes $5.3 million in annual pay increases and benefits for jobs in 27 pay grades ranging from $23,500 to $167,710. The increases will affect 1,183 employees. The Council had budgeted for 4% increases. Some will get more, and others will get less. County Administrator Cole Alverson said tax revenue is greater than expected, and all the raises can be paid for without a tax increase. The raises take effect Jan. 3, and will be seen in the Jan. 23 paychecks, he said. Designed to attract and retain employees, council members said they hope the raises make up for several lean budget years of no or little pay increases.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Two South Dakota companies have paid off all lunch debt in the Pierre School District. Karber Construction and American Trust Insurance have eliminated a negative balance of about $2,300 in students’ meal accounts. Mandy Karber said that as a small business, they were looking for a way to give back. She said it’s typical of the community where there are a lot of people willing to help out, according to the Argus Leader. American Trust Insurance said it raised about $1,000 with an employee-giving campaign. District business manager Darla Mayer said school officials are grateful for the generous individuals and businesses.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:Two American originals, Elvis Presley and David Lynch, will converge when Graceland plays host to a fan convention celebrating the 30th anniversary of “Twin Peaks.” The gathering – officially known as “Twin Peaks 30: Official Fan Celebration” – is set for April 3-5, with most events at the Elvis Presley’s Memphis entertainment complex across the street from the mansion. According to Graceland, the convention will include “‘Twin Peaks’-themed parties; exhibits of props and costumes; screenings of fan-favorite episodes; and autograph and meet-and-greet sessions “accompanied by cherry pie and ‘damn good coffee,’” according to a press release citing the culinary preferences of FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, the series hero played by Kyle MacLachlan. Celebrity guests who are scheduled to attend include Sherilyn Fenn, Mädchen Amick, Dana Ashbrook, Chrysta Bell, Michael Horse, James Marshall, Kimmy Robertson and Sheryl Lee. Lynch, the celebrated director who created the cult series with writer Mark Frost, is not scheduled to attend. Ticket packages for the “Twin Peaks 30: Official Fan Celebration” go on sale at 2 p.m. Thursday at www.graceland.com/TwinPeaks. Tickets initially will be offered in expensive “packages,” ranging from $399 to $999; one-day tickets and other types of admission are expected to be made available at a later date.\n\nTexas\n\nKaty: A dispute over a child’s haircut ended with gunfire Saturday at a barbershop, according to authorities. Deputies are looking for a man who shot an employee of a barbershop in the Houston suburb of Katy during an argument, the Harris County Sheriff’s office said in a tweet Saturday. Witnesses said the argument was over a haircut given to the man’s son. The alleged shooter left the barbershop in a grey, four-door sedan, according to the sheriff’s office. The employee was shot three times and was in stable condition at an area hospital, KPRC-TV reported Saturday. The sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to requests for information Sunday.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Federal officials are considering whether to allow a highway to be built through protected Mojave desert tortoise habitat in southern Utah, a plan that has drawn criticism from conservationists. The proposed four-lane highway would pass through the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area north of St. George to connect traffic from Washington City to St. George, the Spectrum newspaper reported. The Bureau of Land Management is taking public comments through Jan. 6 ahead of a draft environmental impact statement that’s expected to come out late spring or early summer. Elected officials in southern Utah have been pushing for the road to address current and future traffic concerns in one of the most rapidly growing parts of the country. Conservationists argue that officials should consider alternatives to a highway that could put the threatened tortoise and other sensitive species at risk.\n\nVermont\n\nBarre: Three school districts will soon be using electric buses to carry some of their students to and from school. The Barre Unified School District, Champlain Valley School District and Franklin West Supervisory District will each replace a regular bus as part of an electric bus pilot program. The districts were chosen from a long list of applicants to participate in the program funded by Vermont’s legal settlement with Volkswagen for violations of the Clean Air Act, MyChamplainValley.com reported. Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Emily Boedecker said it’s an opportunity to check the benefits of electric transport on a small scale. The Vermont Agency of Natural Resources and the Vermont Energy Investment Corporation are working together on the program. Over the next few months the districts will be working with the sponsors to purchase the buses, build charging infrastructure, and look at any other facility upgrades that might be needed.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam said Friday that he hired Melissa Baker to oversee 38 state parks and more than 270 employees. She will be the first woman to run the department in the park system’s 83-year history when she starts in January. Baker previously worked as the director of North Dakota Parks and Recreation Department and previously worked as chief of operations for Montana State Parks. She previously taught at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and the University of Maine.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Health officials are warning people to stay away from area beaches and bodies of water as the region’s record-breaking rainstorms have caused sewage spills. Medina Park Beach along Lake Washington, Saltwater State Park in Des Moines and Port Washington Narrows in Kitsap County were hit by sewage overflows caused by a 48-hour storm system that soaked the region. The heavy rainstorm began Thursday, dropping more than 6 inches of rain before easing up Saturday. Friday was the wettest day in Seattle in 10 years, and the most rain for Dec. 20 since record-keeping at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport began in 1945. The National Weather Service said the airport recorded 3.25 inches of rain Friday, making it also the fifth-rainiest day in city history. Seattle also broke a daily rainfall record on Thursday with 2.91 inches, making it the 11th-wettest day recorded at the airport. King County said the Medina Pump Station was fully functioning when it overflowed on Friday for about four hours. Advisory signs have been posted. Officials said coming into contact with fecal contaminated waters can cause gastroenteritis, skin rashes, upper respiratory infections, and other waterborne illnesses.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Residents who want to recycle their Christmas trees after the holidays will be able to donate them to be used for fish habitats. The recycling event is from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Jan. 4 at Charleston’s Capitol Market. There’s no limit to the number of trees each person can donate and no size limit. Trees must be real. All decorations must be removed, and branches must be attached to the tree. The trees will be repurposed as fish habitats in lakes across West Virginia, including Cheat, Tygart, Stonewall Jackson, Stonecoal, Burnsville, Sutton, Summersville, Big Ditch, Sherwood, R.D. Baily, Beech Fork and East Lynn lakes, and the Apple Grove Hatchery in Mason County. The program is sponsored by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection’s Rehabilitation Environmental Action Plan in conjunction with West Virginia State Parks and the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources. Staff will be at the donation site to help unload trees. Those who donate can register for prizes, and each person who donates will receive a gift from the Rehabilitation Environmental Action Plan.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWausau: For decades, those who have participated in snowball fights in Wausau have risked getting in trouble with the law. But that might be about to change. A 1962 ban on throwing projectiles in Wausau lumps snowballs into the same category as rocks and other items that can cause serious harm. City Council President Lisa Rasmussen said that recent negative national attention over the rarely used ordinance has raised questions about whether it could be time to take snowballs off the naughty list. Wausau police and the mayor even made a video showing officers having a snowball fight. The City Council will consider decriminalizing snowball fights at a meeting next month.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: The city plans to continue using police sharpshooters to reduce its deer population. A Wyoming Game and Fish Department permit allows the city to cull as many as 50 deer per year. A recent count showed 180 deer in the city limits, down from 192 in 2018 and nearly 300 in 2015, the Cody Enterprise reported. A task force in 2015 recommended reducing the deer population to 150. Police sharpshooters have killed 151 deer since the local program began. Allowing the herd to grow would cause the deer to have insufficient food and become unhealthy, Police Chief Chuck Baker said. The Police Department provides the deer to people willing to process and eat the meat.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/11/02/mikiztil-festival-exorcism-ranch-storms-underwater-impact-news-around-states/50894879/", "title": "Mikiztil festival, exorcism ranch: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuskegee: As early as next summer, Tuskegee University plans to move the needle in cancer genomics – the study of DNA sequence and gene expression differences between tumor cells and normal cells. With a $7.93 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, the university will build a new biomedical annex to its Carver Research Center to focus on cancer research and health disparities in underrepresented populations. “This award is recognition for the dedicated effort of the faculty, staff and students within the Center for Biomedical Research to eradicate health disparities, particularly in Alabama Black Belt,” Center for Biomedical Research director Dr. Clayton Yates said in a statement. “Students, particularly African-Americans and other underrepresented minorities, will receive training to become excellent biomedical research scientists, significantly benefitting from this state-of-the-art enhancement.” Booker T. Washington founded the historically Black university in 1881 with the purpose of educating Black teachers. Since then, the school has expanded its mission to include educating students for careers in the sciences, architecture, business and engineering. It also forged a path in bioethics for HBCUs. Tuskegee formed its National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care in response to the violations committed during the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A lawsuit filed in state court is challenging the eligibility of a legislative candidate to hold the seat. The lawsuit filed Monday alleges Democrat Jennifer “Jennie” Armstrong did not meet residency requirements on the date she filed to run for office. The complaint seeks an injunction barring state elections officials from certifying Armstrong as the winner of her Anchorage House race should she garner the most votes. Armstrong faces Republican Liz Vazquez in next week’s election. The case, brought by Chris Duke, Randy Eledge, Steve Strait and Kathryn Werdahl, names the state Division of Elections and its director as defendants. The plaintiffs are described as “public interest litigants.” Patty Sullivan, a spokesperson with the state Department of Law, said Tuesday morning that the department had not yet been served an official copy of the complaint and could not comment on the specific allegations. But she said that Armstrong has been certified for the ballot based on information she provided in her declaration of candidacy and that the time for any challenge to her eligibility under a state law and regulation has expired. “There is no process for the Division to find a candidate disqualified based on residency at this point in the process,” Sullivan said by email.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Crowds gathered at Steele Indian School Park on Sunday to honor the Indigenous roots of Día de los Muertos at the annual Mikiztil festival. “The Mikiztil is the painted decorated skull that you see, and it represents not death but transcendence,” said Zarco Guerrero, president, chair and co-founder of Cultural Coalition, the host organization of the event. Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, an ancient Mexican celebration with Indigenous Aztec roots, is typically observed Nov. 1-2 during the Catholic holidays of All Saints Day and All Souls Day. During this time, people honor their deceased relatives and invite their spirits back from beyond to join their families in the celebration. The Día de los Muertos celebration well-known today in the U.S. is a medley of Indigenous origins of the tradition mixed with forced Spanish and Catholic influence from the Europeans who conquered the lands of Indigenous people, according to Carmen Guerrero, executive director and co-founder of Cultural Coalition. The Mikiztli festival aims to revive and celebrate its Indigenous origins. “We’re trying to go back to the ancestral understanding of what this event really means. ... It was never about death. It was always about transcending to the next life,” Zarco Guerrero said. Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego acknowledged the city’s support and welcomed the crowd to the event. Shortly after began the Danza Mexica, a form of ancestral worship to what the Aztecs described as the four sacred directions: north, south, east and west.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The FBI is investigating after several people in the city told police someone called and said their children had been kidnapped and then demanded a ransom. The calls’ claims have been fake but are being investigated by local and federal law officers. Since Thursday, police took reports of a series of calls from across the city about kidnappings. The caller used the same phone number to claim that the targets’ children had been kidnapped and that they would only give the children back if a ransom were paid, police said. “These calls have been investigated and are confirmed to be scams,” according to a Fort Smith news release. In one of the calls, the victim’s child was confirmed safe. In another, the victim did not even have any children. “When the caller is pressed, their knowledge of the victims and the area appears to be limited and superficial,” police said. Anyone who gets a kidnapping call or any other suspicious call can report it to Fort Smith police or the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center at fbi.gov/tips.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The Hoopa Valley Tribe alleged in a lawsuit Monday that the federal government is violating its sovereignty and failing to collect money from California farms that rely on federally supplied water to pay for damages to tribal fisheries. The tribe, which has a reservation in northwest California, says in its lawsuit against the Biden administration that the Trinity River that it relies on for food and cultural purposes has been decimated by decades of the federal government diverting water. The suit alleges the U.S. Department of the Interior has failed to follow laws that require the contractors who use that water to pay money for habitat restoration projects. It says those contractors owe $340 million for environmental restoration work along the Trinity River and other places damaged by water diversions. “The river has become a place that is no longer a healing place, but a place that is a sick place,” said Jill Sherman-Warne, a member of the Hoopa tribal council. The suit also alleges that the federal government has failed to appropriately consult with the tribe on matters related to the river. The Interior Department declined to comment through spokesman Tyler Cherry.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man has been sentenced to more than 23 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to shooting a ranger at Rocky Mountain National Park last year. The ranger was wearing a bulletproof vest and wasn’t seriously injured. Daron Ellis, 29, of Aurora, was sentenced Monday in federal court in Denver after pleading guilty to attempted murder of a federal officer and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence, The Denver Post reports. The Dec. 8 shooting occurred after a Colorado State Patrol officer tried to stop Ellis outside the park for speeding. The trooper learned the car was stolen and ordered Ellis to leave the car, but Ellis sped off, authorities said. A National Park Service Law Enforcement ranger spotted the car at the Fall River entrance to the national park in Colorado and ordered Ellis to show his hands. Ellis shot the ranger in the chest with a semi-automatic handgun; the ranger returned fire, wounding Ellis, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado. The ranger’s identity hasn’t been released. Rocky Mountain National Park is about 50 miles northwest of Denver.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A former state representative pleaded guilty Tuesday in connection with the theft of more than $1.2 million in federal coronavirus relief funds from the city of West Haven, using some of the money for gambling at a casino, according to prosecutors. Michael DiMassa, a West Haven Democrat, appeared in federal court in Hartford and pleaded guilty to three counts of wire fraud conspiracy. DiMassa’s wife and his former business partner also pleaded guilty earlier this year, while a fourth person charged in the scheme awaits trial. At the time of the theft, DiMassa was both a state representative and an aide to the West Haven City Council. Prosecutors alleged he used his city position, which had authority to approve the reimbursement of COVID-19 expenditures, to steal the funds – some of which he used for gambling at the Mohegan Sun Casino in eastern Connecticut. DiMassa resigned from both positions after his arrest last year. No sentencing date was set for DiMassa. The sentencing guideline range for the charges to which he pleaded guilty is 41 to 51 months.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After years of hovering slightly under 1 million residents, the First State has surpassed that milestone − but just barely, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. The government estimated this summer that in July 2021, Delaware had 1,003,384 residents. Census Bureau data lags by about a year. While Delaware’s overall population growth has remained steady at an average of 1% per year since 2010, adults 65 and older have seen the fastest-growing numbers, with that population increasing 55% in the 11-year period. In contrast, the 35-to-49 age group declined the most, dropping 4.2% in the same time frame. Currently, the 50-to-64 age group makes up the largest share of Delaware’s population, at 20.5%. The 65-and-up age group comes in close second, however, making up 20.1% of the state’s population. Though adults ages 50 to 64 still account for the largest percentage of the state’s population, the rapid growth of the 65-plus age group comes as no surprise given the trend is also being seen nationally, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Community Living found.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: After decades of planning and years of delays, the D.C. region’s Metrorail system will open a long-awaited extension to Dulles International Airport in about two weeks. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced Monday that the second phase of its Silver Line extension into Loudoun County and the northern Virginia airport will open to passengers Nov. 15. The $3 billion extension adds more than 11 miles of track and six new stations. It has been plagued by cost overruns and criminal charges against contractors who falsified records to try to hide faulty concrete. It was originally scheduled to open in 2018 but faced numerous delays. The opening comes at a time where the Metrorail system continues to face a significant drop in ridership from its pre-pandemic levels, as well as an anticipated budget gap. In recent weeks, Metro officials had said they could not open the new line until safety regulators allowed the system’s 7000 series rail cars to return to use. They had been pulled from service after a derailment. Regulators approved a plan last week to return enough of the cars to service ahead of Thanksgiving to allow the Silver Line extension to open.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: Hurricane Ian ravaged southwest Florida on land but was destructive underwater as well. It destroyed human-made reefs and brought along red tide, the harmful algae blooms that kill fish and birds, according to marine researchers who returned last week from a six-day cruise organized by the Florida Institute of Oceanography. Researchers who used the cruise to study marine life in the Gulf of Mexico following the hurricane say it left in its wake red tide and destroyed artificial reefs from as far away as 30 miles from the coast of southwest Florida. “The onetime vibrant reefs are now underwater disaster sites themselves,” said Calli Johnson, safety dive officer for the research cruise. “Where there used to be a complete ecosystem, there are now only fish that were able to return after swimming away.” Before the Category 4 storm made landfall a month ago, southwest Florida had a reputation for being one of the best saltwater fishing destinations in the U.S. Saltwater and freshwater fishing in Florida has an economic impact of about $13.8 billion, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. “Time will tell how this affects our greater economy because changes in the fishing industry and tourism will come from changes in our underwater world,” Johnson said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Monday declined to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed against former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani by two women who served as election workers in Georgia in November 2020. In the lawsuit filed last December, Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss accused Giuliani of defaming them by falsely stating that the pair had engaged in election fraud while counting ballots at State Farm Arena in Atlanta. The lawsuit says Giuliani repeatedly pushed debunked claims that the mother-and-daughter pair pulled out suitcases of illegal ballots and committed other acts of fraud to try to alter the outcome of the presidential election in Georgia. In an opinion accompanying Monday’s order, U.S. District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell in Washington described the situation that followed the November 2020 election, when the vote totals in several key states were so close that the results were not immediately clear. “As election workers across the state worked long hours carefully ensuring the accuracy of the election, the Trump Campaign and its allies, including Giuliani, engaged in a media offensive that at best questioned, and at worse condemned, their work,” Howell wrote. Moss had worked for the Fulton County elections department since 2012 and supervised the absentee ballot operation during the 2020 election. Freeman, her mother, was a temporary election worker, verifying signatures on absentee ballots and preparing them to be counted and processed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The pilot of a helicopter that crashed on a remote lava field during a sunset tour in June told investigators that the engine had been swapped out but three earlier flights that day were normal. The National Transportation Safety Board on Monday released various documents related to the crash that injured all six people on board, but the agency has yet to release a probable cause for why the helicopter suddenly made “violent and uncommanded yaw and pitch changes.” The morning of the crash, the pilot and a mechanic took the helicopter on a operation control flight after its engine had been changed and there were no issues with the flight, according to the pilot’s accident report. The documents did not specify exactly when the engine was changed. The pilot then took the helicopter on two tours, which were also normal and uneventful. The helicopter crashed during a third tour and was found lying on its left side with significant damage to the cockpit, and the tail boom was nearly 800 feet from the main wreckage, according to one of the reports. A large piece of lava rock penetrated about 13 inches into the cockpit area. In a passenger statement, a 48-year-old man on the tour with his two 18-year-old daughters told investigators the helicopter suddenly felt upside down about 30 minutes into the flight.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A former longshot Idaho gubernatorial candidate was convicted Monday of kidnapping and killing a 12-year-old Colorado girl who went missing nearly 40 years ago. Jurors found Steve Pankey, 71, guilty of felony murder, second-degree kidnapping and false reporting in the disappearance and death of Jonelle Matthews in 1984, the office of district attorney Michael Rourke said. A judge then sentenced him to life prison with the possibility of parole, the Greeley Tribune reports. It was Pankey’s second trial in the case. Last year, jurors were unable to reach verdicts on the kidnapping and murder charges, and prosecutors decided to put him on trial again. Pankey was a neighbor of Jonelle and her family when she vanished after being dropped off at her empty home by a family friend after performing at a Christmas concert in Greeley, Colorado, a city about 50 miles north of Denver. He emerged as a person of interest in the case three decades later – shortly before Jonelle’s body was found in 2019 – after claiming to have information about what happened to her and asking for immunity from prosecution. Prosecutors said Pankey kept up to date on the case throughout the years even as he moved his family to several states before settling in Idaho, where he ran unsuccessfully as a Constitution Party candidate for Idaho governor in 2014 and in the Republican gubernatorial primary in 2018, the year authorities said he was named as a person of interest in the girl’s death.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The owner of a North Side senior housing facility where three women earlier this year died amid a brief May heat wave that caused temperatures in the building to soar into the low 90s has been fined $1,500 by the city’s buildings department. Citing city records, the Chicago Sun-Times reports that the fine was levied after an inspection by the buildings department found 11 code violations – two of which were the result of a rooftop air conditioning “chiller” that did not appear to be suitable for use on the exterior of the building. Records show, according to the newspaper, that the department determined that issues noted in the city’s first inspection had been addressed and that a second inspection determined there were “no dangerous and hazardous conditions.” By that time, the Hispanic Housing Development Corporation – a nonprofit organization that owns and manages the James Sneider Apartment – had, among other things, provided individual air conditioning units to every tenant. Mike Puccinelli, a buildings department spokesman, said the fine was levied before city officials had access to autopsy records that showed the deaths of the three women whose bodies were discovered May 14 were linked to the heat. He said the fine was based completely on the violations found during the inspection.\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel: After years of overcoming legal challenges and governmental hurdles, more than 200 people gathered excitedly Saturday to break ground on the Islamic Life Center in Carmel. “My heart is pounding so fast with no fear or sadness but truly with a feeling of joy and pleasure,” Nadeem Ikhlaque, Al Salam’s founding president, said from a podium at the site of the future center. “In my 54 years of life, I never had this feeling, but today I have – standing in front of you.” Carmel leaders, the Al Salam Foundation, Muslim members, and those from other faith communities and the public broke ground on the city’s first mosque. The center will be under the umbrella of the foundation, which is an Islamic nonprofit organization. “We are practicing our faith rituals – daily and weekly prayers, nightly prayers, fasting through the month of Ramadan,” Ashhar Madni, president of the Al Salam Foundation, told the crowd. “The other half of our faith is to do good deeds. ... While we worship our creator, we need to serve his creation as well.” The road to this point was not a straight line and showed the clash that can occur as cities become more diverse. While city, community and religious leaders largely supported the project, many Carmel residents of different cultural and religious backgrounds in nearby upscale neighborhoods protested against it, saying they were largely concerned with property values. Center members said Saturday that they looked forward to being a good and inviting neighbor.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Agriculture officials said Monday that another commercial egg farm in the state has been infected with bird flu – the first commercial farm case identified since April, when a turkey farm was infected. The latest case is in Wright County in north central Iowa, about 80 miles north of Des Moines, housing about 1.1 million chickens. Iowa has had 15 commercial farms infected this year, including turkeys, egg-laying hens and other chickens. In addition, five backyard flocks have been infected. Because the virus is highly contagious, all birds on an infected farm are killed and disposed of to avoid the spread of the disease. Iowa has been hardest hit with bird losses at more than 13.3 million this year before the latest farm was found infected. Nationally more than 47.7 million birds have been affected in 43 states that includes 251 commercial flocks and 328 backyard flocks, U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show. Most of the Iowa cases were during the spring migration of wild birds in March and April with one reported in early May. The virus hadn’t been detected again until a backyard flock was infected Oct. 20, and then the latest infection was confirmed Monday.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s top elections official warned voters Monday that text messages from outside the state were giving them incorrect information about where to vote, but groups involved in the texting said they weren’t trying to confuse or mislead people. Several Democrats said they began hearing about the texts Sunday or had received them. Each message said it was from a representative of Voting Futures, Voto Latino or Black Voters Matter and provided the address of a voting site, with a picture of a building. In some cases, the person already had voted; in others, people couldn’t vote in advance at the listed site, and in some, people could vote in advance there, but not on Election Day, Nov. 8. Movement Labs, a vendor headquartered in Oakland, California, working for both Voto Latino and Black Voters Matter, tweeted that texts also went to voters in Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina and Virginia. Kansas Democrats who learned of the texts worried that a disinformation campaign had targeted their voters in hopes of preventing their ballots from counting or discouraging them from voting. And Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a Republican, said voters should be on “high alert” about potential election misinformation from such texts.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Former U.S. Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky., whose tenacity and personal integrity formed the foundation of a long career in politics and public service, died Tuesday at his home in Louisville. He was one day shy of his 90th birthday. Charlie Mattingly, his former chief of staff, said Mazzoli’s mental acuity never waned, although his health declined, particularly in recent months. Throughout his 24 years in the House, Mazzoli defied the usual stereotypical descriptions applied to political figures. His unpredictable voting patterns occasionally prompted the casual observer describe him as a maverick, a term Mazzoli disliked. “I don’t like labels,” he said in 1988. “I don’t consider myself anything but thoughtful.” Mazzoli’s nature frequently put him in conflict with his party on issues of substance and matters of conscience. Although he pledged in his first House speech to support the Equal Rights Amendment, he alienated women’s groups that were trying to keep the amendment alive in 1983 by voting to defeat an ERA resolution. He said Democratic leaders had not provided enough time to discuss its impact on abortion and women in the draft. A devout Catholic, Mazzoli strongly opposed abortion, putting him at odds with members of his party’s liberal Washington establishment. He frequently angered organized labor by refusing to support protectionist legislation and voted once to support the veto of a Democratic bill to raise the minimum wage.\n\nLouisiana\n\nFerriday: The family of legendary rock ’n’ roll pioneer Jerry Lee Lewis has announced details of memorial services planned this weekend for his birthplace. Lewis, known for hits such as “Great Balls of Fire” and many others, died Friday at age 87. The funeral service is set for 11 a.m. Central Daylight Time on Saturday at Young’s Funeral Home in Ferriday, family members said. There will be very limited public availability, but the ceremony will be livestreamed, with details to be announced later on Lewis’ Facebook page. A private burial will follow. A celebration of life is also planned for 1 p.m. that day at the Arcade Theater in Ferriday, Lewis’ representatives said. Lewis was the last survivor of a generation of artists that rewrote music history, a group that included Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry and Little Richard.\n\nMaine\n\nEtna: A 74-year-old man who spent nearly 30 hours lost in the woods was hypothermic and unable to move when he was found by a game warden using a tracking dog, officials said. Joseph Nolin knew his ordeal was over when he heard a bell attached to the Labrador retriever’s collar, and then the dog bounded up and started licking him Monday afternoon, his son told wardens. Nolin walked until he couldn’t move and told wardens he wouldn’t have survived another night in the woods. He was found a mile from his house deep in the woods at the edge of the Etna Bog, officials said. A Maine Forest Service helicopter was used to retrieve Nolin, and he was released after being hydrated and warmed up, officials said. Nolen had been last seen Sunday morning, when he departed to check on game cameras in the woods. He son reported him missing Sunday evening.\n\nMaryland\n\nBowie: A representative for the company staging a Halloween magic performance at Six Flags America says an emergency call that medics described as a serious injury caused by sword swallowing was caused by an “unrelated medical condition,” WUSA-TV reports. The call for help came from Six Flags in Bowie between 9:30 and 10 p.m. Saturday evening. “It was not for an accident during the show but rather for other unrelated health conditions,” said Josh Bowren, production manager for Aaron Radatz Productionz, which staged the show, according to Six Flags officials. Bowren did not name the actor, whom he described as “our sword swallower,” and authorities have not released the name of the injured person. The performer was a 59-year-old man who was in serious but not life-threatening condition when he was transported to Capital Region Health Hospital in Largo on Saturday night, rescuers said. Rescuers described the weapon to medical workers as “a haunted house sword” and said it occurred during a “Halloween show.” A spokesperson for Six Flags said the company’s “thoughts and prayers are with the performer and his family.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A retired state trooper who was killed in what authorities described as a shooting motivated by racism and an officer who drowned while trying to save the life of a teenager were honored Tuesday with awards for exemplary acts of bravery. A total of 32 Massachusetts law enforcement personnel were named recipients of the annual George L. Hanna Memorial Award for Bravery by Gov. Charlie Baker during a ceremony at Mechanics Hall in Worcester. Hanna was a state trooper shot and killed during a traffic stop in Auburn in 1983. Two of his children participated in Tuesday’s ceremony. “Like Trooper George Hanna, the dedicated women and men in law enforcement perform exceptional work guided by their deeply rooted commitment to helping others, no matter the risk to themselves,” Baker said in a statement. Retired state Trooper David L. Green, 68, left his Winthrop home in June 2021 to investigate a truck crash and was shot multiple times by a white man who authorities say had expressed antisemitic and anti-Black views. Green and Ramona Cooper, a 60-year-old Air Force veteran, were killed. Both were Black.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The family of Porter Burks, a Black man fatally shot during an early morning confrontation with Detroit police, is suing the city for $50 million, their lawyer announced Tuesday. Five unnamed officers also are named in the wrongful death lawsuit filed Tuesday by attorney Geoffrey Fieger. It claims gross negligence and assault and battery, among other things. Burks’ Oct. 2 death was recorded by police body cameras as officers pleaded with him to drop a knife he was carrying. They initially were called to a home on the west side about a knife-wielding man who was having a mental health crisis and spoke to a man who identified himself as Burks’ brother. The man said Burks had slashed the tires on his car. “Drop the knife for me, man. Come here real quick. You’re OK,” a member of the Detroit Police Department’s crisis intervention team can be heard telling Burks. “You’re not in any trouble. Can you just talk to me and drop the knife?” “You’re not in any trouble, OK?” the officer continued. “I just want to help you. I just want to help you, man. OK? Can you just drop the knife for me please? Please? Whatever you’re going through, I can help you.” Burks – who police say had schizophrenia – was shot as he sprinted toward officers from the middle of the street.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBrainerd: A man is accused of fatally shooting his daughter’s boyfriend who he suspected was abusing her. The 45-year-old Brainerd father is charged with second-degree murder in the death of 23-year-old Bryce Brogle, who was reported missing after going to the man’s storage unit Oct. 26. According to a criminal complaint, the father shot Brogle in the back of the head from a distance and then buried his body in Crow Wing County. The defendant’s daughter reported her boyfriend missing Oct. 28, telling police he hadn’t been seen since he went to the storage unit with her father. Investigators executed a search warrant Oct. 29 at the storage unit and said they found the presence of blood and bleach on the concrete floor and signs something had been dragged across the floor. The following day, law enforcement officers searched land in Crow Wing County on foot and found a grave site. The complaint said that after it was excavated, they found a body with a gunshot wound to the back of the head. An autopsy confirmed it was Brogle. According to the charges, the landlord for Brogle and his girlfriend called the sheriff’s office, saying the father has asked if Brogle had hurt his daughter. The landlord said his daughter had been seen with two black eyes. The complaint said the father then told the landlord he was going to kill Brogle, and he’d already dug a hole.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency confirmed Monday that the city’s water is safe to drink, after months of sampling at a treatment plant overwhelmed by August flooding that caused wide supply disruptions. The beleaguered O.B. Curtis water treatment plant fell into crisis after the late summer flooding left 150,000 people without running water for several days. People waited in lines for water to drink, bathe, cook and flush toilets. The crisis also added to the rising costs for business owners already saddled with a labor shortage and high inflation. The city had already been under a boil-water notice since late July because the state health department found cloudy water that could make people ill. But current water samples pass muster for safe consumption, the EPA said. “Current sampling confirms water delivered from J.H. Fewell Water and O.B. Curtis Water Treatment is safe to drink,” said Maria Michalos, a spokesperson for the EPA, referring to the city’s two water treatment plants. The agency encouraged Jackson residents to stay vigilant about updates and follow all future boil water advisories, as “localized issues” may resurface. It is not yet certain whether Jackson has too much lead and copper in its water. Sampling has been completed, and results are expected in mid-November.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state’s health department is investigating whether a hospital violated federal health care rules in denying a woman an emergency abortion, an agency spokeswoman confirmed Monday. Missouri Health and Senior Services spokeswoman Lisa Cox in a statement said the agency launched an investigation into southern Missouri’s Freeman Health System’s treatment of Mylissa Farmer. Farmer, who is from Joplin, told the Associated Press she went to the system’s local emergency room when her water broke months early Aug. 2. She said tests showed she had lost all of her amniotic fluid because of a pregnancy complication, and doctors told her the fetus was not expected to survive. Doctors also told Farmer that “awaiting a medical emergency may put her at further risk for maternal mortality” or the removal of her uterus, medical records show. But because her fetus still had a heartbeat, and her condition wasn’t considered a life-threatening medical emergency at that moment, they couldn’t terminate the pregnancy in Missouri, they told her. She eventually got an abortion in Illinois. Records from that visit say doctors told Farmer that the law supersedes their medical judgment, and “contrary to the most appropriate management based (on) my medical opinion, due to the legal language of MO law, we are unable to offer induction of labor at this time.” “They were telling me to basically get out of the state to get the care that I needed,” the 41-year-old told AP.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: A woman was cited for animal cruelty Thursday for shooting and skinning a 6-month-old husky and posting pictures of herself with the animal online bragging that she had shot a young wolf, officials said. The husky was among a group of 18 dogs and puppies, including German shepherd mixes, that had been abandoned on national forest land in northwestern Montana in mid-September, the Flathead County Sheriff’s Office has said. The investigation led the woman to be cited with a misdemeanor and not charged with a felony because officers believe they can prove negligence but not intent, the Sheriff’s Office told NBC Montana. The citation gives the woman two weeks to appear in Justice Court, Officer Paul Charbonneau said. The Flathead County Animal Shelter cared for the dogs, some of which had parvo, a viral infection that causes vomiting and diarrhea. Charbonneau said he believed all the dogs had been adopted.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A Halloween celebration turned frantic after a man drove through a barricaded area and was shot by a police officer Monday night, police said. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the shooting occurred during the popular annual “Halloween on the Boulevard” block party in the Minne Lusa neighborhood in Omaha. Children and adults were out in the neighborhood trick-or-treating when a car drove recklessly through a blocked-off area shortly after 7 p.m., Omaha Police Lt. Neal Bonacci said. The driver of the vehicle was shot by an Omaha police officer and taken to Nebraska Medical Center with serious injuries. The name of the driver has not yet been released. Police say no one else was injured. Chrissy Lopez, a resident of the neighborhood, told the Omaha World-Herald that the vehicle initially drove slowly through the crowd as people yelled at the driver to stop. “He would stop and then drive a little more,” she said. “I heard his engine rev, and people started screaming, and I thought, ‘Oh no.’ And then I heard the gunshots, and everybody just started screaming and running and crying.” Police and firefighters were already on the scene for the block party, which is put on by the Miller Park Minne Lusa Neighborhood Association and draws thousands of people to the area each year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The Republican National Committee is asking a judge to order election officials in Las Vegas to hire more GOP poll workers to correct what a legal filing calls a disproportionate imbalance favoring Democrats. A Clark County District Court judge is scheduled Wednesday to consider accusations that county elections chief Joe Gloria “stacked” a key ballot signature verification board with 23 Democrats, 33 nonpartisans and “a mere” eight Republicans. Dan Kulin, spokesman for Gloria, declined Monday to comment on a matter pending before a judge. “The registrar’s lopsided staffing of the signature verification board is not remotely ‘as equal as possible’ ” under state law, attorneys representing the RNC alleged in a document filed Friday. “He created a signature verification board with a partisan makeup that tilts sharply against Republicans.” Judge Timothy Williams had signed off Oct. 5 on a pact between the two sides after the county agreed to provide to the RNC a roster showing job titles and political party affiliations of poll workers. The RNC dropped a demand to obtain workers’ names. Voter registration leans Democratic in Clark County, the most populous area of Nevada and home to nearly 1.3 million, or more than 71%, of the state’s 1.8 million active registered voters.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: A U.S. House candidate on the ballot in next week’s election would be the youngest woman ever in Congress if she wins. Karoline Leavitt recalls being in her college dining hall in 2018, filling out an application for a White House intern job while her friends were tailgating at a football game. “I remember thinking, ‘If I made this opportunity, it’s worth missing any football game in the world,’ ” she told the Associated Press in an interview She got the job. That eventually led to a position in President Donald Trump’s White House press office, then another as communications director for Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. Inspired by Stefanik, the youngest woman elected to Congress when she won in 2014 at age 30, Leavitt is now running for a House seat of her own. At age 25, she could make history on Election Day: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., won at 29 in 2018. Leavitt, an unabashed pro-Trump Republican, would also be the youngest person in the next session of Congress if she were to defeat two-term Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in one of the most competitive races this year. Leavitt is seven months younger then fellow Gen Z candidate Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a Florida Democrat favored in his race. Leavitt won her 10-way Republican primary in September in part by going to the right of the other candidates. “I consistently continue to be the only candidate in this race who says that I believe the 2020 election was undoubtedly stolen from President Trump,” she said during a debate.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: While COVID-19 has been at the forefront of health concerns for more than two years, another group of infections has continued to spread among New Jersey residents. Chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis have become more prevalent among adults and teens over the past decade, according to data from the New Jersey Health Department. Incidences of the three infections rose 40% between 2012 and 2019, according to state data. While it caused a small drop-off in disease rates, the COVID-19 pandemic failed to significantly slow down the spread of sexually transmitted infections across the state, said Dr. Edward Liu, the infectious disease section chief at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune. “Even during the pandemic … their behaviors didn’t change that much,” he said. “Or maybe they were so cooped up that they had to have some type of outlet.” While rates of infection for chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis did drop during 2020, the rate still exceeded the rate for 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Although all three infections are treatable with certain antibiotics, experts worry that they may soon run out of medications capable of treating gonorrhea. Greta Anschuetz, the assistant acting commissioner at the New Jersey Department of Health who leads the division of HIV, STD and TB Services, said her office is concerned about the infection. “Gonorrhea has figured out how to be resistant to every drug, and we’re on the last of the (known, effective) drugs,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A sheriff’s department has submitted its investigative findings to prosecutors in the death of a cinematographer shot and killed by Alec Baldwin on a film set in New Mexico in October 2021. Santa Fe Sheriff’s Office spokesman Juan Ríos said Thursday that two binders of information were turned over to the Santa Fe-based district attorney’s office, without setting forth any recommendations about possible criminal charges. He said the case file outlines all the evidence collected, including investigative interviews and forensic analysis of physical evidence by the FBI. District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said through a spokeswoman that investigators and prosecutors will now begin a thorough review to make a timely decision about whether to bring charges, without mention of specific deadlines. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins died shortly after being wounded by a gunshot during setup for a scene in the western movie “Rust” at a filmset ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe on Oct. 21, 2021. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The debut of a giant “Bluey” balloon, Lea Michele and the Broadway cast of “Funny Girl,” and the legendary Dionne Warwick are some of the highlights slated for this year’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. This year’s parade – the 96th annual – will feature 16 giant character balloons, 28 floats, 40 novelty and heritage inflatables, 12 marching bands, 700 clowns, 10 performance groups and, of course, Santa Claus. New balloon giants joining the line-up Nov. 24 include Stuart the one-eyed Minion from “Despicable Me 2”; a new green dinosaur, an Apatosaurus; the debut of the animated sensation “Bluey”; and a new “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” balloon. Other celebrities slated to be on hand include Paula Abdul, making her parade debut; Fitz and the Tantrums; Big Time Rush; “Blue’s Clues & You!” host Josh Dela Cruz; Gloria Estefan along with her daughter, Emily, and grandson, Sasha; Kirk Franklin; Mario Lopez; Ziggy Marley; and Miss America 2022 Emma Broyles. The singers Joss Stone, Jordin Sparks and Betty Who will all be part of the festivities, as will the stars of Peacock’s “Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin” – Adam Devine, Sarah Hyland and Flula Borg. Jimmy Fallon & The Roots will be on a float celebrating Central Park.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper on Tuesday announced a new commission tasked with making recommendations on changing how the boards guiding the University of North Carolina system and its 17 member schools are chosen, bidding to broaden their membership by political leanings, race and gender. The Democratic governor essentially blamed the Republican-controlled Legislature for contributing to problems within the governing structure of one of the country’s leading public university systems – with 240,000 students and UNC-Chapel Hill and N.C. State University as its flagship campuses. “The UNC system is the envy of the nation for what we have built here,” Cooper said at an Executive Mansion news conference. “But there are signs of trouble that come when all of the appointed leaders are chosen by too few … we have an appointed university leadership that doesn’t come close to reflecting our diversity.” As a reminder of partisanship he blames for the system’s stumbling, Cooper stood beside commission co-chairs Tom Ross and Margaret Spellings, two recent UNC system presidents. Both got pushed out in different ways by previous editions of the UNC Board of Governors that were controlled by GOP-approved members.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A judge ruled Monday that he will keep the state’s ban on abortion from taking effect, saying there’s a “substantial probability” that a constitutional challenge to the law will succeed. Judge Bruce Romanick’s ruling means abortion is still legal in North Dakota, though the state’s only clinic – the Red River Women’s Clinic of Fargo – shut down as it challenged the ban and has moved across the border to neighboring Minnesota. Romanick last month rejected a request from North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley to let the law take effect while the Red River clinic’s lawsuit went forward. Romanick based his earlier decision on several factors, but Wrigley argued he had not sufficiently considered the clinic’s chances of prevailing in court. The North Dakota Supreme Court agreed and told Romanick to take another look. In his earlier ruling, Romanick noted the clinic’s uphill battle. But in his ruling Monday, he said the clinic has a “substantial probability” of succeeding, though he noted that the question of whether abortion is a constitutional right in North Dakota has been contentious and has not been decided by the state’s highest court.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A man was arrested Saturday at the Hamilton County Board of Elections after officials say he yelled through a megaphone on the premises and refused to leave. Stephan Pryor, 43, of Over-the-Rhine, is charged with criminal trespassing after the weekend incident at the Norwood facility. Officers engaged with Pryor about 1:30 p.m., while early in-person voting was underway for the day. According to board of elections director Sherry Poland, the board implemented a policy in March banning the use of bullhorns on the premises because they can be heard inside. Ohio law prohibits campaigning inside a polling location. Pryor was reportedly asked to stop using the bullhorn and to leave the property. He refused, Poland said, and Norwood police responded to ask him to leave. He was arrested after refusing again, an incident report says. In an interview Monday evening, Pryor said after he cast a ballot, he went to advertise candidates as he often does for elections. It is not the first time he’s used a megaphone at the facility, he said. He said he was standing the proper distance from the building and didn’t break laws regarding polling place advertisements. He cited that the board’s recent rule regarding megaphones is not protected directly by Ohio Revised Code. “They did me wrong. They arrested me in front of everybody – that was wrong,” Pryor said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nRamona: A ranch with a history of exorcisms is being revamped into a resort. When Amber Stewart found out that Tri County Technology Center was selling a 114-acre property just off Highway 75, she leapt at the opportunity to own the land despite its history. “My husband (David) and I had wanted to buy it for years and years and years,” Amber Stewart said. “It was something that we had talked about, dreamed about and didn’t really think would come to fruition. But when we found out the property was for sale, we were feeling like this is the Lord’s will for us.” Jarrett Farm Resort, 24 miles north of Tulsa, has a history as a commercial property tracing back to the 1940s. It’s been a commercial farm, a conference and retreat center and, for a few years, home to an order of Catholic priests known for performing exorcisms. The Stewarts hope to restore its reputation as a vacation getaway, but it has been an immense challenge. “There were dead mice and large spiders ... there was a raccoon living in the attic,” Amber Stewart said. The Stewarts actually spent the first night of their honeymoon 20 years ago during its previous iteration as a resort. The Catholic Diocese of Tulsa then purchased Jarrett Farm and used it from 2014 to 2018 as a home for an order of priests known for performing exorcisms, according to county records and reports from the diocese. The Stewarts have faced a mix of curiosity and resistance from some residents in Ramona’s small community, but they intend to “honor the story” of Jarrett Farm.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s pioneering motor voter program, in which residents who interact with the motor vehicle division are automatically registered to vote, hit a minor software speed bump, but Oregon’s secretary of state said Monday that it’s being resolved. Secretary of State Shemia Fagan said the Oregon Elections Division on Friday discovered the software error, which for the past six years has failed to preregister some 16- and 17-year-olds to vote. “As a result, 7,767 eligible voters in Oregon … were not given the opportunity to become automatically registered voters for the 2022 election. The issue has impacted voters during the last three election cycles,” Fagan’s office said in a statement. Fagan will direct Oregon’s 36 county clerks to issue ballots to affected voters – those who will be 18 or older Nov. 8. “Eligible voters not receiving their ballots in Oregon is unacceptable,” Fagan’s statement said. “As long as I am Oregon’s Secretary of State, I will do everything in my power to ensure that no eligible voters are disenfranchised.” The Oregon Elections Division was alerted to the issue by a voter who didn’t receive a ballot. Fagan said her technical staff worked through the weekend to resolve the software error.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nStroudsburg: Prosecutors say they have found no evidence of criminal negligence in a gas main rupture under an eastern Pennsylvania roadway and a subsequent fatal single-vehicle crash early on Christmas Day almost two years ago. The Monroe County district attorney’s office said Monday that all parties involved were cooperative in the investigation into the Pocono Township rupture and crash on Route 314 that killed 33-year-old Ana Abreu, of New York City. Township police said Abreu, her husband, their 2-month-old child and another family member were in a sport utility vehicle heading north toward the intersection with Route 611 about 1:30 a.m. on Christmas morning in 2020. Police said a natural gas main beneath the roadway ruptured, flipping the SUV over onto its roof and killing Abreu. The rupture left a large hole in the road, exposing the gas main underneath and a fracture in the pipeline, prosecutors said. A UGI Utilities spokesperson told LehighValleyLive.com that the company was “encouraged” by the decision but declined additional comment.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Bus drivers have reached a tentative settlement with their employer, First Student, avoiding a strike that was scheduled to begin Wednesday. The bus drivers, monitors and aides are members of Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union. The strike would have affected bus drivers in Lincoln, West Warwick and the state bus yard in Cranston, who transport students with special needs, among others. The settlement includes a four-year contract that provides a fair wage increase and an increase in guaranteed hours, the union said. The 275 members of the union are expected to ratify the contract, at which time more details will be provided. “I’ve been a school bus driver for 13 years, and many of the kids I transport have special physical and behavioral needs that require special accommodations and increased attention,” said Mike McDermott, a bus driver at the metro yard in Cranston. “We are happy that First Student was finally willing to come to the table with proposals that will help us better take care of our families and do our jobs. Even before the pandemic, First Student could not recruit bus drivers, monitors to do this work, and we are hopeful that better hours and pay will go a long way in attracting more workers to the field. At the end of the day, it’s our students who benefit most.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGrenville: Voters in Greenville County will be allowed to wear “Black Lives Matter” and “Make America Great Again” paraphernalia to the polls this Election Day, according to a notice sent to poll workers by county Elections Director Conway Belangia. He said the county’s decision is the result of a court ruling in Minnesota allowing the same practice. He said the American Civil Liberties Union alerted the county to the ruling. The county attorney was brought in to review the situation, and he determined the Minnesota court ruling, which found BLM and MAGA gear should not be considered prohibited campaign materials, applied to Greenville County. Belangia said the change of interpretation applies only to voters in Greenville County, but the state election commission had previously ruled in a similar manner. The county was a “Johnny-come-lately” in its determination to allow BLM and MAGA gear, Belangia said. Voters are still prohibited from wearing gear for any specific candidate inside polling places.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld a lower court’s decision to block parts of a South Dakota law that would have required ballot petition workers to publicly disclose their personal identification information. The Republican-controlled Legislature in 2020 passed a law that would have required paid ballot measure circulators to list their personal information, including phone number, residential address, email address and driver’s license information, in a directory. The law was just one attempt by lawmakers in recent years to add barriers to ballot measures, which have given progressive causes a chance at enactment in the politically red state. Circuit Judge Steven Grasz wrote in an opinion for a three-judge panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that being forced to disclose the information would be “chilling in today’s world” and the law would violate the First Amendment. United States District Judge Lawrence Piersol issued a temporary injunction against the law last year. Dakotans for Health, an organization that was formed around a ballot measure to expand Medicaid eligibility, sued to have the law overturned. The organization is now focused on placing a proposed constitutional amendment on the 2024 ballot to codify abortion rights.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A man accused of intentionally setting fire to a Planned Parenthood clinic and of firing shots later at a federal courthouse died months ago, officials announced Monday in disclosing both the man’s death and the allegations. Federal court documents indicate that the man, Mark Thomas Reno, 64, died Aug. 15. Yet many of the documents in his case were sealed until this week, including records showing he had been arrested in connection with the Planned Parenthood arson fire. “The government’s investigation has revealed that (Reno) engaged in a series of violent acts of property destruction in Knoxville since early 2021,” a newly unsealed complaint said. The complaint said Reno fired a shotgun at the clinic’s doors in early 2021, shattering glass and leaving holes in the reception area. Reno then set the clinic ablaze in December 2021, the document said. The building was unoccupied during the fire but had to be closed for months to undergo an $2.2 million renovation. Other court documents show that the FBI began surveillance of Reno in April of this year after he told an undercover agent he belonged to a group with a mission to resist actions opposed to Catholic orthodoxy. The agent was secretly recording Reno, who said that his group had “plenty of targets,” according to the documents.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The leaders of a group that promotes election conspiracy theories were jailed Monday for not complying with a court order to provide information in a defamation lawsuit over some of their claims. Catherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips, who run True the Vote, were ordered detained by U.S. marshals, according to an order signed by U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt in Houston. They will be held for at least one day or “until they fully comply with the Court’s Order,” Hoyt wrote. Houston-based True the Vote provided research for a debunked documentary that alleged widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Engelbrecht, Phillips and their nonprofit organization are being sued by Michigan-based election software provider Konnech Inc. over True the Vote’s claims of a Chinese-related conspiracy involving U.S. poll workers’ information. Alfredo Perez, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service in Houston, said Monday that Engelbrecht and Phillips were in the law enforcement agency’s custody. True the Vote said in a statement read during a video livestream Monday that its attorneys would appeal Hoyt’s ruling.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: For years, water conservation advocates have urged the state to offer money to residents to incentivize them to remove their lawns. For some, at least, that proposal came closer to reality Friday, with water officials set to start taking applications for a pilot program that could pay up to $1 per square foot to Utahns who want to replace their water-guzzling grass with drought-resistant landscaping. The Legislature earlier this year approved a $5 million expenditure to fund a statewide grass removal rebate program. State water officials plan a full launch of the program next spring via a new website, UtahWaterSavers.com, but in the meantime, residents can apply for the pilot program on the Utah Division of Water Resources website, conservewater.utah.gov/grass-removal-rebates, with a limited number of spaces available. Applicants who are approved get a year to complete their landscaping project as long as they meet the criteria, which include requirements for the type of replacement landscaping allowed in each part of the state. Turf removal programs have proven successful in desert cities like Las Vegas, dropping per-capita use, but have been slow to develop in Utah, with water managers often citing a lack of funding.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: In a national assessment of learning, Vermont student performance in math and reading was about average compared to the nation but continued a downward trend the state has seen on national standardized tests since before COVID-19. Vermont students predictably performed below 2019 levels – the last time the test was administered – in math and reading on the National Assessment of Educational Progress test and in most cases aligned with the average U.S. score. The test was administered to fourth and eighth graders in math and reading. The test is usually given every two years as a way to measure national and statewide progress over time but was postponed in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Vermont, 202 schools participated in 2022. For the second time in a row, Vermont’s fourth grade math scores dipped below the national average, albeit by one point. Vermont fourth graders’ math scores fell five points overall compared to 2019. This year’s score was 234 on a scale of 500. Math proficiency for both fourth and eighth graders in Vermont had been increasing from the mid-1990s until about 2013, when the scores turned the other direction, and have been in a gradual decline ever since. In 2022, about 35% of fourth grade students were proficient in math.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: In the past four years, the state has seen opioid overdose deaths among Black residents more than triple – the highest death rate, by far, of any demographic. The numbers underscore the lethality of a fentanyl-polluted drug supply, as well as structural barriers to entering recovery, a critical first step in preventing fatal overdose, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. The numbers – made publicly available by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention death certificate database – tell the story of a striking rise, particularly in the Richmond metropolitan area. Chesterfield County had 34 deaths in 2021, up from 11 in 2018. Henrico County spiked similarly, up to 44 deaths from 14, and Richmond accounted for 135 deaths, up from 41 deaths in 2018. The spike was more acute in Richmond than in any other county in the state. “It desensitizes you to death,” said Darryl Cousins, whocounts three friends who have died of an overdose in the past two months. Cousins, a Black man, works for Starfish Recovery and Wellness, a Richmond-based recovery residence for people with addiction. He’s been sober for 15 years, he said, and shares a long view on how the city has changed in that time. Most frightening is the drug that seems to be everywhere these days. “All of a sudden it’s in every drug being sold,” Cousins said. “Fentanyl has taken over the drug world.”\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: A flatbed truck carrying 500 gallons of liquid detergent hit the median on Highway 3 on Monday evening near Gorst, spilling the fluid onto the road and then into the Puget Sound. The crash near milepost 35 was reported at 5:40 p.m. and cleared about 7 p.m., blocking traffic in each direction for the duration, according to Washington State Patrol Trooper Katherine Weatherwax. The driver told investigators he fell asleep, Weatherwax said. The state Department of Ecology was notified. The detergent that spilled is designed to clean trucks.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State transportation officials say construction has begun on a full-service Division of Motor Vehicles regional office in Morgan County. The new office being built in Berkeley Springs will bring additional driver’s licensing and vehicle services to the citizens of the Eastern Panhandle, officials said in a news release Thursday. It is expected to open in the spring of 2023. “We know how busy our Martinsburg and Charles Town Regional Offices are on a daily basis,” said Everett Frazier, commissioner of the state’s Division Of Motor Vehicles. “Population continues to grow in that location, and opening an office in Morgan County will help us to provide accessible, more efficient and convenient customer service to that area.” A staff of a dozen people or more could be employed at the Morgan County office, and hiring will begin soon, Frazier said. Full-service DMV regional offices offer driver’s license skills testing, written knowledge tests, vehicle registration renewals, title work and other services. A motorcycle course will also be built at the new office.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge on Monday scheduled a two-day sentencing hearing for a man who killed six people when he drove his SUV through a Christmas parade in suburban Milwaukee last year. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow set Darrell Brooks’ sentencing for Nov. 15-16 to accommodate dozens of people who want to speak at the proceeding. Prosecutors told the judge they expect at least 36 people will speak. Brooks said he anticipates about 20 people will speak on his behalf. A jury last Wednesday convicted Brooks of 76 counts in connection with the Nov. 21, 2021, incident in Waukesha. The charges include six counts of first-degree intentional homicide and 61 counts of recklessly endangering safety. Each homicide count carries a mandatory life sentence, although Dorow can decide whether Brooks could be released on extended supervision at some point. Each endangerment count carries a maximum sentence of 171/ 2 years.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A contentious “glamping” development is in question again, with Teton County officials saying they might force a pause to construction underway near Teton Village, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. County commissioners warned the companies involved might be told to obtain county permits in the wake of opposition from neighbors and advocates worried about the effects on the land and water supplies, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/08/25/teacher-strike-eagle-paradox-forest-restoration-news-around-states/50638451/", "title": "Teacher strike, eagle paradox: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: City leaders complained, yet agreed to a $5 million bailout to help the World Games 2022 reduce a roughly $15 million debt from the sporting event held in the city last month. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the metro area did benefit from the 11-day Olympics-style competition. But he also joined council members in criticizing a lack of transparency about the finances of the event, which featured sports ranging from parachuting to billiards. “I know each of you enough to know this sucks,” Mayor Randall Woodfin told the council at their meeting Tuesday. “I feel the same way you feel.” The World Games lost $2.5 million in expected sponsorships in May, and ticket sales fell about 200,000 short of projections, said Nick Sellers, chief executive of the World Games Organizing Committee. While expenses were lower than projected, the lack of revenue still caused a budget crunch, he said. More than 100 companies or individuals, many of them from Alabama, are owed about $15 million, officials said. Some area companies also complained about a decline in business during the event, which didn’t draw the expected number of international visitors during its run July 7-17. The Birmingham games marked only the second time a U.S. city played host to the World Games in its four-decade-long existence.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican U.S. House candidate Tara Sweeney said Tuesday that she plans to end her campaign, saying she does not see a path to victory or to raise the resources needed to be successful in the November general election. Sweeney was positioned in fourth place after last week’s U.S. House primary as elections officials continued to count ballots. But she was far behind the top finishers, Democrat Mary Peltola and Republicans Sarah Palin and Nick Begich, who were already poised to advance to the November general election. An election process approved by voters in 2020 calls for the top four vote-getters in a primary to advance to the general election, in which ranked-choice voting will be used. Tiffany Montemayor, a spokesperson with the state Division of Elections, said if a candidate who advances from the primary withdraws 64 or more days before the general election, the fifth-place candidate would advance instead. She said that determination would come after the Sept. 5 withdrawal deadline. Peltola, Palin and Begich also were the three candidates competing in last week’s ranked-choice special election that will determine who serves the remainder of the late U.S. Rep. Don Young’s term, which ends early next year. The results of that election aren’t expected until Aug. 31.\n\nArizona\n\nMarana: A massive, beloved cactus has fallen. “Strong-Arm,” a saguaro that stood in the Tortolita Preserve in Marana near Tucson, fell Aug.4 after living for roughly 150 to 200 years, the town said on its website. The 40-foot-tall saguaro, marked with its own metal sign proclaiming its name, had 34 arms in all and was home to many birds, including a great horned owl and some woodpeckers. In the memorial post on Marana’s government website, Jason Grodman, natural resources supervisor with the Marana Parks and Recreation Department, called it a “saguaro motel” to its many animal residents. “It saw all of the development grow up around us, and it’s really a sentinel for the preserve,” Grodman said in a tribute video for the plant. Marana’s recreation superintendent Bob Stinson said his predecessor had given the saguaro its name since it was one of the largest cacti in the area, and the trail went right by it. “It was just a beautiful specimen,” Stinson said. He said, gauging from the many people he had spoken to about it, Strong-Arm would be missed in the community. Grodman said in the video that the trunk of the saguaro, which remains upright, will likely stand for the next few years, while the arms will likely decompose of the course of about five years.\n\nArkansas\n\nMulberry: The attorney for a man seen on video being punched and kneed by officers said Tuesday that the violent arrest is part of an alleged pattern of excessive force by a sheriff’s deputy, and policing experts said some of the blows appeared to be unjustified or even criminal. A bystander’s video of 27-year-old Randal Worcester’s arrest Sunday in the small town of Mulberry sparked outrage after it was posted online. All three officers were later suspended, and state and federal authorities have opened criminal investigations into their actions. It’s the latest case in which increasingly omnipresent cameras have led to consequences for officers and raised questions about what level of force police are justified in using and when. A deputy was caught in the video repeatedly punching and kneeing Worcester in the head before grabbing his hair and slamming him against the pavement. As that was happening, another officer was holding Worcester down as a third also kneed him over and over. Carrie Jernigan, an attorney for Worcester, said the deputy who punched him, Levi White, used excessive force against other people she’s representing. “There’s something going on, and we just need to get it addressed,” she said during a Tuesday news conference with the two other clients.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Victims who receive unsolicited sexually graphic material by text, email, app or other electronic means could sue the sender under a bill that lawmakers sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday. The bill targets what’s known as “cyber flashing,” when victims receive such unwelcome surprises, often from strangers. “Just as individuals suffer sexual harassment and abuse in their physical, non-digital lives, there’s a growing incidence of individuals being harassed by receiving unsolicited, sexually explicit images and videos including from people they do not know,” Democratic Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry said when the Assembly approved the bill. The Assembly passed the measure 76-0 last Thursday, and the Senate sent the bill to Newsom on a 37-0 roll call Monday. There was no recorded opposition. The most common recipients are young women, Aguiar-Curry said. The Pew Research Center in a report last year on online harassment found that 33% of women under 35 had been sexually harassed online – three times as often as men. In a 2017 report, the center said more than half of women ages 18-29 had been sent unsolicited explicit images, as had 37% of men in the same age range. The bill would allow recipients to recover at least $1,500 and as much as $30,000 from senders of obscene material.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A Colorado businessman charged in a “We Build the Wall” fraud case that once included former presidential adviser Steve Bannon among defendants wants his October retrial moved from New York to Colorado to save money and spare him from what his lawyer says is bias from political polarization he’ll otherwise face. Attorney John Meringolo wrote in papers submitted to a Manhattan federal court judge late Monday that Timothy Shea cannot get a fair and impartial retrial in New York. He also asked that the retrial be moved from Oct. 24 to early December, saying prosecutors have recently produced a previously seized laptop computer taken from Shea’s Castle Rock, Colorado, residence that contains an email exchange not introduced at the first trial, which ended in June with a deadlocked jury. In requesting a change of venue, Meringolo cited what he called the “obviously politically charged atmosphere of the jury room” at the first trial and said the effect of “political polarization” became obvious when the trial ended in a mistrial after 11 jurors tried to force one juror off the panel, saying he possessed political bias. A similar venue-change request was denied before Shea’s first trial. Meringolo said the first trial was an immense financial burden for his client, and a move would enable him to have witnesses who live closer to Colorado testify on his behalf.\n\nConnecticut\n\nManchester: A department store security guard who was shot outside a mall was wounded when he struggled with an alleged shoplifter who pulled a handgun on him, according to an arrest warrant affidavit released Monday. The affidavit was released as Richard LaPlante was arraigned in court on attempted murder and other charges in connection with Friday’s shooting outside The Shoppes at Buckland Hills in Manchester. A judge kept the 30-year-old Windsor resident’s bail at $1 million. Tirso Polanco, a 27-year-old loss prevention officer at the Macy’s store at the mall, was shot in the abdomen and remains hospitalized, police said. According to the affidavit, LaPlante fled the mall after the shooting and took a transit bus home. Police said they were able to track and identify him through mall and bus security cameras. LaPlante turned himself in to police Saturday. His next court date was set for Sept. 7. His lawyer, Ronald Johnson, said after Monday’s court hearing that LaPlante “feels bad” about the shooting.“We’re praying for the victim and hope that the victim is OK, and we’re praying for his family,” Johnson said. “And the most important thing is let the judicial process go through its process.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A group of prisoners has sued the state’s prison system and its private health care contractor, claiming they’ve been left to suffer chronic and sometimes debilitating pain after officials banned certain pain medicines. Aside from complaints involving the pandemic, the lawsuit is the first large-scale litigation filed against Centurion of Delaware, the private health care provider for the state’s prison system. Centurion won a $47 million contract to provide health care for those imprisoned by the state starting in 2020, taking over after years of complaints and scandals involving the prisons’ prior health care provider. The lawsuit names 24 plaintiffs. All but one are currently in a Delaware prison. They each claim that they suffer from chronic pain or nerve damage caused by a range of issues from gunshot wounds to things like degenerative joint and spinal conditions, pain that was treated by medications that were effectively banned by the prison in 2019, the lawsuit says. The suit claims that after that, inadequate alternatives were provided. In some cases, they were given psychiatric drugs or alternative methods such as “distraction” and yoga, which leave the prisoners suffering behind bars.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A homeless encampment in Northwest D.C. was cleared Wednesday morning, leaving many people looking for a new location to live, WUSA-TV reports. The National Park Service closed Reservation 70 about 7 a.m. The closure was due to imminent threats to public health and safety from unsheltered encampments in the parks, National Mall and Memorial Parks Chief of Communications Mike Litterst said. The closure will allow for turf rehabilitation, cleaning and maintenance of the park area, and removal of rodent infestation. Fencing will enclose the park and will remain closed while the park is under restoration. There was no information on how long the people who were living there were notified ahead of the closure to make arrangements to relocate. The site is one of many encampments that have been closed to homeless residents in the district this year. Once an encampment is closed, the unhoused people who were living there typically migrate to a different one, which can cause overcrowding.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz as a toddler was intellectually and physically behind other children, which caused him to isolate himself and hit and bite to get what he wanted, a day care administrator and former neighbor testified Tuesday at his penalty trial for mass murder. He remained socially and behaviorally stunted through elementary school, a special education counselor also testified. Cruz’s attorneys began the second day of their defense by building on testimony that his birth mother’s cocaine and alcohol abuse during pregnancy left him severely brain-damaged, putting him on a road that led to him murdering 14 students and three staff members at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14, 2018. They are trying to persuade his jury to sentence him to life without parole instead of death. Cruz, 23, pleaded guilty in October to the murders, and the trial is only to determine his sentence. Prosecutors say no drugs were found in Cruz’s system at birth. The defense says that’s because his birth mother was put in a residential drug rehab program when she was six months pregnant, but the damage had been done. The defense is trying to overcome the prosecution’s case, which featured surveillance video of Cruz mowing down students and staff as he stalked a three-story building for seven-minutes, photos of the aftermath and a jury visit to the building.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMorrow: Two white Atlanta police officers who clashed with Rayshard Brooks acted reasonably during the 2020 encounter that ended with the 27-year-old Black man’s fatal shooting, a specially appointed prosecutor said Tuesday in announcing his decision not to pursue charges against them. Officer Garrett Rolfe, who shot and killed Brooks in June 2020, and Officer Devin Brosnan faced a “quickly evolving” situation when Brooks lunged and grabbed one of their Tasers during an arrest attempt, said Pete Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia. “We did not look at this with 20/20 hindsight. Given the quickly changing circumstances, was it objectively reasonable that he used deadly force? And we conclude it was,” Skandalakis said. The shooting happened against the backdrop of heightened tensions and protests nationwide after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer less than three weeks prior. Sometimes-violent protests had largely subsided in Atlanta, but Brooks’ killing set off a new round of demonstrations against police brutality and racial injustice. Skandalakis said he believes context is important and acknowledged encounters between police and the African American community are sometimes “very volatile,” but he said he doesn’t believe race played a role in this instance.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A food distribution company has agreed to pay $90,000 to settle a lawsuit alleging a Black employee was subjected to racial slurs and racist references to slavery, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Wednesday. According to the lawsuit, a supervisor at Suisan Co.’s Hilo warehouse shouted racial slurs at the worker, who was fired after complaining to management. A manager who investigated also used a racial epithet during a meeting with the employee, the lawsuit said. During a second meeting, the manager and another supervisor made jokes about slavery, the lawsuit said. The commission alleged in the lawsuit filed last year in U.S. District Court in Honolulu that the man was later fired in retaliation for reporting the harassment. In addition to the money, Suisan agreed to measures to address and prevent discrimination, the commission said, including outlining an internal complaint process and providing anti-discrimination training. “Even though Hawaii is a racially and culturally diverse state, we continue to see race discrimination and harassment complaints filed with our agency in this region,” said Anna Park, regional attorney for the commission.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Tuesday called a special session of the Legislature beginning Sept. 1 to use the state’s projected $2 billion budget surplus for a record $500 million income tax rebate this year to help residents deal with increased food and gas prices due to inflation. The Republican governor also proposed an ongoing tax cut of more than $150 million annually by creating a corporate and individual flat tax rate of 5.8% starting next year. The first $2,500 of income for individuals and $5,000 for those filing jointly would be exempt from taxes. Finally, Little wants to bolster K-12 public schools and ongoing education with $410 million annually from sales taxes starting next year. Language in Little’s proclamation calling the special session cites high inflation, currently about 8.5%. “Idaho taxpayers and the education system are especially imperiled by the consequences of historic inflation,” Little’s proclamation said. The proposed bill already has enough co-sponsors in the 70-member House and 35-member Senate to make it to the governor’s desk for his signature. The Legislature would decide when it meets in regular session in January how to spend the education money. Of the $410 million, $330 million is proposed for K-12 and $80 million for ongoing education.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A former prison guard could face life in prison after a jury convicted him Tuesday of violating the civil rights of a 65-year-old inmate who died after correctional officers beat him in a lockup more than four years ago. The jury of six men and six women deliberated about three hours before returning guilty verdicts on five counts against ex-correctional Lt. Todd Sheffler, 54, of Mendon. Sheffler is the second ex-guard convicted in the death of Larry Earvin in May 2018. A separate jury convicted Alex Banta, 31, of similar charges in April. That jury could not reach a verdict on Sheffler, so the government tried him again. “The defense made a statement about the long, cruel arm of government,” assistant U.S. Attorney Eugene Miller said in his closing statement. “Todd Sheffler violated his training, violated the U.S. Constitution and allowed, participated in and covered up the brutal beating of a 65-year-old man, defenseless, a fellow citizen, handcuffed behind his back and lying on the cold, hard concrete floor. He was the long, cruel arm of government.” Like Banta, Sheffler was convicted of depriving Earvin of his civil rights, conspiracy to deprive civil rights, tampering with a witness, destruction or falsification of records and intimidation or force against a witness. The civil rights charges alone carry sentences of as much as life in prison.\n\nIndiana\n\nLakeville: Democrat Paul Steury has been confirmed as the party’s candidate for the special election to complete the congressional term of Republican U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski following her death in a highway crash. Democratic precinct committee members from Indiana’s 2nd Congressional District confirmed Steury’s selection during a caucus vote Tuesday evening in Lakeville. “With Paul Steury, Democrats have an educator and proven community leader who is ready to fight climate change, create more good-paying jobs, and build a better tomorrow for Hoosiers across Indiana’s Second Congressional District,” Indiana Democratic Party Chair Mike Schmuhl said Tuesday night in a statement. Steury is a high school science teacher from Goshen and will face Republican Rudy Yakym and Libertarian William Henry. Yakym won a Republican caucus Saturday to replace Walorski on the November ballot after gaining the endorsement of Walorski’s husband. Yakym, an executive with Elkhart distribution company Kem Krest, will be a heavy favorite to win in the solidly Republican district. All three candidates are running both in the special election to complete Walorski’s term that ends in early January and the regular election for a full two-year term. Both elections will be on the November ballot.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The city is undertaking an ambitious project to survey the condition of every house in Des Moines. The Property Condition Survey intends to survey more than 50 neighborhoods and 96,000 houses across the city, officials said. The initiative employs coordinators to evaluate properties with a focus on safety, according to SuAnn Donovan, the city’s deputy director of Neighborhood Services. As a part of the survey, coordinators will survey the condition of each property’s roof, siding, windows, fence and gates, porch and balconies, and foundation. Properties are then ranked on a scale of one to five, with one indicating the property is in good condition and five indicating it is in need of repair, according to Donovan. The overall score will help the city and Invest DSM, a neighborhood revitalization project, decide where to invest in next, she said. The survey is being used in the development of a voluntary neighborhood assistance program coined “Improving Our Neighborhoods,” Donovan said. Between 2011 and 2021, developers, homeowners and businesses have invested $2.1 billion in the city’s downtown, supplemented by government tax breaks and incentives. She emphasized that the initiative is voluntary and that the city will not be issuing any violations in regard to the findings of the survey.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: An anti-abortion activist is now suing for a complete hand recount of an election in which voters soundly rejected a proposal to remove abortion rights from the state’s constitution. Mark Gietzen is representing himself in a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Sedgwick County District Court after a nine-county hand recount that his supporters largely funded wrapped up over the weekend. Fewer than 100 votes changed out of more than 500,000 cast in those counties. The measure failed by about 165,000 votes statewide. Republican Secretary of State Scott Schwab said in a news release that the recount results should “put to rest the unfounded claims of election fraud.” In the lawsuit, Gietzen alleges without evidence that votes statewide might have been vulnerable to the same type of programming error that initially switched results in a county commission race. The suit also seeks a revote “where necessary.” A judge quickly dismissed a lawsuit Gietzen filed before the election seeking to have ballot drop boxes removed across the state.\n\nKentucky\n\nJackson: In the wake of the worst flooding in eastern Kentucky memory, 59 Breathitt County residents have signed onto a lawsuit against Blackhawk Mining and a contracted company, Pine Branch Mining, alleging nearby strip mining operations amplified the flood damage. Ned Pillersdorf, a local attorney representing the plaintiffs, said a majority of those 59 residents are now homeless, and those who aren’t won’t have access to clean water for months. The mining operations were a “ticking time bomb ready to explode with any type of heavy rainfall,” the filing in Breathitt County Circuit Court alleges. Following the late July flooding, residents said they found fish on their property that would normally reside in the silt ponds of coal mining operations, which the plaintiffs say indicates failure on the part of the coal companies to properly maintain its silt ponds and overall operation. Kentucky Administrative Regulation 20:060 requires coal companies to keep any debris or water from its operation from escaping its property into non-permitted areas, such as the residences below. The filing also accuses the coal companies of failing to continuously reclaim strip mined land, as required under Kentucky Revised Statute 350.100, damaging residents’ water supply, and causing property damage.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: About two dozen juvenile inmates at a troubled detention center won’t be moved to the notorious state penitentiary at Angola until at least the middle of next month, as a legal battle over their transfer plays out, officials said Tuesday. The juveniles are currently being held at the Bridge City Center for Youth in Jefferson Parish. Officials have long acknowledged issues at the center, which wasn’t designed to house certain high-risk inmates. There have been at least four escapes this year, as well as a riot in which 20 juveniles took over parts of the complex. But the plan to move them to Angola has been sharply criticized by criminal justice advocates, former officials and parents of children currently held at the center, The Times-Picayune/The News Orleans Advocate reports. A federal lawsuit to block the state from moving forward with the transfer was filed Friday on behalf of a teenager currently held in Bridge City who is set to be transferred to Angola, the newspaper reports. The defendants in the case – which include Gov. John Bel Edwards and the Office of Juvenile Justice – and their attorneys said Tuesday that they would not transfer any of the inmates until at least Sept. 15. A preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled for Sept. 6.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state’s public defender system wants to more than double its budget to better represent people who can’t afford an attorney. The Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services voted to recommend a $62.1 million budget next year. The proposal would open four public defender offices in the state and raise the hourly fee from $80 to $150 for court-appointed lawyers. Maine is the only state in the nation without a public defender’s office for people who cannot afford to hire a lawyer. The state relies on private attorneys who are reimbursed by the state, but the number of lawyers willing to take court-appointed cases has declined in recent years. The American Civil Liberties Union of Maine is suing the state, contending there’s a failure to train, supervise and adequately fund a system to ensure the constitutional right to effective counsel. The budget request, which will be considered by lawmakers, comes against a backdrop of states grappling with public defender systems across the country.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A Texas man was sentenced to six months in federal prison Tuesday for threatening a Maryland doctor who has been a prominent advocate for COVID-19 vaccines, a federal prosecutor said. Scott Eli Harris, 52, of Aubrey, Texas, pleaded guilty in February to threats transmitted by interstate communication. U.S. Attorney for Maryland Erek L. Barron announced the sentence, which will be followed by three years of supervised release, in a news release Wednesday. “While we are all entitled to our own opinion, no one has the right to threaten the life of someone because of race, national origin, or because of holding different views,” Barron said in a statement. “Threats like these will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” According to Harris’ plea agreement and statements made in connection with the plea hearing, Harris sent a threatening message from his cellphone to the doctor. Court documents identify the doctor only as “Dr. L.W., who had been a vocal proponent of the COVID-19 vaccine.” Harris’ message included violent statements such as: “Never going to take your wonder drug. My 12 gauge promises I won’t. .… I can’t wait for the shooting to start.” Harris’ message also made reference to the doctor’s Asian American background and national origin.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nKingston: A project underway in the woods of coastal Massachusetts seeks to restore a 32-acre former Catholic summer camp on the banks of the Muddy Pond in Kingston to something closer to what it might have looked like before European colonization transformed it. Through the Wampanoag Common Lands, the Native Land Conservancy – the local Native group that received the donated forestland this year – envisions a natural environment filled with indigenous plants and animals where Wampanoags can practice cultural ceremonies and educate new generations in traditional ways. Ramona Peters, a Mashpee Wampanoag who founded the conservancy, said the effort is all the more meaningful because the land is some 5 miles from where Pilgrims arriving on the Mayflower established the English colony of Plymouth, near the remnants of a Wampanoag community wiped out by European disease. “This is basically where the first impact of colonization of this country happened,” she said. “It’s very significant that it’s been returned to us.” The Wampanoag Common Lands is part of a growing movement of Indigenous-led conservation efforts helping to preserve and reinvigorate Native culture and identity, said Beth Rose-Middleton, a professor at the University of California, Davis, focused on Native American environmental policy and conservation.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: University of Michigan researchers are studying how well people with autism spectrum disorder can detect road hazards, and they plan to assist the young motorists in sharpening their driving skills. The upcoming effort will be the second phase of a project funded by Ford Motor Co. that teams the Ann Arbor university with a local driving school. During phase one of the study, researchers found that students with autism spectrum disorder detected fewer hazards than control participants during simulated drives. But lead researcher Elise Hodges said some extra work behind the wheel did the trick. “Those folks that underwent training improved in two-thirds of hazards in the simulated drive,” said Hodges, a clinical associate professor in the University of Michigan’s neuropsychology program. Ann Arbor Academy, a school for students with learning and social differences, hosted driving lessons. Hodges designed the simulated drives and oversaw the study. Ford footed the bill. The goal, in part, was to provide an opportunity for those with autism spectrum disorder to improve their driving skills. “Many of them … would like to drive, but getting from wanting to drive and being able to drive are two different things,” she said. The individualized driving sessions planned for phase two are expected to start in a month or two, Hodges said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nEden Prairie: A suburban Minneapolis mall resumed normal business hours Tuesday after a fatal shooting that had earlier locked down the shopping complex. Police responded to the Eden Prairie Center mall Monday night and found a man dead of what they said was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The shooting happened in the Scheels sporting goods store, which also sells firearms. Police Chief Matt Sackett said it’s not clear whether the man brought a weapon to Scheels or accessed one of the store’s guns. “It’s obviously an active and fluid investigation, but again, we do believe it to be an isolated incident. There is not a threat to anybody else in the public,” Sackett said at a briefing. Will Dammann was shopping in Scheels when he heard an alarm sound and a commotion near a door. Seconds later a store announcement told people to evacuate immediately. “So then it was, you know, the hustle bustle of getting out. Then everyone was just standing out in front, and that’s when the police just started rolling in,” Dammann said. He said people seemed calm, including store employees. He did not hear a gunshot, Minnesota Public Radio News reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nLorman: The Honors Curriculum Program at Alcorn State University is being renamed in honor of Myrlie Evers-Williams. The program will be renamed the Myrlie Evers-Williams Honors Program in recognition of the civil rights leader, author and journalist who spent over three decades seeking justice for the 1963 murder of her former husband, Medgar Evers, the university said in a news release. Evers-Williams attended Alcorn A&M College for a year, and there she met and fell in love with Medgar Evers. The two later married in 1951. Alcorn said the honors program attracts academically successful and socially conscious students and assists the university in cultivating global citizen scholars. Evers-Williams expressed her appreciation to the school for recognizing her. “This designation is a special recognition that I hold close to my heart, acknowledging my time on Alcorn’s campus, my life’s work, and my dedication to furthering the fight for equality and human rights,” she said. Alcorn President Dr. Felecia M. Nave praised Evers-Williams’ achievements and said she was proud to recognize the civil rights leader on campus. “She’s an ideal example of the strength, courage, and character that Alcornites exude. We’re thrilled to recognize her for extraordinary contributions and ongoing activism,” Nave said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: John Wood, a Republican running as an independent for U.S. Senate, announced Tuesday that he was withdrawing from the race. Wood said on Twitter that he decided not to challenge Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Democratic nominee Trudy Busch Valentine in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt. Wood said he has significant differences with Schmitt and Valentine, but “it has become evident there is not a realistic path to victory for me as an independent candidate.” Wood, a lifelong Republican, former U.S. attorney and most recently a top investigator for the U.S. House committee examining the Jan. 6 riot, said he entered the race when disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens was the front-runner for the Republican nomination. He said it would have been “unacceptable” for Greitens to be Missouri’s new senator. Schmitt soundly defeated Greitens in the Aug. 2 GOP primary. Greitens resigned as governor four years ago after a sex scandal, two criminal charges that were eventually dropped and a legislative investigation that could have led to impeachment hearings. This year, his ex-wife accused him of abuse. Wood’s candidacy was backed by a political action committee led by retired Republican Sen. John Danforth, which spent millions on his campaign.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Visitors to the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center in Great Falls will have the unique opportunity Monday to get close to some of Montana’s most powerful predators: hawks, falcons and owls. Educational staff from Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks will be in the city with two or three live “ambassador birds” in conjunction with FWP’s Montana WILD program. Three 40-minute programs will give attendees an up-close encounter with the birds, along with insights into what makes raptors unique from other types of birds, why they are so important to our ecosystems, and simple things property owners and recreationalists can do to protect and conserve raptors. “The mission of the ambassador bird program to educate and hopefully get people interested in the outdoors and what we’re doing in terms of conservation,” said Ali Pons, of FWP’s Wildlife Rehabilitation Center. The Montana WILD program is an outgrowth of the work being done at the center in Helena, which takes in injured and orphaned raptors for rehabilitation and release. Montana WILD cares for 15 ambassador birds too injured to be released on their own. “They wouldn’t make it,” Pons said of raptors who’ve become stars of the educational program. “They also have a personality and a demeanor that makes them good education birds.”\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A judge has dismissed the discrimination lawsuit of a former Lincoln Police Department spokeswoman, saying her allegations did not sufficiently prove a hostile work environment. Erin Spilker said in her lawsuit that she faced years of discrimination and that the department not only mishandled allegations of sexual assaults by male officers but also disciplined the women who complained. “She is under a microscope, and has been subjected to assaults, harassment, intimidation, threats and retaliation, which affect her ability to do her job,” Spilker’s attorney, Kelly Brandon, said in the complaint. In his order issued Monday, District Judge Kevin McManaman acknowledged Spilker’s string of allegations, from male colleagues making sexualized remarks about female colleagues to suffering various acts of retaliation after she complained, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. But McManaman said, citing case law, that the allegations amounted to “an amalgamation of discrete incidents … and not one unlawful employment practice.” The allegations “are not so similar in nature, frequency and severity as to be considered part and parcel of a hostile work environment,” McManaman wrote. Spilker, who was a 20-year veteran of the department before she resigned earlier this year, is among several female Lincoln police officers who have sued, alleging sex-based discrimination in the department.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A new herd of wild horses is descending on the Black Rock Desert for 2022’s Burning Man festival. The Wild Horses of the American West project is rounding up more than a dozen life-size sculptures from local and international artists to bring awareness to environmental concerns surrounding the West’s wild horses. “Everyone loves horses. Wild horses are beautiful,” said organizer Adrian Landon. “But the bottom line is they need to be managed.” A longtime metalwork artist, Landon’s career has largely focused on equine sculptures. In 2019, he created “Wings of Glory,” a giant, flying Pegasus with moving parts now on display in England. This year, Landon had a vision of creating a herd of horses to bring awareness to the plight of Western ecosystems and the need to bring wildlife, plant life and water resources into balance. He put out a call to other artists interested in creating equine art and received dozens of replies. He selected 10 artists and used a grant from Burning Man to help fund their pieces. Now, the herd includes a sculpture from British artist Simon Bellamy, who fashioned a galloping steel piece based on the work of pioneering motion photographer Eadweard Muybridge, and Turburam Sandagdorj, a paper-cutting artist who learned the ancient art from his dad.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Continuing with its efforts to close gaps and recover from missed learning, the state Department of Education has selected Tutor.com to provide 24/7 online tutoring for every middle and high school student in the state. Through the partnership, more than 100,000 middle and high school students will gain unlimited access to Tutor.com – anytime, anywhere, from any internet-connected device. The service will be available to students at all New Hampshire schools (public, non-public and charter), as well as students in Home Education and Education Freedom Account programs. “This tutoring will not only facilitate and enhance learning but serve as a tremendous resource for students hoping to enhance their educational experience, or those students in need of individualized instruction. This partnership will also support teachers in their ongoing efforts to assist students who may be struggling and seeking additional guidance,” said Frank Edelblut, the state education commissioner. School districts are being encouraged to register for Tutor.com’s free access for their students; students outside those districts will be able to register individually.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEdison: Mayor Sam Joshi said symbols of hate and discrimination are not welcome in the township, after a piece of construction equipment, viewed as a symbol of hate by the Muslim community, was featured in the Aug. 14 India Day Parade. The parade, from Edison to Woodbridge, marked the 75th anniversary of India’s independence and the division of the South Asian subcontinent into two nations, Hindu-oriented India and Muslim-oriented Pakistan, after years of civil strife. In a statement Monday, Joshi said Edison is committed to celebrating and working in harmony with people from all cultures. But an American-Islamic relations group said it’s disappointed the mayor has not gone further in rebuking the parade organizers, whom the group called to apologize. The parade, organized by the Indian Business Association, featured a piece of construction equipment with the photos of political leaders in India, who are described as proponents of hate against Muslims and other minorities, according to Azra Baig, chair of the South Brunswick’s Human Relations Commission. In India, Baig noted, homes, businesses and houses of worship are being bulldozed because of people’s faith and when they stand up for their rights. “Something this hateful should never be included in a parade in Edison,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state will no longer deny licenses to practice law solely because of an applicant’s citizenship or immigration status, including some aspiring law students who arrived in the U.S. as children and don’t have a clear path to citizenship. Announced Monday, the rule change from the New Mexico Supreme Court is scheduled to take effect Oct. 1. Several states already have provisions that disregard residency or immigration status in licensure decisions. “The change in the licensure rule is grounded in the fundamental principle of fairness, and is consistent with New Mexico’s historical values of inclusion and diversity,” Supreme Court Chief Justice Shannon Bacon said in a statement Tuesday. She said the shift aligns New Mexico with recommendations by the American Bar Association and provisions in at least eight other states that provide attorney licensing to some immigrants. All applicants are still required to graduate from law school, pass the bar exam and undergo further character vetting by a board of bar examiners. The rulemaking drew immediate criticism from state Republican Party Chairman Steve Pearce, at a time when GOP candidates are challenging two incumbent state Supreme Court justices in the November general election.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is headed to Harvard this fall as a teaching fellow at the university’s schools of government and public health. De Blasio, a Democrat who served as mayor from 2014 to 2021, will take part in “a variety of discussions, events, and programming” at the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School and will teach classes on leadership and public service at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the schools said in separate announcements Wednesday. Dean Michelle A. Williams cited the former mayor’s time grappling with public health crises including COVID-19, homelessness and the opioid epidemic. Setti Warren, interim director of the Institute of Politics, said de Blasio’s “decades of experience in local government, federal agencies, national campaigns, and running the largest city in the country will provide invaluable insight to our students and the Harvard community.”De Blasio, who grew up in Massachusetts and is a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan, was prevented by term limits from seeking a third four-year term as mayor. After an unsuccessful campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, de Blasio flirted this year with running for governor of New York and later mounted a brief run for a congressional district that includes his Brooklyn home.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A federal appeals court on Tuesday blocked a local district attorney from prosecuting state Attorney General Josh Stein or anyone else for his 2020 campaign ad through a criminal libel law. The majority of a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, granted the request by Stein’s campaign committee and others associated with his campaign to prevent enforcement of the law while they sue to attempt to have the law overturned as unconstitutional. The 2-1 decision came the day after a Wake County grand jury formally asked the Wake district attorney’s office to submit an indictment against Stein and two of his advisers or any one of the three for jurors to consider. Wake County DA Lorrin Freeman said Monday that could have happened as soon as next month. Any formal charges could harm the political future of Stein, a Democrat and possible 2024 gubernatorial candidate. The law, which dates back to at least 1931, makes it a misdemeanor to circulate “derogatory reports” about a candidate with the intent of hurting that candidate’s chances in the election. Stein’s Republican opponent in 2020, Forsyth County District Attorney Jim O’Neill, cited the law while demanding that the board investigate a political ad that accused the Republican of letting more than a thousand rape kits go untested. O’Neill said the ad was false because police agencies, not prosecutors, are responsible for testing the kits.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A school board reversed course on its decision to stop reciting the Pledge of Allegiance at its monthly meetings, following complaints from conservative lawmakers and an angry backlash from citizens around the country. Seven of the nine members of the Fargo Board of Education, including four newcomers who took office in June, voted earlier this month to cancel a previous board edict that was approved a couple of months before the election. The new board agreed with member Seth Holden, who said the pledge did not align with the district’s diversity and inclusion code in part because the phrase “under God” does not include all faiths. Republican Gov. Doug Burgum last week promoted new legislation that would require public schools and governing bodies to administer the pledge without mandating that people recite it. Republican state Rep. Pat Heinert, a retired county sheriff, is suggesting that sanctions be put in place for public boards and commissions that don’t require the patriotic oath. Angry emails and voicemails dominated Thursday’s special meeting to reconsider the vote. Nyamal Dei, a refugee who fled war-torn Sudan, played a profanity-laced voicemail from a man who called her a slave, racist and Nazi. Several board members apologized to Dei, the lone Black member on the board, for taking the worst of the abuse. Dei said reversing the decision would be giving in to hate. She paused for several seconds before casting the lone “no” vote to reinstate the pledge.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A strike by teachers in the state’s largest school district entered its third day Wednesday – the first day of school for some 47,000 students, with some of those students and their parents rallying to their sides. Parents, students, teachers and other employees gathered at schools across the Columbus School District with plans to picket for hours, advocating for safer buildings, better heating and air conditioning, smaller class sizes, and a more well-rounded curriculum that includes art, music and physical education. It’s the union’s first strike in the district since 1975. Picketers blasted music on the sidewalks outside Whetstone High School in Columbus and waved to honking drivers. Some held up signs reading:“Columbus schools deserve working air,” “a history lesson in progress,” and “my feet hurt but I’ll walk as long as it takes.” The school district and the union resumed bargaining Wednesday afternoon. The school board said its offer to the union put children first. The Ohio Education Association said more than 94% of the Columbus Education Association members voted to reject the school board’s final offer late Sunday. The union represents more than 4,000 teachers, librarians, nurses and other employees, though it isn’t clear how many of those 4,000 members were not on the job Wednesday.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday rejected clemency for a man facing execution Thursday for the 1997 hammer killing of a Choctaw man, despite a recommendation from the state’s Pardon and Parole Board that his life be spared. James Coddington was convicted and sentenced to die for the beating death of a friend and co-worker, 73-year-old Albert Hale, inside Hale’s Choctaw home. Prosecutors say Coddington, who was 24 at the time, became enraged when Hale refused to give him money to buy cocaine. Coddington’s execution is scheduled for Thursday morning. “After thoroughly reviewing arguments and evidence presented by all sides of the case, Governor Kevin Stitt has denied the Pardon and Parole Board’s clemency recommendation for James Allen Coddington,” Stitt’s office said in a statement. During a clemency hearing this month before the state’s five-member Pardon and Parole Board, an emotional Coddington, now 50, apologized to Hale’s family and said he is a different man today. “I’m clean; I know God; I’m not … I’m not a vicious murderer,” Coddington told the board. “If this ends today with my death sentence, OK.” Coddington’s attorney, Emma Rolls, said Coddington doesn’t have any pending appeals that would delay or stop his execution Thursday.\n\nOregon\n\nKlamath Falls: The Klamath Irrigation District in southern Oregon plans to defy a U.S. government order issued last week for a halt to water deliveries to farmers in the drought-stricken basin. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation manages the Klamath Project, which includes Klamath Irrigation District and serves 266 square miles of farmland around the Oregon-California border. A limited allocation of water was allowed for irrigators from Upper Klamath Lake this year because of extreme drought. The bureau has said the project is now out of water and ordered a shutdown last week, but irrigation district directors met Monday and authorized the district’s manager, Gene Souza, to continue operations, the Capital Press reports. The district operates a canal that provides water to nine irrigation districts encompassing about 191 square miles. Souza said in a letter to Alan Heck, acting area manager for the U.S. agency, that it has not provided a legal basis for shutting down the project and that doing so would deny farmers of the water they have legal rights to receive. “I am not doing my duty if I just comply because I do not have a legal justification to deny the people I serve their property,” Souza told the Capital Press.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State elections officials said Wednesday that a push last week to recruit new poll workers produced more than 1,100 applicants, including at least one in 58 of 67 counties. The effort tied to Help America Vote Day, organized by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, brought in the most applicants in some of the populous suburbs of Philadelphia – 221 in Montgomery County, 132 in Chester and 91 in Delaware. Allegheny County, which encompasses Pittsburgh, drew 100 applicants, while Philadelphia brought in 47. In central Pennsylvania, Lancaster received 71 applications, Dauphin 40 and Cumberland 39. Poll workers, often older people, are paid to help run elections in some 9,000 polling places across the state, but it has been a challenge to recruit and train sufficient numbers of them during the COVID-19 pandemic. Poll worker shortages predate the pandemic, however, in part because their work can require 14- or 16-hour days. Lisa Schaefer, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, said the influx of 1,146 new candidates was a welcome boost. Some counties promoted the recruitment drive last week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A new report suggests ways the city can atone for its extensive ties to the trans-Atlantic slave trade and centuries of racism and discrimination by, among other things, establishing home repair funds, launching financial literacy programs, and boosting aid to Black and Indigenous organizations. The report, issued Monday by the Providence Municipal Reparations Commission, notably doesn’t recommend giving out direct payments to Black and Native American residents, as some had called for. Instead, it defines “reparations” as efforts that close the “present-day racial wealth and equity gaps,” and it outlines 11 areas for the city to focus its reparations work, including criminal justice reform, neighborhood development, health equity, and improving educational and cultural opportunities. Providence’s reparations effort was launched the same year Rhode Island voters approved a ballot referendum getting rid of the words “and Providence Plantations” from the state’s formal name because of its slavery connotations. The new report suggests creating a dedicated fund to support residents touched by urban renewal policies that displaced and negatively affected communities of color. It also calls for forgiving certain municipal court debts; ending police use of so-called no-knock warrants; decriminalizing consumption of alcohol in public; and creating a school curriculum based on the city’s research into its racist and discriminatory policies.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A showdown between defense attorneys for disbarred lawyer Alex Murdaugh who say prosecutors are unfairly withholding evidence and prosecutors who want the defense to agree to secrecy rules first is heading for a courtroom next week. In their latest court filing, defense lawyers said the secrecy rules as Murdaugh awaits a murder trial in the shooting deaths of his wife and younger son are hypocritical because prosecutors are leaking evidence to media outlets, including a video the leaker said was taken not long before the killings. Prosecutors, including South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson himself, denied the leaks last week. A hearing about the matter is scheduled for Monday at the Colleton County courthouse, where defense attorneys want the murder trial to take place in January. The cellphone video from Murdaugh’s son included Murdaugh talking to his wife outside the family’s Colleton County home where the killings happened, said defense lawyers, who said they hadn’t been given the video, but it was shown to Murdaugh’s family by state agents. The leaked media reports did not include that the conversation was friendly and about dogs, the defense said. Defense lawyer Dick Harpootlian said the state contends that Murdaugh killed his wife and son “for no apparent reason” within minutes of the light-hearted conversation.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota is joining other states in filing an amicus brief in defense of the Indian Child Welfare Act. The friend of the court brief involves the U.S. Supreme Court case Brackeen v. Haaland, which challenges the act that establishes federal standards for placement of Native American children in foster of adoptive homes. The act seeks to give the child’s family and tribe the opportunity to be involved in decisions from which they previously may have been excluded, including placement and services. Arguments in the case are scheduled before the high court this November. Stephanie Amiotte, legal director for the South Dakota ACLU, said if the court overturns the law, it could be devastating for tribes. “ICWA was enacted by Congress to address a situation where disproportionate numbers of Indian children were being removed from their homes, and eventually a disproportionate number of them were being adopted into white families,” Amiotte told South Dakota Public Broadcasting. The act’s opponents say the race-based policy is unconstitutional. Amiotte said keeping Indigenous children connected to their culture improves outcomes. “Native American Children have been essentially invisible within the American society,” Amiotte said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The superintendent of the state’s largest school district has resigned as he was being investigated by an outside attorney for allegations that he abused his power and violated policies. The Shelby County School Board accepted the resignation of Joris Ray during a specially called meeting Tuesday evening, officials said in a news release. Ray was appointed to lead Memphis-Shelby County Schools in 2019, and he had worked in the district for more than 24 years. The board had suspended Ray during an investigation stemming from allegations made in divorce proceedings between Ray and his wife, who is also a school district employee. A board resolution says it took action “to review the allegations to determine whether Superintendent Ray, during his tenure as Superintendent, engaged in relationships with District employees violative of MSCS policies.” The investigation was being led by former U.S. Attorney Edward L. Stanton III. In a statement posted on Twitter, Ray thanked colleagues for their “many, many small but powerful acts of devotion and commitment.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Texas officials have accused the state’s most populous county of defunding some of its law enforcement agencies in violation of a new law that prevents such funding cuts. In a letter sent Monday, Texas Comptroller Glen Hegar alleged leaders in Harris County, where Houston is located, reduced funding for the offices of its constables in the current fiscal year and would again reduce funding next year. Harris County officials pushed back against the claims they were defunding law enforcement, saying they have actually increased funding, proposing a budget for the next fiscal year that would allocate $1.4 billion for justice and safety – which is 75% of the county’s budget and the most ever allocated by the county for public safety. Hegar accused the county of ending a policy that would have let the constables’ offices automatically roll over unspent departmental funds from one fiscal year to the next, resulting in a loss of more than $3 million. He also accused the county of reducing funding for the constables by up to $12 million for the 2022-23 fiscal year. Constables and their deputies are licensed peace officers who have the same powers as regular police officers but also have the added responsibility of civil law enforcement.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Republican state leaders sued the Biden administration Wednesday over the president’s decision last year to restore two sprawling national monuments on rugged lands sacred to Native Americans that ex-President Donald Trump had downsized. The lawsuit over Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments alleges President Joe Biden’s action violates the authority granted in a century-old law that allows presidents to protect sites considered historically, geographically or culturally important. The legal argument has been repeated for years by Republicans, and the legal challenge had been expected since Biden made the move in October 2021. The lawsuit is the latest twist in a years­long debate spanning three presidential administrations about proper protections of lands that include ancient cliff dwellings and petroglyphs. Trump’s decision to cut them in size opened them for mining and other development, although market dynamics kept that in check. “President Biden made no attempt to explain how 3.23 million acres constituted the ‘smallest area compatible with the proper care and management’ of these supposed monuments,” the lawsuit claims, citing the 1906 Antiquities Act outlining rules for designating national monuments.\n\nVermont\n\nStrafford: A woman was attacked by a black bear over the weekend while walking her two dogs on trails on her Strafford property, the state Fish and Wildlife Department reported Tuesday. The 61-year-old woman was treated at Gifford Medical Center in Randolph on Saturday for non-life-threatening injuries, including a bite wound on her leg and multiple scratches, the department said. Fish and Wildlife game wardens and a bear biologist visited the site and concluded that the bear was a female with cubs who was likely provoked when the woman and her dogs surprised the group. They were unable to find the bear and say such attacks are extremely rare in the state. At the time of the attack, the woman had called her two dogs, who were out of sight, when she heard a large noise and realized a bear was charging her, officials said. She told game wardens that she tripped on a stone wall as the bear was charging her and then realized the animal was on top of her and had bitten her. The woman said her Jack Russell terrier barked at the bear, prompting the animal to get off her. She said she left with her dogs without seeing the bear again and called 911 when she got home. She also texted a neighbor to take her to the hospital.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A ratepayer protection that state regulators included in a recent order approving Dominion Energy Virginia’s application to build and recover the costs of a massive offshore wind farm would force the utility to scrap the project, Dominion said in a filing this week. The State Corporation Commission granted approval this month for the 176-turbine, multibillion-dollar project off Virginia Beach. Dominion immediately raised concerns about the commission’s inclusion of a performance guarantee for the wind farm and in a petition Monday asked the regulators to reconsider that element of their order. Dominion “shares the Commission’s concern, as expressed in the Final Order, that the Project be constructed and operated in a way that reasonably mitigates risk for its customers. The Commission’s unprecedented imposition of an involuntary performance guarantee condition on its approvals, however, is untenable,” the filing said. “As ordered, it will prevent the Project from moving forward, and the Company will be forced to terminate all development and construction activities.” The commission’s Aug. 5 order included three “consumer protections,” including the performance guarantee, which it said would protect customers who are paying for the wind farm “from also having to pay for replacement energy if the Project does not generate the amount of electricity upon which Dominion bases its request and its cost estimates.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An analysis of Washington State Ferries data shows ferries are running behind schedule this year more than they have in the past decade, with a consistent decline in on-time performance. Ferries spokesperson Ian Sterling told The Seattle Times that with 50% more passengers traveling by ferry in the summer, it is not unusual to see a dip in on-time performance from June to September. But the delays are more pronounced this year, and passengers on the Anacortes/San Juans route face particular problems, according to WSF data. While this route usually records more delays than others, in June, nearly half of all sailings on this route ran behind schedule. The newspaper reports that was a 40 percentage point gap from WSF’s target to run on time for 95% of trips. WSF attributes the lower on-time performance to a staffing shortage and a higher number of passengers on busy routes. On weekends, especially holiday weekends like Labor Day, passengers on popular tourist routes such as Anacortes/San Juans and Port Townsend/Coupeville are more likely to face delays on Thursday and Friday afternoons leaving the Seattle area and returning on Sunday and Monday afternoons. As of July this year, WSF had a 6% decline in staffing since 2019, when it was running at full capacity.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A cleanup project is planned for the Kanawha River next month. The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection’s Rehabilitation Environmental Action Plan is sponsoring the 32nd annual Great Kanawha River Cleanup from 8 a.m. to noon Sept. 10. Cleanup sites will be in Kanawha, Putnam and Fayette counties. Anyone who wants to volunteer should register with the department at (800) 322-5530 or christopher.j.cartwright@wv.gov. Bags and gloves will be provided for volunteers, and REAP will arrange for the trash to be hauled away. Volunteers will receive a T-shirt. Last year, 59 volunteers helped remove 1.9 tons of litter and 301 tires from five sites along the Kanawha River.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A federal judge has rejected a motion by the Milwaukee Police Department that sought to dismiss a case brought by two city residents who claimed their constitutional rights were violated when they were arrested near a memorial site for a Black man fatally shot by an officer in 2016. The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin is representing the residents, including Jarrett English and a plaintiff who did not wish to be named. They were arrested Aug. 30, 2016, in Milwaukee’s Sherman Park neighborhood, where police killed Sylville Smith approximately two weeks earlier. The 23-year-old Smith, who was armed, was running from police who suspected him of dealing drugs. The officer who killed Smith, also Black, was acquitted in the fatal shooting. Smith’s death touched off days of rioting in which businesses were burned, including a gas station, an auto parts store and a beauty supply shop. Firefighters were held back from the gas station blaze because of gunfire. The two plaintiffs, in their 2019 lawsuit, said their rights to the freedoms to assemble and to express themselves were violated when police in riot gear cleared Smith’s memorial site and arrested each of them at separate locations in the neighborhood.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: The rush to build wind farms to combat climate change is colliding with preservation of one of the West’s most spectacular predators – the golden eagle – as the species teeters on the edge of decline. Ground zero in the conflict is Wyoming, a stronghold for golden eagles that soar on 7-foot wings and a favored location for wind farms. As wind turbines proliferate, scientists say deaths from collisions could drive down golden eagle numbers considered stable at best. Yet climate change looms as a potentially greater threat to the species: Rising temperatures are projected to reduce golden eagle breeding ranges by more than 40% later this century, according to a National Audubon Society analysis. That leaves golden eagles doubly vulnerable – to the shifting climate and to the wind energy promoted as a solution to that warming world. “We have some of the best golden eagle populations in Wyoming, but it doesn’t mean the population is not at risk,” said Bryan Bedrosian, conservation director at the Teton Raptor Center in Wilson, Wyoming. “As we increase wind development across the U.S., that risk is increasing.” Turbines blades hundreds of feet long are among myriad threats to golden eagles, which are routinely shot, poisoned by lead, hit by vehicles and electrocuted on power lines.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/new-mexico/2019/12/22/sex-trafficking-new-mexico-searchlight-navajo-girl-harrowing-story/2681341001/", "title": "Sex trafficking in New Mexico: One Navajo girl's harrowing story", "text": "Nick Pachelli\n\nSearchlight New Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico\n\nEva was found at dusk one Tuesday in late December 2016, standing in a parking lot in northeast Albuquerque. The 15-year-old Navajo girl had been missing more than two weeks when her grandmother got a call from the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s office — saying her silver Ford truck had been recovered.\n\n“I don’t care about the truck, what about my granddaughter?” Heidi demanded.\n\nShe drove three hours, from her house outside Gallup to Albuquerque, and arrived a few minutes after 1 a.m. to see Eva emerge from the juvenile holding area, quiet and hunched, her dark brown eyes fixed on the floor. She weighed 94 pounds. Her cheeks and neck looked skeletal. She kept her answers short, and when an officer asked her to sign a release document, she rolled her eyes. A familiar pattern was unfolding.\n\nBack in the car, Heidi locked the doors. The cold fabric of the seats smelled of cigarettes and pine. Give me my phone, Eva said.\n\n***\n\nFor going on two years, Eva recognized that horrific actions were being forced upon her, but she didn’t have a name for them. She didn’t know she was a part of something larger, something the state and the nation has yet to fully reckon with or measure.\n\nEva was among the thousands of human trafficking victims targeted and exploited in the U.S. every year, of whom only 10 percent or so are ever identified.\n\nIn New Mexico, only 160 cases have been opened since 2016 — Eva’s among them. And while Native Americans make up about 11 percent of the state’s population, they account for nearly a quarter of trafficking victims, according to data compiled from organizations that provide services to trafficking victims.\n\nA 16-month investigation by Searchlight New Mexico has found that when it comes to human trafficking, indigenous women and girls are the least recognized and least protected population in a state that has long struggled to address the issue. An almost total lack of protocols, mandated training, and coordination between law enforcement systems as well as medical institutions have ensnared victims in cycles of exploitation.\n\nIssues remain nationally:States improve on stopping juvenile sex trafficking, but there are still issues\n\nThat includes Eva, who, according to her own recounting in addition to notes from medical personnel, caseworkers, and therapists, was systematically lured, coerced and threatened by a man who amassed hundreds of pornographic images and videos of her, raped her more times than she can estimate and traded sex with her to others for money, drugs and favors. Her name, along with those of her family members, have been changed for reasons of safety and privacy.\n\nThroughout those two years, Eva showed many of the warning signs of someone who’s been trafficked: She was anxious, depressed, absent-minded, mute, and had little sense of time. She was frequently reported missing, labeled a runaway, appeared malnourished and was occasionally bruised.\n\nTime and again, she was cast aside by the very authorities sworn to protect her.\n\nShe was given few referrals for care from licensed professionals, who responded to her trauma by dispensing psychotropic medication to her on numerous occasions, while not asking questions or consulting other agencies.\n\nWhen she tried to take her own life, the hands-off responses persisted.\n\nDespite dozens of brushes with five law enforcement agencies (Zuni tribal police, Gallup police, McKinley County sheriffs, Bernalillo County sheriffs, and Albuquerque police) and seven healthcare institutions (in Gallup, Zuni, Black Rock, Las Cruces, Albuquerque, and Taos), she was not once questioned or screened for human trafficking.\n\n“Nobody saw me,” she says. “Not until the very end.”\n\n***\n\nGrowing up on the Zuni and Navajo reservations of western New Mexico, Eva moved continuously between her mother’s two-bedroom house in Nakaibito to the residences of her grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins — all in small communities north and south of Gallup with fewer than 2,000 people, connected by roads flanked by spruce trees. The only constant in her life was Haley, her sister 4½ years her junior.\n\nEva was the outgoing one, admired by her sister for her lanky limbs, her long eyelashes and her gift for sketching. When her cousins came for sleepovers, they marveled at her drawings of butterflies floating among trees. Eva was the one to initiate games of basketball in the driveway, scolding her cousins when they didn’t pass the ball to Haley.\n\nThe girls’ mother, Lea, worked multiple jobs as a nurse’s aide, and the family had a comfortable life in an area where the median household income hovers at about $27,000 a year. Lea entered her daughters in child beauty pageants in Gallup, Albuquerque and Las Cruces, and Eva relished in the two times she placed first.\n\nLea was the kind of mother who on a whim would take the family on a road trip to White Sands National Monument or the redwood forests of northern California, where the girls twirled and laid silent under the trees at night. Eva remembers those times as her happiest ones.\n\nThey ended the year she turned 11.\n\nLea had long struggled with alcoholism, and as the disease worsened she increasingly left her daughters in the care of others or alone at home. Eva was made to mature far beyond her years while enduring the advances of an abusive stepfather.\n\nWhen her mother was too intoxicated to drive, she propped Eva on a pile of blankets to see over the steering wheel of the family’s 1999 Honda Civic. Eva began skipping school, and while there she got in trouble for smoking. Finally, in her seventh grade year, she was expelled for fighting and never went back. Her grandmother described her as “12 going on 25.”\n\nReports from McKinley County sheriffs and Zuni police officers, who responded to disturbance and residential battery calls, chronicled a home life with frank, check-box detachment.\n\nDaughter, 12, seemed OK.\n\nAlcohol abuse by biological mother… Said she [leaves] kids with stepfather.\n\nYounger one said they are alone a lot.\n\nDaughter, 12, asked to go to grandmother’s house.\n\nOnly later would Eva and Haley confide in their grandmother that their stepfather physically, sexually, and emotionally abused them. “Don’t you tell Grandma what happens in this house,” he often said.\n\nThe girls’ grandmother says she kept as close a watch as she could, and when she saw them, she would give her granddaughters almost anything they wanted. For Eva’s 12th birthday, she bought her an iPhone, so Eva could call whenever they were left alone at home.\n\n“Buying her that phone was the worst thing I ever did,” Heidi says now.\n\n***\n\nOn Dec. 8, 2015, Eva looked at her phone and saw a Facebook message from a young man with a thick brow, chalky brown hair, and a round jawline. I remember you from middle school, he wrote. Eva, then 13, didn’t recognize him, but she assumed she knew him. “Everyone on the reservation knows everyone. Or they pretend they do,” she says.\n\nD, as she came to call him, enthused about her large brown eyes, her dimples, and the way she wore her hair in French braids. He asked for photos and she sent him intimate selfies, soon followed by more explicit pictures. She drove to his house in her mother’s car — still propped up on blankets and often hitting trash bins along the way — where he shared beer and marijuana with her. She thought he looked older than he did in his pictures on Facebook, but told herself that he was probably in high school when she was still in middle school. They drove to a Conoco gas station near the waterless Red Lake north of Gallup, where D — so confident, so approachable — told her he loved her. Eva felt needed and exultant, unmoored from the problems at home.\n\nAs the months went by, D took more photos and recorded videos — usually of Eva performing oral sex and having intercourse with him. His affectionate ways were soon supplanted by forceful sex, violence and threats. He promised to share her photos and videos on Facebook and hurt her little sister if she were to say anything. Then, he invited other men — he said they were his brother and cousin — to the house, where they molested and raped Eva. She remembers initially resisting, punching one of them, and hearing the words “Just do it,” before feeling a weight fall on her.\n\nHer grandmother reported Eva missing that night when she failed to return her texts and calls. When Eva returned the following morning looking “totally out of it,” a police dispatcher urged Heidi to take her to Para los Niños, an abuse crisis center for children and adolescents in Albuquerque. After an examination that lasted several hours, clinicians concluded that Eva showed signs of rape, “petechial bruising” and “penetrative trauma,” according to medical records.\n\nA nurse gave Heidi brochures, while Eva was presented with new clothes and stuffed animals and referred to tribal social services for counseling.\n\nNo follow-up was ever made. No one at the center asked any of the questions developed to help identify human trafficking victims. Questions like: Sometimes people are hurt or threatened, forced to do things by someone else who is getting something in exchange. Are you in a situation where you think this could happen?\n\nIndeed, according to Searchlight’s research, no major healthcare center in the state mandates trafficking screenings for minors presenting signs of sexual violence.\n\nAs they drove home on I-40 Eva heard a high-pitched noise, like someone yelling, in her head. The only sound her grandmother remembers hearing was the buzz of Eva’s phone.\n\n***\n\nSex trafficking is defined (federally and by the state) as the exploitation of individuals through threat or use of force, coercion, and/or fraud to induce a “commercial sex act” — a technical definition that blunts the trauma and spectrum of exploitation. It is a growing crime that’s estimated to generate $99 billion in illegal profits a year globally, and in the U.S., people of color — mostly black and indigenous women — are victimized at the highest rates.\n\nBut the widely cited mainstream definitions need to be expanded and reshaped when considering the ways indigenous women and minors are victimized, says Maureen Lomahaptewa, a Hopi woman and caseworker at The Life Link, a Santa Fe-based nonprofit that shelters and serves trafficking victims and other vulnerable populations.\n\nCaseworkers there say there’s a lack of understanding about the ways indigenous women, especially those from rural areas, are trafficked — and how the police, legal and medical systems fail them. These women are, according to experts, the most underserved of the underserved.\n\nThe Navajo Department of Family Services, which operates in Arizona and New Mexico, says that sex trafficking is often overlooked or misidentified among child abuse, sexual abuse, and domestic violence cases. Domestic violence accounts for one-third of the nearly 300,000 calls made to Navajo police every year, and the NDFS reported a 23 percent increase in child sexual abuse cases over the past two years, with 442 intakes in 2018.\n\nOpinion:I lost a student to sex trafficking and murder. We woefully fail to protect our children.\n\nThe agency is currently reviewing formerly closed cases and has in the past year opened three new trafficking investigations. Its efforts have been spurred in part by Navajo Nation Council Delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty, who spearheaded an as yet unpublished white paper on trafficking in the Navajo Nation.\n\nThe paper functions as a warning to policymakers and those who deny the prevalence of the issue. It compiles the few existing research studies and data sets on trafficking of indigenous peoples, and calls for extensive research and assessments that go beyond simple statistics — such as the 2016 National Institute of Justice finding that four in five indigenous women will experience violence in their lifetimes. A landmark national needs assessment was slated to begin in 2018, but the Department of Justice eliminated its funding.\n\nNot all tribal leaders regard the issue with the same urgency. Navajo Nation Police Chief Philip Francisco, for one, says he does not see sex trafficking as a problem in his jurisdiction. “It’s more of a border issue,” he says.\n\nOf course, trafficking and exploitation are hardly a new phenomenon in indigenous communities.\n\nFor centuries, sexual violence has been a cornerstone of the treatment of indigenous populations, integral to colonization and displacement, which to this day reverberates generational trauma.\n\nSex trafficking of contemporary indigenous women is “almost indistinguishable from the colonial tactics of enslavement, exploitation, exportation, and relocation,” writes Sarah Deer, professor of law at Kansas University and author of \"The Beginning and End of Rape: Confronting Sexual Violence in Native America\" (University of Minnesota Press, 2015).\n\nToday, high rates of chemical dependency, abuse, involvement in the foster care system and a lack of resources exacerbate vulnerability to predators, the vast majority of whom are non-Native. As noted in Crotty’s white paper (produced in partnership with Casey Family Programs and the University of Colorado’s American Indian Law Clinic), female minors, homeless youth and transgender or two-spirit/LGBTQ people are most vulnerable to trafficking.\n\nTrafficking cases uncovered by NDFS show that the criminal activity is not solely conducted through organized crime. Individual exploiters from metropolitan areas often target rural communities. And, as tribal leaders have found in NDFS cases, family members have been known to exchange younger children for money, drugs or basic needs.\n\n“We’ve seen our children trafficked by their own family, and most don’t even know they were trafficked. … Ultimately addressing this is about going back to the stories of these individuals who have been trafficked in each way. We need to stop erasing the experience of survivors,” says Crotty.\n\nExplaining the enormity of the global sex trade:13 sex trafficking statistics\n\nIn August 2017, Crotty and Council Delegate Nathaniel Brown co-sponsored a law designating human trafficking as a criminal offense in the Navajo Nation. “Our Navajo children are being picked up through social media and trafficked at truck stops or other areas across the United States,” Brown says. “And for a long time we didn’t have a word to describe sex trafficking in our communities.”\n\nThe new law grants tribal courts jurisdiction over Native and non-Native victims in cases that fall outside federal jurisdiction or that federal authorities decline to pursue. The law calls for coordination among government and civil institutions to fight illegal “transporting, trading or dealing” of people. Should a case arise, it would challenge the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court ruling Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, in which tribes lost the authority to prosecute non-Natives in Indian Country.\n\nMcKinley County, New Mexico\n\nIn the fall of 2016, D doubled his threats against Eva. If she spoke out, he would escalate. In addition to sharing the photos and videos, he promised to harm Heidi and abduct Haley. Isolated and cornered, Eva felt a heaviness to her every step.\n\nIf anyone could have helped Eva, it would have been her mother. Lea knew, or at least suspected, what was happening; she had seen the nude photos of her daughter and did nothing. Eva expected her mother to act or at least say something. But in November 2016, Lea died after an incident near Shiprock.\n\nHer death left Eva terrified. For weeks after the funeral she lay on the floor of her grandmother’s house, her body squirming in the dark, while her phones buzzed with messages.\n\nBy now, she had four Samsung cellphones, all supplied by D, who within several weeks of her mother’s death was texting daily, demanding more photos, threatening her with violence unless she pick herself up off the ground and met him. Which she did, as if pulled by a wire tethered to her feet — driving or being driven to faraway towns and switching between cars with strange men.\n\nHeidi, who now had full custody of both granddaughters, coped by writing notes in her planner (Eva snuck out of room in morning, 2-3 a.m… Eva gone… Eva still gone) and calling tribal and county police. She called so many times that they recognized her voice. Her despair had, in her words, become something of a joke to them. “Eva up and gone again?” they would ask.\n\nShe cut back her hours as a pharmacy assistant to look for Eva, driving across the Zuni Pueblo and southern Navajo Reservation to Gamerco, north of Gallup, knocking on doors to ask total strangers if they’d seen her granddaughter.\n\nAll this time, D kept tightening his grip. On Sept. 8, 2017, he sent a text demanding she send naked photos of her 10-year-old sister. Eva tried, first taking lighthearted pictures and then pulling at Haley’s clothes and screaming at her. When Haley began to screech and cry, Eva stopped as Heidi entered their room.\n\nThat night, Eva tried to kill herself by swallowing a bottle of Tylenol and cutting her forearms. Heidi drove her to a local emergency room, but with fewer than 20 adolescent psychiatric beds then available in the entire state, Eva was flown to Mesilla Valley Hospital in Las Cruces, 300 miles away.\n\nHeidi followed by car, laying out every detail she thought relevant to hospital staff: her granddaughter’s deepening depression, her history of sexual violence, her disappearances.\n\nIt would prove yet another opportunity missed. When Eva was discharged seven days later, she came home with little more than prescriptions for three psychotropic medications.\n\n“She was a zombie when she came out of there,” Heidi recalls. “And then she started texting all the time again and taking off with my truck.”\n\n***\n\nAfter conducting more than 75 interviews and gathering data from 18 agencies, Searchlight shared Eva’s story with nine tribal police officers, four tribal officials, and two former clinicians for the Indian Health Service. No one expressed surprise.\n\n“Tribal agencies are understaffed, underfunded, and undertrained in this type of response,” says Ramah Navajo Police Chief Darren Soland, who employs six officers to cover more than 250 square miles in McKinley and Cibola counties.\n\nA 2018 report from the Bureau of Indian Affairs found that, nationwide, tribal law enforcement received a mere 22 percent of necessary funding in 2016. The result, says Soland, is a growing culture of lawlessness.\n\n“Once someone who is being victimized goes from tribal to state land or to a municipality and maybe comes back, it’s hard to get the agencies to reach out and communicate with each other to identify someone or further a case,” he says.\n\nTraffickers exploit these legal technicalities. Research has shown that police and healthcare workers are most likely to encounter sex trafficking victims as they respond to calls and receive patients.\n\nA July 2019 study in the journal Criminology & Public Policy explored the reasons why law enforcement officers rarely recognize trafficking victims and found that many say they are either unaware that this is a crime over which they have jurisdiction or that they don’t believe it is an issue present in their communities. Many also cite the reluctance of victims to come forward to explain the low number of identifications and cases.\n\n“All these different players and systems, they don’t talk to each other when they need to, when someone is in potential crisis,” says Meredith Dank, a trafficking researcher at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a co-author of the 2019 study. “So often (the victims) fall right back to their traffickers.”\n\nThe study built on a 2017 report by the Government Accountability Office, which documented little-to-no coordination between law enforcement agencies and poor record keeping by the FBI — the principal authority, with BIA, on major criminal investigations in Indian Country.\n\nThe majority of states, including New Mexico, require no law enforcement basic training on human trafficking. No law enforcement agency in the state makes mention of the crime as it pertains to U.S. citizens in a standard operating manual.\n\nAnd while lawmakers have proposed legislation, their efforts have largely stalled. The renewal of the Violence Against Women Act, which includes amendments from Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M., Laguna Pueblo) to better assist Native victims of sexual violence and increase communication between law enforcement agencies, is stalled in the U.S. Senate.\n\n“Public safety in Indian Country should be a top priority, because Native women are experiencing violence at alarming rates — this is a national crisis,” Haaland wrote in a statement.\n\nAt the state level, New Mexico Human Trafficking Task Force members are lobbying for shelter funding, more statewide resources that reach rural areas, and stricter penalties for traffickers. Currently, trafficking offenders are not placed on the state’s Sex Offender Registry.\n\nIn major crime cases, trafficking included, justice is most effective when federal authorities — the FBI, BIA and U.S. Attorneys — track the issue, investigate and prosecute. The latest national figures, however, show that federal prosecutors declined nearly half of all cases in Indian Country in 2017 — many of them cases of sexual violence.\n\nSince 2015, the District of New Mexico U.S. Attorney’s office, the third busiest district in the country for Indian Country cases, has declined 69% of cases that fall under the ‘Offenses committed within Indian Country’ statute and 80% of cases falling under child abuse in Indian Country, according to data from the TRAC research center at Syracuse University.\n\n“What we've seen is Indian victims, but ones that end up in urban areas like Albuquerque,” says New Mexico U.S. Attorney John C. Anderson. “We have not seen, to date, a human trafficking prosecution referral that has its central situs in Indian country or that has been premised in Indian Country jurisdiction.”\n\nTribal police chiefs and caseworkers said they believe most cases stall or are deprioritized, remaining open but in “inactive status.”\n\nIn state-level human trafficking statistics, the FBI does not publish the county or victim’s ethnicity. In a written response to questions, a spokesperson from the FBI’s New Mexico headquarters wrote, “The FBI is committed to fulfilling our mandate to investigate the most serious crimes in Indian Country. ... The FBI aggressively investigates any reports of human trafficking, using force-multiplying Human Trafficking Task Forces.” The FBI did not provide figures on the number of inactive-status trafficking cases.\n\n“We’re letting the FBI off the hook way too easily,” says Mary Kathryn Nagle, a Cherokee Nation lawyer and counsel to the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center. “And I wish more senators would call them to account for how few investigations go anywhere. They need to have an oversight hearing on why the FBI is abdicating its duties.”\n\nMcKinley County, New Mexico\n\nEva this is grandma!! Where are you. Please call me... You are precious to us.\n\nEva had been missing a week when Heidi sent her frantic messages and posted a round of pleas on Facebook. Every hour, she sent another one. Eva where are you! I’m scared for your life! Are you warm?\n\nPlease call and I can pick you up no questions asked!\n\nWhen the responses came, they were from an account under the name “Devon” — photos of Eva being assaulted, along with the words Do not call the police. At no point did Facebook flag or intervene in the sharing of these images of sexual abuse and child exploitation on its platform.\n\nThe 70-year-old grandmother ignored the threat and called New Mexico State Police, reporting that her granddaughter had stolen her silver Ford truck. “I figured I’d rather her be locked in jail than not know where she was.”\n\nEleven days later, Eva was handcuffed outside a Dollar Store in northeast Albuquerque. She was standing near the truck with an older man, who walked away without questioning from officers after denying that he knew Eva.\n\nThe following morning, Heidi brought her granddaughter to the children’s psychiatric unit at the University of New Mexico, where blood work revealed she had a sexually transmitted disease. A doctor’s case notes described a “15 (year-old) patient crying in ER, mute, and unable to talk coherently.”\n\nEva was prescribed antibiotics and antidepressants and put under suicide watch. “It is unclear if the numerous high risk activities in which (Eva) has been engaging recently are indicative of dysfunctional grieving, desire to harm self, or defiance of guardian,” the doctor noted.\n\nTwo weeks later, she was transferred by ambulance to a 90-day program at Butterfly Healing Center, a co-ed treatment center for Native American teens in Taos.\n\nManaged by the Eight Northern Indian Pueblos Council, Butterfly Healing Center helps indigenous youth stabilize and recover from substance abuse and mental health issues. Many kids who have been pushed out from other agencies are, for the first time, given time and space to heal.\n\n“I just felt calm when I got to Butterfly,” Eva says. “And needed.”\n\nREAD:Sex trafficking, prostitution is anything but a 'victimless crime,' experts say\n\nHeidi and Haley relocated to Santa Fe to be closer to Eva, and for the first time in years, Eva says, she began to think with a level of clarity. The piercing noises in her head subsided. She watched movies and played board games and basketball with other teens.\n\nMost important, she bonded with a therapist and a female staff member, whom she credits with returning meaning to her life. A month into her stay, she began to talk.\n\n“All that stuff that my grandma thought was going on was true,” Eva says. In one pivotal conversation, she laid everything out — being groomed and exchanged for sex, her own life and that of her family members threatened.\n\nHer disclosure set in motion a string of reports that reverberated across agencies, including the child protective services, the FBI, The Life Link and others. It culminated with a three-hour interview with the FBI during which her phone was turned over to the agency.\n\n“I’d never heard the word ‘trafficked’ until that day,” says Eva. “When I heard it, I thought it was just like a word for trapped.”\n\nHome\n\nIn the last 14 months since departing a safe house, Eva, now 17, and Haley, 13, have each enrolled in new schools twice and changed apartments three times. Eva has gone missing once after she ran away in the middle of a panic attack. She has also been arrested and spent a night in jail for kicking and punching Heidi.\n\nDespite the occasional outburst, the family maintains a bond — albeit one that’s limited to the three of them. Though aunts and uncles and cousins live in western New Mexico, Eva, Haley and Heidi do not visit. There are many places Eva won’t return to.\n\nTo date, no charges have been filed. Every few months, Heidi calls the assigned FBI agent for an update, but there rarely is anything to report. Several individuals familiar with the case believe it has been relegated, like so many others under the FBI’s purview, to inactive status.\n\nEva, meanwhile, has grown out her bangs and wears large puffer and fake-fur coats that obscure her slender body, no matter the season. She frets about being recognized in public and says illicit photos and videos of her can still be found in the dark corners of the internet. Recalling those photos is one among many triggers for her, along with the smell of marijuana and abrupt movements.\n\nSometimes at the peak of a panic attack, she faints — a somewhat rare occurrence among trauma victims, one that’s more often experienced by refugees who survive war, torture and genocide. She deconstructs these episodes and her past in biweekly therapy sessions.\n\nThe family subsides on victim assistance funds that will change and decrease as Eva grows older. Heidi will apply for food stamps and public housing in the coming years. Eva says she and Heidi will soon start looking for jobs.\n\nFor now, though, she tries to stay focused on finishing the 10th grade. While she sometimes struggles in school, in her creative writing class she has an A+.\n\nSometimes, Eva has a sense that things will improve, but she also likes to point out that to believe rests on an assumption that believing will work.\n\nMany nights, she resists sleep. Nightmares ensue, and the sensation of near-sleep reminds her of the feeling she experienced when she was being trafficked — weightless and contorted underwater.\n\n“I want to make it not real. But I was living there. And sometimes, I’m still living there.”\n\nSearchlight New Mexico is investigating human trafficking in urban and rural New Mexico.

The City Council voted to extend the mask requirement through May 24. The decision came the same day the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Alabama will receive $44 million to expand vaccination efforts. Alabama ranks last in the country for the percentage of people who have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said the mask ordinance is needed because COVID-19 continues to be a health threat, and most people in the city and the state have not been fully vaccinated. Woodfin said many local businesses also urged the city to keep the mask ordinance in place. “We will continue to make decisions that we believe will save lives. They may not be popular,” Woodfin said. The mayor urged people to “continue to do their part” during the “fourth quarter of this global health pandemic.” Although Gov. Kay Ivey’s statewide mask order expires Friday, health officials are urging people to voluntarily wear masks.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A judge has ruled that attorneys must be allowed visits with clients in state Department of Corrections facilities, regardless of the inmates’ vaccination status. The recent ruling by Superior Court Judge Una Gandbhir came in a case brought in January by defense attorneys who argued that a continued ban on attorney-client visits deprived defendants of their right to legal counsel, the Anchorage Daily News reports. In March 2020 amid COVID-19 concerns, the Department of Corrections stopped in-person visits at its facilities. Last month, with the growing availability of COVID-19 vaccines, the department said attorney visits could resume but only with inmates considered fully vaccinated – or at least two weeks after their last vaccine doses. Gandbhir wrote that with criminal trials expected to resume soon in Alaska, delays in allowing lawyers and clients to meet “might prove fatal to the liberty interests of countless currently incarcerated Alaskans.” Sarah Gallagher, a corrections department spokesperson, said the agency will comply with the order. Gallagher said appointments must be scheduled in advance, and face coverings must be worn. She also said there will be health and temperature screenings for attorneys when they arrive. Family and friends still cannot visit, according to the department.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state-run COVID-19 vaccination site at Phoenix Municipal Stadium will move indoors Monday as it relocates to Desert Financial Arena on Arizona State University’s Tempe campus, the Department of Health Services announced Thursday. The relocation of the outdoor site in a parking lot near the Phoenix-Tempe border is the latest change in the state’s mass vaccination program to account for rising temperatures. Free parking is available in a parking lot near the ASU arena, which is close to transit routes, the department said. People who already have second-dose appointments scheduled at Phoenix Municipal Stadium for Monday and later are being informed of the new location, the department said. Arizona health officials say they are seeing demand for vaccinations slowing, particularly at large sites. Appointments at state-run sites opened to anyone 16 and older March 24, and thousands of slots were available at sites in Tucson and Yuma as the week began, KTAR reports. “What I think we’re seeing right now is supply starting to meet demand,” Dr. Cara Christ, Arizona Department of Health Services director, said at a press conference Monday. The state’s death toll related to the coronavirus surpassed 17,000 this week.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 244 new cases of the coronavirus and seven more deaths Wednesday from the illness caused by the virus. The Department of Health said the state’s COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began now total 331,505. The state’s active cases, meaning ones that don’t include people who have died or recovered, increased by 47 to 1,649. The state’s COVID-19 deaths reached 5,660, and hospitalizations decreased by two to 150. More than 27,000 additional COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered, the department said. About 1.3 million of 1.9 million doses allocated to the state have been administered so far. Arkansas last week expanded its vaccine eligibility to everyone age 16 and older. “With COVID-19 cases increasing in other states, we are in a race to get everyone vaccinated,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said in a statement. “This is the key to victory. If you are over 16, let’s get the dose.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Lawmakers on Thursday advanced what they called commonsense legislation requiring two state agencies to share information aimed at helping stop billions of dollars in pandemic-related unemployment fraud. The measure that cleared its first committee would require the beleaguered Employment Development Department to cross-check unemployment applications with inmate records to identify fraudulent claims. State officials approved at least $810 million in the names of roughly 45,000 inmates, some of them on death row, according to a state audit in January that put the toll at more than double the amount previously reported by the state. Investigators say overall fraud losses will top at least $11 billion. “The notion that this type of fraud occurred simply because two agencies don’t communicate with each other during a global pandemic as we try to figure out how we can help people is actually kind of mind-boggling,” said Democratic Assemblywoman Wendy Carrillo, one of six committee members who advanced the bill without opposition. At least 35 other states were cross-matching unemployment claims against state prisoners as of 2016, and 28 states were checking claims against county jail inmates, the audit noted.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Health officials have reported an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations across the state, while infections also suggest wider spread of the coronavirus. The state Department of Public Health and Environment said 450 people were hospitalized statewide as of Wednesday with confirmed or suspected coronavirus infections, The Denver Post reports. The last time that many people were in the hospital because of COVID-19 was Feb. 19. Larimer, Adams, Douglas and Pueblo counties saw an increase in hospitalizations, while numbers in most parts of the state remained stable or slowly decreased. Hospitalizations in Pueblo increased 11 of the past 14 days. Health officials have said the relatively steep increase can be a sign that vaccines have not yet chased the virus out of Colorado. State data released Wednesday said there was an 8% increase of active coronavirus outbreaks in the past week, bringing numbers back to the level seen last month. Jefferson, Summit and Pitkin counties have increased safety restrictions as a result of rising case counts. “Unfortunately we are slipping in the wrong direction,” Jefferson County Public Health Executive Director Dawn Comstock said. “None of us want to go backwards on the dial after all of the hard work we’ve put in and sacrifices we’ve made.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont signed an executive order Tuesday that will allow people to use the continuing COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to vote by absentee in any election, primary or referendum held before May 20. The Democrat’s latest order related to the public health and civil preparedness emergencies is similar to the order that allowed voters to use absentee ballots during elections in 2020. Lamont’s new order also provides municipalities and regional school boards with additional flexibility in scheduling budget hearings, meetings and votes to account for logistical challenges posed by the pandemic. Meanwhile, the state continues to see new coronavirus cases, with 1,074 confirmed or probable cases added Tuesday. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by 25.1%, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins. The number of hospitalizations for COVID-19 increased by 21 since Monday to 505, while the number of COVID-19-associated deaths increased by seven to 7,930. Lamont on Tuesday visited Hartford’s second walk-up, no-appointment vaccine clinic for Hartford residents 18 and older. The site is located at the Swift Factory, a commercial and community campus. The city held its first no-appointment clinic last week at a Walmart parking lot.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth: Rehoboth Beach’s historic boardwalk amusement park is back to its traditional opening date this year, returning May8, on Mother’s Day weekend. Funland will continue operating under the plan it implemented last year, to include enhanced cleaning and sanitizing, mandatory face masks, and limiting the number of guests in the park through an online booking system. Gone are the days of using those familiar green tickets to access rides. Now, Funland patrons book $20 “ridepasses” online. Each pass offers two hours of unlimited access to 17 rides. A limited number of passes are issued for each two-hour block, so lines are almost nonexistent. “Jungle of Fun” and “SimRider” will remain closed this year, unless and until COVID-19 restrictions are reduced. Ridepasses became available to book online Thursday. There are no refunds, so make sure you check the weather first. Funland’s iconic midway and arcade games are accessible via the boardwalk without a ridepass, and this year, there will be more of them.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A CVS offering vaccinations to D.C. residents has drawn complaints about clutter, crowding and patient privacy concerns, WUSA-TV reports. Fed up with the mess outside the store in the Penn Branch Shopping Center in the Southeast neighborhood, Dr. Jalan Burton pulled out her cellphone and took a video showing sheets of plywood inside the front windows and boxes, crates and other construction material cluttered outside. Burton said her concerns were only magnified by what she saw and heard as soon as she stepped inside, with a vaccination line in the store’s small entryway. “They had a representative sitting there with a table – a card table – and a sign that said COVID vaccines, and she was there doing health screenings,” Burton said. She said she cut through the line but could hear private medical information. “You can hear everything. Not only is it unfair from a privacy standpoint, but also from a safety standpoint, right?” she said. “Because if I can touch the people to the right, and I can touch the people to the left, and I have to walk through that line, that is not socially distanced at all.” A CVS corporate spokesperson said the team is working on rearranging the store’s flow. The plywood on the windows was related to a December car crash, the spokesperson said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis has received a single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, his office confirmed Wednesday. He did so out of the public eye even as governors elsewhere across the political spectrum have been vaccinated publicly to reassure Americans that the shots are safe. A spokesperson for the Republican governor initially declined to provide details, including when exactly DeSantis received the dose. But it was later disclosed that the governor received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine last week. The spokesperson, Meredith Beatrice, acknowledged the governor’s vaccination during an interview. The disclosure came after a DeSantis news conference at the Capitol assailing the TV news program “60 Minutes” for a story airing Sunday that suggested a “pay-to-play” vaccine distribution deal with a supermarket chain that donated to the governor’s political committee. DeSantis had recently said he would be vaccinated soon, but no announcement was made by his office when he received it, and no journalists were on hand. Even some of his top lieutenants said they were unaware the governor had been vaccinated as they continued to urge Floridians to get inoculated against a disease that has killed nearly 34,000 people statewide. More than 2 million people in Florida have been infected.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp is declaring that “Georgia is open for business” as of Thursday, loosening the restrictions he imposed last year to control the spread of the coronavirus by letting people sit closer together at restaurants and gather in larger crowds. The Republican governor changed the state’s rules despite urgings from federal officials that states should keep curbs on unmasked close contact among strangers. They warn that more infectious virus variants now spreading across the U.S. could cause another spike in cases and deaths. Kemp portrays his new executive order as part of an effort to return to “normal,” continuing to emphasize that economic health is as important as freedom from the respiratory illness that has killed more than 19,000 Georgians. “Many small-business owners are still struggling under the impact COVID-19 has had on our economy,” Kemp said in a video message Wednesday. “And we know hard-working Georgians cannot endure another year like the last.” Federal officials acknowledge “COVID-19 fatigue” but say it’s too soon to stop being careful. Under Kemp’s new order, restaurant tables now must be only 3.5 feet apart without partitions, and there’s no longer a 50-person limit on gatherings when people are closer than 6 feet, which could allow larger indoor concerts and conventions.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Oahu will remain in its current tier for coronavirus restrictions despite a rise in cases that could have triggered a rollback. Under an agreement between Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi and Gov. David Ige, the island will remain at the current level of business and social restrictions for at least four weeks, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. That means larger gatherings can continue, and businesses like restaurants and bars can operate at a higher capacity. Oahu’s coronavirus case count averaged more than 50 infections per day for the second week in a row which under the current reopening plan would have meant a return to more a restrictive tier. The mayor asked Ige to loosen the criteria for its current level of restrictions to a seven-day average daily case count of 50 to 100, one of the current triggers for the more restrictive second tier. No formal changes to the tier system have been made, but the governor agreed to allow the island to postpone rollback by a month to see what happens with case counts during that period. Noting the “profound impact on our businesses, families and community,” Blangiardi said in a statement that “we are focused on the broader definition of health and I believe moving back to Tier 2 at this point would have had a tremendous negative impact on the overall health and economic recovery, including the impacts on livelihoods, jobs and mental and emotional health.”\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: Idaho Bureau of Laboratories Director Christopher Ball has said concerning coronavirus variants are likely spreading across the state, despite efforts to vaccinate residents. COVID-19 vaccines currently being distributed are believed to be effective against the strains; however, the continued spread intensifies pressure to speed up the vaccination efforts, the Post Register reports. “We are in a race against the variants with our vaccination program,” said Kathryn Turner, the state’s deputy public health researcher. “Every single time that virus is transmitted, it has a chance to mutate. So the faster we get people vaccinated, the better off we’ll be; the fewer variants we’ll have.” Health officials have said variants accounted for four of the more than 100 residents who tested positive for the virus in the past two weeks after receiving their final vaccines. Turner said cases in which people contract the virus after being fully vaccinated are rare, accounting for less than 0.03% of about 320,000 fully vaccinated residents. Data from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare reveals 95 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been identified as caused by variants of concern. But Ball said official state variant counts don’t show the whole picture.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: With the state poised to open up eligibility for COVID-19 vaccines to residents as young as 16, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Thursday that Illinois will make 150,000 first-dose appointments available in the Chicago suburbs. The governor said the shots will be available at 11 state-run mass vaccination sites in the suburbs and at area pharmacies. Starting Monday, residents 16 and older will be able to schedule appointments in suburban Cook County as well as the state’s other 101 counties. Chicago officials have said such universal eligibility will be expanded April 19, meeting a goal set this week by President Joe Biden, but Pritzker said Chicago residents are “absolutely welcome” to sign up for appointments at the state-run vaccination sites. Still, he warned not to expect to get an appointment immediately. “Even with all of these new appointments, there will not be enough vaccine in week one to get everyone that wants to be vaccinated a dose,” he said.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: The University of Notre Dame says it will require all students to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 for the fall semester. University officials notified the campus community of the requirement in a letter Wednesday, saying the school will accommodate documented medical or religious exemptions to vaccinations. “Requiring students to be vaccinated for COVID-19 is a new and important addition to our health policies, one that we believe will enhance public health at Notre Dame and in our community, while also contributing to our ability to return to a more vibrant campus environment,” university President the Rev. John Jenkins said. The announcement came in advance of Notre Dame opening a clinic Thursday to administer the Pfizer vaccine to any students, faculty and staff who want a shot. Spokesmen for Indiana University and Purdue University said neither institution is requiring the vaccine yet. Nearly a quarter of Indiana residents age 16 and older are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, state health officials said Wednesday. Meanwhile, the state on Thursday reported 1,397 new coronavirus cases and an additional 16 deaths. Even as the pace of vaccinations accelerates, the state has been seeing the number of new cases rise.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state must “take a stand” against so-called vaccine passports, Gov. Kim Reynolds said Wednesday, while pledging to back legislation or use executive action to restrict their use. The idea of using “vaccine passports” for travel or at entry points to venues has sparked a political divide, and Republican lawmakers and governors in several states are working on proposals to ban them. The White House has said the federal government will not roll out its own system requiring Americans to carry vaccine credentials. At the end of March, New York launched the Excelsior Pass, an app that displays a digital code verifying the person is inoculated against COVID-19. It is accepted at dozens of venues statewide, including Madison Square Garden, and allows people to increase the size of catered events, such as weddings, according to USA TODAY. Reynolds said she believes the shots are effective, and she noted she has been vaccinated. But she said vaccination should remain a personal choice. A passport system would create a “two-tiered society” and have privacy implications, she said during a news conference Wednesday. Reynolds later said she is still looking into the wording of a ban and how broad the measure would be, including whether it would cover efforts by the private sector.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A Native American tribe in the state is appealing to President Joe Biden’s administration for $7.5million from the first round of coronavirus relief funding distributed last year under the CARES Act. The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, based near Mayetta, filed a lawsuit last June against the U.S. Treasury Department, claiming the department under former President Donald Trump had used improper data to allocate relief money. The federal government then was using an Indian Housing Block Grant data to allocate and divide the approximately $8 billion set aside altogether for tribes. But the data was flawed and undercounted populations, according to multiple lawsuits, and the Treasury ignored data that tribes submitted themselves. The Prairie Band Nation said that mistake meant $7.5 million lost for them. Other tribes in the nation, such as Oklahoma’s Shawnee Tribe, said that mistake meant it would receive virtually nothing, as the Shawnee didn’t participate in the IHBG program. “The Trump Treasury Department used a wholly inappropriate housing-based formula that cost us and other tribes millions of dollars of needed relief,” Prairie Band Nation Chairman Joseph Rupnick said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A judge has temporarily blocked another attempt by Republican lawmakers to restrict Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Franklin Circuit Judge Phillip Shepherd extended a temporary injunction Wednesday to apply to a measure passed over the governor’s veto. It specifies which of Beshear’s pandemic-related orders would remain in place should the Legislature win its legal fight with the governor. House Joint Resolution 77 was a response to Shepherd’s previous order temporarily blocking GOP-backed laws that threatened to invalidate Beshear’s COVID-19-related orders. Shepherd said HJR77 was a mechanism to “terminate a broad range of executive actions in the field of public health that constitute the state’s attempt to prevent the spread of COVID-19.” He said it’s unclear whether the proposed termination of Beshear’s pandemic orders under HJR77 supersedes the governor’s executive authority under public health laws. “Until this issue has been resolved, it would create a great public harm and would undermine effective public health requirements to allow the temporary suspension or termination of the governor’s public health orders,” Shepherd wrote.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Plans for $450 million in upgrades to New Orleans’ iconic Superdome have been disrupted because of financial troubles caused by the pandemic, the stadium’s manager told state lawmakers during a budget hearing Wednesday. The coronavirus outbreak temporarily ended concerts, monster truck shows and many other events at the domed stadium and the neighboring arena. Local hotel tax collections that help fund the facilities’ management district plummeted as the virus obliterated tourist travel. Crowds at the Superdome weren’t allowed or were greatly limited for New Orleans Saints games. In response, ASM Global – the company that oversees the Superdome, arena and other facilities in the Louisiana Stadium and Exposition District – slowed the stadium improvements and may not complete the full project plans as originally envisioned. “We took a step back from the renovation project,” Evan Holmes, business operations director for ASM Global, told the House Appropriations Committee. “We’re taking it year by year, step by step to make sure we’re not overextending ourselves.” The nearly 50-year-old stadium was supposed to see its ramp system removed and replaced with elevators and escalators, club and suite levels expanded, new entry gates erected, concession stands added and access for people with disabilities improved.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state is set to relax attendance restrictions for private events such as weddings and private parties next month. Indoor events have been limited to 50% of permitted occupancy or 50 people, whichever is greater, since late March. The Maine Department of Economic & Community Development said earlier this week that the restrictions will rise to 75% of permitted occupancy or 50 people, whichever is greater, on May 24. The restrictions on outdoor events will rise from 75% to 100% of permitted occupancy May 24. The restrictions are designed to reduce the spread of coronavirus in the state, state officials said. “Group social gatherings such as weddings, celebrations, and similar private events with invited attendees bring people from multiple communities into close contact with each other and have the potential to increase COVID-19 transmission,” the economic development department said in a statement. The number of infections is creeping upward in the state, with the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases up over the past two weeks from 197.29 on March 23 to 310.43 as of Tuesday. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths in Maine did not increase over the past two weeks, going from 0.86 on March 23 to 0.57 on Tuesday.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Emergency measures to help struggling businesses pay less in unemployment insurance taxes while simultaneously granting more funding to the unemployed were voted out of the Legislature last week and await a signature from Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. Raising from $50 to $200 the weekly amount of uncounted pay that unemployment insurance claimants can receive is among the measures, which come as the Maryland Department of Labor continues to receive thousands of claims each week as the pandemic’s economic effects drag on. The department reported receiving more than 12,000 new and reclassified claims last week, the lowest mark of the month. While this is a notable improvement from the 50,000 claims recorded in the last week of January, the state’s numbers have seesawed for much of the year. Employers pay unemployment insurance taxes to both federal and state governments – payments to the latter are deposited into a trust fund, from which money is drawn to pay out claims. In Maryland, individuals who lose their job through no fault of their own and who are actively seeking work can receive up to $430 per week in unemployment insurance. The amount that claimants receive is partially based on their current weekly wage total.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Emerson College is temporarily restricting campus activities amid a recent rise in COVID-19 cases. College officials said Wednesday that all in-person student activities and gatherings will be halted, including athletics. The campus fitness center will close, the dining center will offer only to-go meals, and the library will be open for socially distanced study and reserved study spaces only, Erik Muurisepp, the college’s assistant vice president for campus life, said in a message to the campus community. Students are also being asked to leave their residences for a limited number of reasons such as picking up food, seeking medical care, or going to and from employment. Travel is prohibited. The changes will took effect Wednesday evening and will remain in place for at least a week, according to Muurisepp. In-person classes will continue as normal, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Officials are putting together plans to knock on doors across the 139-square-mile city to convince residents to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Detroit expects by the end of April to have crews start visiting homes to speak with residents about the importance of protecting themselves from the coronavirus with vaccinations and how to sign up to receive the shots, the Detroit News reports. Despite drive-up vaccinations at a downtown convention center, mass vaccinations at Ford Field and Saturday vaccinations at churches, only 22% of Detroit residents have received at least one vaccine dose compared to 38% for all of Michigan, according to Michigan’s Department of Health and Human Services. Ford Field is a federally selected regional mass vaccination site where 6,000 doses a day will be administered for two months. Efforts in Detroit, which is about 80% Black, mirror other parts of the country where African Americans have been more hesitant than white people to get vaccinated. “We’re going to knock on every residential door in the city, making sure every Detroiter knows how to make an appointment,” Victoria Kovari, an executive assistant to Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, told the Detroit News. The initial outreach is expected to last six to seven weeks.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Health officials reported 2,500 new coronavirus infections Thursday as more infectious variants drive case growth across the state. The new cases mark the highest single-day total since January, when the state was coming down from the surge in infections cases late last year. The Minnesota Department of Health reported 14 more people have died due to COVID-19 in addition to the 2,535 new virus cases, bringing the state’s totals to 6,922 deaths and 535,182 cases since the start of the pandemic last year. Hospitalizations have climbed alongside cases, with 565 patients in Minnesota hospitals due to the coronavirus, including 131 in intensive care. Health officials have expressed concern regarding the steady rise in cases and hospitalizations, citing a growing seven-day test positivity rate that indicates community transmission of the virus. Officials have described the state’s vaccination progress as a race against the more contagious virus variants, hoping the state’s efforts to vaccinate populations more susceptible to the virus will prevent a significant spike in cases, hospitalizations and deaths. More than 3 million doses of the vaccine have been administered as of Tuesday. About 1.9 million Minnesotans have received at least one dose, with more than 1.2 million fully inoculated.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Alongside rising COVID-19 vaccinations, the state’s seven-day case average has dwindled from the January peak of 2,400 to 200, Gov. Tate Reeves said during a Tuesday news conference. Hospitalizations have dropped from 1,444 to 163 in the same time span. COVID-19 patients on ventilators have declined from 230 to 35. Within the week, 1,434 new COVID-19 cases were recorded, down by 115 from the previous week. Just 34 people died due to COVID-19, down from 62 the week before. Black residents make up 38% of the state’s population, and total doses administered since vaccines came into the state have gone to 31% of Black Mississippians. As of Thursday, the state had administered more than 1,369,330 shots, nearly 41.5% of which left recipients fully vaccinated. The state reports an overall COVID-19 vaccination rate of 19.1%, similar to the national average of 20%. “Under every circumstance, the vaccine is better than COVID,” State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said during a news conference last Friday.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The state’s Republican-led Senate on Wednesday voted to ban so-called vaccine passports. Senators voted 26-7 in favor of a wide-ranging bill that includes a ban on requiring such documentation to travel in the state. Vaccine passports show travelers have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or recently tested negative for the coronavirus. Technology companies and travel-related trade groups are developing and testing out vaccine passports to encourage travel. Republican Gov. Mike Parson has said he won’t require vaccine passports, which he emphasized again while speaking on Fox News on Wednesday. “If people want to carry a card, that’s fine. It’s called freedom. It’s called individual rights,” Parson said. “But it’s not government’s place to do that.” The Missouri bill would ban any requirements that travelers show proof of vaccination in order to fly, get a taxi or use public transportation in the state. The bill now goes to the state House for consideration. The state health department on Wednesday reported 2,175 confirmed coronavirus cases over the week of March 29, averaging about 311 per day. Cases are down about 3% from the week prior. Six new deaths were reported in the past week, bringing the total COVID-19 death toll in Missouri to at least 8,509.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state is starting a temporary program to allow 15-year-olds to get a learner’s permit without having to take a driver’s education class. About 22,000 students are waiting to enroll in driver’s education, but courses are limited due to COVID-19-related restrictions and a shortage of driving instructors, Attorney General Austin Knudsen said. “Too many families are having to wait for more than a year until their son or daughter can get into a drivers ed class,” Knudsen said in a statement. ”We’re getting bureaucracy out of the way so Montana teenagers can get back on track, start learning to drive safely and save their families money.” Under current law, teens who don’t complete a driver’s education course have to wait until they are 16 to get a learner’s permit. Under this temporary program, 15-year-olds can take the written exam and receive a learner’s permit. Then, over the next six months, they will have to complete 50 hours of driving with a parent or other responsible adult, including 10 hours of nighttime driving, before taking the driving skills test with the Motor Vehicle Division. Students who pass the driving test will receive a graduated driver’s license, which limits the number of passengers they can have and limits nighttime driving.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A growing number of younger people are being hospitalized with the coronavirus as more contagious variants spread in the state. Nebraska health officials said the average age of people hospitalized with the virus declined to 51 in March from 61 in January. Officials said the age is also shifting lower because a significant number of older people in the state have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The number of people hospitalized is also growing and hit 161 Wednesday as the state reported more cases of the virus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases nearly doubled over the past two weeks, going from 246.43 new cases per day March 23 to 491.29 per day Tuesday. So far the state has confirmed 237 cases of different variants of the virus. Officials said Wednesday that Creighton University and CHI Health have begun testing in more cases to determine if they were caused by variants. That testing will supplement similar work that was already being done at the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory and give the state a more complete picture of which variants are causing most of the infections.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: One rural southern Nevada county could step ahead of the state and approve lifting mask mandates and business capacity limits enacted as coronavirus pandemic prevention measures more than a year ago. The Nye County Commission is scheduled to hold a vote April 20 to let businesses return to 100% occupancy and make face coverings optional. Gov. Steve Sisolak’s spokeswoman, Meghin Delaney, did not immediately respond Thursday to questions about the county’s proposal. Current state rules call for mask and social distancing for people in public places and generally limit occupancy for businesses and gatherings at 50%. Nye County commissioners on Tuesday passed a separate resolution asking the Legislature to rescind the state’s pandemic emergency declaration, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The moves put the county west of Las Vegas in front of the state’s other 16 counties for easing coronavirus precautions. Sisolak’s appointed Nevada COVID-19 Response Task Force is reviewing plans to turn over pandemic mitigation control to local authorities beginning May 1. Several other reliably Republican rural Nevada counties – including Elko, Eureka, Lyon and White Pine – have also chafed at the Democratic governor’s COVID-19 directives.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: More than 20 school districts have asked the state if they can delay returning to full-time, in-person instruction that’s mandated to start April 19. At least one district, Monadnock Regional School District, has decided it’s going to stick with its original target of May 3, WMUR-TV reports. In Manchester, the district applied for a waiver, citing vaccine concerns for staff members and teachers and invoking federal requirements. “A lot of our employees have (Americans with Disabilities Act) accommodations under federal guidelines,” Manchester Superintendent John Goldhardt said. “They are not allowed to come back until they’ve had their vaccination and have full immunity.” Last week, Gov. Chris Sununu said all K-12 schools must return to full-time, in-person learning as of April 19, although a remote option will still available for parents and students who request it. Schools had already returned to offering in-person learning at least two days a week as of March 8.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Supplies of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine to the state will plummet next week, but appointments were still available for this week at vaccine sites in Atlantic City and Gloucester and Camden counties, Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday. “We’re going to have a couple choppy weeks based on the federal supply,” he said of the state’s effort to vaccinate 4.7 million people by June 30. He urged residents to seize available appointments now, as there will be far fewer openings for the next two weeks. The governor himself, along with his wife, Tammy Murphy, will be vaccinated at the Atlantic City Convention Center vaccination site during a visit Friday, he said. New Jersey will receive 90% fewer doses of the J&J vaccine next week compared with this week – a drop from 131,000 this week to 15,600. That is expected to dwindle further to just 5,200 doses the following week, when all New Jerseyans 16 and older become eligible for vaccination, said state Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli. Manufacturing problems at a Maryland production facility recently made it necessary to throw out 15 million doses of J&J’s vaccine, causing nationwide supply shortages just as eligibility for the vaccine expands.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state that leads the nation in the vaccine rollout is making it easier for senior citizens to get a COVID-19 shot. The Department of Health announced Thursday that people 60 and up can schedule a vaccine appointment without first being offered one by health officials. Since the rollout began, seniors have had priority for the shots. But the system to set appointments was frustrating for them and at times impossible for rural residents. The appointments are offered by text or email on a first-come, first-served basis. They can close within hours of being sent. The locations where shots are offered also could be far from where people live, requiring as much as a four-hour round-trip drive. Under the new policy, New Mexicans 60 and up can register for an appointment online whenever they want. Vaccination sites in their area may be booked, but they don’t have to wait for an invite and can check availability at their convenience. The move effectively gives them first pick at appointments, ending the need for 24/7 access to text messages and emails. It follows a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found New Mexico lagged other states in distributing vaccines to highly vulnerable populations, despite its best-in-the-U.S. inoculation rate, with 31% of residents fully vaccinated.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: In the largest program of its kind, state lawmakers have created a $2.1 billion fund to aid workers who lost jobs or income during the coronavirus pandemic but were excluded from other government relief programs because of their immigration status. The fund, which passed this week as part of the state budget, will give payments of up to $15,600 to workers who were living in the country illegally and weren’t eligible for federal stimulus checks, unemployment aid or other benefits. As many as 300,000 workers might benefit, according to some estimates. Other states have offered aid to unauthorized workers, but nothing on this scale. The creation of New York’s program showed the strength in the state of Democratic Party’s left wing, which has been increasingly emboldened as the state’s leading centrist, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has wrestled with a sexual harassment scandal. The fund will offer much-needed relief to people like Felipe Idrovo, 52, an immigrant from Ecuador who lives in Queens. He lost a job working in food distribution in March 2020 and now owes a year’s rent on his small bedroom. “I cannot jump, but I am really, really happy,” said Idorvo, a board member of Make the Road New York, an immigrant-led advocacy group whose members participated in a 23-day hunger strike in support of the legislation. “My heart is happy but my body is torn down,” he said as he and other activists broke their fast at a rally Wednesday in New York City.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: COVID-19 vaccine supply, eligibility and providers are reaching all-time highs across the state, and the focus is beginning to shift toward making sure there’s enough demand. More than 600,000 doses were headed to providers across the state this week, not including allocations directly from the federal government to retail pharmacies and other providers. And now, since Tuesday, all adults 16 and over, more than 8 million North Carolinians, qualify for COVID-19 vaccines. State allocations for the week are up almost 56,000 from the week prior and up more than 138,000 from the week before that, according to data provided by the state Department of Health and Human Services. As those numbers keep climbing, North Carolina is approaching the point where supply will outpace demand, Gov. Roy Cooper said in a recent update. “We’re going to have plenty of supply to get every person vaccinated who wants a vaccine,” he said. “Pretty soon, we’re going to be pushing, encouraging people to get it because we do know at some point we will hit that peak of supply exceeding demand, and we need to continue to push up the demand so we can get as many people vaccinated as possible.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Republican-led Senate endorsed a measure Wednesday that would prohibit the state from mandating face coverings. Senators approved the bill 30-17 but amended it to give local governments, schools and employers the option of requiring masks. Representatives approved the measure 50-44 in February. It now goes back to the House for review of the Senate amendment. Bill sponsor GOP Rep. Jeff Hoverson and others have argued there was no proof that masks work to slow the spread of the coronavirus and questioned the government’s role in mandating them. The state health officer, backed by Gov. Doug Burgum, imposed a mask mandate in November after months of refraining from such an order, hoping to stem a coronavirus surge that had been among the worst in the U.S. and threatened to overwhelm the state’s hospitals. The Republican governor dropped the statewide mask requirement as well as limits on the number of people who gather in restaurants, bars and event venues about two months later, citing a dramatic drop in active COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations due to the coronavirus.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The 2021 Ohio State Fair will not be open to the general public this summer due to public health concerns, officials said Thursday. Instead, the Ohio Expositions Commission, which runs the annual event, announced the fair will focus this year on agricultural and educational competitions for exhibitors and their families and friends. “While we are hopeful that we will soon be on the other side of this pandemic, the reality is that cases of COVID-19 remain high, and we just don’t know how things will look in July,” the announcement said. The commission outlined concerns for public health and the financial perils of hosting a fair under current pandemic safety protocols. “Although vaccination rates are improving significantly each day, Ohio continues to fight the battle against COVID-19,” General Manager Virgil Strickler said in the release. “This decision will not only help to protect the health and safety of Ohioans, it will also protect the long-term financial viability of the fair.” The fair, which opens to limited capacity July 19, usually provides rides, concerts, numerous food vendors and other entertainment. The commission said it plans to return to that regular programming in 2022.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of deaths due to COVID-19 topped 8,000 Thursday in Oklahoma, according to the state health department. The death toll reached 8,023, an increase of 23, and the total number of coronavirus cases rose by 483 to 442,389 since the pandemic began, the Oklahoma State Department of Health said. The rolling average of daily deaths in the state has increased during the past two weeks from 8.9 per day to 245.1, a spike that state epidemiologist Dr. Jared Taylor predicted Tuesday as he said the health department had begun using a new algorithm to confirm some COVID-19 deaths that do not require human review. The rolling average of daily new cases is also rising in the state, from 374.1 daily to 506, after the health department reported about 1,300 additional confirmed cases, most between December and March. Taylor said the additional cases came from one laboratory, which he declined to identify, that thought it was properly reporting cases, but they weren’t recorded in the system the state health department uses to track cases.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Fifteen inmates who contracted the coronavirus while at Multnomah County’s Inverness Jail are suing the county and Sheriff Mike Reese. The inmates say the county and sheriff were negligent by not taking proper safety precautions, denying testing, and mixing infected inmates and guards with those who were healthy in jail dorms, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The county’s response to the pandemic was “woefully inadequate,” the suit alleges, noting that 38% of adults in custody in the Northeast Portland jail tested positive by Feb. 17. The jail houses about 5,126 inmates. Sheriff’s Office spokesman Chris Liedle on Tuesday declined comment on the pending litigation. On March 23, Multnomah County Public Health declared the coronavirus outbreak at Inverness Jail over, calling it one of the “most challenging periods” at the jail. It was the largest and longest outbreak at either of the county’s two detention centers. The plaintiffs are seeking a court order that will require social distancing, proper testing, sanitation and compliance by county jails with federal and state health guidelines issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Oregon Health Authority. It also seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMcKeesport: The state is “winning” the race to contain a recent spike in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations thanks to its accelerating vaccine rollout, the governor said Wednesday, as officials sought to address what they view as the pandemic’s next big challenge: persuading stragglers to get the shot. The Wolf administration is pushing people to get inoculated as soon as possible, saying vaccines will be what end the pandemic, and has so far shown little appetite for new mitigation measures to address the latest surge in infections and hospitalizations. “It’s a race between the vaccine and the upsurge, this fourth upsurge, and I think the vaccine is winning,” Gov. Tom Wolf said Wednesday outside Bethlehem Baptist Church in McKeesport, near Pittsburgh, which will host a community vaccine clinic operated by the Allegheny County Health Department. Pennsylvania this week eased restrictions on bar seating, restaurant capacity and indoor and outdoor events, even though the state – along with New York, Michigan, Florida and New Jersey – accounted for nearly half of the nation’s reported infections over a recent seven-day reporting period. But Wolf said an increasing vaccine supply has put Pennsylvania in a much different position than it was in November. He predicted anyone who wants a shot will be able to receive at least an initial dose by the second week of May.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: There will be high school proms and graduation ceremonies in the state this spring as more residents get vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Dan McKee said Thursday. “We’re making great progress,” the Democratic governor said, noting Rhode Island is ranked among the highest in the country for how many residents are fully inoculated. “That is good news. I know the schools and all the students are looking forward to that.” McKee said he’s even optimistic the state will enjoy a “real” Fourth of July, complete with parades and fireworks displays. State officials project 70% of Rhode Islanders will have at least one dose of vaccine by mid-May, and 70% will be fully vaccinated by mid-June. Proms and graduations will be allowed as part of new coronavirus safety guidelines state officials detailed Thursday during their weekly coronavirus briefing at the Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Providence. Non-catered indoor gatherings such as concerts and commencements are currently limited to 250 people, and similar outdoor gatherings are allowed up to 500 people. After May 15, those limits will double, to 500 people indoors or 1,000 outdoors, state officials said. Dancing will also be allowed at proms, so long as students wear masks and dance only with others at the same table, officials said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Senate has unanimously approved a proposal to prevent employers from mandating COVID-19 vaccines for workers. The resolution advanced by senators Wednesday says employers can’t punish or fire their workers for refusing to get the shots. The measure also says the Department of Health and Environmental Control would not be able to require people who refuse to get vaccinated to quarantine or isolate themselves. The proposal does make some exceptions for hospitals and other employers working with populations who are especially vulnerable to the coronavirus, such as the elderly or people with certain underlying conditions who have a higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19. Employers could still require quarantines for workers exposed to the virus and provide incentives for employees to get the vaccine. Senators have also passed a separate bill that would prevent lawsuits against businesses and other groups by people who contract COVID-19 as long as federal and state health guidelines were being followed.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A year after pools stayed closed because of coronavirus concerns, cities across the state are finding it harder than usual to hire the necessary lifeguards to see them open this summer. In Sioux Falls, pools are set to open May 28, but they’re still in need of more than 50 lifeguards to make sure they’re fully staffed, city officials said. Kelby Mieras, the city’s park operations manager, said they’ve been struggling to hire for the city’s pools as the opening date approaches. Recruiting efforts for the positions often include reaching out to past employees, but after the pandemic forced pool closures, that group has shrunk. As of Wednesday afternoon, Mieras said the city was looking for 54 lifeguards and 32 short-term maintenance positions, who could work on pools, athletic fields and parks. A full staff of lifeguards would be 82 full-time positions, but many positions will end up being part time, with well beyond 100 lifeguards likely on staff. If the city is unable to fill the needed positions, Mieras said, officials may have to adjust scheduling at local pools. Justin Weiland, city administrator for Dell Rapids, reported running into similar issues. Officials advertised the lifeguard openings, but not one person applied, he said. “Not being open last year, that pipeline was disrupted,” Weiland said.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: Knox County families will have more time to decide if they want to do in-person or virtual learning for next school year, Bob Thomas announced Wednesday evening at a school board meeting. He said the state board of education is meeting Monday to discuss virtual programming that would require students to unenroll in their base school and enroll in a separate virtual school. The district is monitoring that discussion and will keep families informed. This could mean virtual learners would be at a separate KCS virtual elementary, middle or high school. Each school would have a capacity of 1,500 students as required by law. Regardless of what the state board of education decides, Knox County will still offer summer learning camps. The deadline to enroll for these camps is April. Knox County Schools has not announced a new enrollment window, district spokeswoman Carly Harrington said. Families were previously told they had to make a decision between April 15 and April 23.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: In a ruling that was divided along party lines, a state appeals court on Thursday dismissed Attorney General Ken Paxton’s challenge to Austin and Travis County pandemic-related orders that placed a curfew on businesses during the New Year’s weekend. The orders, which barred food and beverage service after 10:30 p.m. amid a surge in local COVID-19 cases, were in place for only one night before the Texas Supreme Court blocked enforcement, making the issue moot, the Austin-based 3rd Court of Appeals said in a 2-1 ruling. The court’s lone Republican, Justice Melissa Goodwin, disagreed, arguing that the issue remains live because Austin and Travis County officials continue to “vigorously defend their authority to adopt and enforce the local orders and do not concede that (they) were invalid or unlawful.” The ruling, which can be appealed, thwarted for now Paxton’s hope for a decision affirming Gov. Greg Abbott’s power to issue emergency orders that block local officials from adopting stricter requirements in the name of pandemic safety. Paxton, however, still has a separate appeal pending before the 3rd Court that seeks to block another Austin and Travis County pandemic safety order – this one requiring face coverings in area businesses.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The city will continue its mask mandate after a statewide order is lifted Saturday, the mayor said Wednesday, though the rest of the county decided not to require masks, and the city’s rule may violate a new state law. Democratic Mayor Erin Mendenhall said keeping the mandate will protect residents, many of whom have not yet been vaccinated against COVID-19. “We need to keep doing what has worked: wearing masks,” she said. Keeping the rule also prevents front-line workers from confrontations with customers angry about private mask mandates in stores, said Matt Caputo of Caputo’s Market and Deli, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. Leaders on the Republican-controlled Salt Lake County Council, meanwhile, decided to lift their mandate Saturday along with the rest of the state. Council Chair Steve DeBry cited public health data indicating that many of the most vulnerable residents are vaccinated and that hospitals won’t be stressed beyond capacity. “There’s mask fatigue. There’s COVID fatigue. People want to get back to normal life,” he told the Deseret News. Mendenhall said her decision doesn’t violate a so-called end game law for pandemic restrictions, but its sponsor disagreed. Republican state Rep. Paul Ray said it would be a waste of time to sue the city, but he predicted political fallout.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Health Department is asking people to submit their stories – including original videos, photos or written thoughts – about getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Select submissions will be featured in a television ad campaign, and one entry will be picked at random to receive a $500 cash card. Details can be found on the health department’s website. The state says it’s seeking the submissions to show why getting vaccinated is important. The move comes as Vermont is continuing its gradual reopening as more people get inoculated. Meanwhile, Gov. Phil Scott wants the state to use some of more than $1 billion in federal COVID-19 assistance money to help improve access to broadband internet services and other wireless connectivity. Scott on Tuesday outlined plans for spending some of the funds the state is due to receive through the American Recovery Plan. The governor would also like to spend money for housing, climate change mitigation, water and sewer infrastructure, and additional economic development and recovery from the pandemic. Scott calls his proposal a starting point for discussions with the Legislature about how the money, part of the $1.9 trillion federal COVID-19 rescue plan approved by Congress last month, should be spent.\n\nVirginia\n\nStaunton: Mount Salem Baptist Church will be hosting a COVID-19 vaccination event for the public from 10a.m. to 3p.m. Saturday. The Rev. Dr. Floyd Miles, pastor of Mount Salem Baptist Church, said it is a great idea for the church to be involved, and he’s excited to help out with the vaccination effort. Miles said the pandemic greatly affected his services, and the church had to go virtual, but he can’t wait to have his services in person and see his community again. Miles said a total of 250 vaccination slots were available. He hoped to fill all the appointments and help people get scheduled for their second doses. “It is a great privilege to be able to offer the church because it is time to get our community, our society and our churches to enjoy life back together,” Miles said. Community members who are interested can contact Margaret Lyle at 540-649-6075. She will be taking vaccine registrations until Friday.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The federal government has lowered vaccine supply allotments for the state because of problems at a facility producing Johnson & Johnson vaccine, state health officials said Wednesday. Comments about the decreased supply Wednesday come as state officials prepare to open vaccine eligibility to everyone age 16 and over April 15, The Seattle Times reports. Health officials had expected the state to receive at least 600,000 doses of vaccine through state and federal programs for each week in April, but now Washington expects deliveries of at least 500,000 doses next week. The federal government maintains the expected supply boost will come, but the timeline is not yet clear. “The three-week forecast is a little bit lower than we hoped for,” said SheAnne Allen, the COVID-19 vaccine director for the Washington State Department of Health. “These are estimates; they do change.” About 15 million doses were ruined after employees for a contract manufacturer to J&J mixed ingredients incorrectly. The problem was discovered before any bad doses were shipped. With more people becoming eligible, State Health Secretary Dr. Umair Shah said he hoped vaccine supply would rise in May, if not later in April, “so we can match that demand.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nInwood: Utilizing life skills learned in their career and technical education program, Musselman High School’s culinary students prepared meals for first responders working local vaccination clinics. Rachel Nauman, the baking and pastry teacher for the career and technical education program, said COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on the world, and her course was no different, as she and her students have spent the past several months trying to find a balance between hands-on learning and safety precautions. “It’s put a different spin on the class, but it’s been a good spin,” Nauman said. “This has allowed us to focus on the minor details, to force the students to do more in-depth thinking on what they are doing and what they are serving.” With the goal of service and hospitality in mind, Nauman said she and her students were more than up to the challenge when the school’s principal suggested the students cook and serve meals to Berkeley County first responders. Nauman said she and her students began preparing a menu they felt would be filling yet manageable and transportable, ultimately deciding to serve homemade BLT sandwiches and pasta salad and chocolate caramel brownies alongside packaged chips and drinks.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state recorded its highest number of new coronavirus cases in two months Thursday, leading to new warnings from health officials about the growing spread of more contagious variants and a renewed call for everyone to be vaccinated as soon as possible. The seven-day average of new cases was twice as high as a month ago. “There’s a danger of this pandemic getting out of control,” said Dr. Ryan Westergaard, the state’s chief medical officer. State health officials urged people not only to get vaccinated but also to continue wearing masks, frequently washing hands and maintaining social distance to slow the virus’s spread. “We are not ready to go back to life pre-COVID,” said Julie Willems Van Dijk, deputy secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. “We are not ready for huge mass gatherings yet. We need to be cautious as we move forward.” The Wisconsin Supreme Court last week repealed the statewide mask mandate, but health officials stressed Thursday that face coverings should still be worn even if not required by local ordinances. “The worst thing in the world we can do right now is say no mandate, no mask,” Willems Van Dijk said. Westergaard saying not wearing masks now, just because there is no order, would be a “grave mistake.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The outdoor rodeo Cheyenne Frontier Days will continue as planned this year after being forced to cancel last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon and Cheyenne Mayor Patrick Collins joined Cheyenne Frontier Days CEO Tom Hirsig on Wednesday during a news conference to make the official announcement, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Frontier Days is a rodeo and western festival that draws about 200,000 attendees each July. Its website calls it the world’s largest outdoor rodeo, featuring competing professionals, behind-the-chutes tours, trick riding, a wild-horse race and other activities. Hirsig said the event will take place at maximum capacity and without a mask requirement but will feature a new health and safety protocol focusing on increased sanitization, digital ticketing, cashless payment options and a clear bag policy. The measures are subject to change based on COVID-19 infection rates. Guests are encouraged to cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing with sleeves or tissues followed by immediate hand-washing. People feeling sick or showing symptoms are urged to remain home.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/12/operation-santa-missing-jesus-future-rhino-news-around-states/40804817/", "title": "Operation Santa, missing Jesus: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: For many children, coming back after the Christmas break with a new pair means a lot. “Shoes with the kids means everything. It naturally builds self-esteem,” says Mac “Dukie” Hopkins, an artist manager and event promoter. That’s why he’s hosting his fourth Christmas shoe drive, hoping to give at least 100 new pairs of shoes to children in need through the Brantwood Children’s Home. A fixture in Montgomery’s rap scene since the early 2000s, Hopkins has used those connections in years past to bring in donations. In 2015, the event’s first year, he called on local artists to compete against local producers in a basketball game. Those who came to watch brought shoes as their ticket payment. That first year brought in nearly 100 pairs, and Hopkins says it’s grown each year since. This year’s drive runs through Dec. 20.\n\nAlaska\n\nNapakiak: This town is quickly losing land to the Kuskokwim River because of erosion that’s forcing everyone to move farther inland – this year alone, it’s lost more than 100 feet of shoreline. But for one day this month, the Alaska National Guard gave folks a reason to smile, thanks to its “Operation Santa Claus” program. Now in its 63rd year, Operation Santa Claus has become a rarity among National Guard units. Defense officials have shut down the program everywhere but Alaska, where the mission survives because the state is so large and some communities so remote. The program started in 1956 when the residents of St. Mary’s, Alaska, had no money to buy children Christmas presents after flooding severely impacted hunting and fishing. Since then, Guard members try to visit at least two rural communities a year, delivering Christmas gifts and other needed supplies.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A state commission unanimously approved a partnership Tuesday between the University of Arizona and Tucson Electric Power to run the campus primarily on renewable energy. The five members of the Arizona Corporation Commission, which regulates public utilities, voted for the project at a public meeting in Phoenix. The proposal would make the school the largest research university nationwide with an initiative to offset greenhouse gas emissions, according to the UA. Tucson Electric Power will provide clean energy to the school for the next 20 years via a wind farm in New Mexico and a solar-power storage system just outside Tucson. Construction on the facilities has not begun, but both are expected to be operational sometime next year.\n\nArkansas\n\nConway: A police officer who is on military leave inadvertently shot an 18-year-old man when his gun accidentally discharged, authorities said. The officer was preparing to clean a gun when it discharged Friday, striking the teenager, Conway Police Department spokeswoman LaTresha Woodruff said. Authorities said the teen’s injuries aren’t life-threatening. The officer’s name has not been released. Arkansas State Police spokesman Bill Sadler told the Log Cabin Democrat that the 18-year-old was struck once by gunfire. An investigative file will be forwarded to prosecutors to determine whether any charges will be filed, Sadler said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A white rhino born last month at San Diego Zoo Safari Park has been named Future for what the calf represents to rhino conservation worldwide, officials say. The baby is bonding with her mother and frolicking in a maternity yard left wet by recent storms. “Future’s new favorite thing is mud,” zookeeper Marco Zeno says. “She sees a puddle, and she wants to roll in it!” Future is the 100th southern white rhino to be born at the park and the second conceived through artificial insemination. The first, Edward, was born to a different mother in July. The zoo births using frozen sperm are part of efforts to develop knowledge needed to save a subspecies called the northern white rhino, officials say. Only two remain, and both are female. Several other rhino species also are being pushed toward extinction. Future was born Nov. 21 to an 11-year-old mother named Amani.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The city is anticipating the arrival of the new U.S. Space Force under a defense policy bill making its way through Congress. The Gazette reports the bill also earmarks $322 million for construction at military bases in the city. The Space Force will take over from the existing Air Force Space Command as the newest armed forces branch charged with defending satellites and conducting other military initiatives in space. The Space Force is a longtime priority of President Donald Trump. Republican Congressman Doug Lamborn of Colorado Springs told the Gazette that the National Defense Authorization Act will make the city “the center of military space.” The Space Force, the first new U.S. military branch since the Air Force was created in 1947, will consist of troops attached to Air Force Space Command. The command, in turn, supervises space-related operations of all service branches.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont and Democratic legislative leaders are planning to vote early next month on a proposal to upgrade the state’s infrastructure. The Democratic governor and the lawmakers announced Tuesday that they have agreed to convene a special session of the General Assembly to vote on the transportation plan and a major state bonding bill. There had been expectations of a possible vote next week on the transportation proposal, which will likely include a dozen bridge tolls for just trucks. Lawmakers are still expected to return to the state Capitol next week. Both the House and Senate have been advised there will be another special session Dec. 18. The General Assembly is expected to vote on a settlement Lamont’s administration recently reached with the Connecticut Hospital Association over a state tax and legislation that would settle a dispute over how certain restaurant workers are paid.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: The director of a state agency that oversees food stamp benefits and determines Medicaid eligibility has been placed on administrative leave with pay, an official says. Delaware Department of Human Resources spokeswoman Karen Smith confirmed the information about Ray Fitzgerald, director of the Division of Social Services, but did not give a reason for the placement, citing the department’s policy not to discuss personnel matters. Fitzgerald has been with the state Department of Health and Social Services since 2006, according to his LinkedIn profile. He became director of the social services division in 2015. Fitzgerald could not be immediately reached for comment about being placed on leave.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A man attacked two guards at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception on Tuesday morning, authorities said. A domestic dispute was apparently behind the attack at what’s believed to be the largest Roman Catholic church in North America, assistant police Chief Jeffery Carroll told news outlets. Police said Dorsey Lee Mack III, 48, first struck a female guard with a car, pinning her against another vehicle, before crashing into her again. A male guard then tried to intervene and was chased by the man through the Basilica and into the church’s crypt, where the guard was stabbed several times, church rector Monsignor Walter Rossi told The Washington Post. He said there appears to be no other relation to the shrine other than that the guards worked there. The man fled to an area home, where he barricaded himself inside for about two hours.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The University of Central Florida on Tuesday said it was partnering with the Florida state parks system to open a research facility in a first-of-its-kind agreement. UCF officials said they plan to take over a former restaurant building in Econfina River State Park in rural Taylor County and convert it into a research facility. The site will be about an hour’s drive southeast of Tallahassee. UCF’s National Center for Integrated Coastal Research will lead the new center. The partnership with the Florida Park Service will allow anthropology students to dig up precolonial sites. Civil engineering students will be able to study storm surge, and biology students can examine the park’s habitats, UCF officials said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and its parent corporation aren’t happy with how one of their late reporters is portrayed in the upcoming film “Richard Jewell,” which depicts Kathy Scruggs as using sex to get information from sources. A law firm sent a letter Monday on behalf of the companies to film leadership, including director Clint Eastwood, screenwriter Bill Ray, Warner Bros. and others, the newspaper reports. It requests that they issue a public statement acknowledging characters and events were dramatized. They also want the disclaimer prominently featured in the film, which hits theaters Friday. The film tells the story of the late Richard Jewell, a security guard who saved countless people from the 1996 bombing at the Atlanta Olympics. The newspaper and Scruggs were the first to report that the FBI considered Jewell a suspect, it says. Jewell was cleared months later.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Visitor entrance fees at Haleakala National Park on Maui will increase on New Year’s Day, the National Park Service says. Park officials say the rate increase will begin Jan. 1, The Maui News reports. A $5 increase will raise the entrance fee to $30 per vehicle and $25 per motorcycle, officials say. There will also be a $3 increase for bicycle riders and pedestrians to $15 per person. The cost of a Tri-Park Pass will increase from $50 to $55. The annual pass allows visitors unlimited entry to the state’s fee-collecting parks including Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Haleakala National Park and Puuhonua o Hanaunau National Historical Park. Haleakala receives more than a million visitors each year, and its fees are increasing along with those at other U.S. national parks to conduct infrastructure improvements, the park service says.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Prison officials have changed their administrative rules to ensure secrecy surrounding the source of the state’s lethal injection drugs. Like previous versions, the rule updated earlier this year forbids the Idaho Department of Correction from disclosing “under any circumstance” information that department director Josh Tewalt determines could jeopardize the department’s ability to carry out an execution. But this version also specifically forbids the release of information that could potentially identify both past and future suppliers of lethal injection drugs. The rule doesn’t include allowances for court orders. That could complicate an appeal in a lawsuit against the department from a University of Idaho professor who is seeking access to lethal injection records. A state judge has ordered the state to turn over the documents, but prison officials have appealed, and the state Supreme Court is expected to hear the case next year.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s interim police superintendent is discontinuing a so-called merit promotion system that rank-and-file cops have long complained rewards officers for who they know and not what skills they have to do the job. In a letter to the 13,400-member department obtained by the Chicago Tribune, Interim Superintendent Charlie Beck said Tuesday that he’s heard many officers have been “dissatisfied and discouraged” by the process that allows promotions to the ranks of detective, sergeant and lieutenant regardless of exam scores. Beck wrote that he made the decision after consulting with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Fraternal Order of Police President Kevin Graham. Beck said he will recommend to whomever Lightfoot selects as the next permanent superintendent in 2020 that the merit promotion system be discontinued and that promotional exams be given every two years.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Up to 20 low- and middle-income homes in the city could be running on solar power free of charge by the end of next year with the help of a new city initiative, the first of its kind in the Midwest. Just months after Indianapolis and Hamilton County formed solar power co-ops to make solar energy more available to homeowners, the city of Indianapolis announced another co-op plan – this one aimed specifically at providing solar power to financially burdened residents. Like the co-ops announced this year, the plan is the result of a partnership with Solar United Neighbors, a national nonprofit that establishes similar co-ops and promotes solar power. Installing solar panels for a home can $5,000 to $20,000, depending on the home, pushing it out of reach of most low- and middle-income homeowners who already spend a higher proportion of their income on energy.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A state-run family planning program that excludes Planned Parenthood from accessing funds has seen a nearly 75% drop in the number of people using its services since 2017, according to a new agency report. The 11-page report shows 5,857 people utilized services through the program in the calendar year 2017. The number using services under the program as of December 2018 was 1,502. The program is supposed to help poor and moderate-income Iowans obtain reproductive services like contraception and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. The state-run family planning program was launched in July 2017, so the data from that year includes services provided under a federally funded program that allowed Planned Parenthood to seek reimbursement for providing services.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The state Department of Agriculture is offering stressed farmers a place to find support and resources. A new website, kansasagstress.org, comes at a time when the number of farmer suicides is rising across the nation. The website is a collaboration among the state and several other agriculture partners. Kansas Ag Stress Resources includes a “Family Support” tab that provides resources to different family members. The main page lists the Kansas Suicide Prevention Line and the Crisis Text Line. Agriculture Secretary Mike Beam said in a news release that the website is intended to support those involved in Kansas agriculture through times of emotional of financial stress. Gov. Laura Kelly said the increase in suicide rates for farmer and ranchers is alarming, and the state wants to provide them and their loved ones with support and alternatives to suicide.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A national group that focuses on issues common to Muslims and Jews in the U.S. has launched a chapter in Louisville. The Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council held an event at the Muhammed Ali Center over the weekend in Louisville to launch its new chapter. The group says its national board is composed of 45 civil, religious and business leaders who “advocate for domestic policy issues of common concern.” Among the issues is combating discrimination against religious minorities. Lonnie Ali, widow of Muhammad Ali, says she is looking forward to being an active member of the Louisville-based council. “This is the work my husband would want me to do,” she said. The group has regional chapters in 10 other cities.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: As the state broadens its efforts to combat hepatitis C in hopes of largely eliminating the deadly viral infection, the health department announced Tuesday that 10 Walmart locations around the state will offer free screenings for the infectious, liver-damaging disease. Walmart will offer the no-cost hepatitis C screenings every Wednesday from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. until Feb. 1 at the pharmacies in stores in Vivian, Ville Platte, New Iberia, Raceland, Oak Grove, Amite, Monroe, Denham Springs, Opelousas and Morgan City. “We are trying to make it as easy as possible for people to get screened for this virus and then get treated,” Health Secretary Rebekah Gee says. The screenings involve a finger-stick test. If the testing detects the presence of hepatitis C virus antibodies, patients will be referred to their primary care doctors or a local health care provider.\n\nMaine\n\nJonesport: Fishing regulators are implementing emergency closures in the state’s scallop harvesting industry for the first time this season. Maine scallop fishing takes place every winter, and the state uses emergency closures to protect the valuable shellfish against overfishing. The Maine Department of Marine Resources says it has closed Moosabec Reach, an area off Jonesport in Down East Maine. The closure went into effect Sunday. Scallops are among the most profitable marine resources in Maine. However, the fishery dipped in both volume and value last year. Fishermen harvested a little more than 560,000 pounds of scallop meat in 2018 after collecting more than 800,000 pounds in 2017. The price per pound to fishermen also fell $1.20, to $10.54.\n\nMaryland\n\nUpper Marlboro: Racist memes poisoned the mind of a white man who fatally stabbed a black college student at a bus stop on the University of Maryland’s campus after a night of drinking, a prosecutor told jurors Wednesday. Sean Urbanski doesn’t deny he stabbed Richard Collins III that night in May 2017, but one of his lawyers says there is no evidence race was a motive for the killing. “They have used race to divide this community,” defense attorney William Brennan said of prosecutors during the trial’s opening statements. Urbanski, now 24, is charged with first-degree murder and a hate crime. Urbanski had saved at least six photographs of racist memes on his cellphone and liked a Facebook group called “Alt-Reich: Nation,” according to prosecutors. “These images were in his phone, in his mind every day. It’s poison,” said deputy state’s attorney Jason Abbott.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nHolyoke: A blue wheelchair van once used to transport a judge with ALS to work and doctor’s appointments has been donated to a police chief battling the same condition. Rose Boyle, the wife of late Springfield District Court Judge William Boyle, turned over the keys to the van to Lee Police Chief Jeffrey Roosa during a meeting Tuesday of the Western Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association, according to Masslive.com. Roosa has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease, the same condition that claimed Boyle’s life in September. Roosa, 46, was diagnosed with the disease in 2017. He continues to work, drives his car some, and uses a wheelchair and a cane to get around. He knows eventually he will need the van. Roosa thanked the Boyle family and said the gift will help defray costs for his family as he continues to fight the disease.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Internet gaming and sports betting are soon expected to be legal in the state after the Legislature sent a package of bills to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday, on the last session day of the year. The bills, expected to be signed by Whitmer, will allow existing licensed casinos to offer poker, blackjack, slots and other casino-style games over the internet. The legislation also will allow those casinos to set up theaters to accept wagers on live sporting events and accept sports bets online. “It’s been a long journey to move sports betting and casino-style gaming into a regulated, safe and modern environment – but the end is in sight, and with it a great opportunity for Michigan will begin,” said state Rep. Brandt Iden, R-Oshtemo Township, a major sponsor of the package.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: A baby Jesus statue has been missing from a nativity scene downtown for a year. The manger is currently filled by a swaddled toy doll. The statue was stolen last December. The Stearns County History Museum has owned the nativity scene since 1978 and has had it on display near U.S. Bank during the holidays since 1988. “We never did recover the original baby Jesus,” museum executive director Carie Essig says. The museum is looking for a more permanent replacement for the temporary baby Jesus. Local schools raised money to buy the nativity in 1944 and donated it to the city of St. Cloud. The museum will either replace the figure with a similar piece from the era or will have something new cast, Essig says.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Legislative leaders are recommending the state spend slightly less during the coming year than the current year. Members of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee met Wednesday and adopted a broad outline for a nearly $6.3 billion budget for the year that begins July 1. That would be nearly $94 million less than the state is set to spend in the current year, about a 1.5% decrease. The plan recommends some spending hikes. The Department of Public Safety would receive an additional $4.4 million for new state troopers and another $1 million for pay raises for law enforcement officers. The state would spend an additional $18.4 million to cover the current year’s shortfall for an underfunded teacher pay raise plan. Overall spending for elementary and secondary education would be less than 1% higher. Spending for community colleges would decrease about 3.6% and about 2.6% for universities.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The Kansas City Zoo is now home for eight fluffy new macaroni penguin chicks. Eggs for the chicks were flown in from SeaWorld San Diego and hatched in incubators in Kansas City, the zoo announced Tuesday. It is the first time in the zoo’s 110-year history that it has had this species of penguin. Zookeepers are raising the chicks by hand, which includes giving each of them up to six feedings a day of a mixture of herring, krill and vitamins. The food is working, as the chicks continue to gain weight, the zoo said. They averaged only 92 grams at birth but are gaining 10% to 15% of their body weight every day. They’ll eventually grow to be about 10 pounds and 2 feet tall. The chicks are expected to go on exhibit at the zoo in the next few weeks. Macaroni penguins are listed as vulnerable to extinction. They get their name from the the bright yellow crest of feathers above their eyes.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A council at the University of Montana has recommended the removal of a swastika-like tile arrangement on the walls of a university hall. The tiles show a mirror-image swastika called an aristika designed within Corbin Hall in the 1920s, when swastikas were not yet adopted as a symbol by the Nazis, university officials say. After months of calls for the tiles to be taken down amid the image’s negative connotation, the university’s Diversity Advisory Council voted Tuesday to recommended the tiles be removed, archived and replaced. The council will send the proposal to President Seth Bodnar. The student and faculty senates passed resolutions this fall for the tiles to be removed. Some professors have expressed concerns about letting the Nazi use of a symbol overshadow its more positive connotation in other cultures and recommended installing a plaque explaining the symbol’s meaning.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The school board has scheduled a special election Feb. 11 so voters can decide whether to issue $290 million in bonds to build two more high schools, an elementary and other facilities. The board voted unanimously Tuesday for the bond resolution and authorized district officials to buy two parcels for the high schools. One will be in northwest Lincoln, the other in southeast Lincoln. If the bond issue were to pass, the northwest high school would open in 2022 and the other in 2023. The Lancaster County election commissioner will decide whether the election will be conducted solely through the mail or by traditional balloting.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A conservative advocacy group wants quick action from a judge to block a statewide red flag gun law allowing firearms to be taken from people deemed to be a threat to themselves or others. The group NevadansCAN is seeking an injunction against the law that is set to go into effect Jan. 2 amid a “Second Amendment sanctuary” drive in several rural counties where sheriffs have vowed not to enforce the law. Red flag laws are designed to prevent gun violence by allowing weapons to be confiscated after a judge reviews an application by police or family members about a person’s potentially threatening behavior. “It’s more than the Second Amendment. It’s an infringement on your right to due process of law,” said Tina Trenner, of Pahrump, a radio show host in Las Vegas and spokeswoman for the Henderson-based citizen action network.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A school board has voted to remove a Native American mascot from certain school logos after facing controversy. Merrimack Valley High School held a meeting on the fate of the school’s logo, and the board voted to remove the controversial mascot from gym banners, WMUR reports. The vote came Monday after those against the mascot’s use asked the school board to permanently remove it. “Our headdresses are very sacred to us. Each feather is earned. You have it on the floor as a mockery,” Andover resident Amy Moriarty said. The board decided the mascot will remain in the school’s hall of fame as well as outside banners for one month every school year. Board members also voted to create a history room that would include Native American school artifacts and asked curriculum to add content in the school education on local indigenous history.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nUpper Saddle River: A deer seen wandering around town with its head stuck in a plastic pumpkin has been rescued, police said. The borough of Upper Saddle River posted on Facebook late Tuesday morning that a deer seen wandering around with part of its head, including its mouth, stuck inside a plastic pumpkin had been found, and the pumpkin had been removed. The pumpkin is the kind typically used for trick-or-treating at Halloween. A short time before, Upper Saddle River published a post asking for tips after people reported seeing the deer. The borough thanked animal control and the New Jersey Division of Fish & Wildlife.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A public hearing has been delayed on a petition to open up the state’s medical marijuana program to ailing pets. New Mexico’s medical cannabis advisory board declined to hear the proposal Tuesday because a quorum of board members was not in attendance or available by phone. Chairwoman Laura Brown was the only board member to attend the meeting in person and apologized when several agenda items were postponed for at least 30 days. An anonymous petition would allow marijuana prescriptions for dogs with epilepsy. The petitioner contends that authorizing cannabis for animals would minimize the danger of animal abuse by regulating the use of medical marijuana with pets and provide new treatment tools to veterinarians. No state has expressly authorized medical pot for pets.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The governor says he’s put state police in charge of park police at a time of soaring attendance at state parks. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo says the change will make it easier to deploy state resources to parks visited by 74 million people a year. Cuomo’s memorandum waives age restrictions. About 270 park police officers can become troopers if they apply and meet training requirements including a background investigation. Officers who qualify to become troopers would then attend a shortened academy. Such park officers can also remain in their current titles. The governor says executive staff members will oversee the transition over the next six months. The Albany Times Union reports the park police officers’ union hopes the change will result in better disability and retirement benefits.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nShelby: Barrels of raw pork shoulder were riding fat in a tractor-trailer pulled over by deputies. Approximately $3 million in cash was recovered from the barrels Saturday, the Cleveland County Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post Tuesday. The driver of the tractor-trailer was accused of failing to maintain his lane and impeding the flow of traffic on Interstate 85. Deputies became suspicious of the truck when a K-9 alerted them to the trailer, the post says. Deputies searched ut and discovered the cash wrapped in plastic in the barrels. The money is believed to have been obtained from drug sales throughout the region and was headed to Mexico, Sheriff Alan Norman said. “It’s one of the largest U.S. currency seizures in Cleveland County history,” Norman told The Shelby Star.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An anti-abortion group has filed a brief in defense of a state law that requires doctors to inform women they can reverse the procedure when it is carried out with medication, even though the science behind that claim is disputed. Heartbeat International Inc. and its attorneys from Alliance Defending Freedom filed the brief in federal court Tuesday. “We want to make sure women are able to know all the facts before they abort a child,” said Kevin Theriot, an attorney for the group. North Dakota is among eight states that have passed or amended laws to require doctors to tell women undergoing medication-induced abortions that they can still have a live birth after the procedure. The law that was passed this year by the state’s Republican-led Legislature and signed by GOP Gov. Doug Burgum is on hold pending a federal lawsuit.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Voting-rights advocates have urged both the state’s top lawyer and the elections chief to do more to assure that immigrants understand the voting process, after more than 350 apparent noncitizens were referred for investigation last week. A coalition of 11 groups raised their concerns in a letter to Attorney General Dave Yost and Secretary of State Frank LaRose, both Republicans, on Tuesday. Groups including the A. Philip Randolph Institute, the Ohio arms of the League of Women Voters, ACLU and Common Cause, and CAIR-Columbus said that publicly announcing investigations into potential voter irregularities involving immigrant communities is harmful. They said the probes rarely turn up serious offenses or intentional fraud, but those results are hardly ever shared with the public.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A civil rights group has filed a federal class-action lawsuit against court officials in central Oklahoma, alleging a county’s bail system unconstitutionally discriminates against poor and disabled people. The American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma filed the suit late Tuesday in federal court in Oklahoma City on behalf of six inmates currently being held in the Canadian County jail. The lawsuit alleges that the county’s bail system routinely keeps poor people in jail before a trial, not because they are a flight risk or a danger to society but only because they can’t afford to pay bail. The suit also alleges that inmates aren’t provided access to counsel when bail is set, that hearings are taking place in private, and that the system unconstitutionally discriminates against people with disabilities.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The City Council has agreed to spend up to $213,000 to open 140 warming shelter beds at two local churches. Warming shelter openings currently are driven by freezing temperatures. But under a proposed deal between the city, nonprofit and church representatives, the two shelters would remain open every night from Jan. 1 to March 31. Representatives from Church at the Park and Salem First Presbyterian Church still need to OK the deal. Salem First Presbyterian Church’s Pastor Del Burnett called the idea “marvelous” and the deadline “ridiculous.” Burnett said to his knowledge, his church was not consulted on the proposal ahead of time. The warming-shelter idea marks the latest twist as city leaders try to figure out where people experiencing homelessness should go after a public camping ban goes into effect Dec. 16.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Faculty at state universities will go without a pay raise this year but see their salaries climb at least 12% over the next three years. The four-year contract approved Wednesday covers about 5,000 professors and instructors at 14 schools. Spokesman David Pidgeon of the state System of Higher Education says the raises are expected to cost about $22 million. A similar deal has been reached with about 700 other employees who work in student services. The agreement comes three years after prolonged contract talks between the educators’ association and the state led to a three-day faculty strike.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state is offering $5 million in grants for projects that protect publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities from storm surge, winds and other natural hazards. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management and Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank announced the availability of matching grants for resilience projects last week. DEM Director Janet Coit says strengthening the facilities’ resilience is critically important, due to the changing climate that will continue to bring more intense storms and increased rainfall. Rhode Island has 19 major facilities that treat about 120 million gallons of wastewater daily. The department says many are at risk of inundation because they’re at low elevations to take advantage of gravity. Voters approved a green economy and clean water bond last year, which will fund the grants. The deadline is Jan. 30.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Mobs of kangaroos can roam largely unrestricted in the state, where laws don’t regulate ownership of the creatures. Most other states have taken a harder stance on the chaotic marsupials and either require permits or ban ownership outright, The Post and Courier reports. South Carolina has regulations on many native wildlife but little when it comes to out-of-state animals. Several laws tightening restrictions have passed over the years, including one that went into effect last year that bans the ownership of large wild cats, non-native bears and great apes. The Department of Natural Resources doesn’t even keep a list of private individuals who own wild or exotic animals, though it did track black bear ownership as recently as 2006, when about 30 owners were listed.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A Minnehaha County disaster recovery center has opened in the city to assist survivors of severe storms, flooding and tornadoes in September, according to a news release. State officials and Federal Emergency Management Agency representatives have opened the center at Southeast Technical Institute in the Ed Wood Trade and Industry Center. Hours of operation are Monday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Representatives from the state, FEMA, U.S. Small Business Administration and other organizations will staff the centers to explain available assistance programs and help connect survivors with resources that best match their recovery needs. FEMA hazard mitigation specialists will also be available to provide advice on rebuilding to avoid damage from future disasters. Homeowners, renters and businesses can register for disaster assistance before visiting a recovery center.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Singer Bettye LaVette, piano man Eddie Boyd and 1920s star Victoria Spivey are among the performers named to the Blues Hall of Fame this year. Based in Memphis, the hall honors singers, musicians, producers, songwriters, educators and pieces of music that have made significant contributions to the genre. The hall is also inducting two harmonica players this year – Billy Branch and Georgie “Harmonica” Smith, The Blues Foundation said in a news release Tuesday. Also on the list are singer and musician Syl Johnson and producer Ralph Peer, who recorded both country and blues musicians. The Howlin Wolf compilation “The Chess Box” is the only album inducted this year. Blues singles that made the cut include “3 O’Clock Blues,” by B.B. King, “Trouble in Mind,” by Bertha “Chippie” Hill, and Arthur “Big Boy” Crudup’s “That’s All Right (Mama),” Elvis Presley’s first recording at Sun Studio in Memphis in 1954.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A new judge will consider if a hospital can take a 10-month-old girl off life support despite her family’s opposition after the impartiality of the previous judge was questioned. A temporary restraining order stopping Cook Children’s Medical Center in Fort Worth from removing life-sustaining treatment for Tinslee Lewis was set to expire Tuesday. But after the removal last week of Tarrant County Juvenile Court Judge Alex Kim, a new hearing on the family’s request for a temporary injunction will now be held Thursday in Fort Worth. Cook Children’s spokeswoman Wini King said the situation is “hard all the way around.” “We would love nothing more than to be able to make her better and walk her out of here. … But there comes a point, there comes a time when we have to say: We can’t do any more. It’s not making it any better.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A legislative task force has voted to recommend a tax reform plan to the Legislature that would reduce state taxes by $160 million, double the amount in a previous proposal, officials said. The Tax Restructuring and Equalization Task Force met Monday ahead of a possible special session this week where lawmakers could address a sweeping change to the state tax code, task force members said. The latest version of the plan would decrease state income taxes by $635.5 million, while elimination of certain exemptions, new taxes and tax hikes would generate $475.5 million in new revenue, officials said. The proposal includes a food tax hike from 1.75% to the full 4.85% state sales tax rate generating $250 million by itself, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: About 470 miles of snowmobile trails in the Green Mountain National Forest are going to be ready for the opening of the 2019-2020 snowmobile season, National Forest officials said. Weather and snow conditions permitting, nearly 5,000 miles of trails in the national forest and throughout Vermont will be opening Monday and running through April 15. “We are concerned about user safety,” said John Sinclair, Forest Supervisor for the Green Mountain and Finger Lakes National Forests. “Patrols which are aimed at enforcing rules and regulations, monitoring trail conditions and providing visitor information will occur throughout the Forest.” Due to heavy snow last month in parts of southern Vermont, forest service employees and snowmobile clubs have been working to clear trees and other debris from the trails.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: A private Christian university founded by Pat Robertson will remain accredited for another 10 years. Regent University said in a statement Wednesday that its accreditation was reaffirmed by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. The commission oversees 11 states. Regent is based in Virginia Beach and has nearly doubled its student population to more than 10,000 in the past five years. The school was founded in 1978 and first received accreditation in 1984. Robertson is well-known as a religious broadcaster who founded the Christian Broadcasting Network and for hosting the television show The 700 Club. Gerson Moreno-Riano, executive vice president for academic affairs, said in a statement that Regent will serve for years to come as a destination for “students preparing to become Christian leaders to change the world.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan says the city will invest a record $110 million into affordable housing this year. The Seattle Times reports the funding will go toward the construction and redevelopment of 1,944 new units across the city. Durkan stressed the urgent need for affordable housing in a time of great economic growth and displacement. “Look, we know that our city has grown so rapidly, and so many people have been pushed out of the community instantly, that I think it really threatens who we are as a city,” Durkan said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The House of Delegates will reconvene this month to continue the second special legislative session, officials say. Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw issued a call for the chamber to meet Monday at noon. A spokesman for the House said lawmakers will take up a bill to extend a tourism tax credit to 2025. The Senate has already passed the measure. Lawmakers returned to the Capitol last month for their second special session of the year to take up the tax credit bill, a proposal to stop expunging DUI convictions and a measure to allow the state to pay off a road bond. The DUI bill and the road bond bill quickly passed and were signed into law by Republican Gov. Jim Justice.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state will no longer categorically deny Medicaid coverage for medically necessary gender-confirming surgery, a practice a federal judge found violated patients’ civil rights and federal health care law. Lawyers for transgender residents who sued last year announced a settlement Tuesday after the deadline had passed for the state to appeal last month’s final judgment in the class-action case. U.S. District Judge William Conley, of Madison, noted the “consensus within the medical profession (is) that gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition, which if left untreated or inadequately treated can cause adverse symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, serious mental distress, self-harm, and suicidal ideation.” Four named plaintiffs will share about $840,000 in damages, and the state will pay about $1.35 million in legal fees to three law firms who handled their case.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state faces more tough times ahead but isn’t headed off a fiscal cliff, offering time for a thoughtful approach to delivering government services to citizens without running up deficits, Gov. Mark Gordon told lawmakers in outlining his first state budget this week. Gordon cautioned, however, that an upcoming revenue forecast in January may be less optimistic than one in October, shortly before he released his $3.1 billion biennial budget proposal for 2021-2022. “Navigating for these challenging times will require sacrifice, care and thought,” Gordon, who took office in January, told the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee. The powerful committee met in its traditional conference room on the third floor of the Capitol for the first time after four years of renovations to the over 130-year-old sandstone structure.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/12"}]}

Origin, meaning of holy day", "text": "Easter is just a hop around the corner – with millions of people around the world are preparing to celebrate this Sunday.\n\nThe Christian holiday commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. While traditions and religious rituals for Easter vary among denominations and across the globe, many Christians observe the holiday through church services and prayer.\n\nMeanwhile, others may also be anticipating a visit from a magical Easter Bunny – or preparing for a weekend full of colorful eggs, baskets of chocolate and more.\n\nHere are some key facts about the history of Easter and how people commemorate the day.\n\nMoney:Make like the Easter bunny and hop on these deals for eggs, candy, and more stuffers\n\nPolitics:What to know about annual White House Easter Egg Roll, ticket lottery\n\nWhat is the history of Easter?\n\nEaster commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ, three days after he was crucified by Romans around 30 A.D.\n\n\"Easter's roots (date back to) a day in the week in which Christ rose from the dead. It would have been the first day of the week after the Jewish Sabbath, which was Saturday,\" Timothy P. O’Malley, a faculty member at the University of Notre Dame's McGrath Institute for Church Life, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Early Christians celebrated, therefore, every Sunday like it was Easter. There was no annual commemoration of Easter early on, but by the second and third centuries, there comes to be an annual celebration of Easter,\" O'Malley continued, adding that the celebration later grew.\n\nEaster marks the last day of the Holy Week, which consists of several days that each carry their own significance. These include:\n\nPalm Sunday: commemorating when Jesus entered Jerusalem\n\nHoly Thursday: commemorating the Last Supper and washing of feet\n\nGood Friday: commemorating Jesus' crucifixion and death\n\nEaster Sunday: commemorating the resurrection of Jesus\n\nPhotos:Holy week celebrated by Christians around the world\n\nEaster mass is one of the longest sessions of the Catholic mass. For some, the Easter Vigil begins after sunset on Saturday night or early Sunday morning into the sunrise of Easter. With more readings, songs and rituals, mass can be anywhere from two to three hours.\n\nSome Christian churches, such as Catholic and Orthodox churches, also celebrate the Octave of Easter – an eight-day period that begins on Easter Sunday as \"the formal celebration of the feast of Easter,\" O'Malley says.\n\nWhy does the date of Easter change each year?\n\nThe date of Easter hops around each year – typically between March 22 and April 25. In short, the holiday falls on the first Sunday after the full Moon on or following the spring equinox.\n\nWestern Christianity uses the Gregorian calendar. In 2023, Easter falls on April 9.\n\nIn Eastern Orthodox Christianity, however, the date of Easter differs. This year, it falls on April 16.\n\nWhen is Easter 2023?

What you need to know about the Jewish holiday\n\nHow did the Easter Bunny and eggs become symbols of the holiday?\n\nBeyond religious rituals, commercial celebrations of Easter have popularized the holiday's symbols of the eggs, chicks and, of course, the Easter Bunny.\n\nThese symbols have religious roots, experts say. In the northern hemisphere, where Easter occurs in spring, images of new life associated with the season are linked to the holiday, O’Malley says.\n\nThe bunnies, chicks and eggs are signs \"new life and fertility around the spring time,\" O'Malley says.\n\nAccording to History.com, Easter eggs are also \"said to represent Jesus’ emergence from the tomb and resurrection.\"\n\nThe practice of dyeing eggs dates back to the ancient Middle East when people used onion skins to color them, Nadieszda Kizenko, director of religious studies at the University at Albany, told USA TODAY last year.\n\nEggs were also decorated because of their importance, Kizenko said. In the early days of Lent – the time period of fasting between Ash Wednesday and Easter – meat was given up, as well as dairy products.\n\n\"Being able to eat eggs once again was a really big deal. That's when people started the custom of decorating eggs,\" Kizenko said.\n\nTop stories:Peeps candies asked to remove Red Dye 3 from marshmallow treats over cancer concerns\n\nEaster celebrations vary around the world\n\nOf course, Easter celebrations differ around the world – depending on both regional traditions as well as denominational practices across different Christian churches.\n\nWhile U.S. families celebrating Easter may anticipate a visit from the Easter Bunny this weekend, young children in France, for example, are told that bells will bring them eggs.\n\n\"To be honest, I find (this tradition to be) a little less creepy than a giant bunny coming into my house to deliver candy,\" O'Malley joked. \"The bells leave the churches and drop candy everywhere.\"\n\nKizenko also noted that a significant difference between Easter celebrations in the U.S. compared to other parts of the world is the commercialization of it, similar to Christmas.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Sunday recognized ujamaa, or cooperative economics, and Karenga was in Rochester to share his vision at the invitation of the Rochester Kwanzaa Coalition.\n\nAs he explained it, Kwanzaa transcends African culture to celebrate the universal: “the celebration of Kwanzaa is about embracing ethical principles and values ... so the goodness of the world can be shared and enjoyed by us and everyone.”\n\nBut at the same time, it is more specifically a celebration of African culture, broadly. Questions about whether white people can celebrate Kwanzaa are improperly cast, Karenga said — the celebration is of black people, not Kwanzaa.\n\nThat makes the holiday an opportunity for cross-cultural appreciation as well as soul-searching within the black community.\n\n“What does it mean to be the fathers and mothers of human civilization? What does it mean to be the sons and daughters of the holocaust of enslavement?” Karenga asked of the audience. “What does all that mean? We have to discuss that.”\n\nThe values that come from asking those questions — the seven principles — form a moral code based on love for oneself and others, shared responsibility and a distaste for injustice, Karenga said.\n\n“These principles, practiced throughout the year, ensure that Kwanzaa is not only a season of celebration but also a living and lived tradition,” he said.\n\nKarenga is no stranger to upstate New York — Buffalo has one of the country’s most active Kwanzaa celebrations and the founder attends it every year, according to Kiah Nyame, a member of the Rochester Kwanzaa Coalition.\n\nJahmal Golden, 20, has been an admirer of Karenga’s since he was a child and was eager to see him speak in person.\n\n“(Kwanzaa) transcends when it was created and reflects our current experience,” he said. “I love that he was here to bring that to us today.”\n\nJMURPHY7@DemocratandChronicle.com\n\nTwitter.com/CitizenMurphy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/weather/christmas-artic-winter-storm-tuesday/index.html", "title": "Polar air and a powerful winter storm put millions under winter alerts ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor millions of Americans across a large swath of the country, the holiday week is beginning with unrelenting below-freezing temperatures made even more miserable by heavy snow expected Tuesday and Wednesday in several central and northwestern states.\n\nA developing ‘bomb cyclone’ has prompted alerts from Washington state to Maryland that cover over 50 million people, according to the National Weather Service, and that number is expected to grow over the coming days.\n\nA ‘bomb cyclone’ is a term used by meteorologists to describe a rapidly strengthening storm. Specifically, it means a drop of 24 millibars (a term used to measure atmospheric pressure), in 24 hours. These storms frequently occur with winter nor’easters, but in this case, the bomb cyclone is expected to occur in the Plains. That’s because of the extreme temperature difference between the warm and moist air in advance of the storm and the extreme Arctic air mass moving in from Canada.\n\nThis weather phenomenon is expected to be the pressure equivalent of a category 2 hurricane as it reaches the Great Lakes, with the weather service now calling the strength of the low a “once-in-a-generation” event.\n\nMore than 40 million people are under wind chill alerts across much of the central and northwestern US, including in places slammed with blizzard conditions by a separate storm system last week. Parts of Alabama and Tennessee are also under a wind chill watch as the “feel like” temperatures are expected to plummet below zero.\n\nOn Tuesday, the sprawling weather system is delivering dangerously cold temperatures and snow to Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and most of Minnesota, where high temperatures will remain below zero, according to forecasters at the NWS.\n\nThe air feels so cold, frostbite on exposed skin can occur in under 10 minutes in most of the impacted areas, and some isolated locations in under five minutes, forecasters warn.\n\n“In addition to the brutally cold temperatures, dangerous wind chill values of 35 to 55 degrees below zero are possible into the end of the week across these areas,” the Weather Prediction Center said Monday.\n\nWind chill advisories are in place for Sioux, South Dakota, and Fargo, North Dakota, Tuesday, when the dangers of frostbite are settling in. Wind chill, which indicates what the wind feels like, will be as low as 40 degrees below zero, and in Wyoming on Wednesday night could hit a staggering 70 degrees below zero.\n\n“Starting tonight, the worst of the arctic air mass will reach our area, bringing dangerous temperatures and wind chills. Slippery roads will continue with additional accumulating snow expected Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday morning,” the weather service office in Glasgow, Montana, said Monday evening.\n\nDrastic temperature drops are coming. In Denver, for example, the temperature will be 50 degrees at noon on Wednesday but is expected to drop to 12 below by daybreak on Thursday. Similarly, New Yorkers will enjoy 60-degree weather on Friday in Manhattan and then see a temperature of 24 degrees as a high on Christmas Eve.\n\nSnowfall has already begun in Seattle, which is under a winter storm warning Tuesday. The storm will move east into portions of Idaho Tuesday morning and then spread out across northern and central Montana later in the afternoon.\n\nAs the storm moves east this week, it stands to make holiday travel difficult, if not dangerous, in many places, with forecasters urging people to be prepared to make changes.\n\nIn Minnesota, the weather service in the Twin Cities implored residents to be cautious of the “potentially dangerous week of weather,” with the worst of the effects in the Midwest beginning Wednesday.\n\n“The bottom line is travel will be very dangerous and could be LIFE-THREATENING later this week so be prepared to alter travel plans now!” the local weather service office said.\n\nMany local governments in the affected areas have opened warming centers in an attempt to provide relief to those who need it.\n\nSioux Falls, South Dakota, was hit last week by a massive winter storm. The city is again under winter weather alerts Tuesday. Erin Woodiel/Argus Leader/USA Today\n\nWhat’s ahead Christmas week\n\nOverall, most of the US is expected to see abnormally cold temperatures this week. In fact, more than 80% of the country, excluding Hawaii and Alaska, are forecast to see below-freezing temperatures.\n\nIn Montana, Helena and Missoula are under winter storm warnings beginning Tuesday, and Billings is under a wind chill advisory through noon Friday.\n\nThe storm is also expected to intensify as it approaches the Midwest, where the greatest impacts are forecast. Snow will begin in the region Wednesday and last through much of the Christmas weekend.\n\nIn parts of central Minnesota, several inches of fluffy snow are expected Wednesday, followed by high winds, creating the potential for blizzard conditions. A blizzard is defined as having winds of at least 35 mph along with falling or blowing snow which reduces visibility to a quarter-mile or less, for at least three hours.\n\n“By Thursday, wind gusts of 40-50 mph appear likely. With the fluffy snow in place, blizzard conditions are highly likely area wide, even in areas that typically aren’t favored for whiteout conditions,” the weather service said.\n\nKristin Jagodzinske sweeps the snow off the sidewalk in front of her shop in snowy downtown Poulsbo on Tuesday, Dec. 20, 2022. Meegan M. Reid/Kitsap Sun/USA Today Network\n\nChicago is forecast to be one of the hardest hit cities, where a winter storm watch is in effect starting Thursday night through Friday evening. With blizzard conditions likely, holiday travel could grind to a halt for many seeking to celebrate with family and loved ones.\n\nThe city could pick up 6 to 8 inches of snow from Thursday morning through late Friday night and when combined with 55 mph winds, the weather will bring travel to a stand still. The blizzard conditions could close O’Hare airport during the peak of the storm and will likely cause the cancellations of hundreds of flights in Chicago alone.\n\n“Rapidly deteriorating conditions by late Thursday afternoon, with dangerous blizzard conditions appearing increasingly likely Thursday night into Friday,” said the weather service office in Chicago, home not only to one of the nation’s busiest airports but also long-distance train depots.\n\nSouth bracing for unseasonably cold temps\n\nMeanwhile, even southern cities unaccustomed to wintry conditions will get a brittle taste of it this holiday season, with Austin, Houston, Atlanta, and even Orlando at risk of seeing temperatures below freezing beginning midweek.\n\nIn Texas, the weather service made it a point to reassure residents this week’s unusually cold temperatures are not expected to affect the state as severely as last year’s brutal winter storms, when millions of people lost power during a weeklong extreme weather event in February 2021.\n\nHowever, water pipes will be at risk of bursting, the weather service said. A wind chill watch for Amarillo, Texas, is in effect from Wednesday night through Friday afternoon.\n\n“Outdoor pipes will be at risk due to well below freezing temps and windy conditions late this week,” the weather service in Fort Worth said. “Make sure to cover pipes and let faucets drip!”\n\nMississippi is urging residents to start bracing for what could be an extremely cold couple of days, the state’s emergency management agency said in a Facebook post Tuesday morning.\n\n“Dangerous, cold temperatures are expected this week for most of the state. Start prepping NOW,” the post said. “Wrap pipes and keep a preparedness kit in your car with extra blankets. Remember the Four P’s of Winter Weather Preparedness. People, Pets, Pipes, and Plants!”\n\nMuch of the state is under a hard freeze watch, according to the weather service. Subfreezing temperatures are expected.\n\n“A prolonged period of subfreezing temperatures may cause pipes to burst. Bitterly cold temperatures and wind chills will result in hypothermia and become life-threatening to those with prolonged exposure or without access to adequate warmth,” the weather service said.\n\nIn a post Monday, state emergency management officials reminded residents to seal windows and doors, insulate pipes and test smoke alarms.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/06/28/aaa-record-travel-projected-july-4-holiday/86468032/", "title": "AAA: Record travel projected for July 4 holiday", "text": "Bart Jansen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe lowest gas prices in a decade will fuel a record number of Independence Day holiday motorists, putting millions more behind the wheel than on Memorial Day, according to AAA.\n\nNearly 43 million Americans will travel from June 30 through July 4, which would set a record for the holiday weekend and amount to 5 million more travelers than the Memorial Day holiday, according to AAA.\n\nThe average gallon of gas now costs $2.31, down 47 cents from a year ago and the lowest price for the holiday weekend since 2005.

Will it be ...", "text": "Associated Press\n\nHONG KONG (AP) — Millions of Chinese tourists usually spend their weeklong National Day holidays traveling abroad.\n\nThis year, travel restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic mean that some 600 million tourists — about 40% of the population — will travel within China during the holiday that began Thursday, according to Ctrip, China’s largest online travel agency.\n\nThat’s still down 25% from last year, when tourists took 782 million domestic trips and generated tourism revenue of 650 billion yuan ($95.4 billion), according to government data. The dip comes as some in China remain wary of the coronavirus and opt not to join the holiday rush. The country’s borders remain closed to international visitors.\n\nThe eight-day holiday, known as Golden Week, commemorates the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. This year, it coincides with the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, serving as a litmus test of whether China’s tourism industry can bounce back following the battering it took earlier in the year. Travel within the country, and sometimes even within cities, was restricted beginning with the Lunar New Year as China fought the spread of the coronavirus that emerged in the central city of Wuhan and has sickened more than 34 million people, killing over a million.\n\nThe weeklong holiday in October is typically the busiest time for domestic travel. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism said that tourism revenue totaled 76.7 billion yuan ($11.3 billion) on Thursday, close to 70% of last year’s. In Beijing, 223 major tourist attractions registered close to 1.1 million visits, the city’s Bureau of Culture and Tourism said.\n\nWith the world’s biggest-spending tourists spending their money travelling domestically, local governments are offering discounts and subsidies to tourists, including free or heavily discounted tickets to attractions.\n\nZhao Kerui, a designer with a flexible working schedule, often takes several trips abroad each year. Last year, he visited Malaysia and Japan. He had planned to visit Istanbul in Turkey or to Jeju island in South Korea this year, but eventually decided to instead visit cities like Chengdu, known for being the home of pandas, as well as scenic Guilin, famed for its karst limestone hills.\n\n“To take a trip abroad, you will be quarantined for half a month when you arrive, and when you return, it’s another half a month of quarantine,” Zhao said. “One month is gone with you doing nothing at all. “\n\nCao Ke, a science researcher based in Shanghai, usually would spend his National Day holiday relaxing at the beaches in Thailand’s Phuket island. This year he’s heading to the southern coastal province of Fujian in China, hoping to take some nice photos.\n\n“I usually prefer traveling abroad, because there are too many people traveling domestically, and accommodation and meals become very expensive,” said Cao.\n\nThat’s a sentiment shared by many Chinese who can afford to fly overseas for holidays but now are barred by flight cancellations and quarantine restrictions. Thailand, one of the most popular destinations among Chinese travellers, closed its airports to international commercial flights in April and has yet to fully reopen to tourism.\n\nSo instead, Chinese visitors will be crowding into popular attractions, such as the Disneyland resort in Shanghai and the research base for panda breeding in the southwestern city of Chengdu, Ctrip’s report said.\n\nChina is one of the few countries in the world where millions are freely touring around the country, while most countries are discouraging unnecessary travel as they battle coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nChina has reported no new locally transmitted coronavirus infections since Aug. 16, and the country’s culture and tourism ministry last month eased restrictions on tourist sites, allowing them to operate at 75% capacity. Visitors also are encouraged to obey social-distancing rules during their travels.\n\nThe number of tourists at top attractions across the country jumped nearly 159% in the second quarter of the year compared to the previous quarter, at the height of pandemic shutdowns.\n\nThe number of tourists visiting resorts and engaging in rural tourism in July and August was about 90% of last year’s level, Shan Gangxin, an official with China’s ministry of culture and tourism, told reporters in Beijing this week.\n\nHotel bookings are 50% higher compared to last year, and airline reservations are on a par with 2019, helped by discounts for hotels and flights, according to data from Fliggy, Alibaba’s online travel arm.\n\nZeng Xiaoqi, a 24-year-old nurse from central China’s Hunan province, planned a trip to Beijing for the holidays to celebrate her mother’s 50th birthday.\n\n“Before I left, I took the nucleic acid test in my hometown and called the tourist sites I wanted to go to ask if the site is open during the holiday week, and how tickets could be booked,” said Zeng. “I didn’t depart until all the preparation was done.”\n\nShe said that she was not worried about traveling within China, as most areas are currently fairly low-risk when it comes to the coronavirus.\n\nNonetheless, as a precaution, Zeng said she was well-equipped with masks, hand sanitizer, and wet tissue for the flight and high speed train to Beijing.\n\nRailway authorities said they expect 108 million train journeys to be made between Monday, Sept. 28 and Oct. 8, or an average of almost 10 million per day. Overall, train and airline passenger numbers are still forecast to be lower than in previous years amid concerns that restrictions could be re-imposed if new cases are detected.\n\nLike many other Chinese, Zhao plans to stick to domestic trips for the next few months.\n\n“To be honest, it’s the same whether I travel abroad or around China,” he said. “I do it to relax.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/02/12/super-bowl-monday-holiday/11228634002/", "title": "Is Super Bowl Monday a holiday?

But the Monday after the big game can feel like a letdown – whether you had a team to pull for in the event or not.\n\nSuper Bowl parties can spill over into late Sunday night. And that can leave revelers – as well as those who traveled to the game or traveled to gather and watch with friends – scrambling to make it to work on Monday.\n\nOver the years, many have had a game plan of making the Monday after the event a national holiday, handing off a three-day weekend to football fans.\n\nThat would also benefit children and teens who want to watch the game – and the commercials, of course – even though it could push up against bedtime on a school night.\n\nFor that reason, some Philadelphia and Phillly-area schools are delaying the start of school Monday for two hours.

The Biden administration has not kept the \"We the People\" petition feature up and running – could it be because of this very reason?\n\nNearly half of U.S. sports fans would give up one of their current work holidays to have the day off after Super Bowl Sunday, a survey from 2020 found.\n\nMore than 40% said they would rather work Presidents Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day or Columbus Day than the Monday after the Super Bowl.\n\nAbout 10% said they would even prefer working Christmas or Thanksgiving.\n\nLooking for more signs of love for a prolonged Super Bowl weekend? Change.org, a different petition site, has gotten more than two dozen petitions since 2017 asking Congress, the president or the NFL to make the Monday after the Super Bowl a national holiday. One wants Presidents Day moved to the day after the Super Bowl and others suggest no school the day after the game.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nWhat would it take to make Super Bowl Monday a holiday?\n\nCongress and the president, over the years, have enacted 12 federal holidays, including New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Christmas, and most recently, Juneteenth. In June 2021, Congress passed a bill making June 19 a federal holiday commemorating the symbolic end of slavery in the United States and President Joe Biden signed the bill.\n\nEven though these are considered federal holidays, they are not \"national holidays,\" and are only applicable to federal employees and the District of Columbia, notes a Congressional Research Service report updated in July 2021.\n\nEach state gets to determine its legal holidays, the report states.\n\nAs an example, at least nine states have made Juneteenth an official paid holiday for state employees, while several other states have laws that make federal holidays a state holiday. But the majority of states may simply observe or recognize the holiday.\n\nStudent's Super Bowl request:Can we have a two-hour delay Monday after the game?\n\nTwo state legislators in Tennessee have proposed a bill making the first Monday after the Super Bowl into a legal holiday. With so many folks already taking the day off, \"it is already kind of like a de facto holiday,\" Rep. Joe Towns, who co-sponsored the bill with state Sen. London Lamar, told USA TODAY. \"People are not going in and they are calling in sick or taking a sick day, a rest day, a mental health day, whatever you want to call it.\"\n\nHowever, he notes, the holiday could eventually occur naturally if the NFL continues to expand its season. \"If they extend the number of games they play, Presidents Day could end up being the holiday,\" Towns said.\n\nThat could be the most likely path for Super Bowl Monday to happen. Realistically, creating a Super Bowl Monday federal holiday faces plenty of hurdles, even if hospitality and leisure industries would get a bump around the celebration, said Columbia Business School professor and corporate strategy expert Rita McGrath.\n\n\"The paid day off holidays tend to be very contentious, and it is extremely hard to get one through,\" she said. \"It also diminishes the seriousness of other national holidays which are about truly pivotal people or events.\"\n\nAnd, realistically, the intensity of the interest is in several markets in the country –the cities from which the two teams come from, plus, a few other sports intense markets on the coasts and in states such as Florida and Texas, Conway said.\n\n\"Today, for an event, or commemorating an individual, to rise to the level of national holiday status, I think there would need to more universal support around the country, which by about 12 noon the day after the game, that interest has dissipated,\" he said.\n\nWell, how about the NFL move the game to Saturday? That way most would have Sunday off. There's a petition for that, too.\n\nA previous version of this story originally published in February 2022.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/12"}]}

The U.S. has an equally long list that includes taxing X-ray machines and other Chinese goods.\n\nIowa farmers could lose up to $624 million, depending on how long the tariffs are in place and the speed producers can find new markets for their soybeans, said Chad Hart, an Iowa State University economist.\n\nU.S. soybean prices have fallen about 12 percent since March, when the U.S.-China trade dispute began.\n\n\"Any tariff or tax put in place will have a significant impact, not only to the U.S. soybean market but to Iowa's, because we're such a large producer,\" Hart said Friday.\n\nIowa is the nation's second-largest soybean grower, producing 562 million bushels last year worth $5.2 billion.\n\n\"It will slow down the market. Even with the tariffs in place, we will ship a lot of soybeans to China,\" Hart said. \"It just won't be nearly the amount we did before.\n\n\"It's likely to still be our largest market even with these tariffs in place.\"\n\nOn Friday, President Donald Trump said the U.S. will place 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods. China quickly vowed to match Trump's action.\n\nThe U.S. tariffs are a response to \"China’s theft of intellectual property and technology,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nTrump also is looking for tariffs on another $100 billion of Chinese products.

About 40 percent of China’s soybean imports come from the U.S.\n\nTariffs could slash U.S. soybean exports to China by about 65 percent, as other countries' soybeans become a better buy, a Purdue University study said.\n\nIt shows losses for U.S. farmers could range from $1.7 billion to $3.3 billion with tariffs up to 30 percent.\n\n\"You can't make business decisions with this kind of uncertainty. … it will be difficult not just for farmers, but ag lenders, equipment manufacturers, seed companies,\" Kimberley said. \"It impacts everybody.\"\n\nSecretary Sonny Perdue said Friday the U.S. Department of Agriculture is assessing the tariffs' impact on farmers, given \"the president’s promise not to make farmers bear the brunt of these trade disruptions.\"\n\nPerdue said the Commodity Credit Corp., USDA agency that has broad authority to support farm prices and incomes, is among \"the tools available\" but provided no details.\n\n\"It’s way too early\" to determine the financial hit, said Perdue, who met Friday with Minister Lawrence MacAulay, Canada's agriculture minister on Prince Edward Island.\n\n\"We’ll look and see what the market damage is from the trade disruptions.

Trump says he wants to bring back American factory jobs but economists say his tactics could result in a trade war that ultimately hurts the United States. Economics reporters Roger Yu and Paul Davidson try to sort it all out.\n\nQ: How did China become the second-largest economy in the world and so intertwined with the U.S.?\n\nWith a population of nearly 1.4 billion, China is the world’s largest country. It has taken advantage of its bountiful labor force to fuel an export-oriented economy. In short, it became richer by transforming itself into the world’s factory. American companies fully exploited the opportunities, rushing to outsource manufacturing there.\n\nThe result was a burgeoning middle class in China that formed a new export market for American products. More Chinese students can now afford to study in the U.S., often forming the largest international student group at prestigious universities. Chinese tourists pack American hotels in major cities. And the Chinese government began investing heavily in U.S. Treasuries. China is now America’s largest creditor.\n\nQ: What is a trade deficit and why has our trade deficit with China widened?\n\nA trade deficit occurs when a country's imports of goods and services exceed its exports, or goods and services shipped “abroad.” The U.S. trade deficit across the globe totaled $531.5 billion in 2015, up from $508.3 billion a year earlier. In other words, Americans consume more foreign goods and services than the country ships overseas.\n\nThe vast majority of the U.S. deficit derives from trade with China. The gap with China rose to $365.7 billion in 2015 from $343.1 billion a year earlier. That’s because more U.S. companies continue to outsource to China to take advantage of cheap labor, and those goods are then shipped to the U.S. Meanwhile, U.S. exports to China are growing as wages in that country increase and residents consume more, but not nearly as quickly as imports. The standard of living in China is still relatively low.\n\nAlso, China puts high tariffs on many American products while U.S. tariffs on Chinese products are low. And the dollar is strong, particularly in relation to the Chinese yuan. That makes U.S. goods more expensive for Chinese customers, and Chinese goods cheaper for Americans.\n\nQ: What U.S. goods are exported to China and which Chinese goods are imported to the U.S.?\n\nSome of the goods exported by the U.S. include industrial supplies, foods, airplanes and car parts and machinery. Goods imported to the U.S. from China include consumer electronics and clothing.\n\nQ: Why has Trump made China such a big issue?\n\nPolitics plays a huge role. The Rust Belt states were very much in play for Trump, and he knew that the message of bringing jobs back from China would resonate with voters. It worked. “There’s certainly a sense in heartland America that trade has not worked well for average workers, especially in the manufacturing sector,” says Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University. “It’s a lot easier to blame the external boogeyman as the main culprit for the job losses. It presented a fat and juicy target.”\n\nQ: What does Trump want from China?\n\nAs seen in his recent negotiations with Carrier to keep operations in the U.S.,Trump has shown that the appearance of victory matters to him. So he’s looking for concessions, says Mauro Guillen, an economics professor at the University of Pennsylvania. “What he wants is to score some kind of victory, at least symbolic,” he says.\n\nHe may also have more substantive goals in mind, says Matthew Kahn, an economics professor at the University of Southern California. Trump could negotiate to broaden local market access for American companies, restrict its theft of U.S. intellectual property and continue Chinese investment in U.S. real estate and universities. “I think he wants China to consume more of our exports,” Kahn says. “He wants more American success there.”\n\nQ: China has been accused of currency manipulation. Does this continue? How does it affect our trade policy and American companies’ operations?\n\nChina pegs the yuan to the dollar, giving the government much control over its value. Most advanced economies let their currencies “float,” allowing market forces to dictate their currency value.\n\nFor years, China has deliberately devalued its currency, which made its exports cheaper. But the practice has faded in the past two years, Prasad says. With the Chinese economy cooling, market forces have driven the yuan to an eight-year low against the dollar in November. And China’s central bank and other state-owned banks have been intervening to ensure it’s not depreciating too far,” Prasad says. “Right now, it’s doing the reverse of currency manipulating,” he says. “It’s helping the U.S.”\n\nQ: How does the trade deficit with China affect the U.S. economy?\n\nFor most Americans, the trade deficit is manifested on the shelves of stores like Walmart. Consumer goods have gotten cheaper because companies can make them at low cost in China. “The U.S. is a stronger nation because of trades with China,” Khan says. “I don’t think it’s a bad thing that we have a deficit with China.”\n\nBut don’t tell that to factory workers in Michigan and Ohio. Many factors have contributed to the exodus of jobs in those regions, including automation. But there’s no denying that American manufacturing jobs have been lost due to offshoring. Free trade “may come at the expense of some jobs in the U.S. But Americans have developed a taste for cheap consumer goods,” Guillen says.\n\nQ: Trump has threatened to slap Chinese imports to the U.S. with 45% tariffs. Would that be effective in narrowing the trade deficit and bringing jobs back to the U.S.?\n\nUnlikely, economists say. Any measures to lower imports of Chinese products — say, a tariff on a specific industry — will likely result in a tit-for-tat response from China, resulting in higher prices for U.S. exports.\n\nMany U.S. manufacturers then will simply move operations to other countries with low costs, such as Vietnam. Raising tariffs is not a guaranteed remedy for regenerating U.S. manufacturing jobs, Prasad says.\n\nBesides imposing tariffs on American goods, China could seek to make accessing the Chinese market difficult for American companies. That could mean unforeseen licensing requirements and administrative procedures. Chinese students could be held back from attending American universities. Airbus’ planes could be favored over Boeing. Intellectual property laws may not be enforced as aggressively. China “can start to restrict its market even more,\" Prasad says. \"There’s a lot they can do.”\n\nMeanwhile, higher prices on Chinese imports to the U.S. will affect working-class Americans more disproportionately, possibly leading to concerns about inflation.\n\nQ: What is Trump’s endgame?\n\n\n\nDespite Trump’s tweets that were antagonistic toward China, few economists expect him to risk a full trade war. But if he followed through on some campaign promises — such as tariffs or formally declaring China a currency manipulator — “that’d signal an opening salvo,” Prasad says.\n\nEconomists say Trump may be approaching the issue as a business dealer, bluffing and stretching boundaries to extract better deals. But the United States' need for access to the Chinese market isn’t waning, and Trump must tread carefully in his dealings, they say.\n\nQ: China’s economy is slowing down. Why is this worrisome to Americans?\n\nThe Chinese economy continues to grow, just not at the rate it once did a few years ago. A slowing Chinese economy would mean less global demand for oil, steel, food and other commodities as well as fewer purchases of American real estate and luxury goods, and perhaps even a slowdown in China’s purchase of U.S. Treasuries.\n\nQ: How is China trying to spark faster economic growth?\n\nFacing more competition from countries with low-cost labor, such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, the Chinese government has started to shift from an export-driven economy to one fueled by domestic consumption. But the initiative has been slow to take effect as the Chinese are known to be aggressive savers. “They don’t have Medicare or Social Security,” Guillen says. “China has 400 million people still living in poverty in rural areas. They’re not ready to move toward a consumer-oriented economy.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/05/13/tariffs-china-imports-trade-war-threatens-farmers-manufacturers/1191088001/", "title": "Who gets hurt by China's new tariffs on American goods?

But all existing U.S. and Chinese duties, including those announced Monday, will shave growth by three-tenths of a percentage point next year, says Oxford economist Greg Daco. Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi expects an even bigger impact of nearly half a percentage point.\n\nThe fallout for investors has been more prominent. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 600 points Monday. That’s partly because multinational corporations with significant exports could see less revenue and profits, Zandi says. The bigger toll is on business confidence and investment, he says.\n\n“It raises the probability of a full-blown trade war, which will hammer earnings,” Zandi says.\n\nSo far, China has slapped tariffs on $100 billion in U.S. goods. As a result, U.S.exports to China fell 7% in 2018, according to the U.S.-China Business Council. And Chinese investment in the U.S. was down 60% last year, “in part because of added scrutiny applied to proposed deals and a souring political climate,” the group says.\n\nU.S. farmers, who have been especially affected by China’s tariffs last year, are likely to suffer an additional blow.\n\nJohn Heisdorffer, a soybean farmer in Keota, Iowa, has lost about $10,000 since China put a 25% levy on U.S. soybean shipments last year as prices fell from more than $10 a bushel to about $8. U.S. soybean exports to China effectively halted before rising modestly recently as part of Chinese concessions during negotiations. Heisdorffer says he has cut back on investments in new equipment.\n\nAfter Monday’s news, soybean futures fell another seven cents. Although soybeans aren’t directly affected by the latest round of Chinese tariffs, various soy-related oils and extracts will be hit.\n\n“I thought it was going to be resolved last week,” Heisdorffer says. “I don’t know what to think now. It continues to ratchet down the amount of cash we have to pay bills.\"\n\nIf the conflict drags on, he says, there won’t be anything left to give his son, who plans to take over the farm when Heisdorffer, 67, retires.\n\nHeisdorffer, who is chairman of the American Soybean Association, also worries the number of soybean farmers who go bankrupt will increase substantially if the latest Chinese tariff isn’t removed. “People are going to be hanging by a thread,” he says.\n\nDow:Dow stock swings are exhausting, but here's how to survive\n\nSocial media pressure:Young people, scrolling their friends' Instagram feeds, feel pressure to overspend\n\nStefanie Smallhouse, president of the Arizona Farm Bureau, said the prospects of tariffs that could undercut exports to China come at an already bad time for the state’s agricultural industry.\n\nFarmers and ranchers already have been paying higher prices for equipment, seed, fertilizer and other expenditures – partly due to tariffs that raised the price of steel and aluminum imported into the U.S. Plus, they face uncertainty in exporting to Mexico and Canada pending approval of a revamped North American trade agreement.\n\n“We’re being squeezed on both sides,” said Smallhouse, who with her husband owns a livestock ranch near Tucson. “At this point, it’s a downhill slide.”\n\nLonger term, the tariffs and heightened trade tensions mean farmers and ranchers face missed opportunities and the prospect of losing market share in China, which she described as an important export destination for Arizona agricultural products, especially dairy and meat.\n\nChina also represents the third-largest export market for U.S. chemical makers. Last year, U.S. chemical exports to China rose just 2.7% after notching double-digit gains in 2016 and 2017. The U.S. offers high-quality, inexpensive products, largely because of cheap prices for natural gas, a feedstock for many chemicals used to make plastics, oil-related goods, pharmaceuticals, construction and other products in China, Brzytwa of the ACC says.\n\nWith many chemical makers eyeing China as a prime market, about $200 billion in new factories are being planned in the U.S. But some could move to other countries if the newest tariff remains, Brzytwa says. Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturers could shift their chemical purchases to domestic suppliers or other Asian countries.\n\nBASF, a Germany-based chemical manufacturer with more than 100 facilities in North America, said it's \"concerned about the U.S. announcements, and the response of several of its trading partners, to impose import tariffs on a wide range of products that could affect the chemical industry and its numerous customer industries.\"\n\nThe company said it's still assessing the potential effects of the latest round of increased Chinese tariffs on its American operations.\n\nContributing: Russ Wiles, Arizona Republic; Yan Zhang; Nathan Bomey", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/iowa-view/2018/03/09/exports-good-and-imports-bad-right-nonsense/410993002/", "title": "Exports are good and imports are bad, right? Nonsense", "text": "Dennis Starleaf\n\nIowa View contributor\n\nMany people appear to be under the impression that exporting is good while importing is bad. This is nonsense.\n\nWhat a country gains from international trade is the ability to import things it wants from other countries. Exporting is not a rational national objective in and of itself. The need to export is a burden that a country must bear because its import suppliers demand payment for what they supply.\n\nSuppose that the U.S. exported 10% of its national output and imported nothing. What would be the consequences? We would have for domestic use only 90% of what we produce, so we would have a lower standard of living than if we exported nothing.\n\nWould we get anything in exchange for our exports? We would get a lot of foreign money. But foreign money is generally of value only because it can be used to buy foreign goods and services. If we are not going to import, of what use is acquiring foreign money? We could, of course, use this money to make investments in foreign countries and these investments would undoubtedly yield profits (or at least interest) in the future. But this simply means that we would have more unusable foreign money in the future. Unless you are going to use acquired foreign money to buy things from other countries (i.e., to spend it on imports) now or in the future, there is not much point in exporting.\n\nNow suppose that the U.S. imported an amount of foreign goods and services equal to 10% of what we produce and exported nothing. What would be the consequences? We would have for domestic use 110% of what we produce, so we would have a higher standard of living than if we imported nothing. What would we give other countries in exchange for these imports? U.S. dollars, of course. And U.S. dollars are cheap to produce. For example, it costs only a few pennies for the U.S. government to print a $100 bill.\n\nIf we could get foreigners to sell us goods and services in exchange for dollars that they merely hoarded and did not spend on U.S. products, this would be a wonderful deal, along the lines of manna falling from heaven. And to some extent we have this deal.\n\nBecause the U.S. dollar has a pretty stable purchasing power, it is often used in trade outside the United States. For example, U.S. currency is commonly used (legally or illegally) in trade within countries that do not have a stable-value currency. In fact, most of the U.S. currency in existence is owned and held by foreigners outside the United States. And for foreigners to have acquired these dollars, they have had to export goods and services to us in exchange for the dollars.\n\nFurthermore, foreign countries hold foreign currency reserves – pools of foreign money and other foreign-currency denominated financial assets – and much of the foreign currency reserves that foreign countries hold are denominated in U.S. dollars. The chief way that foreign countries acquire U.S. dollar-denominated financial assets is to export goods and services to U.S. in exchange for U.S. dollars.\n\nIt is a wonderful deal for the U.S. But the willingness of foreign individuals and businesses to export goods and services to the U.S. in exchange for U.S. dollars that they merely hold is limited. For the most part, at least in the long run, foreigners are going to spend the proceeds from their exporting to the U.S. on – you guessed it – U.S. goods and services (i.e., U.S. exports). This means that over the long haul international trade is pretty much a two-way street. If a county is going to be able to import, it is going to have to export. And over the long haul, the value of a country’s exports is going to be approximately equal to the value of its imports.\n\nDennis Starleaf is an emeritus professor of economics at Iowa State University.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/08/30/us-china-trade-war-china-need-soybeans-could-spur-deal/1136570002/", "title": "US China trade war: Chinese demand for American soybeans may ...", "text": "Here's why China could well follow Mexico and resolve its rancorous trade fight with the U.S. in the next few months: Soybeans.\n\nThis crop, used by the Chinese to feed pigs for pork, is at the top of the list of thousands of products ensnared in the U.S.-China skirmish. In early July, China slapped a 25 percent tariff on imports of U.S. soybeans, among hundreds of other American shipments, in retaliation for a similar U.S. duty on $34 billion in imports from China.\n\nSoybeans represent the largest U.S. export to China, with a value of $12.4 billion last year. And with soybean prices down about 22 percent since April, perhaps no single group has suffered from the escalating trade feud like the hundreds of thousands of soybean farmers, largely in red states, who voted for President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nAmerican soybeans, however, help feed the growing middle class in China, where soy-fed pork has become a mainstay of the diet. That need will become more acute this fall when soybeans from Brazil – the world’s other major producer – grow scarce, analysts say.\n\n“China is going to need U.S. soybeans come the fourth quarter,” says Mike Dawson, an analyst at Sterling Marketing, an agricultural research firm. “I think that as we get closer … China will become far more amicable” to a trade agreement.\n\n“We certainly hope so,” says John Heisdorffer, president of the American Soybean Association and an Iowa soybean, corn and hog farmer.\n\nA White House official would not comment.\n\nChinese buyers will have little choice but to turn again to the U.S. crop, which is also used for cooking oil in China, experts say. And if the 25 percent tariff is still in place, it could further stoke Chinese inflation that hit a four-month high in July and is traditionally a hot-button political issue in the country.\n\nMore:Survey of companies indicates U.S. workers can expect slightly bigger raises in 2019\n\nMore:Buying wedding dresses online: More brides are leaving physical stores at the altar\n\nMore:What are the best and worst car brands in the U.S. in 2018?\n\nTalks with Mexico, Canada\n\nChina’s stepped-up need for soybeans will coincide with the U.S. midterm elections. China is likely hoping to sway the voting against pro-Trump Republicans in red states by hurting farmers there, says John LaForge, head of real asset strategy at the Wells Fargo Investments Institute.\n\n“With the midterm elections only a few months away, we would expect China to keep the pressure turned up,” LaForge wrote in a note to clients. “But soon thereafter … we would expect to see some relief for U.S. soy prices and U.S. soy exporters.”\n\nTrump announced a tentative trade deal with Mexico this week and said he's optimistic Canada will join the pact by a Friday deadline. Midlevel talks between the U.S. and China resumed last week but no agreement was reached, and Trump administration officials say the president has put off further negotiations.\n\nU.S. grievances with China are far thornier than with Mexico, involving charges of intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer. Besides U.S. tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports – and tit-for-tat duties by China on a like amount of American imports – Trump has threatened levies on another $200 billion in products from China in September.\n\nChina is top soy consumer\n\nSoybeans could represent a possible breakthrough because China consumes a third of the world’s soy, Wells Fargo figures show. The grain is used in a meal fed to pigs, and pork has become a staple in the Chinese diet. China is the world’s largest consumer of pork.\n\n“China loves its pork, and the pigs must be fed,” LaForge says.\n\nYet China produces only about 12 percent of the 112 million metric tons of soy it consumes annually, Sterling and Wells Fargo data show. It imports the rest, chiefly from the U.S. and Brazil, which together make 68 percent of the world’s soybeans. The U.S. leads, at 120.4 million metric tons, followed by Brazil at 108 million. But Brazil has a slight lead as an exporter, and last year it sold 51 million metric tons to China, while the U.S. exported 33 million metric tons, according to Wells Fargo.\n\nSince April, when investors began anticipating China’s 25 percent tariff on American soybeans, U.S. soybean prices have fallen from $10.54 a bushel to $8.20 as China has shifted soybean purchases from the U.S. to Brazil. As a result, Brazilian soybean prices have spiked, but they’re still lower than American soybean costs with the tariff.\n\nHigh prices and more limited supplies from Brazil have forced other countries to ramp up their soybean purchases from the U.S., Dawson says. But total U.S. soybean exports are still down about 4 percent over the past 12 months compared with the prior year.\n\nSoybean farmers, already struggling with thinner profit margins or losses amid a bumper crop, have seen their problems intensify, Heisdorffer says. If the standoff persists into early next year, some could be forced to shut down, he says. A $12 billion federal aid package to farmers hurt by the trade battle will initially offset about 37 percent of the decline in soybean prices.\n\nFifty-seven percent of U.S. soybean exports went to China last year, Wells Fargo says.\n\nChina will soon need U.S. soybeans\n\nHere’s the bright spot: While Brazil’s soybean harvest in the Southern Hemisphere runs from February through May, the U.S. harvest goes from September to December, Dawson says. And so by late this year, Brazil won’t have enough soybeans to supply China, he and LaForge say. Chinese buyers will have to resume purchases from the U.S., either at the higher tariff-affected price or at lower prices if the dispute is resolved.\n\nThere’s no guarantee that China’s appetite for soybeans will force its hand in the trade talks, at least in the near term, LaForge says. And the Chinese government could help buyers avoid U.S. soybeans a while longer by selling them the crop from its own emergency stockpile. But that would be a temporary solution, LaForge says.\n\nAlso, the African swine fever virus is thinning China’s hog herd, reducing the need for soy, but only very modestly Dawson says.

Europe has a China problem ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nEurope is becoming increasingly reliant on China for trade, and many of its top companies are eager to invest in the world’s second biggest economy despite the disruption caused by Covid lockdowns.\n\nBut a souring relationship with an increasingly unpredictable Beijing, regret about the price Europe has paid for getting too close to Russia, and rising geopolitical tension has some EU officials considering whether the bloc should start to reduce its exposure.\n\nIt’s a calculation EU Council President Charles Michel weighed up on Thursday when he visited Chinese leader Xi Jinping for talks aimed at shoring up diplomatic ties.\n\nAt the meeting in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Xi told Michel that China was “ready to strengthen strategic communication and coordination with the European side,” according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nA lot has happened since the last time an EU president — appointed by the leaders of the 27 EU member states — met with Xi in person four years ago.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and tit-for-tat sanctions between China and EU lawmakers have strained relations since. The United States, which imposed controls on exports of semiconductors to China in October, is reportedly exerting pressure on Europe to adopt a similarly hard line.\n\nMichel’s spokesperson, Barend Leyts, said in a statement last week that Michel’s visit provides a “timely opportunity” for Europe and China to engage on matters of “common interest.” He did not specify which subjects would be discussed.\n\nBut some within Europe are growing wary of close relations with China. The bloc has been badly burned this year by its historic reliance on Russia as its main energy supplier, and diversification has shot up the political agenda.\n\nThe receiving station for the now-defunct Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline stands at twilight on February 02, 2022 near Lubmin, Germany. Nord Stream 2, which is owned by Russian energy company Gazprom, was due to transport Russian natural gas from Russia to Germany before Berlin halted the project's certification in February after Moscow invaded Ukraine. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nSpeaking at a conference in Berlin on Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that the “dangerous dependency” of some countries on Russian natural gas should cause the alliance to “assess [its] dependencies on other authoritarian states, not least China.”\n\nThose concerns bubbled up last month when German Chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to Beijing with a delegation of top business leaders to meet Xi, a move intended to shore up Germany’s second biggest export market after the US.\n\nThe bloc is in a similar bind.\n\n“Any problems you have from a political and strategic level [between the EU and China], they tend to spill over to the economic level,” Ricardo Borges de Castro, associate director at the European Policy Centre, told CNN Business.\n\n‘Too big to fail’\n\nBoth sides have a lot invested in their partnership. The total value of the goods trade between China and Europe hit €696 billion ($732 billion) last year, up by nearly a quarter from 2019.\n\nChina was the third largest destination for EU goods exports, accounting for 10% of the total, according to Eurostat data. China is Europe’s biggest source of imports, accounting for 22% in 2021.\n\n“The European market’s importance as a destination for Chinese exports is around double that of the Chinese market for Europeans,” Jörg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China (EUCCC) wrote in a September report.\n\nOverall, the relationship is simply “too big to fail,” according to Borges de Castro. Europe is not seeking to decouple from the lucrative Chinese market, he added.\n\n“I don’t see [the EU’s strategy] as a decoupling strategy. I think the EU strategy, for the moment, is a diversification strategy… the lesson [from Russia] is that you cannot have a single provider,” he said.\n\nMachinery, vehicles, chemicals, and other manufactured goods account for the vast bulk of goods traded between the two powers, according to Eurostat.\n\n“European companies have done extremely well here and the overall long term outlook is very positive,” EUCCC Secretary General Adam Dunnett told CNN Business, adding that he expects European company revenues to keep growing in China over the next decade.\n\nThere are areas where Europe is dependent on Beijing, namely for the supply of rare earth metals required to make hybrid and electric vehicles, and wind turbines. Europe’s solar panels are also mostly manufactured in China.\n\nBut those dependencies shouldn’t be exaggerated, Dunnett said.\n\n“When you look at some of the broader things that China exports to the EU such as furniture and consumer goods, a lot of those things you can get elsewhere,” he said.\n\nEven so, the United States may exert more pressure on Europe to pull away from China, Borges de Castro noted. In early October, Washington banned Chinese firms from buying its advanced chips and chip-making equipment without a license.\n\nBenjamin Loh, the head of Dutch chipmaker ASM International, told the Financial Times on Wednesday that the US was “putting a lot of pressure” on the Dutch government to take a similarly tough stance.\n\nThe pressure may already be beginning to show. Germany last month blocked the sale of one of its chip factories to a Chinese-owned tech company because of security concerns.\n\n‘Systemic rival’\n\nEconomic ties between Brussels and Beijing, though mutually beneficial, have frayed in other ways in recent years.\n\nLast year, Chinese direct investment into the European Union dropped to its second lowest level since 2013, only behind 2020, according to analysis by the Rhodium Group, a research firm. It has fallen almost 78% since 2016.\n\n“The level of Chinese investment in Europe is now at a decade low,” Agatha Kratz, director at Rhodium Group, told CNN Business, citing Beijing’s strict capital controls and greater scrutiny by EU regulators.\n\nEU investment into China has also become more concentrated. Between 2018 and 2021, the top 10 European investors in China, including those from the United Kingdom, made up almost 80% of the continent’s total investment in the country, Rhodium Group data shows.\n\nAnd just four German companies — automakers Volkswagen (VLKAF), BMW, and Daimler (DDAIF), and chemicals giant BASF (BASFY) — made up more than one third of all European investment in those four years.\n\nAn investment deal between Beijing and Brussels was shelved last year after EU lawmakers slapped sanctions on Chinese officials over alleged human rights abuses, prompting China to retaliate with its own penalties.\n\nThe deal, agreed in principle in 2020 after years of talks, was designed to level the playing field for European companies operating in China, who have long complained that Beijing’s subsidies have put them at a disadvantage.\n\nEU diplomats said in April that a “growing number of irritants” were hurting relations, including China’s tacit acceptance of Russia’s war in Ukraine. They have described China as “a partner for cooperation and negotiation, an economic competitor and a systemic rival.”\n\n‘Covid carousel’\n\nThe most pressing issue for European businesses in China, according to Dunnett, is its stringent zero-Covid policy.\n\n“For the last year, it’s been the Covid carousel, [the] Covid rollercoaster,” he said. “Every time you think [it was] about to open up, something pulls us back,” he added.\n\nOver the weekend, thousands of protestors took to streets across China in a rare series of demonstrations against the country’s strict Covid controls. Some restrictions have since been lifted in Shanghai and other major cities.\n\nBeijing’s uncompromising approach is helping to further dampen foreign investment in the country, especially among smaller companies, Raffaello Pantucci, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a security research group, told CNN Business.\n\n“The general business environment in China is perceived as becoming harder to navigate, and while companies still feel they have to engage given its size and potential, increasingly small to medium sized companies are giving up,” he said.\n\n— Laura He and Sophie Jeong contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/06/10/vietnam-alleges-china-faking-made-vietnam-skirt-us-tariffs/1408023001/", "title": "Vietnam alleges China is faking 'Made in Vietnam' to skirt US tariffs", "text": "WASHINGTON – Vietnamese officials say China is intentionally mislabeling its products as \"made in Vietnam\" to avoid American tariffs, and have ordered offices to more aggressively examine products' certificates of origin.\n\nChinese firms first export products to Vietnam, then change the labeling on packages before exporting the goods to the United States, Japan or Europe, they said.\n\n\"Dozens\" of products have been identified, Hoang Thi Thuy, a Vietnamese Customs Department official, told state-run media, and goods like textiles, fishery products, agricultural products, steel, aluminum, and processed wooden products were most vulnerable to the fraud.\n\nMore:Donald Trump rips U.S. Chamber of Commerce for attacking his tariff strategy\n\nVietnamese state media noted that in 2017, the Customs Department exposed a company called INTERWYSE for trying to rebrand 600 Chinese-made speakers and phone chargers with a \"Made in Vietnam\" label.\n\n\"It will sabotage Vietnamese brands and products and it will also affect consumers.

Earlier in the day, he performed an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle.\n\n\"I'd like to take this opportunity to say thank you for the kind messages of support for Catherine and for my father, especially in recent days,\" William told the gala dinner for London's Air Ambulance Charity. \"It means a great deal to us all.\"\n\n\"It's fair to say the past few weeks have had a rather medical focus, so I thought I'd come to an air ambulance function to get away from it all,\" he added jokingly.\n\nThe royal, who is a former air ambulance helicopter pilot, met fellow pilots and chatted with guests including Hollywood star Tom Cruise at the black-tie event.\n\nWilliam temporarily stepped away from public duties last month to help care for Kate and their three young children following her operation for an undisclosed condition. The Princess of Wales, formerly Kate Middleton, isn't expected to resume public duties until April.\n\nCharles' cancer diagnosis earlier this week is putting extra pressure on the royal family, with the king suspending his public appearances to focus on treatment and recovery. While receiving treatment for an unspecified form of cancer, Charles will continue with behind-the-scenes work such as reviewing and signing state papers.\n\n\"His absence is putting a lot of pressure on the other members of the royal family, who are certainly up to it,\" said Sally Bedell Smith, author of \"Prince Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of an Improbable Life.\" \"And having one of the great stars of the royal family, the Princess of Wales, in recuperation from a surgery\" magnifies those strains.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to call the king Wednesday evening to wish him well as he recovers. In-person audiences are expected to resume later this month.\n\nCharles' illness comes at an awkward time for the House of Windsor.\n\nThe king, who ascended the throne just 17 months ago, has pledged to reduce the cost of the monarchy, in part by keeping a lid on the number of \"working royals\" whose public duties are supported by taxpayer funds.\n\nBut with two of the most visible family members out sick, it will be more challenging for the family to keep up.\n\nIn addition to the widely publicized pomp and ceremony of royal processions and state visits, the Windsors attend hundreds of little-known events every year to recognize the accomplishments of the general public and mark local events such as the opening of libraries and community centers. Hundreds of charities cherish royal appearances, which give visibility and credibility to their good work among potential donors.\n\nThe 75-year-old king was seen in public for the first time since his cancer diagnosis when he left his offices at Clarence House on Tuesday after a brief reunion with his younger son, Prince Harry.\n\nHarry arrived in London from California less than 24 hours after Buckingham Palace announced the king's cancer diagnosis. The meeting has raised hopes that the pair can repair their troubled relationship after Harry publicly criticized the royal family for unconscious racism and complained about the way his American biracial wife, former actor Meghan Markle, was treated by palace officials.\n\nHarry and Meghan, once seen as stars of the royal family who could help the Windsors connect with a younger generation, walked away from royal duties in 2020 and now live in California.\n\nPrince William:Prince of Wales likely to step up amid King Charles III's cancer diagnosis, experts say\n\nKing Charles III's health:British monarch diagnosed with cancer following hospitalization for prostate procedure", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/22/uk/future-of-the-monarchy-king-charles-queen-elizabeth-intl-cmd-gbr/index.html", "title": "King Charles III begins his reign with his impartiality in question | CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\nThe death of Queen Elizabeth II marked the end of an era for the monarchy in more ways than one. She was the last senior royal from a generation that will soon seem alien to modern monarchists.\n\nDuring her 70 years on the throne, Elizabeth gave only one media interview which was limited to the subject of her coronation. She never publicly stated a strong opinion on any subject that could be considered political or controversial. She avoided any kind of public intervention into how the public institutions of the UK should be run.\n\nIn fact, the most controversial political moments during Elizabeth’s reign came from the indiscretion of others.\n\nFormer UK Prime Minister David Cameron said that the Queen “purred” in delight when Scotland voted to remain part of the UK in a 2014 independence referendum. The Sun newspaper speculated in 2016 that the Queen supported Brexit, something that former Buckingham Palace communications director Sally Osman was quick to rubbish while interviewed on CNN earlier this week.\n\nCompare this to the royals who now lead the monarchy into a new, more uncertain future. Elizabeth’s eldest child, now King Charles III, embarrassed the family when letters he wrote to former Prime Minister Tony Blair between 2004 and 2005 were published.\n\nKing Charles reacts as a member of the public hands him a drawing of his late mother, as he meets with people waiting in line to pay respects at the Queen's lying in state on September 17, 2022. Aaron Chown/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile the letters seemed fairly innocuous – focusing on things like subsidies for farmers and, amusingly, the merits of publishing private letters such as these – the fact that the first-in-line to the throne was so happy to express political views to the prime minister alarmed those who supported the convention that the monarchy is apolitical.\n\nCharles has also controversially supported using public money to provide homeopathy on the UK’s state-funded National Health Service. NHS England said in 2017 it would no longer fund homeopathy because of a “lack of any evidence for its effectiveness did not justify the cost.”\n\nHowever unimportant knowing Charles’ views on these matters might have seemed at the time, it’s worth remembering that for the entirety of her reign we knew virtually nothing of Elizabeth’s personal views, let alone how she felt government funding should be distributed.\n\n“The monarchy has a huge amount of indirect power in that it can influence public opinion on a matter, which is arguably more important than lobbying ministers,” says Kate Williams, a leading royal historian and professor of public engagement with history at the UK’s University of Reading.\n\nShe points to the time Elizabeth II said that Scottish voters should “think carefully about future” while leaving a church service in Scotland ahead of the referendum in 2014. “While that comment in isolation was probably aimed to be neutral, in the context of the referendum both sides could claim it was an endorsement of rejecting independence,” Williams adds.\n\nScathing views on the media\n\nThe seemingly incompatible mess of a monarch sharing views on such matters while remaining apolitical becomes murkier the further we generationally move from the late Queen.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales were, as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, very public campaigners for mental health. William, who will take the throne after Charles, has spoken on the record about his own struggles with mental health, particularly following the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nWilliam has also used his platform to speak out against racism in football, heavily implying at a time when it was a huge controversy in the sport that he supports players taking the knee before matches, an issue that has prompted a huge backlash for many football clubs in the UK.\n\nAnd the now-first in line has had a difficult relationship with the British media, particularly the BBC following revelations that one of its journalists, Martin Bashir, had used nefarious methods to secure an interview with his mother when she was extremely vulnerable following her divorce from Charles.\n\nWilliam, Prince of Wales leads his brother Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, followed by their cousins before mounting a vigil around the coffin of their grandmother Queen Elizabeth II on September 17, 2022. Ian Vogler/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRight now, support for the monarchy is high. We have witnessed the outpouring of both grief for the late Elizabeth, and sympathy for the new King, taking on the role of his life while mourning his mother. But that doesn’t mean support will remain high forever.\n\nCharles, in a BBC documentary filmed for his 70th birthday in 2018, promised he would not meddle in controversial affairs once he became king. Specifically asked if his campaigning would continue, he said: “No, it won’t. I’m not that stupid.”\n\nHe added: “I’ve tried to make sure whatever I’ve done has been nonparty political, but I think it’s vital to remember there’s only room for one sovereign at a time, not two. So, you can’t be the same as the sovereign if you’re the Prince of Wales or the heir.”\n\nNonetheless, the problem facing both the King and his heir is that they can’t put these comments back in the bottle. And the fact these opinions exist will inevitably affect their relationship with the public in the years that follow, as we move further from the era of the inscrutable Elizabeth.\n\nThat said, republicanism has never been hugely popular in the UK. Even last week, during the official events, the protests were mostly limited to a small group of people, many of whom did little more than hold up pieces of paper. A disproportionate reaction from police, in which some protesters were arrested, led to some media coverage and outcries, but hasn’t moved the dial against the royals in any meaningful way.\n\nAbility to remain neutral undermined\n\nElizabeth was a particularly popular monarch. Most public research on the matter shows that older monarchists think her relative silence, in comparison to her successors, was dignified and preserved the integrity of the Crown.\n\nMany of these traditional supporters, however, have historically been skeptical of Charles and would prefer he followed in his mother’s footsteps.\n\nConversely, the late Queen was popular with younger monarchists in spite of her silence. It’s hard to identify precisely why, but it’s plausibly just a by-product of Elizabeth having always been on the throne and younger people knowing no different.\n\nHowever, what is also clear is that younger monarchists approve the royal family speaking out on issues that would previously have been considered too controversial for the Queen.\n\n“It is entirely possible that the generation who thinks the Royals should maintain a stiff upper lip and not talk about issues like women’s rights and mental health will die out,” says Joe Twyman, director of the political research organization Deltapoll.\n\nPrince William, King Charles III, Princess Anne, and Prince Harry follow the coffin of Queen Elizabeth II during a procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall on September 14, 2022. WPA Pool/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\n“To people from a certain generation, the idea of bowing to your grandmother every time you see her just because she’s the Queen seems insane,” he added, in reference to the row following Meghan Markle’s interview with Oprah Winfrey last year in which she described how surreal she found royal life at times.\n\nThis conflict in the precise role of the monarch is important because the institution lives or dies by whether the public thinks it’s worth it or not.\n\nIt’s likely there will always be traditional monarchists who will defend its every action providing it doesn’t evolve or modernize. They tend to be the most ardent in support.\n\nHowever, this group will probably become a minority before William takes the throne. If Charles lives to 99, as his father did, William will not become King till 2048. No credible social scientist could confidently tell you what public attitudes towards anything will be by then, be it the royal family, climate change, or racial equality.\n\nThe fact that the King and his heir have already said things on all these issues will dramatically undermine their ability to remain neutral on any such issues being raised in the future, something which, however serious the matter, is expected of the Sovereign.\n\nThe fact is their perceived opinions on any of these issues, even if based on past comments, will continue to affect public opinions and therefore policy. If William’s dim view of the BBC leads to more Brits thinking public funding should be pulled in years to come, how will politicians respond to that pressure?\n\nThe monarchy has not had to address these issues for some time because, as long as Elizabeth was on the throne, the public view of the family and its role was largely stable.\n\nThat era is truly over. Now, Charles and William must navigate less certain times, balancing old and new views of who they are against the pressure of being an apolitical head of state. And, unlike Elizabeth, they will do so knowing that the popularity on which they rely will be less guaranteed than it was at any point in the longest-serving monarch’s 70-year reign.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/uk/royal-news-newsletter-12-30-22-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Britain's royal family had a rollercoaster year | CNN", "text": "A version of this story appeared in the December 30 edition of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family. Sign up here.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nThe writing was on the wall. Family reunions, legal troubles, fractured relationships and exiled royals – it was always going to be a tough 12 months for the House of Windsor. But nothing could have prepared Britain’s royal family for the realities of the past year and the seismic shifts it has endured.\n\n2022 should have been a year of celebration, an opportunity to recognize the entry of Queen Elizabeth II into an exclusive club of world leaders who reached the historic milestone of 70 years of service.\n\nFor many Brits, the Queen was the only monarch they’d ever known but instead the summer’s Platinum Jubilee became a swansong that united thousands in London to celebrate her reign one last time.\n\nExuberant partygoers draped in Union Jack flags flocked to the British capital for the long weekend. As expected, the four days of pomp and pageantry were an eclectic and, at times, eccentric British spectacle. But concern for the Queen’s health cast a shadow over the occasion – a stark reminder that her presence was not everlasting.\n\nWith her ongoing health and mobility issues, she only appeared twice: once as events kicked off with the Trooping the Color military parade and at the pageant finale when she took to Buckingham Palace balcony for what would become the final time.\n\nThe Queen gives the public a look at the future of the monarchy, standing on the Buckingham Palace balcony with Britain's next three Kings during the Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June. Leon Neal/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nJust three months later, in September, crowds returned to the famous royal residence as the Queen once more united the nation – this time in grief at her passing.\n\nWith the end of the second Elizabethan Age came a long goodbye. Ten days of mourning and commemoration during which 250,000 people flocked to the Palace of Westminster to pay their respects as the late monarch’s coffin lay in state.\n\nAmong the mourners, presidents, prime ministers and dignitaries from around the world – 2,000 in all – came together for the Queen’s funeral. The mourning period saw a new King grieve publicly as individual family members paid tribute to the late monarch’s lifelong dedication and legacy.\n\nThe funeral arrangements, which had been the subject of much speculation for years, followed centuries of tradition, and allowed many both at home and across the Commonwealth and world to mourn the Queen’s death. Thanks to decades of meticulous planning, the dawn of the new Carolean reign saw Charles III quickly proclaimed before he embarked on a whistlestop tour of each of the UK’s nations.\n\nPreviously unresolved issues such as what kind of role his wife Camilla would have in the future monarchy had been settled by the Queen in the months before her death. One example was her wish for her daughter-in-law to be known as Queen Consort “when the time comes” in a statement issued in February, on the anniversary of her father’s death.\n\nMourners stood in line several miles long from the Palace of Westminster to Tower Bridge and beyond. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nElizabeth II had made several decisions in the twilight of her reign to try and ensure the transition of power to her son was as seamless as possible. Another was to draw a line under the scandals surrounding Prince Andrew – who at the beginning of the year was still facing a protracted court battle in the United States over historical sexual abuse allegations – by stripping him of his cherished titles and duties.\n\nThe Queen understood the monarchy was being tainted by Andrew’s legal woes and removing him from any possibility of a future role in civic life likely helped quell further criticism. Andrew later settled out of court for an undisclosed figure without admitting any wrongdoing and the case was dismissed. But, apparently understanding that the damage to her son’s reputation was irreparable, the Queen had again shown that her institutional duties to the country came first.\n\nWith Charles III now on the throne, it is unlikely we’ll see a reversal of that position. Andrew is still a member of the family and as such was present at Sandringham over the holidays, but the new King is not going to sign off on any kind of return to the royal fold for Andrew. He signaled as much by recently passing on Andrew’s former military titles to other members of the clan. Additionally, the family’s advisers have, in recent years, been promoting a slimmed-down monarchy and the King will want to maintain that in these austere times.\n\nOne issue the Queen wasn’t able to resolve was the growing animosity between Prince Harry and Meghan and other members of the family. The Queen had vaguely pushed back against claims in their Oprah interview by saying “recollections may vary” but that they were still “much loved family members.” However, the bad blood between the Sussexes and other royals remained until her death. And yes, we saw them reunite briefly with the new Prince and Princess of Wales in Windsor to greet mourners. But it’s unlikely that things have improved since the couple’s Netflix documentary came out earlier this month.\n\nHarry and Meghan open up about their bitter split with the royal family in their Netflix show. From Netflix\n\nThe six-hour series was an unfiltered telling of the family separation from the Sussex perspective. And while most of the talking points covered old ground, the claims of institutional gaslighting, bullying behavior and alleged planting of stories in the British press against the couple will not be a moment of the year the family will look back on fondly.\n\nThe response from the palace followed a tried-and-true method: silence. Hours after the final part of the series was released, the Windsors put on a unified front at the Princess of Wales’s Christmas concert in London. While there was likely unhappiness behind palace walls over the barrage of negative headlines, the family opted against any kind of retaliation and instead laid on a stoic showing. The clear message: Keep calm and carry on. The Windsors’ lack of response to the series also signaled that they did not view it as damaging to the institution.\n\nThe Firm will come under the microscope again when Harry’s memoir releases in January and presumably they’ll choose to handle that second Sussex salvo in the same way. Maintaining a dignified silence in the face of potentially detrimental claims is by no means the easy option but the King will not want to get bogged down in family disagreements as his reign begins. Instead, he’ll want to redirect the public’s attention to the power of the monarchy as the family readjusts.\n\nKing Charles III views floral tributes to the late Queen Elizabeth II outside Buckingham Palace in September. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nTo say 2022 has changed the royal family would be a monumental understatement. Few could have predicted just how much change the year would bring. But 2023 isn’t going to be much quieter. The royal diary over the next 12 months is already stacking up and the redrawn family will be hoping it brings some much-needed stability.\n\nWith Charles on the throne, the new family dynamics face fresh scrutiny. Questions remain over whether the new King can bridge the divide that has cleaved his children. But Windsor turmoil aside, the business of the monarchy will continue.\n\nAmong other things next year will also bring the King’s first overseas tour – the first by a British sovereign since 2015. And then of course we have the coronation – royal events don’t get much bigger than this and the King will want to use it to cement his standing and that of the remaining working royals. Charles has signaled a desire to represent all races and religions, and to protect Britain’s diversity – the invited congregation will reflect that. In doing so, he’ll also be hoping to channel his mother’s flair for unity and bring the country and Commonwealth together as his reign gets underway.\n\nA MODERN MONARCHY: WHO’S WHO IN THE HOUSE OF WINDSOR?\n\nFrom CNN’s Ellie Stubbs, Rachel Jung and Sarah-Grace Mankarious\n\nThe last 12 months have seen significant changes throughout the British royal family.\n\nAs members of the Windsor Clan have stepped away from public duties, others have stepped up and roles have shifted.

Helping the monarch to mark an unprecedented 70 years on the throne, British singer-songwriter Craig David joined a stellar line up of global stars for a night of entertainment in front of Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe 41-year-old artist - dressed in a bright blue sequin ensemble that one little royal in particular went “crazy” for – got the crowds jumping with a medley of his biggest hits including “Ain’t Giving up,” “Re-Rewind” and “Fill Me In.” Reflecting on the moment, David recently told CNN it was incredible to be on stage at the iconic location.\n\n“It was such a special moment for the country,” David explained. “I think everyone was looking for something at the end of a pandemic that hit so many people and so many people had lost family members. There was this moment of celebration for the first time in the whole country.\n\nCraig David performs at a concert at Buckingham Palace on June 4 as part of Queen Elizabeth II's platinum jubilee celebrations.

Inside, he met Prince William and his wife, Catherine, who revealed that Prince George had gone “crazy” over the sequin outfit. David also shared that he told the royal couple he’d look into getting George his own smaller version made up.\n\nMark it in your calendars!

While custom dictates that only working members of the royal family wear military uniforms during ceremonial occasions, Andrew was allowed to wear his as a mark of special respect for the Queen. The King, Anne and Edward were also in military dress.\n\nAndrew stepped away from his royal duties in 2019 over his ties to disgraced financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nKing Charles III, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward attend the vigil in Westminster Hall on September 16, 2022.

Sign up here to receive our newsletter every Friday.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nAnd just like that it’s all over. Britain’s Prince Andrew, the Queen’s second son, has reached a deal with Virginia Giuffre to settle her civil sex abuse lawsuit against him.\n\nGiuffre alleges she was trafficked by convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and forced to perform sex acts with his friends, including the senior royal. She also said the Duke of York had been aware she was underage in the US at the time.\n\nGiuffre brought the case last August under the Child Victims Act, a state law enacted in New York in 2019 which temporarily extended the statute of limitations in child sex abuse cases, giving survivors more time to seek justice.\n\nAndrew, 61, repeatedly rejected the allegations against him. Just weeks ago, his lawyers had demanded a jury trial to clear their client’s name.\n\nBut now the looming courtroom showdown is off. On Tuesday, the two sides reached an out-of-court settlement for an undisclosed figure.\n\nIn a letter to federal Judge Lewis Kaplan, the parties stated that while the full financial terms of the agreement would not be revealed, “Prince Andrew intends to make a substantial donation to Ms. Giuffre’s charity in support of victims’ rights.”\n\nAccording to the court document filed by Giuffre’s attorneys, the parties plan to file a stipulation of dismissal of the case within 30 days.\n\nSo, with news of the case’s pending conclusion, let’s unpack a few things.\n\nAndrew has claimed to have no recollection of ever meeting Giuffre or of posing for the infamous photo showing the royal with his arm around the teenager.\n\nA photograph appearing to show Prince Andrew with Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre and, in the background, Ghislaine Maxwell. Florida Southern District Court\n\nHis lawyers have spent months trying to undermine Giuffre, arguing her claims were motivated by money. They wrote in a blistering court filing in October that: “Giuffre has initiated this baseless lawsuit against Prince Andrew to achieve another payday at his expense.”\n\nAnd while Andrew neither confirmed nor denied Giuffre’s claims in Tuesday’s court filing, he has now agreed to a likely multi-million dollar settlement with a woman who leveled grave accusations of sexual abuse against the senior royal.\n\nUK newspapers twisted the knife on Wednesday with numerous headlines suggesting the deal amounted to anywhere between £10 and 12 million ($13-$16 million). The Daily Mail splashed with “Duke’s final ‘£10 million humiliation,” The Sun newspaper ran with “His final disgrace,” while The Daily Telegraph reported “Queen to help pay for £12m settlement.”\n\nQuestions over how Andrew will foot the bill remain. There have been suggestions that the Queen may contribute – but that could be damaging for the monarch, were it ever to be confirmed.\n\nTo date, the Queen has largely avoided becoming the target of public anger over the saga that has engulfed her son. She remains revered, and ‘the firm’ has gone to great lengths to distance itself from the civil suit.\n\nThe Queen and her son chat at the Windsor Horse Show in 2017. Mark Cuthbert/UK Press/Getty Images\n\nA closer look at the phrasing of the document is also revealing. It states that “Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms. Giuffre’s character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks.”\n\nHis team is now recognizing her trauma and praising her bravery at coming forward.\n\n“Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others,” the document continues.\n\nOne of the big criticisms of Prince Andrew has been over his lack of empathy for Epstein’s victims. Giuffre’s lawyer, David Boies, had provided a view of the case from her perspective in January when he told the BBC it was important to his client that the matter “be resolved in a way that vindicates her and vindicates the other victims.” Sigrid McCawley, another attorney for Giuffre, said Tuesday that she was “very pleased with the resolution” of the lawsuit.\n\nThen there’s the question of why this has happened now. The settlement comes at a crucial juncture in the case, as it moved into the discovery stage, during which both sides could demand disclosure of documents and the parties involved would have had to sit for depositions.\n\nAndrew was less than a month away from having to give a statement under oath to Giuffre’s lawyers, who were reportedly planning to fly to London to question him in person. If ever there was a moment to strike a deal, this was it.\n\nPrince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein (far right) pictured together at the Ascot horse races. Tim Graham Photo Library/Getty Images\n\nCNN legal analyst Joey Jackson says it was “a significant development and off ramp” for the duke as with litigation “you always will have revelations that occur.”\n\n“In depositions, for example, where you raise your hand and you swear to tell the truth … in the event that he perjures himself, he opens himself up to some other issues and then obviously it stays in the news,” he continues.\n\n“Not to mention a legal perspective, where after depositions, after discovery, and you go to court and you could lose, and that’s when all types of details may come out that you may not want.”\n\nJackson thinks the duke was left without any option other than to settle, since letting the case drag on “would do him no good nor anyone else related to him any good.”\n\n“I think this was the best option to explore and ultimately to take,” he adds.\n\nHowever, the end of the lawsuit doesn’t mean we’ll see the ninth-in-line to the British throne returning to public duties anytime soon. For the former naval officer, that ship has well and truly sailed.\n\nHis handling of the crisis since Giuffre’s allegations first emerged years ago has left his reputation in tatters.\n\nThe court of public opinion designated him persona non grata after that car-crash interview with the BBC in 2019, during which he was coy about his years-long friendship with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. He said he was at a pizza parlor on the night it is alleged that he had sex with Giuffre. He also said he was medically incapable of sweating, countering allegations from Giuffre that he had perspired profusely before they had sex in 2001, when she was 17.\n\nA settlement leaves many of the issues raised in that interview unresolved.\n\nAnd it’s important to note that the recently convicted Maxwell is now facing life in prison for sex trafficking.\n\nLegal experts say prosecutors could consider continuing their work investigating the crimes of the British socialite and Epstein to determine whether others should be charged – especially if she decides to cooperate.\n\nPrince Andrew has kept a low profile since stepping back from public duties as a senior royal. Steve Parsons/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nThese days the prince spends much of his time on the Windsor estate and is often surrounded by photographers when he attempts to leave his home.\n\nA Buckingham Palace spokesperson told CNN the palace would not be commenting on the latest developments in the case on Tuesday, once again saying it was a matter for the Duke and his legal team.\n\nBut the settlement will likely be welcomed within the palace since it means the court case will no longer cast a shadow over the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations this summer.\n\nThe family has gone to great lengths to distance itself from the scandal surrounding Andrew, with the Queen stripping him of his HRH status as well as his royal patronages and affiliations last month, to make it clear his exile from the royal frontline was permanent.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Andrew still has a constitutional role. He remains a Counsellor of State – and along with Charles, William and Harry – could be called on to pick up some of the Queen’s duties if she were temporarily incapacitated due to illness or if she was traveling.\n\nStreet art featuring Prince Andrew is seen in the Shoreditch area of London on July 1, 2020. Guy Smallman/Getty Images\n\nAndrew’s relinquishment of his public-facing royal role doesn’t change his counsellor status – it would take an act of parliament to revoke that.\n\nHow the prince will move on from this remains to be seen.\n\nThe carefully-crafted settlement letter states that: “He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.”\n\nThat suggests he might become some sort of campaigner for sex abuse survivors – but reputation management experts have previously expressed doubt over Andrew’s ability to repair his image. And it is unclear just how welcome any offer of help from him would be to charities or support groups.\n\nWhile the prospect of an embarrassing public trial is off the table, by settling he has failed to clear his name, and the damage to his reputation has been done.", "authors": ["Lauren Said-Moorhouse Max Foster", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/entertainment/harry-meghan-netflix-documentary-release-intl/index.html", "title": "Harry and Meghan Netflix documentary criticizes royals ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, have taken aim at “unconscious bias” inside the royal family and defended their decision to quit the institution, as their highly anticipated Netflix documentary series threatens to deepen the split between the couple and Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe first three episodes of the project, titled “Harry & Meghan,” were released on Thursday after months of speculation that the couple would star in a tell-all series.\n\nThey detail the pair’s initial romance and Meghan’s first exposure to the structures and demands of royal life, as well as Harry’s childhood, the pervasive nature of Britain’s tabloid media and the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nAnd Harry accuses the royal family of “unconscious bias” that blinded them to the struggles he and Meghan experienced in the years and months leading up to their dramatic departure.\n\nBuckingham and Kensington Palaces will likely be braced for the fallout from the series, after sustained tensions between Harry and his father, King Charles, and brother, Prince William.\n\nHarry took aim at the media within the first few minutes of the show. “No one knows that full truth. We know the full truth, the institution knows the full truth, and the media knows the full truth because they’ve been in on it,” Harry said. He said he considers it his “duty” to “uncover this exploitation and bribery that happens within our media.”\n\nA still from the documentary shows Meghan in tears. From Netflix\n\nThe series comes over a year and a half after the couple’s bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey, which contained a flurry of criticisms of members of the royal family and caused turmoil at the palace.\n\nIt marks a first major public relations test for the monarchy under King Charles III, who himself has been tacitly criticized by Harry since their split from the family, and whose relationship with his son has frayed.\n\n‘Skeletons’ in the royals’ closet\n\n“I accept that there will be people around the world who fundamentally disagree with what I’ve done and how I’ve done it,” Prince Harry said of the watershed decision to leave the royal family in early 2020, which set the stage for years of revelations from the couple and turned their relationships with Harry’s relatives frosty.\n\n“But I knew that I had to do everything I could to protect my family, especially after what happened to my mum,” Harry continued.\n\nThe couple have spoken before about the constraints placed on them while members of the royal family, and that frustration re-emerged repeatedly in the documentary.\n\nMeghan described her engagement announcement in 2017 as an “orchestrated reality show,” calling their first interview as an engaged couple “rehearsed.” And speaking of the media’s initial fascination with the prince’s then-girlfriend, Harry recalled how other members of the royal family struggled to share his concern.\n\n“As far as a lot of the family were concerned, everything that she was being put through, they had been put through as well. So it was almost like a rite of passage,” Harry said. “My wife had to go through that, so why should your girlfriend be treated any differently? Why should you get special treatment? Why should she be protected?,” he said, paraphrasing their arguments.\n\n“I said the difference here is the race element,” Harry added. The pair have frequently railed against racist undertones in tabloid coverage of Meghan, who is biracial.\n\n“These are the skeletons in the closet that frequently make an unwelcome appearance in daily life in this family – sometimes, you know, you’re part of the problem rather than part of the solution and there is a huge level of unconscious bias,” Harry said.\n\n“The thing with unconscious bias – it is actually no one’s fault. But once it has been pointed out, or identified within yourself, you then need to make it right,” he said.\n\nElsewhere in the first batch of episodes, Harry commented on some previous marriages among his relatives and ancestors. “I think for so many people in the family, especially the men, there can be a temptation or an urge to marry someone who would fit the mold as opposed to somebody who you perhaps are destined to be with,” he said.\n\nAnd the pair recall Meghan’s first meetings with the Queen, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and other senior royals.\n\n“I remember my family first meeting her and being incredibly impressed. Some of them didn’t quite know what to do with themselves,” Harry said.\n\n“They were surprised … the fact that I was dating an American actress was probably what clouded their judgement more than anything else at the beginning,” he added. “The actress thing was the biggest problem, funnily enough,” Meghan added.\n\nMeghan is ‘so similar’ to Diana\n\nThroughout the first three episodes of the series, the couple spoke of their frustration at the hands of the notoriously boisterous British media.\n\n“My face was everywhere, my life was everywhere, tabloids had taken over everything,” Meghan said of her early encounters with the press.\n\nHarry also compared Meghan to his mother, Princess Diana, who died in a car crash while being chased by paparazzi in 1997. “So much of what Meghan is and how she is is so similar to my mum … She has the same confidence, she has this warmth about her,” he said in the first episode.\n\nThe first three episodes were released on Thursday, with three more scheduled for next week. Interviews were completed in August, the month before the Queen’s death, according to the series.\n\nIts release follows a period of seemingly thawing relations between Harry and his family following the death of the Queen in September. Harry and William re-united for a walkabout and other public appearances in the period of mourning that followed, and King Charles III used his first speech as monarch to “express (his) love for Harry and Meghan as they continue to build their lives overseas.”\n\nBut new tensions could arise when the second part of the documentary airs next week, which is expected to detail their split from the family and move to the US. Harry’s memoir, titled “Spare,” is meanwhile due to be released in January.\n\nBuckingham Palace said on Thursday that it will not be commenting on the documentary.\n\nA royal source initially CNN that neither Buckingham Palace nor Kensington Palace, nor any members of the royal family, were approached for comment on the content of the series. The Netflix documentary noted within the series that members of the British royal family “declined to comment on the content.”\n\nCNN understands that Kensington Palace did receive an email purporting to be from a third-party production company, via a different, unknown organization’s email address, seeking comment on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s new docu-series that was released on Netflix on Thursday.\n\nThe palace contacted Archewell Productions and Netflix to attempt to verify the authenticity of the email but received no response, CNN understands.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to the US on Wednesday to celebrate the transfer with US President Joe Biden.\n\n“It increases accuracy, it increases the kill rate, so it really does exactly what you want it to do which is protection on the ground on very specific targets,” retired Maj. Gen. James “Spider” Marks previously told CNN of the system’s capabilities.\n\nThe Patriot’s radar system combines “surveillance, tracking, and engagement functions in one unit,” a description from the Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS) says, which makes it stand out among other air defense systems. The system’s engagements with incoming aerial threats are “nearly autonomous” aside from needing a “final launch decision” from the humans operating it.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly asked for the US Army’s Patriot – an acronym for Phased Array Tracking Radar for intercept on Target – system, as it is considered one of the most capable long-range air defense systems on the market. And though the US did not fulfill the request for the first 10 months of the war, a senior administration official told CNN that the “reality of what is going on” on the ground in Ukraine influenced their decision to do so.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Russian military has increasingly attacked Ukraine’s power grid and infrastructure as winter approached and the temperatures dropped. Zelensky told Biden that “Russian missile terror” had knocked out roughly half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.\n\nThose attacks have only further fueled Ukraine’s asks for the Patriot. In fact, the Army calls the Patriot system the service’s “most advanced air defense system,” which can intercept “any aerial threat” under “any weather conditions.”\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, former commander of US Army Europe, told CNN that there is likely some unrealistic expectations about what a Patriot battery will be able to do for Ukraine. It won’t, for example, be available to use immediately after the US agrees to provide it — it takes months to train troops on how to use the complex system, Hertling said, adding that training US troops to serve as maintainers or repairmen takes around a year. And it won’t be able to provide blanket cover for the entire country.\n\n“These systems don’t pick up and move around the battlefield,” Hertling said. “You put them in place somewhere that defends your most strategic target, like a city, like Kyiv. If anyone thinks this is going to be a system that is spread across a 500-mile border between Ukraine and Russia, they just don’t know how the system operates.”\n\nIndeed, Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at CSIS, told CNN that the Patriot is “not a game-changer” because it is “still only able to defend a relatively small piece of dirt.”\n\nNot to mention the significant logistical needs; just one battery is operated by roughly 90 soldiers, and includes computers, an engagement control system, a phased array radar, power generating equipment, and “up to eight launchers,” according to the Army.\n\nCSIS recently said in a report that the missile rounds for the Patriot come in at roughly $4 million each. Rounds that expensive likely won’t be used to shoot down every missile Russia launches toward Ukraine, Hertling said.\n\n“This is not a system that will go after drones or smaller ballistic missiles,” he said. “Can it do that? Absolutely. But when you’re talking about knocking down a $20,000 drone, or a $100,000 ballistic missile that Russia buys, with a $3-5 million rocket, that doesn’t give you much of a return on the investment. What it can do it free up the low and medium systems to go after those kind of targets.”\n\nThe system has been purchased by other US allies, including Israel, Germany, and Japan, and was sent to Poland in an effort to help them defend themselves against Russia as it invaded Ukraine on its border. The US military made clear in March when the Patriot system was sent to Poland that it was purely for defensive purposes of NATO territory and “will in no way support any offensive operations.”\n\nAnd in Ukraine’s case, Hertling says offensive operations are far more important than the Patriot system. CNN first reported last month that the US was considering a dramatic increase in the training provided to Ukrainian forces by instructing as many as 2,500 troops a month at a US base in Germany. The Pentagon said this month that combined arms training of battalion-sized elements, which will include infantry maneuvers and live fire exercises, would begin in January.\n\n“The Patriots are a defensive, anti-ballistic and anti-aircraft weapon system, with the emphasis on defensive,” Hertling said. “You don’t win wars with defensive capabilities. You win wars with offensive capabilities.”", "authors": ["Haley Britzky"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/19/politics/biden-world-leaders-queen-elizabeth-funeral/index.html", "title": "Biden and world leaders attend state funeral for Queen Elizabeth II ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS President Joe Biden on Monday joined a long slate of world leaders for Queen Elizabeth II’s state funeral inside London’s Westminster Abbey, where royal pageantry was on full display to pay tribute to a monarch whose rule spanned seven decades.\n\nWorld leaders, dignitaries, politicians, public figures and European royals were among the 2,000 attendees.\n\nThe service was conducted by the Rev. David Hoyle, the Dean of Westminster, at Westminster Abbey. UK Prime Minister Liz Truss and Patricia Scotland, the Commonwealth Secretary General, read lessons. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby delivered a sermon. Toward the end of the service, the Last Post sounded before a two-minute silence was observed. The state funeral was brought to a conclusion by the Queen’s Piper, who played a Reveille, the National Anthem and a Lament.\n\nInvitations were sent over the weekend to the heads of state of countries with whom the United Kingdom has diplomatic relations. The list of leaders who attended the state funeral was long, and included leadership across the Commonwealth and around the world. Representatives of Syria, Russia, Belarus, Myanmar, Afghanistan and Venezuela were absent. For most nations with an invitation, attendance extended to the head of state plus a guest.\n\nFollowing Monday’s state funeral, the coffin will be conveyed from the hall to Wellington Arch before making its final journey out of London to Windsor. The Queen’s journey will end at St. George’s Chapel, within the grounds of Windsor Castle, where her coffin will be lowered into the Royal Vault below the chapel.\n\nBiden was one of the few world leaders to arrive in his own motorcade at the Queen’s funeral, but for the last 10 days, his aides have worked behind the scenes to ensure he had as small of a footprint as possible while she was laid to rest.\n\nA person familiar with the planning said the White House was very conscious about not making the trip about Biden, reviewing protocol closely in recent days as to avoid any missteps that could potentially distract from the funeral itself. Biden traveled with a smaller staff than is typical for an overseas visit, and his aides decided against scheduling even an informal meeting with Truss while in London.\n\nInstead, the only events on Biden’s schedule were those planned in coordination with the palace, the person said.\n\nMonday’s ceremonial events are the culmination of nearly two weeks of public arrangements, codenamed “Operation London Bridge.”\n\nPlans for the Queen’s funeral have been in place for years, allowing American advisers greater insight into precisely what will happen over the coming days as they make security arrangements. The White House said it received an invitation only for the President and first lady, making for a slimmed-down American footprint.\n\nSecurity in the British capital is at its highest level in memory as dozens of world leaders have convened over the weekend and into Monday to remember the late Queen, who met 13 sitting US presidents during her reign.\n\nIn an interview with Sky News last week, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said of the scale: “If you think about the London Marathon, the carnival, previous royal weddings, the Olympics – it’s all that in one.”\n\nBiden is scheduled to fly back to Washington on Monday afternoon after the funeral. During their brief visit to London, the President and first lady Jill Biden paid their respects to the Queen as she was lying in state, signed condolence books and attended a reception with other leaders and King Charles III.\n\nThe funeral takes place the same week world leaders are slated to convene for the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where Biden will hold his first bilateral meeting with Truss on Wednesday.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and reporting.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/opinions/elizabeth-charles-silence-politics-thomas/index.html", "title": "Opinion: King Charles' biggest problem isn't his crown, but his voice ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Holly Thomas is a writer and editor based in London.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe general consensus was that it was surprisingly good. When Britain’s new King – a title the public is still getting to grips with — addressed the nation for the first time on Friday, there was some apprehension as to what his tone might be.\n\nA more outspoken, less conformist figure than Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles III had in his previous role as Prince tended to sidestep tradition and put his own spin on things. In the end, he toed the line. He paid tribute to his “dear mama,” and vowed to emulate her unwavering commitment to “lifelong service.”\n\nHolly Thomas Holly Thomas\n\nAll in all, the message was touching and dignified, no small feat for a man in the bizarre position of having to hold out for the death of a parent to begin the job of a lifetime. The persistent theme was duty. This was also the watchword of his mother’s seven-decade-long stewardship, and so the British public might be forgiven for assuming it knows what it means. But words are open to interpretation, and while the Crown may be hereditary, a monarch’s sense of duty is not.\n\nFor the Queen, duty translated to impartiality, discretion and predictability. A woman we could set our watches by – a largely mute, always seemly figurehead. She did not always succeed, and her approach was not failsafe insurance against public scrutiny. Charles’ track record suggests a different reading of duty altogether. Against the backdrop of uncertainty left by his mother’s loss, this could rupture the institution that he has sworn to uphold.\n\nAs Prince, Charles regularly saw fit to express his convictions on topics ranging from climate change to herbal remedies. Most infamously, he lobbied the government directly via his so-called “spider memos” of 2004 and 2005 (named in reference because of the Prince’s scrawled handwriting), which were addressed to then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and other senior ministers.\n\nTheir contents ranged from demands related to his agricultural charities to urges that the Blair government reprioritize its defense spending — all of which contravened the monarchy’s unwritten constitutional obligation to remain above politics.\n\nThis was far from a solitary infraction. As recently as June, Charles was, according to the Times, overheard criticizing the government’s policy of deporting migrants to Rwanda. An official spokesperson said at the time that “we would not comment on supposed anonymous private conversations with the Prince of Wales, except to restate that he remains politically neutral” – but did not deny Charles’s reported position, which like many of his views, was in step with much of the British public. But what if the soon-to-be head of state had come out in favor of the scheme?\n\nWhen he turned 70 in 2018, Charles declared that he wouldn’t be so “stupid” as to remain so vocal as King, but it was probably too late already. Decades of campaigns in the name of progress stood in uncomfortable contrast with the archaic privilege that enabled him to lead them. By definition, figures of worship tend to be inaccessible, and the Queen’s apolitical silence created a distance between herself and her subjects that made mythologizing her much easier than it otherwise might have been.\n\nBehind closed doors, she lobbied to conceal her private wealth, but outside, she had the sense to keep her feelings about the world around her close to her chest. In speaking out, Charles underscored the strangeness of an unelected official claiming a free spot on the world stage — and revealed the future King as uncomfortably fallible.\n\nCharles’ forthrightness also dashed a vital piece of potential armor: the benefit of the doubt. The Queen’s reticence to voice her opinions allowed the public scope to project their assumptions onto her, and typically, these were flattering.\n\nAs of this summer, she was the most popular member of the royal family. Her more candid firstborn by contrast boasted just 42% approval, and absent her reassuring presence, he’s standing on even shakier ground. Charles’ reported plan to trim the working Royal Family down to just seven active members suggests he’s well aware of the need to modernize in line with public opinion. Unfortunately, the formalities demanded by a royal death have already pulled recent mortifications back into sharp focus.\n\nAs always, the presence of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on British soil over the last few days has aroused callbacks to their contentious departure from royal duties two years ago. Alleged tensions between the couple and the new Prince and Princess of Wales have spilled into the coverage of the Queen’s death, prompting familiar side-taking among the commentariat.\n\nWorse than all this, the arrest of a heckler as the Queen’s coffin proceeded through Edinburgh on Monday pushed Prince Andrew back into the limelight. According to the Daily Telegraph, the man was heard yelling “You’re a sick old man” at Andrew – and someone else in the crowd responded with “God save the King.”\n\nThe lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre in 2019 claiming that she was forced to engage in sex acts with Prince Andrew when she was underage didn’t just destroy his reputation. It exposed the errancy of even the most faithful interpretation of royal duty. Beyond approving a statement from Buckingham Palace rescinding Andrew’s military affiliations and Royal patronages, the Queen never spoke publicly about the case. But she stood by him in public, and after the Prince reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre earlier this year — acknowledging Giuffre’s suffering but neither confirming nor denying her specific claims against him – the Telegraph reported that the Queen would pay at least part of the £12 million sum.\n\nPerhaps the Queen believed the decision to support her son was personal. Perhaps she reasoned that it was in the public interest to quash the story that had cast the darkest shadow over the monarchy since the death of Princess Diana and threatened to taint her Platinum Jubilee. Perhaps she just believed him, full stop. Whatever she thought, her choice was not, and could never have been, perceived as neutral.\n\nThis is the problem facing Charles today. Innocence once lost is lost forever, and neutrality once surrendered is rarely recovered. In speaking his mind so liberally before he became King, Charles forfeited the chance to assume the throne with a blank slate. But as the Queen also demonstrated during her long reign, and particularly in its last months, every monarch is human, and silence is not necessarily benign.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWhen she chose to stand by Andrew, the public didn’t just see a personal choice. It saw royal patronage. Even if Charles does censor himself from here on out, it is unlikely that the Crown will ever recover its appearance of impartiality again.\n\nChange is already in the air. Over the last few days, anti-monarchy protesters have been led away from mourning crowds in England and Scotland, and Commonwealth leaders have noted the opportunity to “debate constitutional arrangements” presented by the Queen’s death. For the last 70 years, the most powerful argument in favor of the Crown has been the assurance it provided as a fixed point in a turning world. Now, that point is spinning on its axis.", "authors": ["Holly Thomas"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/21/uk/royal-news-newsletter-01-21-21-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Has the departure of two senior royals sparked a constitutional crisis ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in the January 21 edition of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family. Sign up here.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nAfter the Queen’s actions to retire Prince Andrew last week, questions have been raised about his remaining constitutional duty.\n\nAs Counsellor of State he may still be called upon to pick up some of the Queen’s duties if she were temporarily out of action due to illness or if she was traveling.\n\nUnder the Regency Act 1937, the group that the monarch can empower are the next four in line to the throne who are over the age of 21.\n\nThose royals are Princes Charles, William, Andrew and Harry (after skipping over the Cambridge and Sussex children due to their young age).\n\nThe late Prince Philip, as the sovereign’s spouse, would also have been included if he were still alive.\n\nTo activate the counsellors, the Queen issues a directive known as Letters Patent to formally grant authority to two or more counsellors so they can fulfill many of her daily duties that keep the state ticking over. For example, attending Privy Council meetings, signing routine documents and receiving new ambassadors to the UK. They aren’t allowed to do the big stuff such as appointing a Prime Minister or deal with Commonwealth matters – that would have to wait until she was back.\n\nReports emerged in the UK this week suggesting palace officials were considering removing Prince Andrew and Prince Harry from their crucial roles as they are no longer actively working for “the firm.” Harry isn’t even resident in the UK.\n\nBuckingham Palace has not commented on the speculation, but constitutional experts say it makes sense because the Regency Act was drawn up with counsellors in mind that are senior royals already working closely with the sovereign and who understand the everyday duties of the monarch.\n\nPrince Charles speaks with his younger brother, Prince Andrew, at a thanksgiving event marking the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012. Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images\n\n“You’re meant to have a little bit of flexibility as to who can act as Counsellors of State because if the Queen is taken unwell and she’s unable to act, then you have people who can just step in and ensure that all the documents that the Queen would normally just approve in her red boxes just get dealt with in the normal way and the process of government just continues rolling on as smoothly as it normally does,” Craig Prescott, a lecturer in law at Bangor University in Wales, tells CNN.\n\nHe says the current situation “limits what Charles and William could do” but that a solution seems “quite straightforward.”\n\nRather than removing Andrew and Harry from the group – which would require an Act of Parliament – Prescott says other royals should be added to the group through a new Regency Act – as was done for the Queen Mother when she was made an additional Counsellor in 1953.\n\n“You allow for other members of the royal family to become Counsellors of State – Princess Anne and Prince Edward, for example. If they don’t do that, then you could end up with a real headache,” Prescott says.\n\nConstitutional experts suggest candidates to become Counsellors of State include the Queen's other children, Princess Anne and Prince Edward. Mark Cuthbert/UK Press via Getty Images\n\nHe says the palace is likely already exploring how to resolve the present issue to avoid any possible obstacles impeding day-to-day operations of the government, according to his research.\n\n“I’ve seen documents in the National Archives, from the 1970s, where they’ve coordinated diaries of different members of the royal family to ensure that there were sufficient numbers of Counsellors of State in the country to act if required,” he says, highlighting an example of the Queen’s sister Princess Margaret who was once asked to return from the island of Mustique earlier than intended to make sure a gap in schedules was covered.\n\nHe adds: “It is something that they take seriously and so that would lead me to think that they’re taking this problem seriously and thinking about how to solve it.”\n\nWhat is clear is that there isn’t enough slack in the system as it’s currently set up. What if Charles or William aren’t available when they are needed? The only two options would be to pull Andrew out of retirement or Harry back from America. How would the government react to that? And what if they refused?\n\nROYAL TEA BREAK\n\nDuke of York social accounts shut down.\n\nPrince Andrew’s Twitter account has been deleted, days after the Queen stripped him of his honorary military titles and charities. Visitors to his official Twitter page, @TheDukeofYork – which has previously been tagged in posts by the official royal family Twitter handle – are now met with a blank page and a message stating “this account doesn’t exist.” Buckingham Palace has also updated its official website to reflect moves taken by the royal family to distance themselves from the Queen’s second son, who is facing a civil sexual assault trial in the US.

Harry’s legal team said they had initiated the legal challenge in September of last year but decided to make that information public now “in order to set the facts straight” because of a leak in a British tabloid newspaper.\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, speak onstage during Global Citizen Live, New York, on September 25, 2021 in New York City.

In particular, Harry’s privately funded US security team “cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed” while they visit the UK, the representative added.\n\nThe claim follows an incident in London in the summer of 2021 when the prince’s security was compromised as he left a charity event, the statement added.\n\nGet the whole story here.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nQueen ‘shocked and saddened’ by Tonga eruption.\n\nThe Queen has offered her condolences to Tonga after a massive volcanic eruption took place on January 15, about 20 miles from the islands of Tonga. The eruption left much of the country covered in volcanic ash and caused a tsunami that led to flooding. “I am shocked and saddened by the impact of the volcanic eruption and tsunami in Tonga. My thoughts and prayers are with the people of Tonga, as you work together to recover from the damage caused. It must be incredibly difficult for those who are unable to contact friends and family while communications are disrupted, and I hope that they will soon be restored,” the Queen sent to His Majesty Tupou VI, King of Tonga, according to a statement released by Buckingham Palace.

For the latest news on the weather, view our live updates file for Tuesday, Feb. 6.\n\nSAN DIEGO − The tail end of a powerful atmospheric river storm that knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of California homes and businesses was deluging the state Monday with more heavy rain, mudslides, flooding, and several feet of snow in the mountains.\n\nThe brunt of the storm's fury Monday centered on the Los Angeles area, where 1.4 million people were under a flash flood warning – including the Hollywood Hills and Beverly Hills. A local state of emergency was issued for the city of Los Angeles by Mayor Karen Bass on Monday afternoon.\n\nAcross Southern California, the heavy winds that blasted the region Sunday were diminishing, but the National Weather Service warned that an unstable weather pattern could generate waterspouts or small tornadoes.\n\nFlash flooding \"is a much greater threat than any weak tornado that the storm may spawn,\" the weather service said, and dangerous flooding was likely across much of the region from the atmospheric river − the equivalent of a river in the sky that is responsible for extreme rain and snow in the West.\n\nAdditional rainfall totals of 5-8 inches were forecast in some areas, which would bring 48-hour totals as high as 14 inches for some locations, the weather service said. A state of emergency was declared in eight Southern California counties.\n\n\"Life-threatening conditions may evolve extremely fast in some communities,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski warned.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ A debris flow caused significant damage to about five homes in Beverly Hills on Monday, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Although no one was trapped, about 10 people have been displaced, the LAFD said.\n\n∎ The Los Angeles Fire Department reported that 1,000 firefighters were responding to 49 mudslides and debris flows, 130 reports of flooding, half a dozen structure fires and other rescues of motorists stranded in vehicles.\n\n∎ Los Angeles recorded more than 4 inches of rain Sunday, breaking the record for the day by more than an inch. It was the most rain in one day in more than 20 years, and surpassed the average for the month of February.\n\n∎ The AT&T Pebble Beach Pro Am golf tournament in Monterey County, which had postponed Sunday's final round to Monday, canceled play Monday and declared Wyndham Clark the winner despite playing only 54 holes of the scheduled 72-hole tournament.\n\n∎ Officials have attributed three deaths to the storm. In Yuba City, 40 miles north of Sacramento, a man was killed when a redwood tree toppled on him in high winds, police said. Two other men were killed by fallen trees Sunday in Carmichael, a suburb of Sacramento, and in Boulder Creek in Santa Cruz County.\n\nSan Diego residents advised to remain vigilant\n\nSan Diego Mayor Todd Gloria issued an evacuation warning for low-lying, flood-prone areas that were battered by heavy rains last week and flooded out two weeks ago. Some areas outside the city saw up to 7 inches of rain in the last two days.\n\n\"I understand the weariness that must come from these repeated warnings,\" Gloria said. \"I recognize that fatigue may be settling in. But I can assure you this decision to issue this warning is not taken lightly. I ask that everyone remain prepared and vigilant.\"\n\nA flood advisory was issued for the entire county coastline and will be in effect until 8 p.m. Monday, according to the National Weather Service. A flood watch for the county will be in effect until Tuesday.\n\nAccording to Gloria's office, nearly 160 households were referred for temporary placement in hotel rooms.\n\nSanta Barbara cancels evacuation orders\n\nEvacuation orders for Santa Barbara County were canceled Monday after the worst of the storm hit the area overnight.\n\nOfficials had made an early recommendation to close schools in preparation for dangerous conditions, according to Camilla Barnwell, director of communications for the Santa Barbara County Education Office. The office said most schools across the county will reopen Tuesday.\n\n\"One or two schools had some debris that needed to be removed,\" Barnwell told USA TODAY. \"The storm just barely lifted yesterday evening so they were out on campuses today assessing the damage... heavy trees coming down, maybe one school (had) some power issues.\"\n\n'Non-stop rain' in Los Angeles as shelters aid city's homeless population\n\nBetween 5 and 10 inches of rain had fallen in the Los Angeles area with more expected, according to the National Weather Service. Dave Bruno, a meteorologist with the weather service in Los Angeles, said Monday was the third wettest two-day period on record in downtown.\n\nShelters were adding beds for the city’s homeless population of nearly 75,000 people.\n\nGeorgia Berkovich, chief communications officer of The Midnight Mission, said there has been \"non-stop rain.\" She added that The Midnight Mission, which is a Los Angeles-based human service organization, has opened its dining room for shelter and provides resources to people, including hot meals and 24-hour restrooms.\n\nAbout 100 people came to The Midnight Mission \"just to get out of the element,\" Berkovich told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Once your clothes are wet it’s over. People are freezing to their core,\" she said. \"So strange in LA we have this great climate but people die of exposure, die on our streets all the time.\"\n\nStorm by the numbers\n\n∎ A rough calculation estimates that 5.6 trillion gallons of water has fallen across California the past two days, according to FOX Weather meteorologist Greg Diamond.\n\n∎ AccuWeather estimates the preliminary total damage and economic loss from the intense storms and record rainfall in California this week will be between $9 billion and $11 billion.\n\n∎ The 11.87 inches that fell in 24 hours at UCLA’s weather station was a 1-in-1,000 year rainfall event. Technically known as a \"1,000-year recurrence interval event,\" according to meteorologist Jacob Feuerstein, a 1-in-1,000-year rain event is a statistical way of expressing the probability of such a huge rainfall occurring in any given year in a given location, according to NOAA.\n\nMud flows through multimillion-dollar homes\n\nSeveral multimillion dollar houses in the Hollywood Hills were damaged as mud, rocks and debris oozed and rolled through the area Monday. Sixteen people were evacuated, city officials said.\n\n“I can’t believe it,\" Keki Mingus of Studio City, California, said, as water rushed down her road around dawn on Monday. \"It looks like a river that’s been here for years. I’ve never seen anything like it.”\n\nWind, snow hammer Mammoth Mountain\n\nThe storm unleashed howling winds and huge snow totals in the mountains. The National Weather Service recorded a wind gust of 125 mph at the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area late Sunday. That same location received a storm total of 39 inches as of Monday morning.\n\nWhere is the storm headed next?\n\nAfter battering California on Monday, the storm's moisture will help fuel heavy snow across the West, and heavy rain in the normally arid Desert Southwest over the next few days, forecasters said. \"Rainfall totals generally between 1-3 inches may lead to some scattered instances of flash flooding,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nFlood watches were in effect throughout portions of southern Arizona and southern Nevada because of the threat of heavy rain and flooding.\n\nClimate change, El Nino conspire to fuel storms\n\nMultiple weather and climate phenomena are conspiring to make these storms particularly damaging. Warm water provides energy to storms, and record-high ocean water temperatures, likely from climate change, are being detected around the world. Additionally, the Pacific Ocean is also seeing the effects of El Nino, where weakening trade winds reduce the upwelling of ocean waters and allow surface waters to bake in the sun and grow warmer still. And California, coming off years of drought and wildfires, is particularly vulnerable to mudslides and flooding.\n\n\"The atmospheric river firehose is aimed at Los Angeles,\" tweeted meteorologist Ryan Maue. \"The onslaught has just begun from this treacherous bomb cyclone.\"\n\n102-mph wind gust recorded in San Francisco Bay area\n\nIn Northern California, the storm swamped streets and toppled trees and power lines across the San Francisco Bay area. A rare hurricane-force wind warning had been posted for the area, and winds exceeded 60 mph with wind gusts recorded as high as 102 mph in Marin County − the equivalent of a Category 2 hurricane.\n\nIn nearby San Jose, first responders went door-to-door warning residents of the flood threat and removing unhoused people from riverbeds. They pulled travelers out of the windows of a car stranded by floodwaters and rescued several people and dogs from an island in the Guadalupe River as it became overwhelmed by high waters.\n\nUnited States Weather Alerts\n\nStorm is second to blast state in days\n\nThe storm slammed California just days after much of the state was soaked with up to 6 inches of rain by the first storm in the \"Pineapple Express,\" so-called because moisture builds up in the tropical Pacific around Hawaii and can roll across the ocean and pound the U.S. and Canada's west coasts with heavy rainfall and snow. The current storm is packing more moisture and overwhelming already-saturated regions.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's office said the state had a record number of emergency assets responding to the \"serious storm with dangerous and potentially life-threatening impacts.\" Those impacts included almost 600,000 homes and businesses without power Monday.\n\nLife-threatening flood threat:Heavy rain and powerful winds clobber California\n\nLandslide hits Hollywood Hills\n\nIn the Hollywood Hills the weather serviced warned Monday of an \"extremely dangerous situation unfolding\" with life threatening landslides and flash flooding. Several families had to evacuate when a mudslide caused a gas leak. A neighborhood in Studio City was forced to evacuate after a slide severely damaged multiple homes. In suburban Tarzana, three homes were swamped by debris flow with firefighters aiding the evacuation of residents.\n\nFlooding and small mudslides were also reported across Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Malibu and Beverly Hills.\n\n“Life-threatening flash flooding is ongoing and will continue into the morning hours of Monday,” the weather service said.\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Lindsay Horvath urged residents near wildfire burn areas of Topanga and Soledad canyons to get out ahead of possible mudslides. The county set up shelters for evacuees.\n\n“If you have not already left, please gather your family, your pets, your medications and leave immediately,” Horvath said at a Sunday briefing.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/20/world/southern-china-southern-severe-flood-rain-climate-crisis-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Hundreds of thousands affected by floods, landslides as heaviest ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAlmost half a million people have been affected by floods and landslides in the Chinese province of Guangdong, according to authorities, after parts of southern China were hit by the heaviest downpours in 60 years over the weekend.\n\nFlooding caused by the torrential rain has forced 177,600 people to relocate, destroyed 1,729 houses, damaged 27.13 hectares of crop and caused losses of more than $250 million, Guangdong’s Department of Emergency Management said Tuesday.\n\nGuangdong is one of at least seven provinces where the record rainfall has caused severe landslides and flooded roads, according to state media. In southwestern Guizhou province, swollen rivers spilled over roads, sweeping away cars and homes, videos on social media showed.\n\nThe downpours come amid warnings by experts that extreme weather is becoming more frequent.\n\nPrecipitation in Guangxi, Guangdong and Fujian reached its highest since 1961, local weather bureaus said on Saturday, as those areas recorded an average rainfall of 621 millimeters (24.4 inches) in the 46 day period from May 1 and June 15, according to state news agency Xinhua. That figure is equal to more than 90% of the countrywide average of 672.1 millimeters for the whole of 2021, based on data by the National Climate Center.\n\nWeather experts say conditions are ripe for further heavy rainstorms in the south of the country and heatwaves in the north.\n\n“Cold and warm air has converged over southern China, and the two sides have entered a deadlock and a tug of war,” Wang Weiyue, an analyst at weather.com.cn, an arm of the China Meteorological Administration, told Reuters.\n\nHeavy rain is forecast to persist until Tuesday in the southern provinces of Guizhou, Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang and Guangxi and then move northward.\n\nExtreme weather warning\n\nChina’s annual flood season traditionally begins in June and is usually most severe in the densely populated agricultural areas along the Yangtze River and its tributaries.\n\nBut it has been growing more intense and dangerous in recent years and experts have warned things could get worse.\n\nIn April, the National Climate Center warned that extreme torrential rains were expected to lash southern and southwestern parts of the country, as well as the normally dry desert terrain of southern Tibet.\n\nA 2022 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said it had “high confidence” that daily precipitation extremes had increased in parts of the region and that heavy precipitation would “increase in frequency and intensity,” leading to more frequent landslides in mountainous areas.\n\nChina recorded average annual rainfall of 672.1 mm last year, which was 6.7% above normal, according to a report released by the National Climate Center in May. The report concluded that China’s weather anomalies were getting worse, especially in terms of rainstorm intensity during the summer months.\n\nThe record rainfall comes amid efforts by China to tackle climate change.\n\nThe country’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment last week announced a new national climate change strategy to build resilience against the effects of global warming by 2035. The roadmap puts more emphasis on monitoring climate change and its related effects as well as developing early warning and risk management systems.\n\nAt least 1.1 million residents in China’s southeastern province of Jiangxi were affected by floods and downpours between May 28 and June 11, according to state news agency Xinhua, while 223,000 hectares of agricultural farmland in the timber and bamboo producing province were destroyed.\n\nIn early June, torrential rains in southern China killed at least 32 people. More than 2,700 houses were severely damaged and 96,160 hectares of farmland were destroyed in the rice-producing province of Hunan.\n\nHigh alert\n\nLast summer, 398 people were killed as devastating floods ripped through central Henan province. Among the dead were 12 passengers who drowned in a submerged subway line. The provincial capital of Zhengzhou saw the most deaths in what authorities called a “once in a thousand years” downpour.\n\nState authorities have been on high alert ever since, amid growing questions over how prepared Chinese cities are for extreme weather.", "authors": ["Kathleen Magramo"], "publish_date": "2022/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2024/02/06/southern-california-weather-floods-mudslides-atmospheric-river/72488247007/", "title": "California weather live updates: Tornado warning, flood threats remain", "text": "The lingering storm system that slammed California for several days brought record-setting rainfall and caused hundreds of mudslides by Tuesday as the storm moved inland.\n\nA large swath of Southern California remained under flood alerts through Tuesday as the storm was expected to drop up to 3 inches of rain in Los Angeles and San Diego from Tuesday to Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. The additional rainfall raised concerns of flooding and mudslides because the ground is heavily saturated in many areas.\n\nSome heavy rain is also expected late Tuesday before the region begins to dry out, according to Tyler Kranz, a meteorologist with the weather service.\n\nSince Sunday, downtown Los Angeles has been inundated with six months' worth of rainfall, the weather service said. In just two days, the area received more than 7 inches of rain — making this month the 13th wettest February on record.\n\n“Our hillsides are already saturated. So even not-very-heavy rains could still lead to additional mudslides,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said during an evening news conference. “Even when the rain stops, the ground may continue to shift.”\n\nThe San Diego region will remain under flood watch through the evening as \"excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations,\" the weather service said. Southern parts of San Diego County received a rare tornado warning Tuesday, which expired in the afternoon.\n\nVideos showed commuters navigating flooded streets and roadways blocked by downed trees and power lines. Cars were seen trapped by mudslides.\n\nThe intensity of the rain is expected to slightly dwindle from what occurred over the weekend as the storm system headed east into the desert, forecasters said. The potential for flash flooding began expanding into Nevada, Arizona and Utah on Tuesday and will continue into Wednesday.\n\nA half an inch to an inch of widespread rain was predicted for the southwest part of Arizona, with higher levels locally, and up to 1.5 inches across south-central Arizona, with locally higher levels coming in through thunderstorms, officials said. Flood watches were in effect in southwest Arizona and portions of south-central areas of the state.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The NWS issued a rare tornado warning for three cities northeast of central San Diego until 12:45 p.m. local time on Tuesday. The warning applies to the cities of El Cajon, La Mesa, and Santee.\n\n∎ A flood watch across Ventura and parts of Santa Barbara counties is in effect until 5 p.m. as the storm threatens to drop up to 1 inch of rain per hour in some areas. The heavy rainfall carries a \"risk for dangerous flooding, especially over freeways and local roads.\"\n\n∎ About 143,000 people across California were without power Tuesday morning, according to a database maintained by USA TODAY.\n\n∎ A debris flow caused significant damage to about five homes in Beverly Hills on Monday, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Although no one was trapped, about 10 people have been displaced, the department said.\n\nFire chief to LA residents: 'Do not let your guard down'\n\nKristin Crowley, chief of the Los Angeles Fire Department, said at a news conference on Tuesday that the impacts of the atmospheric river storm have not entirely subsided and \"will continue to cause hazardous road conditions and increase the chance of mudslides and flooding.\"\n\nCrowley asked residents to monitor their phones for warnings, especially those who live on hillsides. She urged people to stay away from the Los Angeles River after a person was rescued from the rushing waterway by firefighters Monday night.\n\n\"As the storm continues to impact our city, do not let your guard down,\" she said.\n\nBy Tuesday morning, emergency crews had responded to at least 475 mudslides and 390 fallen trees across Los Angeles, according to the mayor’s office. The mudslides caused road closures and ongoing evacuation orders in canyon neighborhoods with \"increased risk of significant flooding, mudslides, and sediment flow because of the burn scars\" from recent wildfires.\n\nSeven buildings were also deemed uninhabitable, the mayor's office said. And at least 10 were yellow-tagged, meaning residents could return to get their belongings but could not stay there because of the damage.\n\nStorm kills at least 7 people\n\nOfficials have attributed at least seven deaths as a result of the storm, including several people crushed by fallen trees in Northern California. A 63-year-old woman was found dead Tuesday under a large tree in her backyard in Fair Oaks, Sacramento County officials said.\n\nThe California Highway Patrol said a 69-year-old man died Monday after his truck went down an embankment and filled with water in Yucaipa, about 80 miles east of Los Angeles. Another accident in nearby Fontana killed a 23-year-old man after the car he was in crashed into a tow truck in the rain, the agency said.\n\nSomeone trying to enter the United States was swept up by a swollen Tijuana River channel and died early Tuesday at the California-Mexico border, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe storm pounded Los Angeles with rain and heavy winds, damaging multi-million dollar homes across the city and sending workers at homeless shelters scrambling for more beds. Sixteen people were evacuated and several homes near the Hollywood Hills were red-tagged.\n\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department said 1,000 firefighters had dealt with more than 100 reports of flooding and rescues of motorists stranded in vehicles on inundated roadways. Shelters added beds for the city’s homeless population of nearly 75,000 people.\n\nAccuWeather estimated that the state's preliminary total damage and economic loss will be between $9 billion and $11 billion.\n\nThe 11.87 inches that fell in a 24-hour span on Monday was a 1-in-1,000 year rainfall event, according to the weather station at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nStorm to bring heavy rain to Las Vegas, Phoenix\n\nAreas of Arizona and Nevada were under flood warnings on Tuesday as the slow-moving storm moved East from California.\n\nAccording to AccuWeather, the storm posed a risk of flash floods, including across major cities such as Las Vegas and Phoenix. Forecasters anticipate the heaviest rain to hit Las Vegas Tuesday afternoon, while Phoenix residents will feel the most intense impacts overnight and into Wednesday.\n\n\"While even a quick downpour can lead to street and highway flooding in the region, the heaviest rain, from 1-2 inches, is most likely to occur on the south- and southwest-facing mountainsides in Arizona,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Adam Douty said.\n\nNorthern Arizona was forecast to receive significant snowfall, reported the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network. Flagstaff and Williams were forecast to receive 9 to 13 inches of snow and Forest Lakes, near Show Low, could get between 13 and 19 inches.\n\nStorm breaks multiple rainfall records from LA to Oceanside\n\nOn Monday, the atmospheric river storm broke several rainfall records across Southern California, according to the weather service.\n\nDowntown Los Angeles received 2.93 inches of rain on Monday, surpassing the previous record of 2.30 inches, set 123 years ago in 1901, the weather service said. Further south, in Oceanside, a city 40 miles north of San Diego, Monday's rainfall total was more than an inch over the previous record set in 1948.\n\nNew rainfall records were also set in Anaheim, Vista and San Jacinto, the weather service said.\n\nContributing: Arizona Republic, Associated Press, John Bacon, Thao Nguyen, Doyle Rice, Kayla Jimenez\n\nCalifornia weather map", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/12/30/california-weather-storms-landslides-flooding-snow/10973150002/", "title": "California weather: Storms bring landslides, flooding; snow forecast", "text": "LOS ANGELES – California saw intense flooding and landslides across the state Friday as a wave of tropical moisture moved across the drought-stricken West from the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe storms, the result of an atmospheric river of moisture — a long and wide plume of moisture pulled in from the Pacific, led to landslides of rock and mud closing multiple roads in the San Francisco area, between Fremont and Sunol, as well as in Mendocino County near the unincorporated community of Piercy and in the Mendocino National Forest.\n\nIt was just the start in a series of storms forecast to move across the West Coast and usher in the new year, according to forecasters at Accuweather.\n\nAnywhere from 8 to 16 inches of rain are forecast across Northern and Central California over the next several days, with some locations seeing the potential for up to 20 inches Friday and Saturday, according to Alex Sosnowski, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather. In San Francisco, 2 to 4 inches of rain was forecast and another 4 to 8 inches was predicted for Sacramento, Sosnowski added.\n\nThe storms are also forecast to drop more than 4 feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada , upping the chances of avalanches as snow levels shift, AccuWeather said, though forecasters say only the highest mountain peaks — higher than 8,000 feet — would likely be impacted by the snow.\n\nThe current system is expected to be warmer and wetter, while next week’s storms will be colder, lowering snow levels in the mountains, said Hannah Chandler-Cooley, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Sacramento. But the washing away of snow also raises the chances of flooding in nearby communities.\n\nThe rain and snow could help slightly to replenish diminishing reservoirs but likely won't be enough to make up for another dry year in California. The past three years have been the state's driest on record.\n\nLocal officials across Northern and Central California warned residents of the weather, with officials in Sacramento County advertising sandbag locations and the city of Stockton opening shelters to help residents combat the cold weather and heavy rainfall.\n\nMORE IN THE STOCKTON AREA:Flood watch issued in San Joaquin Valley, Northern California ahead of weekend storm\n\n\"We haven't had a lot of water in a long time,\" city spokesperson Connie Cochran said. \"In these conditions, you have to drive more carefully. Slow down. If you do encounter areas where the local streets are flooded or there's standing water, avoid driving through it. Don't drive through standing water.\"\n\nSacramento’s fire officials planned to broadcast evacuation announcements from a helicopter and a boat along the American River — a spot where many unhoused people live in encampments — to warn of flooding.\n\nHumboldt County, where a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck on Dec. 20, also saw roadways begin to flood, according to the National Weather Service’s Eureka office. A bridge that was temporarily closed last week due to earthquake damage may be closed again if the Eel River, which it crosses, gets too high, officials said.\n\nContributing: Hannah Workman, The (Stockton, Calif.)

In Northern Nevada, tens of thousands of people were without power and authorities opened warming shelters as temperatures plummeted.\n\n►California isn't alone in bracing for dangerous weather. A winter storm was moving across the Midwest on Monday and Tuesday with areas of heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain, the National Weather Service warned. Gusty winds will result in blowing and drifting snow, causing reduced visibility and difficult travel, the weather service said.\n\n►Farther south, a strong cold front brought the threat of thunderstorms with tornadoes, damaging winds and excessive rainfall. The National Weather Service issued a tornado watch covering more than 1.2 million people living in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, with isolated hailstorms and 70 mph gusts predicted.\n\nUp to 8 inches of rain possible north of San Francisco\n\nSan Francisco and some nearby coastal areas could see another 2 to 4 inches of rain, and residents just north of the Bay Area could see rainfall totals reaching 4 to 8 inches, according to AccuWeather. The Los Angeles area could see up to 2 inches of rain. The storms will result in a \"high risk of dangerous and perhaps life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides,\" especially in the northern and central parts of California, AccuWeather said.\n\nRintaro Restaurant in San Francisco's Mission neighborhood was swamped by more than 3 feet of floodwaters Saturday, owner Sylvan Mishima Brackett told the local ABC-TV affiliate.\n\n\"We had half of us standing on the tables, the rest of us inside,\" he said. \"At one point, there was nothing we could do but evacuate.

Flooding caused by rainfall and the swelling Mokelumne and Cosumnes rivers may rapidly inundate some areas, the National Weather Service warned. Residents were urged to monitor forecasts and be prepared to evacuate, the weather service said.\n\nEmergency crews rescuing motorists on Sunday found one person dead inside a submerged vehicle near Highway 99, Dan Quiggle, deputy fire chief for operations for Cosumnes Community Service District Fire Department, told The Sacramento Bee.\n\nLower Mississippi Valley could see tornadoes, hail\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center has issued an enhanced risk warning for severe thunderstorms for East Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia through Tuesday morning. The hazards could include lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail and a few tornadoes, the center said.\n\nAccuWeather said a dip in the jet stream will bring strong upper-level winds into the southern U.S. Combined with moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and substantially above-average temperatures, severe weather is likely.\n\n\"The extent of the tornado threat will depend on whether storms can remain separated, which would allow for a few intense, large tornadoes to form,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Haley Taylor said. \"If this does not occur, and storms form into a line, damaging winds would become the primary hazard.\"\n\nContributing: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2023/08/20/hurricane-hilary-live-updates-storm-nears-baja-palm-springs-road-closures-state-of-emergency-declare/70635806007/", "title": "Hurricane Hilary updates: 1-10 east and west closed amid flooding", "text": "The Coachella Valley — which was under an unprecedented tropical storm warning until it was lifted around 2 a.m. Monday — is experiencing heavy flooding and other damage after Tropical Storm Hilary churned through the region on Sunday.\n\nLatest road closures across the Coachella Valley\n\nSeveral roads continue to be closed due to storm damage and flooding across the Coachella Valley, leaving significant clean-up work to allow residents to travel across the valley again.\n\n“This storm has been unlike anything our community has faced before.

The district said it expects the shelter to be open until Monday or Tuesday afternoon, with more information to be sent out as the storm continues.\n\n—Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nPalm Springs declares local emergency\n\nPalm Springs City Manager Scott Stiles has declared a local emergency because of the storm, city spokesperson Amy Blaisdell said.\n\nShe said the declaration opens up access to extra resources, such as funds for repairs from storm damage and more flexibility with emergency purchases.\n\nCity law gives the manager the authority to proclaim a local emergency, but it must be ratified by the city council within seven days or it becomes invalid.\n\nMore road closures across valley\n\nMore roads are closing across the Coachella Valley as police advise residents not to drive. Closures were being announced frequently; below is only a partial list:\n\nPalm Springs: Police announced the closure of two more roads in Palm Springs. Farrell Drive was closed between Ramon Road and Mesquite Road.\n\nEl Cielo Road was also closed at Mesquite Avenue, while the Dinah Shore Bridge is closed from Palm Springs to Cathedral City. Golf Club Drive is also closed at the Whitewater Wash.\n\nIndian Canyon Drive, Gene Autry Trail and Vista Chino were already closed at the washes.\n\nCathedral City: Cathedral Canyon Drive and Dinah Shore Drive were also closed by Cathedral City Police. Los Gatos Road at Date Palm Drive was already closed.\n\nEast valley: 66th Street was closed between Van Buren Street and Jackson Street. Box Canyon Road from Interstate 10 to the All American Canal was closed in the Mecca area.\n\nEven in areas where roads weren't fully closed, conditions were treacherous. Just after 4 p.m., two of the three eastbound lanes of Highway 111 were closed due to rocks in the road at the Cathedral City-Rancho Mirage border.\n\nPalm Springs Police Lt. Gustavo Araiza advised residents to avoid travel in the city unless absolutely necessary and to drive with extreme caution if they must.\n\n“We don’t need collisions tying up resources,” he said.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio, Jay Calderon\n\nNewsom, Palm Springs officials discuss storm preparedness, bridge request in Sunday visit\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom stopped in Palm Springs on Sunday as Tropical Storm Hilary wrecked havoc on the Coachella Valley. He met with Palm Springs city councilmembers and staff in the city’s emergency operations center.\n\nNewsom issued a State of Emergency for much of Southern California on Saturday to support the Hilary response and recovery efforts as the state continues mobilizing and coordinating resources ahead of the storm's forecasted impacts.\n\nThe city posted photos of the visit on its Facebook page Sunday, explaining that city staff updated the governor on the city’s storm preparations while Newsom offered “whatever assistance he could provide to the city.” The post noted that Newsom had been “instrumental in bringing Oakland Urban Search and Rescue and Swift Water California OES Task Force teams to Palm Springs,\" where they were going to be used to assist with rescues during the storm.\n\nThey also discussed the city's request for an elevated bridge on North Indian Canyon Drive over the Whitewater Wash. The Coachella Valley Association of Governments has been trying to secure funding for such a bridge, which would reduce the need for rain and wind-related closures.\n\nPhotos show Newsom adding his name to the Emergency Operations Center sign-in sheet during his visit. Palm Springs Mayor Grace Garner, City Councilmember Lisa Middleton, City Manager Scott Stiles, Police Chief Andrew Mills and Fire Chief Paul Alvarado are pictured meeting with Newsom during the visit.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nUpdated rain totals: Palm Desert sees 1.18 inches by 2 p.m.\n\nHeavy rain has moved through the Coachella Valley and brought soaking rains that have flooded many streets and intersections. Here are the latest rain totals from the National Weather Service as of 2 p.m., with rain still falling.\n\nPalm Desert 1.18 inches\n\nCathedral Canyon 1 inch\n\nThermal airport 0.91 inches\n\nPalm Springs Airport 0.89 inches\n\nLower Tahquitz Creek 0.86 inches\n\nFlash flood, severe thunderstorm warning issued for some Coachella Valley cities\n\nThe National Weather Service in San Diego has issued Flash Flood Warnings for most of the Coachella Valley until 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nSome locations that will experience flash flooding include Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage, Indian Wells, Indio, Coachella, Thermal, La Quinta, Mecca and the Santa Rosa Mountain.\n\nAt 1:51 p.m., doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated heavy rain falling across the warned area. The expected rainfall rate is 0.5 to 1 inch in 1 hour. Hourly rainfall rates in Palm Desert have exceeded 0.75 inches per hour. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.\n\nAt 1:40 p.m., doppler radar indicated heavy rain across the warned area. Rainfall rates of three-quarters of an inch per hour are occurring.\n\nFlash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly. The weather service warns life threatening flash flooding is possible from heavy rain, particularly of creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses.\n\nMotorists should turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles.\n\n— Matt Solinsky\n\nHurricane Hilary: Heavier rain, winds forecast for Palm Springs area Sunday\n\nThe Coachella Valley remains under a tropical storm warning on Sunday morning, and a flood watch is in effect until 5 p.m. on Monday. Light rain is falling at Palm Springs International — as of 8 a.m., 0.32 inches had fallen since midnight — and the temperature is a cool 78 degrees with 88% humidity and 6-mph winds out of the southwest, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBut more rain, and heavier wind, is on the way. Thunderstorms are in the forecast throughout the day, with an additional two to four inches of rain expected in the valley, along with wind gusts of up to 40 to 50 mph. Temps are expected to top out at 86 degrees.\n\nNWS Meteorologist Adam Roser said the biggest threat in the Coachella Valley is \"definitely flash flooding.\"\n\n\"Many of the mountain roads going into the valley are very vulnerable,\" he said. \"As are any of those that go over those washes and things like that.'\n\nRoser said most of the rain will fall in heavy bands that could potentially produce 2 inches of rain an hour in the afternoon. There also remains a small chance of tornadoes in the valley, he said.\n\n\"WIth tropical storm systems, any tornadoes are usually weak and brief, but the storm prediction center does have around a 5% chance of a tornado occurring in the area,\" he said.\n\nThe rain and wind will likely be finished by the time most people are waking up on Monday morning, Roser said.\n\n— Kate Franco, Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nHow much rain has fallen so far?\n\nSo far, Tropical Storm Hilary has brought a light but steady rainfall to the Coachella Valley, but weather forecasts advise the rain should become heavier on Sunday afternoon and evening.\n\nAs of noon, official National Weather Service rain totals included 0.40 at Palm Springs International Airport, 0.46 in Thermal at the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport, 0.46 in Thousand Palms and 0.36 in Palm Desert.\n\n—Matt Solinsky\n\nHilary makes landfall over Baja California\n\nThe now-downgraded Tropical Storm Hilary made landfall along Mexico's Baja California coast Sunday as concerns mounted over the storm causing what could be deadly flash flooding in the border city of Tijuana, Southern California and places as far north as Idaho that rarely get such heavy rain.\n\nHilary hit the coast in a sparsely populated area about 150 miles south of Ensenada.\n\nThe storm has already caused flooding in places across Mexico’s arid peninsula and threatens to unleash torrential rains on mudslide-prone Tijuana, where many improvised houses cling to steep hillsides just south of the U.S. border.\n\nForecasters warned the storm could cause extreme flooding, mudslides and even tornadoes. Parts of the U.S. Southwest could be hit with once-in-a-century rains and there is a good chance Hilary could break all-time records as the wettest known tropical cyclone to douse Nevada, Oregon and Idaho.\n\nAs of 11 a.m. Pacific time, Hilary was located about 215 miles south-southeast of San Diego, the National Hurricane Center reported. Hilary had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and was moving northwest at 25 mph.\n\nThe Mexican cities of Ensenada and Tijuana, directly in the storm’s path, closed all beaches and opened a half-dozen shelters at sports complexes and government offices.\n\n—The Associated Press\n\nEvacuation order near Banning\n\nRiverside County has issued an evacuation order north of Banning and near the Morongo Reservation as the worst of Tropical Storm Hilary's impacts approach.\n\nThe county's emergency management department announced the order late Sunday morning for the Mias zone in the Apple/ElDorado burn scar.\n\n—City News Service\n\nSplash House says it will carry on amid storm\n\nOrganizers of Splash House said the Palm Springs pool party and music festival will go on Sunday despite Tropical Storm Hilary's expected inundation of the Coachella Valley and the rest of Southern California.\n\nEarlier in the weekend, the festival had been moved inside at the three hotels where it's held, which are miles apart.\n\n\"We're gonna keep it real with you — we're not big fans of today's projected weather,\" organizers wrote in an Instagram post about 10 a.m. Sunday. \"But we are big fans of keeping this party going safely. Let's take things inside and close out this weekend in unprecedented style!\"\n\nEvents will be at the Renaissance, Margaritaville Resort and Saguaro Palm Springs hotels between about 1 p.m. and 9 p.m., according to an online schedule.\n\n\"Shuttles with run as planned between hotels,\" the Instagram post said, without addressing the possible heavy rain — predicted to be as much as two inches an hour at times Sunday afternoon.\n\nLocal and national officials, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, have advised people to stay indoors and off the roads during the storm.\n\nLater, organizers seemingly acknowledged the storm could make it hard for festival attendees from out of town to drive or fly out as scheduled. They posted a list of hotels that were offering late checkout and discounted rates for extending stays.\n\n—Eric Hartley\n\nMost flights canceled out of Palm Springs on Sunday\n\nAhead of the anticipated impacts from now Tropical Storm Hilary, a majority of airlines have canceled flights in and out of Palm Springs International Airport on Sunday.\n\nAs of 9 a.m., only five of 15 flight arrivals through 6 p.m were still scheduled. United, American and WestJet all canceled flights into the airport. Southwest Airlines canceled its entire Sunday schedule at the airport a day earlier.\n\nDelta’s flight from Salt Lake City to Palm Springs that arrives at 12:18 p.m. Sunday was one of the few still scheduled.\n\nEight of 10 evening flight arrivals into Palm Springs were still scheduled, as were several evening departures, but airport officials cautioned anyone flying to check ahead with their airline before arriving at the airport.\n\n—Matt Solinsky\n\nHurricane Hilary within striking distance of Baja early Sunday\n\nThe National Weather Center in Miami said in the most recent advisory at 2 a.m. that Hurricane Hilary was about 30 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and 385 miles from San Diego, California. The maximum sustained wind speed remained unchanged at 85 mph while spreading “heavy rains” northward over the peninsula.\n\nMeteorologists warned that despite weakening, the storm remained treacherous. Forecasters said the storm was still expected to enter the history books as the first tropical storm to hit Southern California in 84 years, bringing flash floods, mudslides, isolated tornadoes, high winds and power outages.\n\nElizabeth Adams, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service San Diego office, said rain could fall up to 3 inches an hour across the desert and mountains surrounding the Coachella Valley and beyond from late Sunday morning into the afternoon. The intense rainfall during those hours could cause widespread and life-threatening flash floods.\n\nOne person drowned Saturday in the Mexican town of Santa Rosalia, on the peninsula’s eastern coast, when a vehicle was swept away in an overflowing stream. Rescue workers managed to save four other people, said Edith Aguilar Villavicencio, the mayor of Mulege township.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether officials considered the fatality related to the hurricane, but video posted by local officials showed torrents of water coursing through the town’s streets.\n\nThe forecast prompted authorities to issue an evacuation advisory for Santa Catalina Island, urging residents and beachgoers to leave the tourist destination 23 miles off the coast.\n\n— The Associated Press\n\nHurricane Hilary: Storm drops 0.32 inches at Palm Springs International Sunday\n\nAs of 7 a.m. Sunday, rainfall totals since midnight were 0.32 inches at Palm Springs International Airport, 0.41 inches at the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport in Thermal and 0.29 inches in Thousand Palms, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n— Matt Solinsky\n\nRain totals so far Sunday in Palm Springs area\n\nPreliminary precipitation data from the National Weather Service's San Diego station shows 24-hour rain totals as of 5 a.m. Sunday in the Coachella Valley vary from 0.86 inches in Thermal to 0.04 inches in Indio Hills. Palm Springs International Airport reported 0.18 inches of rain so far.\n\nThermal: 0.86 inches\n\nMorongo Valley: 0.39 inches\n\nDesert Hot Springs: 0.31 inches\n\nPalm Springs International Airport: 0.18 inches\n\nPalm Desert: 0.16 inches\n\nIndio Hills: 0.04 inches\n\n— Kate Franco\n\nRoad closures in Palm Springs, Cathedral City\n\nPalm Springs: Indian Canyon Drive, Gene Autry Trail and Vista Chino will be closed at the washes until further notice in preparation of potential flooding due to Hurricane Hilary, the Palm Springs Police Department announced late Saturday.\n\nCathedral City: Los Gatos Road at Date Palm Drive has been closed, city officials said Saturday.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declares State of Emergency\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom issued a State of Emergency for much of Southern California Saturday to support the Hurricane Hilary response and recovery efforts as the state continues mobilizing and coordinating resources ahead of the storm's forecasted impacts.\n\nHeavy rainfall and high winds were expected to last through Monday. At the governor's direction, there were currently more than 7,500 boots on the ground deployed to help local communities protect Californians from the impacts of Hilary.\n\nThe governor also signed an emergency proclamation in San Diego while visiting with California National Guard troops. He met with first responders and local officials, including San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria. He was also in touch with federal officials, including the White House.\n\nThe Emergency Medical Services Authority has assets on standby, including California Medical Assistance Teams to augment local capacity, aid in evacuations and support medical needs in communities impacted by flooding. The EMSA was ready to assist with Ambulance Strike Teams as necessary to support local communities. The Flood Operations Center is activated and has prepositioned flood-fight materials should they be needed.\n\n—City News Service\n\nSandbag availability low, exhausted in some valley cities\n\nSand and sandbags are no longer available at local fire stations in Palm Desert as of Saturday afternoon. Instead, residents can find these resources at the Palm Desert Civic Center, 43-900 San Pablo Ave., Palm Desert.\n\nRancho Mirage ran out of sand at its distribution site at the Rancho Mirage Library & Observatory parking lot, so many people took their empty bags to a nearby empty lot to fill them with sand straight from the ground. Empty sandbags are still available for Rancho Mirage residents at Fire Station 69 at 71-751 Gerald Ford Drive. Proof of Rancho Mirage address is required.\n\nIndian Wells announced mid-afternoon on Saturday that sandbags are no longer available from that city, and residents are encouraged to seek supplies from local home improvement stores, instead.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nHurricane Hilary: How experts say you should prepare\n\nTwo Palm Springs emergency officials have some advice for valley residents on how they can prepare their homes and themselves for the storm. The officials are Capt. Nathan Gunkel of the city fire department and Daniel DeSelms, Palm Springs’ emergency management coordinator.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nThey said residents should make sure they have enough food and water to make it through a few days, including food that can be eaten if the power goes out.\n\nThey also recommended preparing for the power outages by charging their cellphones and making sure they have flashlights and batteries on hand. DeSelms said he generally recommends using flashlights rather than candles because of the fire risks that come with candles.\n\nIn general, they said residents should be prepared to remain at home for multiple days as it will likely be unsafe to go out during the storm and roads could potentially remained closed or impassable even after it passes.\n\nGunkel recommended that residents make sure they know how to get out of their neighborhoods in the event the city does need to evacuate, keeping in mind that roads like Indian Canyon Drive and Gene Autry Road will likely be impassable. However, he said people should remember it is impossible to anticipate which other roads may be closed.\n\nTo protect your home:\n\nBoth DeSelms and Gunkel recommend residents make use of the free sandbags Palm Springs and other cities and agencies are providing, particularly if their homes have ever experienced flooding in the past. It often makes sense to place sand bags in front of the front door or other places where water might pool, Gunkel said.\n\nDeSelms also said those with leaky roofs can put a tarp over them. However, he cautioned that it is important to try to make sure the tarp will be secured enough to withstand the strong expected winds.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/08/biden-visits-kentucky-flooding/10264357002/", "title": "Biden views 'incredibly heartbreaking' damage from Kentucky floods", "text": "From the air and on the ground, President Joe Biden saw firsthand Monday what he described as \"incredibly heartbreaking\" devastation unleashed by flash flooding that killed at least 37 people in southeastern Kentucky and left a path of destruction across several counties.\n\nA little more than a week after heavy storms ravaged the mountainous region in the early morning darkness, evidence of the catastrophic damage and the recovery effort was visible as Biden’s motorcade wound along Lost Creek in Breathitt County, about an hour and a half southeast of Lexington.\n\nBuilding materials, clothing and other flood detritus were strewn along the creek’s banks. A plastic laundry basket was lodged high in a tree. A prefabricated home sat twisted and lifted off the ground along its axis.

The National Guard airlifted more than 1,300 people out of the flooded areas, while state police and other agencies rescued thousands of others, Beshear said.\n\nBiden has declared 13 counties as federal disaster areas.\n\nAt one stop, the Bidens surveyed damage caused when a school bus, carried by floodwaters, crashed into a partially collapsed building.\n\nBiden received a briefing from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and state officials at Marie Roberts-Caney Elementary School in Lost Creek. Col. Jeremy Slinker, Kentucky’s emergency management director, noted that many people have been cut off because bridges were washed out. All wellness checks have been completed, he said.\n\nBiden promised that federal and state resources would be available to help assist the recovery \"as long as it takes.\"\n\n“I promise you, if it’s legal, we’ll do it,” he said. “And if it’s not legal, we’ll figure out how to change the law.”\n\n'I CAN'T DO IT AGAIN': Can Appalachia blunt the devastating impacts of more flooding, climate change?\n\nAfter the briefing, Biden’s motorcade stopped at a bridge over a muddy, swollen creek. Down a dirt and gravel road, the Bidens spoke with members of a family whose home was heavily damaged by the floodwaters. Dining chairs, a refrigerator and a tub – many of them caked with mud – were laid out beside the curb.\n\nAcross the road, a family of six waited in the outline of the foundation of what had been their home. The house was carried hundreds of feet away and deposited at a nearby gas station.\n\nBiden said he talked to a man whose trailer was washed away. “When I started talking about what we could do, he said, ‘Well, you know, we Kentuckians don’t want to ask for too much. We’re used to having neighbors help us out,’” Biden said.\n\n“Everybody has an obligation to help,” Biden said.\n\nThe trip is Biden’s second to Kentucky to survey damage caused by a natural disaster since he took office.

Many residents were jolted from their sleep around 2 a.m. by a raucous electrical storm.\n\n►Rescue workers were trying to evacuate more than 15 residents of a neighborhood in Studio City, 12 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, where flooding and a mudslide submerged about 10 cars in water and debris.\n\n►In Montecito, Ellen DeGeneres posted video on Instagram of flooding near her home. She said she and her wife, actress Portia de Rossi, were told to shelter in place because they are on high ground. “This is crazy,” said DeGeneres, who was wearing a hoodie and raincoat. Evacuation orders issued Monday were lifted Tuesday.\n\nARE CALIFORNIA STORMS NORMAL?:Are California's storms normal, or is climate change making them worse? What experts say.\n\nEntire town in Central California evacuated amid severe flooding\n\nRaging waters overflowed the banks of Bear Creek, flooding parts of the city of Merced and neighboring flooding Planada, a small agricultural community along a highway that leads to Yosemite National Park.\n\nThe community of Planada, a town of more than 4,000 people, was evacuated Tuesday morning after water kept rising Monday night causing streets to flood and submerge vehicles.\n\nSandbags had been placed in areas prone to flooding to hold water back by city crews, according to Merced County Sheriff Vern Warnke. In an update Tuesday, Warnke emphasized the seriousness of the situation and urged residents to evacuate.\n\n\"If you see that I've asked for an evacuation, please do so,\" Warnke said.\n\nMudslides, flooding engulf Southern California after days of relentless rain\n\nWhile a bulk of the heavy rain exited the Los Angeles region by Tuesday afternoon, according to the weather service, several inches of rain were reported in most areas.\n\nOver higher terrain in the Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, upwards of 18 inches of rain was recorded, the weather service said Tuesday. The relentless heavy rain swamped roads with mud, debris, and floodwaters.\n\nSinkholes swallowed up two cars on a Los Angeles street, trapping two motorists who were rescued, and damaged 15 homes in the rural Santa Barbara County community of Orcutt, authorities said.\n\nMultiple roadways were also closed because of flooding, rock slides, and debris flows.\n\nIn Studio City, a neighborhood in Los Angeles County, the fire department had to evacuate 17 residents who were sheltering in place on Tuesday. According to the Los Angeles Fire Department, 3 to 5 feet of mud had piled in the area.\n\nIn San Francisco, the ground 'can't take any more rain'\n\nIn San Francisco, more than 1,000 trees have fallen since New Year’s Eve, including at least 15 since Monday night, said Rachel Gordon, spokeswoman for the Department of Public Works.\n\nA fully grown black acacia tree fell in the wind early Tuesday in the Lower Pacific Heights neighborhood, crushing a Subaru parked nearby. Crews on the scene began cutting the tree and feeding it into a chipper later in the day.\n\n“The ground is just saturated. It can’t take any more rain,’’ public works arborist Drew Landers said. “The slightest breeze can knock these trees down. This one was just so heavy and wet, it fell over.’’\n\nMounting snow levels increase dangers, could lead to avalanches\n\nTwo more storms were expected to pound California in the next several days, increasing concerns about mudslides, flooding and falling trees on saturated terrain. Then there are the mounting piles of snow.\n\nThe National Weather Service predicted 10 to 20 inches of snow for the greater Lake Tahoe area through Tuesday evening, and the numbers would rise to 18 to 36 inches above 7,000 feet. The service warned against traveling in the area, telling motorists, \"You could be stuck in your vehicle for many hours.''\n\nMiles of Sierra Nevada highways were subject to chain requirements and closures because of whiteout conditions. The Eastern Sierra’s Mammoth Mountain ski resort reported 4½ to 5½ feet of snow, and more was expected.\n\nRain turns into snow at higher elevations, and in normal times its accumulation in the mountains serves as natural water storage for the state. Rivers and creeks are nourished by the melting of snow in the spring, and this snow season was projected to be significant after years of underwhelming totals.\n\nThe flip side, however, is huge amounts of snow create hazards that include fallen branches and trees and blocked roads. Accuweather warned that \"the fluctuation of rain and snow could bring an increased avalanche danger as well.''\n\nThin silver lining: Rains bring some relief to lengthy drought\n\nThe \"one good aspect\" of the heavy rains has been relief from the persistent drought that has been plaguing a wide swath of the West, the weather service said. Nearly all of California has seen rainfall totals 4 to 6 times above average over the past several weeks. And much of California into the Great Basin has seen one to two \"drought class\" improvements over the past month.\n\nReservoir levels across California are responding – reservoirs are now above their historical average levels, and water levels are increasing rapidly, the weather service said.\n\nBut it's far from a perfect storm, the National Drought Mitigation Center noted in a tweet: \"The wild weather in California this week reflects one of the biggest barriers to #drought recovery. If soils are saturated, water can't soak in properly to replenish groundwater supplies. On the flip side, if soils are too dry, they can't efficiently absorb water either.\"\n\nFlood watches, mudslide concerns for San Francisco and beyond\n\nThe weather service issued a flood watch for the entire San Francisco Bay Area, the Sacramento Valley and Monterey Bay. Areas hit by wildfires in recent years faced the possibility of mud and debris sliding off denuded hillsides that have yet to fully recover their protective layer of vegetation. The storm was expected to bring enough rain to exacerbate flooding and heighten the risk of mudslides, forecasters said.\n\nSome residents fled, and many sheltered in place.\n\n\"Check on friends and family who may need assistance ... especially the elderly, homebound, or neighbors with disabilities,\" the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management urged.\n\nSinkhole swallows two cars in Chatsworth area near Los Angeles\n\nVehicles were seen submerged in water in some parts of Los Angeles. And a sinkhole swallowed two vehicles in the Chatsworth area in northeast Los Angeles late Monday. Authorities said two people escaped on their own, and firefighters used ropes and an aerial ladder to rescue two others who had minor injuries.\n\nCalifornia state highway authorities said late Monday that parts of U.S. and state highways were closed because of flooding, mud or rockslides, heavy snow or car spinouts and truck crashes. Included: northbound lanes of U.S. 101, a key coastal route.\n\nCalifornia storms: Climate change or something else?\n\nCalifornia could face a \"parade of storms\" over the next several weeks, on top of recent deluges that have killed at least 14 people, triggered flooding, knocked out power and forced evacuations and school closures up and down the coast. Although wet winters and dry summers are a natural part of California's weather patterns going back millennia, the question arises: Are this year's storms something out of the ordinary?\n\nWeather patterns over hundreds of years show periods of severe drought and periods of extreme wetness in the state. The last few years have been severe drought. The wetness over the last two weeks has been extreme.\n\n\"We have in recent years become accustomed to quite dry conditions and a lot of winters that didn't feel much like winter in a lot of California past decade or so,\" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"And that is both unusual, but also typical in the longer context.\" Read more here.\n\n– Elizabeth Weise and Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/10"}]}

Folk titans Joni Mitchell and Tracy Chapman graced us with a pair of nostalgic emotional hits, and Miley Cyrus went a long way in cementing her icon status, exuding rock-star confidence and pizazz as she playfully performed “Flowers,” winner of two Grammys including record of the year.\n\nHere are more of the best performances, ranked from worst to best, of Grammys night, where Taylor Swift made history and Trevor Noah hosted for a fourth time.\n\n12. U2, 'Atomic City'\n\nThe Irish rockers were in fine voice for their truncated take on “Atomic City,” which was essentially an overlong intro for Bono to present best pop vocal album to Taylor Swift’s “Midnights.” More than anything, the pummeling performance served as a gaudy commercial for Las Vegas’ $2 billion music venue The Sphere, with swooping drone footage and enough quick cuts to give you motion sickness.\n\n11. Travis Scott featuring Playboi Carti, 'My Eyes,' 'I Know,' 'Fe!n'\n\nShortly after Jay-Z got in some incisive digs at the Recording Academy, Scott called out voters during his incendiary, chair-bashing performance. “They slept on me 10 times,” he rapped, referring to his 10 career Grammy nominations but zero wins. It was the most memorable moment of the rapper’s “Mad Max”-style medley, which was otherwise bogged down by murky visuals.\n\n10. Burna Boy featuring 21 Savage and Brandy, 'On Form,' 'City Boys,' 'Sittin’ on Top of the World'\n\nBurna Boy oozed charisma as he ran through an infectious medley with rapper 21 Savage and R&B chanteuse Brandy, accompanied by a vibrant ensemble of backup dancers and musicians. As the awards show dragged into its interminable third hour, the Nigerian singer was a much-needed dose of adrenaline.\n\n9. Dua Lipa, 'Training Season,' 'Dance the Night,' 'Houdini'\n\nThe British pop sensation gave us everything Sunday night, opening the show with a red-hot, leather-and-latex-clad medley of hits “Dance the Night” and “Houdini,” along with teasing her sultry upcoming single “Training Session.” For any keyboard warriors still insisting that Lipa can’t dance, the singer put criticisms to bed with her athletic performance: hanging off a rotating cage and sliding across the floor against a dizzying backdrop of mirrors and pyrotechnics.\n\n8. Billy Joel, 'Turn the Lights Back On'\n\nThe Piano Man deserved better. The legendary Joel closed out the telecast with wistful new track “Turn the Lights Back On,” along with his rollicking 1980 single “You May Be Right.” But the performances were unfairly sandwiched in between top awards for Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift at the end of the night, and many audience members were seen filing out during his second song. What should have been a highlight of this year’s awards felt more like an afterthought, at least in the eyes of the Recording Academy.\n\n7. Olivia Rodrigo, 'Vampire'\n\nRodrigo brought “Carrie” to the Grammys telecast with a blood-soaked performance of her piercing single “Vampire.” Despite a somewhat shaky vocal start, the pop-punk hitmaker swiftly recovered as she belted out the dramatic number, dressed in a plunging crimson gown and smearing blood across her face while guts spilled from the flower backdrop behind her.\n\n6. Fantasia Barrino, 'Proud Mary'\n\nAfter a touching tribute to the late Tony Bennett by his friend Stevie Wonder, Annie Lennox commanded the stage with a staggering take on “Nothing Compares 2 U,” calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war as she honored Sinead O’Connor with the Prince standard. Barrino, who auditioned for “American Idol” with Tina Turner’s “Proud Mary,” closed out the “in memoriam” segment with an electrifying spin on the song: shaking her hips with Dua Lipa as she ran through the rousing blues anthem.\n\n5. SZA, 'Snooze,' 'Kill Bill'\n\nSZA brought cinematic excellence to this year’s Grammys, donning a “Matrix”-style trench coat and wide-brimmed hat for the bewitching “Snooze,” flanked by overturned trash cans and burning dumpsters. But the performance really came alive when she moved into smash single “Kill Bill,” paying spectacular homage to the 2003 Quentin Tarantino film with sword-wielding dancers and acrobatic choreography, even “throwing” a man into the air in a delightful bit of stage magic.\n\n4. Billie Eilish, 'What Was I Made For?'\n\nEilish stunned in a pink headscarf and green dress, re-creating a 1965 vintage Barbie look that she teased on her Instagram early Sunday. Accompanied by her brother Finneas on piano, the 22-year-old delivered an elegant and haunting rendition of her Oscar-nominated “Barbie” ballad, which grapples with depression and self-worth. Ever since her career exploded five years ago, Eilish has established herself as one of our most reliably captivating live performers, and her gorgeous showing Sunday was no exception.\n\n3. Miley Cyrus, 'Flowers'\n\nKeeping with the night’s theme of “less is more,” Cyrus brought old-school glamor to her first televised performance of the chart-topping “Flowers,” joyfully dancing in place and shimmying across the stage as she showed off the gravelly and glorious power of her voice. “Why are you acting like you don’t know this song?” Cyrus asked midverse, inspiring audience members including Chrissy Teigen and Kylie Minogue to dance at their tables. The dynamic singer effortlessly channeled Tina Turner with a silver-tassel dress and hair teased sky high, throwing down her microphone in a “Proud Mary”-style encore.\n\n2. Tracy Chapman and Luke Combs, 'Fast Car'\n\nThe Grammys’ worst-kept secret also proved to be one of the night's best moments. After days of speculation that Chapman would join Combs on stage to play her classic 1988 song, the folk singer made a rare appearance at Sunday’s show for a simple yet deeply affecting performance. Dressed down in jeans and a black button-up, Chapman played acoustic guitar and graciously traded verses with the gruff country vocalist. The two smiled at each other as nominees Taylor Swift and Brandi Carlile looked on lovingly from the crowd.\n\n1. Joni Mitchell, 'Both Sides Now'\n\nNearly a decade after suffering a brain aneurysm, Mitchell, 80, made her triumphant debut Grammys performance seated in a satin armchair and surrounded by chandeliers as she gently sang her signature tune, “Both Sides Now.” Her delivery was delicate yet matter-of-fact. She brought A-list attendees Beyoncé and Meryl Streep to tears as she harmonized beautifully with friend Brandi Carlile. It was a stirring performance of an all-time great song – one that will go down as one of the very best moments in Grammys history.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/11/09/cma-awards-2023-jimmy-buffett-tribute-performance/71513158007/", "title": "CMA Awards: Jimmy Buffett honored by Kenny Chesney and Alan ...", "text": "It was a celebration of Jimmy Buffet's life at the 57th Annual Country Music Association Awards as Kenny Chesney, Mac MacAnnally, Zac Brown Band and Alan Jackson took the stage to pay tribute with a medley of the late singer's hits.\n\nBuffett, known as the king of tropical rock, died on Sept. 1 in New York. His popular songs, like \"Margaritaville,\" \"It's 5 O'Clock Somewhere\" and \"Come Monday,\" encourage a beachy, easy-going lifestyle on the ocean with a drink in hand.\n\nSo it's no surprise Wednesday night's tribute during the awards show in Nashville, Tennesse, captured Buffett's enthusiasm for the tropics, with a rowdy audience that sang along to the lyrics, and chanted and hollered as colorful lights flashed onstage.\n\nOf course, rainbow parrots and palm trees decorated the stage.\n\nReview:Jimmy Buffett swings from fun to reflective on last album 'Equal Strain on All Parts'\n\nChesney and MacAnally started off their tribute with an acoustic cover of Buffett's \"A Pirate Looks At Forty,\" both playing guitar on a smaller stage in front of the main stage.\n\nA picture of Buffett was shown on the screen behind the stage with blue lights that washed over the performers.\n\n\"Yes, I am a pirate, two hundred years too late / The cannons don't thunder, there's nothin' to plunder,\" the two sang together.\n\nMore:Tracy Chapman becomes first Black woman to win CMA Award 35 years after 'Fast Car' debut\n\nAfterward, the curtain opened up to the bigger stage behind and Zac Brown Band and Alan Jackson played the classic \"Margaritaville.\" A slideshow of Buffett played in the background, where pictures showed him grinning and sun-kissed, sitting on a sailboat.\n\nDuring the celebratory performance, Zac Brown wore beachy shorts (and no shoes) in classic Buffett fashion, and Jackson rocked his sunglasses inside.\n\nJackson and the band sang, \"Wastin' away again in Margaritaville / Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt\" and the crowd chanted \"Salt, salt, salt!\" And as they finished out the chorus, they sang, \"Some people claim that there's a woman to blame / But I know it's nobody's fault,\" and the audience danced and smiled, honoring Buffett with their exuberance.\n\nCMA Awards 2023 full winners list:Lainey Wilson, Luke Combs, Chris Stapleton and more\n\nBuffett died at his home in Sag Harbor on Long Island, New York, from skin cancer, according to an obituary posted to his website in September.\n\nHe had been battling Merkel cell skin cancer for four years, which the National Cancer Institute describes as a rare carcinoma which usually appears as a single painless lump on sun-exposed skin and tends to metastasize quickly. It is second to melanoma as the most common cause of skin cancer death.\n\nHe kept performing while undergoing treatment, and Buffett’s last show was a surprise 45-minute appearance at a July 2 Mac McAnally show in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, where he brought the crowd to its feet screaming when he walked out.\n\nBuffett “passed away peacefully,” a statement announcing his death read, “surrounded by his family, friends, music and dogs.\"\n\n\"He lived his life like a song till the very last breath and will be missed beyond measure by so many.\"\n\n'He lived his life like a song':Jimmy Buffett, 'Margaritaville' singer and mogul, dies\n\nContributing: Kim Willis, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/cma-music-festival/2022/06/09/cma-fest-2022-nashville-live-updates/7567540001/", "title": "CMA recap: Dierks Bentley, with a nod to the past, closes out the ...", "text": "After a two-year hiatus, the CMA Music Festival drew thousands of country music fans and they wasted no time getting right back to business.\n\nThe Tennessean was on the ground all weekend. Read on for highlights from inside Nissan Stadium, at the Riverfront Stage and more.\n\nHighlights:CMA Fest's third day delivered these unforgettable moments\n\nDierks Bentley celebrates four decades of chart-topping country excellence\n\nThe 2003-released \"What Was I Thinking's\" bluegrass banjos and rock guitar licks welcomed Dierks Bentley to the stage for the 49th CMA Fest's final headlining set of the weekend.\n\nThe stadium event's co-host featured Billy Ray Cyrus on a cover of the latter's three-decade-old, platinum-selling single. Fans met 90s country's pop-cultural moment being feted with joyous revelry -- and a fair bit of pre-TikTok-era line dance-style party steps from the throng in attendance.\n\nThe August 3 CMA Fest ABC special host then noted that he drove the 28-year-old truck he owned when he arrived in Nashville in 1994 to Nissan Stadium to play at the festival. This banter logically led to a spirited and crowd assistance-aided \"I Hold On.\"\n\nThe tail end of his set included a duet cover of The Charlie Daniels Band's \"Devil Went Down To Georgia\" with TV event co-host Elle King, followed by their newly released duet \"Worth A Shot.\" Then, following a successful marriage proposal n the front row, he launched into his 2012-released rocker, \"5-1-5-0,\" to close the night.\n\nDierks Bentley has nearly 20 country radio No. 1 singles that feature drums and every manner of guitar and guitar-style instrument. Notably, in an era where country music has graciously embraced every sonic and social inspiration, it is notable to hear the genre celebrate its hard rock core on its most celebrated commercial stage.\n\nYet, for as much as country music welcomes difference, it will honor the best of what it was and what it is before it embraces and evolves into what it is to become.\n\nOld Dominion deliver jam-band country entertainment\n\nOld Dominion recently played Nissan Stadium as an opener for Kenny Chesney. It's playing with the perennial country chart-topper that informs their ability to craft hook-driven hits like their 2019-released CMA Fest set opener \"Make It Sweet.\"\n\n\"Nights like this are what country music is made for\" screamed the band's lead vocalist Matthew Ramsey prior to launching into the five-year-old countrified soul groove \"No Such Thing as a Broken Heart.\"\n\nOld Dominion's subtle evolution from country rockers to a heavyweight jam band has become stronger in recent years. Their 2021 album title track \"Time, Tequila and Therapy\" offers \"no hard feelings and no bad vibes,\" and locks into very particular energy directly between Chesney and Bobby McFerrin 1989 hit \"Don't Worry Be Happy\"-style vibes -- in the most crowd-moving and enjoyable way possible.\n\n\"Song For Another Time\" is well regarded in Old Dominion fan circles as a tune comprised of lyrics that are actually 20 other song titles. The skill in taking the irony out of a song written with such a peculiar level of high-grade music adoration is hard. However, as previously noted, the group's hard embrace of being down with earnest fun allows for performances like these to honestly connect.\n\nPrior to closing their set, Ramsey noted that Old Dominion was a late addition, replacing Alan Jackson -- who was a last-second lineup scratch. Then, in a kind gesture, the band performed a cover of his 30-year-old classic, \"Chattahoochee.\" As one would expect, it was met with hollering, whooping, and a boogie-woogie party in the Nissan Stadium floor seats.\n\nGary Glitter's four-decade-old \"Rock and Roll (Part II)\" as a lead into \"I Was On A Boat That Day\" is unlikely but comes from the two songs sharing similar bass drum kicks. However, as a lead-in to their finale -- one of CMA Fest 2022's expected, epic sing-alongs, it made sense. Nearly 70,000 country music fans have been \"drunk as a skunk eating lunch with a cross-eyed bear\" and were proud to proclaim this fact at extraordinary decibels.\n\nElle King's arrival as a country star gets an assist from Ashley McBryde\n\nElle King's adaptation of her brash demeanor and 70s rock-star attitude to modern country music is the most delightful, yet unlikely peanut butter and banana-style combination in country music since the last sandwich Elvis Presley ever ate.\n\n\"Drunk (And I Wanna Go Home)\" features Miranda Lambert, but as a solo King performance, it hits like a harder-edged 80s country-rock anthem. Its excellence in that realm was apparent at Nissan Stadium. This performance was followed by Ashley McBryde joining a banjo-picking King for her 2015 breakout hit \"Ex's And Oh's\" it was much more the final part of King being officially claimed as a country-first artist than it was anything else.\n\n\"Country's where it's at,\" King noted to The Tennessean on Saturday evening. The country music industry agrees with the Ohio native's statement.\n\nFollowing King, Parker McCollum took the stage. The \"Gold Chain Cowboy's\" rise from Conroe, Texas, to being the Academy of Country Music's Best New Artist of the Year in 2022 was unexpected. However, in the singles \"Pretty Heart\" and \"To Be Loved By You\" being directly impacted by him being a recently married man, the 29-year-old vocalist has found a way for his lovestruck anthems to resonate more directly.\n\nRussell Dickerson told The Tennessean he was excited to host \"the largest RD Party yet\" at Nissan Stadium. Fellow Nashville crooner Jake Scott joined Dickerson for \"She Likes It,\" his hit 2021 single. For as much as his single \"Love You Like I Used To\" is a well-written and performed ballad when Dickerson sings, \"When I go get groceries, and I bring back flowers / And I rub her back for like half an hour\" in the former song, he's clearly in his artistic wheelhouse. His glee in being there gives fans vibes similar to Luke Bryan, and the \"country girls\" in attendance love it, as expected.\n\nLady A deliver new song, crowd-rousing excellence\n\nHillary Scott's renowned lead vocal kicked off Lady A's 2014 single \"Bartender\" at the start of their Nissan Stadium set. Sunday n, the crowd -- as opposed to the other three nights -- arrived ready for a singing and dancing party. Scott's sultry, soulful performance got the venue's highly packed lower bowl and field levels to their feet.\n\n\"We Own The Night\" followed the opener. At Charles Kelley's urging, the crowd waved their hands in time with the chorus. \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" was met with Kelley noting, after a stirring performance, \"we had to have one tender moment, tonight.\" Ironically, the band followed with the emotive ballad \"What A Song Can Do,\" their latest album's title track (which advises that songs can inspire \"starting a band\" or \"kissing a girl\"). Many in the crowd held their flashlight-lit cell phones up in the air in appreciation.\n\nLady A wrote their new single \"Summer State of Mind\" mere months ago. They told The Tennessean they wanted to get a jump on viral popularity by releasing it without an album. \"You're the ice; I'm the Yeti,\" they sang.\n\nTwo months ago, Charles Kelley appeared at BRELAND's \"Breland and Friends\" event at the Ryman Auditorium. During their mini-set, their duet on Lady A's signature power-pop ballad \"Need You Now\" was an unlikely, almost show-stealer. During Nissan Stadium's fourth night, the tandem reprised the duet, but BRELAND joined Kelley, Hillary Scott, and Dave Haywood onstage.\n\nIn exclusive news, Lady A noted they have a collaboration with BRELAND planned for an album BRELAND says is coming \"in the fall,\" they told The Tennessean in a press room interview.\n\nHillary Scott's been at it as a top-tier vocalist in Nashville for two decades. Hearing her work -- alongside the stellar work horn section -- on tracks like reggae-tinged \"Champagne,\" raucous party elevator \"You Look Good,\" and the previously-mentioned \"Need You Now\" really highlighted the breadth of her talent.\n\nIt was one of the weekend's most comprehensively excellent outings as a start-to-finish performance.\n\nSara Evans kicks off a dance party at Nissan Stadium\n\n8:30 p.m.: Sara Evans took the stage to a trilling organ and tambourines playing chords from Joe Cocker's \"With A Little Help From My Friends.\" For any other artist, this would be audacious. However, Sara Evans is inarguable country music royalty.\n\nHer live band kicked into her 2005 hit \"A Real Fine Place to Start.\" It was readily apparent that her legendary voice was still more than capable of delivering a dynamic, entertaining performance.\n\n\"My vocal cords are like leather because my parents raised me and trained me like one of those tennis prodigies,\" Evans told The Tennessean before hitting the stage. But, similar to what Randy Houser noted on Saturday night, whether she's in front of 30 or 30,000 people, her voice is still a soulful siren in either situation.\n\nAs she broke into her decade-old heartbreak survival anthem, \"A Little Bit Stronger,\" she held her hands out to the crowd as if offering them a hug. From a less experienced artist, the temerity to believe that you could heal 70,000 hearts with two hands is a lot. But as Evans offered in her interview, she developed her skill by listening to artists, including Mariah Carey.\n\nThe level of soul diva self-assurance that comes from knowing that you can harness and weaponize vocal power to overwhelm an audience emotionally is rare in both country and R & B's modern age. However, in 90s and 2000s pop and country, this skill was far more commonplace. The moment served as a reminder of the timeless importance of watching great artists perform their craft in a superstar manner.\n\nEvans settled the evening into a party-ready groove upon launching into her final performance -- the two-decade-old No. 1 hit \"Suds In The Bucket.\" The song's fiddle and guitar-driven honky-tonk vibes inspired an early-evening dance party in the seats. Though the humidity in Nissan Stadium is currently peanut butter levels of sticky and thick, the growing crowd peeled themselves out of their chairs and held their evening's first beers aloft.\n\n8:00 p.m.: El Salvador-born Angie K, a former The Voice contestant co-signed by the likes of Blake Shelton, Thomas Rhett, and Jake Owen, took to the stage at a late filling and smotheringly humid Nissan Stadium. CMA Fest 2022 has settled into its final evening.\n\n\"Real Talk\" is her recently-released breakout single. It's a co-write that features Rhett, his frequent collaborator Jesse Frasure and venerable songwriter Ashley Gorley. It was met with a pleasant response.\n\n\"I'm on cloud nine,\" exclaimed the rising performer when she chatted with The Tennessean before hitting the stage. Her previous largest stadium gig was playing in a building that held roughly half of Nissan's capacity. Regarding what she looked forward to the most, with a focused, but nervous tone, she replied, \"when I get off the stage, I'm going to do a tequila shot.\"\n\nHer grooving track \"Country Is As Country Does\" bore the same jangling melody and rhythmic groove as a legendary country favorite: John Denver's half-century-old, iconic favorite, \"Take me Home, Country Roads.\" The TikTok favorite knows her way around how to inform a song with uniquely personal energy and make it her own. Achieving that goal here, she received a warm ovation. And then, as promised, she had her tequila shot.\n\n3:15 p.m.: Vanderbilt Event Medicine had taken 25 people to the hospital as of Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"Most of those were issues that were made worse by the heat,\" spokesperson Jerry Jones said.\n\nHe said most people have come to them for blisters and to find a place to cool down. He urged people to take advantage of the free water stations that are scattered throughout the festival grounds.\n\n1:45 p.m. Parmalee kicked off a Riverfront Stage set with their 2013 single \"Already Callin' You Mine.\" They had all of the appearances of a 90s rock act playing power pop with effervescent energy.\n\nBlanco Brown returned to the stage to perform his No. 1 hit Parmalee duet \"Just The Way.\" If you are ever looking for a romantic, modern-era Christian rock ballad, this easily fulfills that expectation.\n\nOne of the fascinating things about Parmalee is that their sound smacks of all the pieces of three decades of commercially successful pop, rock, country and Christian music. As other genres have evolved and styles have drastically changed over the years, this set of sounds -- four that the quartet is solidly gifted in crafting -- have remained mainly the same.\n\nThe band's current single \"Take My Name\" followed, their second chart-topper in a row on country radio. It's a wedding song, \"take my name and make it yours,\" the sing-along adored part of the track at the Riverfront Stage -- which gratefully receives a blast of breeze from the Cumberland River every ten minutes or so on a loop.\n\nThis is notable because it makes Parmalee's sound, on this day, extraordinarily more relaxing than usual.\n\n1:15 p.m.: Brittney Spencer took to the Amp Stage as a few passing clouds and a slight breeze gave the crowd small breaks from the heat.\n\nHips were swaying as she covered Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5” near the top of her set. Spencer said she was happy to be part of CMA Fest’s return.\n\n“It’s such an incredible honor,” Spencer said, before kicking off “Sober & Skinny.”\n\nBlanco Brown's dance party brings it all together\n\n1 p.m.: Blanco Brown doesn't perform \"country music.\" He empathetically performs essential American classics with the unique ability to make Sam Cooke and George Jones feel related by how their catalogs are universally beloved.\n\nTo wit, he opened his CMA Fest set with \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" blending into \"Tennessee Whiskey.\" Following it up with trap-country ballad \"Georgia Power\" drives home the point even further.\n\nClad in a combination of classic mid-80s throwback Atlanta Braves and Houston Astros jerseys, he gives off the vibe of \"cool pre-teen prayer camp counselor DJing the the all-camp dance party\" more than \"soulful hip-hop performer.\"\n\nThis is the first set in CMA Fest history to take 60 seconds to seamlessly blend in sounds by hip-hop legends Fatman Scoop (via a sample of his club-familiar track \"Be Faithful\"), Chubb Rock (via his 1990 rap classic \"Treat Em Right\" and Kid-N-Play (via their kick-step dance with his DJ).\n\nThen, as the DJ dropped Johnny Cash's \"Walk The Line\" and followed it with \"9 to 5,\" the crowd felt comfortable. Then, Outkast's \"Ms. Jackson\" was played, and alchemy occurred. The crowd paused, curiously seemed to scratch their heads in unison, shrugged, then exalted. A full crowd singalong of Outkast's 2003 single \"Hey Ya\" followed.\n\n\"You're a glass of champagne, but I'm Tennessee Whiskey,\" Brown crooned. Shouting out Lee Brice, the DJ dropped his collaboration with EDM producer R3HAB for a remix of Brice's \"Soul.\" At this point, the heat was as onerous as the pace was frenetic.\n\nHe then broke into his anthemic 2021 single \"Nobody's More Country.\"\n\nHe found no disagreement as the crowd double-time clapped while sweating ever more profusely than ever.\n\nA full wedding type party then ensued. as he then got them to dance the \"Cupid Shuffle\" and \"Wobble\" and mimic Will Smith and Alfonso Ribiero's dance routine to \"Apache\" by the Sugar Hill Gang.\" This preceded his TikTok dance sensation breakout, \"The Git Up.\"\n\nBlend Brown's artistic intentions erring towards \"purpose over prosperity\" with a peak-hour hip-hop DJ's desire to play the hottest 90 seconds of a track. The 45 minute, 18-song set he helmed at the CMA Fest's Riverside Stage was astonishing, unprecedented and fun.\n\nMeghan Patrick and Shy Carter rally on Sunday morning\n\nAn originally modest crowd swelled as people gravitated towards the Amp Stage during Shy Carter’s 12:30 p.m. set.\n\nFans sang along and tapped their feet to “Beer With My Friends.” Many were eating blue popsicles and waved cold bandanas.\n\n“What y’all sipping on?” Carter asked the crowd. A chorus of replies included shouts of “tequila,” “beer” and “water.”\n\n“You’re smart, man,” Carter replied before launching into “Stuck Like Glue,” cowritten with musical duo Sugarland.\n\nCarter jumped off the stage to sing and dance with fans during “Good As You” and “Good Love.” The crowd created a circle around him and held up their phones to take selfies as he sang.\n\n“What’s your name?” he asked a fan wearing heart-shaped sunglasses.\n\n“Ashton,” she said into the microphone.\n\n“I’m Shy,” he said to the crowd with a grin.\n\nCarter finished his set with “One Call Away.” Fans reached out their hands and shouted the lyrics along with him.\n\nA crowd of about 100 were on their feet for Meghan Patrick at 11 a.m. Sunday.\n\n“Who had a little hair of the dog this morning?” Patrick asked the crowd at the top of her set. “Man, I could use one I think.”\n\n“I know you guys have been sweating and walking all weekend,” Patrick said. “It means a lot that you guys are here bright and early this morning.”\n\nPeople raised their drinks and swayed to “Goes Good With Beer.” Patrick followed with a new song. She wrote “She’s No Good For Me” for “everyone who’s had a breakup with an old version of themselves.\n\nCarrie Underwood closes Saturday night, with a Louisville Slugger\n\n12:30 a.m.: As a live performer, Carrie Underwood has nothing to prove.\n\nHowever, as she noted to the Tennessean before her night three headlining set at CMA Fest, she feels dutifully tied to upholding the \"hustling\" legacies of prior top-tier iconic country stars like Barbara Mandrell and Dolly Parton. Thus, she slung an electric guitar over her left shoulder, wore enough bejeweled red and black stagewear to be seen in Nissan Stadium's nosebleed seats, and rocked out to a defiant, solid version of her 2016 single \"Church Bells.\"\n\nOf late, Underwood has become a touring juggernaut -- Vegas to Stagecoach Festival to the stage of Nashville's Bell Tower for Amazon Music's debut concert for her ninth studio album, \"Denim and Rhinestones.\" However, she showed neither exhaustion nor disengagement from her material. On the contrary, the excitement of the job -- being radio-ready country music's most instantaneously recognizable female name, felt like her call to arms to slay a live crowd already blown away by Luke Combs' phenomenal set just 90 minutes prior.\n\nFrom her new album, she first performed the banjo-aided power-pop lead single \"Ghost Story.\" As she noted to The Tennessean, the song has just enough country blended with pop to highlight her desire to make music that is more broadly genre non-specific. However, she keeps country music's traditions at the core.\n\n2005-era Underwood track, \"Wasted,\" featured Underwood's work as an inspirational Christian rocker blasting to the forefront. Yes, the more traditional \"My Savior\" reflects where her current interests lie in that realm, but her fiddle-backed torch-song exhortations left Nissan Stadium enraptured. Following that performance with \"Jesus, Take The Wheel,\" another religious pop number from the same era of her career, followed by a stentorian take on the gospel hymn \"How Great Thou Art,\" cemented her excellence in this country-adjacent lane.\n\nThe jazzy, 80s, R & B radio synth-pop that underpins her latest album's title track opens a new lane for her career that should prove creatively fruitful. It received the least overwhelming response of the evening, but it's a lane that aligns well with sonic and cultural shifts in the genre.\n\nUnderwood's soul-pop skills were highlighted via her 2007 single \"Last Night,\" a track where she sings, \"Last night, I did things I'm not proud of and I got a little crazy / Last night, I met a guy on the dance floor and I let him call me 'baby.'\"\n\nMasterfully, it set up the set's expected closer -- her smash hit debut single, 2005's \"Before He Cheats.\" if there's a 21st century American Songbook, Underwood promising to commit felonies against a cheating lover is likely on the first page.\n\nHearing an entire venue sing the song cemented the song's -- and her -- undeniable excellence.\n\nLuke Bryan celebrates country's fans 'shaking it'\n\nThe entirety of Nissan Stadium rose to its feet as booming stadium rock drums and heavy, riffing guitars filled the atmosphere. Even though Luke Bryan was starting his 45-minute set, he already \"didn't want this night to end.\" His decade-old No. 1 single was still beloved by nearly 70,000 people from 33 nations worldwide.\n\nHis performance of another 2012 favorite, \"Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye,\" saw Bryan smile slyly when singing the lyric \"All we do right is make love / And we both know now that ain't enough.\" There are live moments in country music when you realize that the best songs come from fondly remembered moments.\n\nThis felt like one of those times.\n\nBryan appeared resolute and impassioned as cell phone flashlights brightly shone throughout Nissan Stadium while he sang the 2013-released Jim Beavers and Chris Stapleton-written ballad \"Drink A Beer.\" It was one of the very few times in under an hour the set approached anything less than a countrified party for the grill, Yeti cooler, and mud-truck trip to backwoods clearing set.\n\nThis was a night where the fact that Luke Bryan unironically elevates the concept of unhinged partying to the highest art was remembered. There were corn field parties (\"Kick The Dust Up\"), margarita-fueled parties (\"One Margarita), deer-hunting and fishing parties (\"Huntin' Fshin' and Lovin' Everyday\"), crashed parties (\"Crash My Party\") and more.\n\nBy the time he sang the 11-year-old single \"Country Girl (Shake It For Me),\" the same women who were canoodling during Thomas Rhett's set on Friday night were following the instructions offered by the hook of the near 30-time country radio No. 1 hitmaker's anthemic song.\n\nLuke Combs makes his case for being music's sincerest and greatest current star\n\n10:00 p.m.: In 2016, before his star-making single, \"Hurricane\" was released, Luke Combs sold 83 tickets for a show in Athens, Georgia. On Saturday night, he played a stellar main stage set at CMA Fest in front of roughly 81,000 percent (or a crowd he placed at 67,000) more people.\n\nIn under a decade, Luke Combs' rise to superstardom is so profound that it needs such an astounding number to encapsulate its greatness.\n\nNight three co-host and Apple Music Radio country host Nada Taha introduced Luke Combs in glowing terms. Then, with nary an ounce of fanfare in response, he ripped into an energetic take of his 2017 No. 1 single, \"When It Rains It Pours.\" He then turned the singing duties for half a verse over to an excited crowd. When the spotlight hit their faces, it illuminated a building prepared for 45 minutes of rocking to anthemic country radio hits.\n\nAs he noted to The Tennessean before appearing on stage, this was, indeed, the last live show he'd be playing before his wife, Nicole, is due to give birth to their first child (he adds he's well aware he's going to be responsible for changing diapers most of the time). He then, apropos of the conversation, sang his romantic fan favorite, \"The Kind of Love We Make.\"\n\nCombs rasping with his trademark rough, assured voice through his single \"Doin' This\" kicked off an epic run of song performances highlighting why he's the CMA's reigning Entertainer of the Year.\n\n\"Beautiful Crazy\" involved Combs elevating the art of honest, earnest stage banter to near soliloquy levels in describing how he wrote the track for his wife and how much it would mean for her to hear the live crowd sing along. \"Best Of Me,\" \"Lovin' On You\" and \"Forever After All\" were also particularly spirited performances.\n\nIt takes an exceptionally high level of believability in a star's connectivity for \"Forever After All's\" opening lines \"A cold beer's got 12 ounces / A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand / You only get so much until it's gone\" to feel sincere and not ironically wryly hilarious.\n\nCombs is that believably sincere.\n\nMoreover, when 67,000 people euphorically agree via screaming that an \"ice-cold long-neck beer never broke their hearts,\" that level of sincerity is doubled down upon.\n\nLuke Combs isn't just a country star. In one awe-inspiring, 45-minute set, he made an excellent case for being a top-tier pop star, regardless of genre.\n\nBrothers Osborne's rip-roaring set takes the party to another level\n\n8:40 p.m. With the last of Saturday's daylight gone, Brothers Osborne dove into a typically raucous set. If the party was not already underway at Nissan Stadium, it certainly was after John Osborne launched into the first of several guitar solos showing his skills are up there with just about anyone in country music.\n\nMeanwhile, TJ Osborne, the other half of the sibling duo, led the crowd in tour through several of Brothers' biggest hits, as a pair of puppeteer-controlled 20-foot-tall skeletons danced behind them.\n\nThe set ended with an extended version of the duo's \"It ain't my fault,\" which left few of the tens of thousands of fans now backed into the stadium in their seats,\n\nRandy Houser's bombastic performance makes Nissan Stadium feel 'Like A Cowboy'\n\n8:00 p.m.: Before hitting the CMA Fest's main stage, Randy Houser told The Tennessean that, regardless of singing in front of 500 or 50,000 people, he sang with equal levels of bravado.\n\nFifteen minutes into his CMA Fest set, his big voice was on display.\n\nAs a late-arriving night crowd reached their field seats at Nissan Stadium, the performer welcomed the \"cowboys and cowgirls\" to the venue. Then, he sang with a blustery baritone about how every time he falls down he gets back up again \"like a cowboy,\" via his decade-old hit.\n\nFor those who are fans of restoring some manner of four-decade-old neotraditional and more rough-hewn pop-country vibes, Houser's set awoke echoes of everyone from George Strait to Jamey Johnson and Cody Johnson, too. As a live band kicked into honky-tonk rhythms, Houser exited the stage to warm, deserved cheer\n\nWarehouse fire sends plumes of smoke over CMA Fest\n\nSmoke from a warehouse fire was seen rising over the CMA Fest crowd in downtown Nashville on Saturday afternoon, but was not on the festival grounds.\n\nThe fire was reported around 3:30 p.m. in the 100 block of North 1st Street, near Nissan Stadium. The building was \"fully involved\" as crews arrived, the Nashville Fire Department said.\n\nNorth 1st Street is blocked as multiple crews worked to contain the blaze. No injuries had been reported as of 4:45 p.m., according to NFD.\n\nNFD tweeted that crews had contained the fire and were focusing on \"hot spots\" around 5:15 p.m. Read more.\n\nRyan Hurd, Hailey Whitters get the crowd involved\n\nHailey Whitters got the crowd stomping, clapping and swaying at the Amp Stage at 2:45 p.m. with songs like “Fillin’ My Cup.”\n\nShe showed off her trademark bloomers under her yellow-and-white checkered dress before she played “Plain Jane.”\n\nA fan lifted two beers high in the air and let out a hardy “Yee haw!” during “The Neon.”\n\n1:45 p.m. An afternoon breeze offered a small measure of relief from the heat as Ryan Hurd took the Riverfront Stage. The crowd spilled into the walkways behind the terraces as Hurd sang “June, July, August.” The singer-songwriter also sang “Waves,” which he co-wrote with Luke Bryan.\n\n“Ladies, I’m going to need your help on this next one,” Hurd said before launching into “Chasing After You,” a song he co-wrote with his wife, Maren Morris.\n\nBoats, kayaks and jet skis dotted the Cumberland River behind the stage as the heat index stayed in the 90s.\n\nHealth and safety tips: Seek out shade, drink water and leave your boots behind\n\nVanderbilt University Medical Center's Event Medical teams are on site at CMA this weekend. VUMC's Jerry Jones says they've treated \"the regular medical issues you’d see at a large event,\" including sunburn, heat exhaustion and blisters.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, they've made 13 transports to the hospital, \"with mostly medical conditions that were made worse by the heat.\"\n\nAs the fest reaches its halfway point, the Event Medical Teams are stressing heat safety. Attendees should avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight, drink plenty of non-alcoholic fluids (there are free water stations through the festival site) and dress to keep cool and in the shade.\n\nAlso, since blisters are a minor but widespread issue: \"We would stress to avoid blisters and wear comfortable shoes. Wait until you get home to wear those newly purchased cowboy boots.\"\n\nSaturday heats up with Lauren Alaina, BRELAND\n\n12:45 p.m.: 2022 at the Riverfront Stage found Lauren Alaina as well known as a CBS reality TV star and Maurices' clothier pitchwoman as she is a pop-country star on the rise.\n\nHowever, those laurels were achieved because the Rossville, Georgia native is human, relatable, and generally — as is ideally the case for a festival attended by thousands of people — a rising country queen of fun vibes.\n\nHer just-released cover of King Harvest's 1973 AM radio hit \"Dancing in the Moonlight\" fit in nicely alongside her ex-lover revenge bar-hopping anthem \"Getting Over Him\" in a fun, arena-style rocker of a set. As well, her solo take on her No. 1 hit Kane Brown duet \"What Ifs\" was met with an ovation.\n\nNotably, her ovation bled from \"What Ifs\" into her solo take on her HARDY and Devin Dawson collaboration \"One Beer.\"\n\nAlaina's voice sounds like small-town Baptist gospel. Blend that with inherently honest songs (\"One Beer\" is already arguably in the canon of great songs about accidental teenage pregnancy), and her growth from least-anticipated to most-wanted Music City fave makes sense.\n\nAlaina closed with her 2017 hit \"Road Less Traveled.\" Indeed, she took the road less traveled, but this set showed her likely on her way across the Seigenthaler Bridge (Nissan Stadium's main stage is there) to potentially more significant acclaim.\n\n12 p.m.: 26-year-old BRELAND's mid-day Riverfront Stage set at CMA Fest showcased his preternatural level of polish as a country music neophyte that has led him to explode out of quarantine with a No. 1 single, peak-hour festival gigs, and the respect of literally all of your favorite country artists of the past three decades.\n\nWhen he performed his viral TikTok breakout \"My Truck\" at the Ryman for April's BRELAND and Friends concert, it was at a seated venue, so it was met with polite excitement. Here at Riverfront, the heat index read 93 degrees at noon. Instead of turning up with the chart-topper, cell phones swayed aloft.\n\nIf you were looking for a moment at CMA Fest wherein the entire crowd was well aware that they were in the presence of a soon (quite literally, Sunday night) Nissan Stadium main stage artist — but were too overheated to go over the top in their actually present excitement — this was it.\n\n10 a.m.: The line snaked all the way down the block along 6th Avenue outside Music City Center as people waited to enter Fan Fair X. The line began moving steadily around 10 am.\n\nDrake White kicked off his set at 10:45 a.m. with “Heartbeat,” as the crowd got to its feet and sang along.\n\n“Welcome to church, everybody,” White said.\n\nSome ducked under trees behind the terraces along the crowded Riverfront Stage as temperatures climbed into the mid-80s. Others wiped sweat from their brows and cooled themselves by waving paper fans.\n\nWhite talked about suffering a hemorrhagic stroke he suffered on stage in 2019 and credited his recovery to his wife, family, God and his doctors.\n\nHe sang “Hurts the Healing” and “Livin’ the Dream,” among others.\n\nKane Brown's CMA Fest set: A superstar victory lap at a comfortable pace\n\nKane Brown closed the second night of CMA Fest in front of a crowd responding to material that has yet to powerfully impact country's radio and marketing circles.\n\nThe Chattanooga native is in the midst of time off prior to restarting his 2022 Drunk or Dreaming tour on September 17 with dates in Australia. He's also celebrated yet another No. 1 single (\"One Mississippi\"), as well as a homecoming performance. This, after a grueling 35-date tour including 29 NBA arenas. Brown was more subdued than expected, onstage.\n\nHe also showed himself accepting his place as a genre-fluid \"different\" artist, as comfortable with rousting the echoes of Alan Jackson's 90s heyday on \"Like I Love Country Music,\" sonorously performing power-ballad \"Homesick\" (an homage to the military, he noted \"I love the USA\"), or pushing into EDM via his marshmello duet \"One Thing Right.\"\n\n\"Like I Love Country Music\" should likely be somewhere near peaking at the top of country's sales and/or radio charts by August 3. Thus, it necessitates a performance that may not strike wild adulation at this moment, but by the time this set hits television, one should expect it -- for the millions watching not present in Music City -- to be seen as \"uniquely intimate\" and warmly received.\n\nBrown's die-hard fans head-banging to an elongated guitar solo for his first No. 1 single \"What Ifs\" as fireworks exploded over the Cumberland River closed an emotional night at the 49th CMA Fest.\n\nCarly Pearce pays tribute to The Judds with Wynonna\n\n10:50 p.m.: Since the last CMA Fest in 2019, arguably no artist in country music experienced a momentum shift (or expanded trophy case) quite like Carly Pearce.\n\nShe graduated to performing Friday at Nissan Stadium after becoming a Grand Ole Opry member and earning CMA Female Vocalist of the Year honors – both achievements backed by her cathartic and critically-praised divorce album “29: Written In Stone.”\n\nCMA Fest:Wynonna Judd joins Carly Pearce onstage for CMA Fest surprise performance\n\nBut instead of a riding a victory lap of the best “29” offers, Pearce spent her time on stage honoring a pair of fellow Kentuckians who came before her: The Judds. Weeks after Naomi Judd’s death, Pearce invited Wynonna Judd to celebrate the late Country Music Hall of Famer with a rendition of Judds song “Why Not Me.”\n\n“As a girl growing up in Kentucky, yes, I idolized The Judds and wanted to be like them,” Pearce said after performing her radio single “What He Didn’t Do” during the two-song appearance. My first concert was to see Wynonna. And I’ve always loved all of the music that The Judds made and just feel like it is such a representation of the best of country music.”\n\nCole Swindell continues his improbable 2022 surge\n\n10:45 p.m.: The 2022 CMA Fest is also a special being recorded for airing on ABC on August 3. Thus, in the decades-long tradition of country music as a variety-show medley format, Carly Pearce introduced Cole Swindell, who performed his recent Lainey Wilson duet and chart-topping hit \"Never Say Never.\" Moreover, he performed his critically-beloved new single on country radio -- and Jo Dee Messina-sampling single \"She Had Me At (Heads Carolina).\"\n\nIn two months, one could expect that the latter -- possibly the best of the lot of 90s country heir apparent expected to dominate country fans' summer and fall months -- should be well along the path to being Swindell's somewhat improbable second number-one single in 2022.\n\nJust as can be noted with ERNEST's George Jones-style \"Flower Shops\" -- another throwback-sounding single that wowed fans earlier in the day -- the classics never die.\n\nGabby Barrett goes from seats to stage\n\n10:30 p.m.: The last time CMA Fest took over Nashville, Gabby Barrett's monster debut single \"I Hope\" hadn't reached the country charts.\n\nFast forward three years and she smiled as the stadium screamed along to the inescapable chorus, \"... and then I hope he cheeeeats.\"\n\nBarrett made a two-song main stage debut at CMA Fest, opening with 2020 song \"Pick Me Up\" before dipping into the five-time Platinum-selling single that launched her from sitting in the stands for CMA Fest 2019 to singing on stage.\n\nThomas Rhett slows down summer while evolving into a CMA Fest staple\n\n9:30 p.m.: Thomas Rhett was once a Nissan Stadium nosebleed seat dweller at CMA Fest. Now, he's something of a main stage regular.\n\nHis 2022 appearance included playing recent favorites like \"Country Again\" and \"Slow Down Summer,\" entertaining a blissed-out crowd during night two of 2022's CMA Fest headlining entertainment.\n\n\"I used to bug my dad for free tickets [to this event] when it was called Fan Fair at the Nashville Fairgrounds,\" Rhett told the Tennessean before hitting the stage. Rhett's father, Rhett Akins — much like the current 18-time country radio chart-topper — was a fixture at Fan Fair as the architect behind many hits during his son's suburban Nashville childhood.\n\nAs Rhett's 45-minute set weaved its way through his collection of soulful ballads like 2015's \"Die A Happy Man,\" the number of girlfriends comfortably canoodling and singing aloud in Nissan Stadium appeared to double. As he grows into being both a parent and a husband (\"my favorite show is Moana,\" the father of four noted in the press room), his live performance slides into the realm of comfortable, approachable middle-age joy.\n\n\"My ultimate goal is to just write great songs that reveal 150,000% of who I am. I've re-lit the creative fire in myself to be the best overall artist I can be,\" Rhett told The Tennessean in April 2022. Two months later, he's started along his path to achieving his career goals in the next chapter of his career.\n\nHighlights: See what happened Thursday\n\nKelsea Ballerini calls ‘Dibs’ with sparking pop-country\n\n8:35 p.m.: Days after she shared the Nissan Stadium stage with Kenny Chesney during his Nashville tour stop, Kelsea Ballerini returned to the towering venue for a pop-country revue that was undoubtedly all hers.\n\nBallerini – covered in glitter and wearing a sparking head-to-toe outfit (plus a matching sparkled pink guitar) – wasted little time in covering her catalog of contagious songs: A revamped rendition of 2017’s “Miss Me More,” pop-tinged piano ballad “I Quit Drinking” new single “Heartfirst” and a solo take on award-winning Chesney duet “Half of My Hometown” all made the cut.\n\nShe gave a one-two-three punch with a lightning-paced medley of “Love Me Like You Mean It,” “Dibs” and “Yeah Boy.” Still, no moment hit quite like an unvarnished solo rendition of “Homecoming Queen?,” prefaced by Ballerini asking fans to pull down life’s emotional filter and be “together in this room right now.”\n\n“Since I’ve seen you, there’s been a lot that’s happened in the world,” Ballerini said on stage. “Going into it’s been hard, but coming out of it’s been equally hard or harder and I’ve been struggling with major anxiety.\n\nShe continued, “I go back to this song that I wrote before the shutdown about giving myself permission to feel my feelings because we're all human and no one’s perfect.”\n\nAnd, of course, she brought a little white wine with her, sipping from a red Solo cup between songs before ending “with a bang” – drinking anthem “Hole In The Bottle.”\n\n“I just kinda feel like the luckiest girl in the world,” Ballerini said.\n\nNissan opens with 'Strawberry Wine'\n\n7:55 p.m.: Like “Two Dozen Roses” band Shenandoah a night ago, Nissan Stadium kicked off Friday with a shot of ‘90s country – this time from hometown singer Deana Carter.\n\nCarter didn’t waste time giving audiences what they hoped to hear: A run of throwback country favorites. She opened the set with “How Did I Get There” before singing “Did I Shave My Legs For This?” and “Count Me In,” each singles off Carter’s celebrated 1996 debut album also named “Did I Shave My Legs For This?”\n\n“How many ‘90s country fans did we got out here?” Carter said on stage. “We are celebrating the 25th anniversary of ‘Did I Shave My Legs For This?,’ my very first record. Some of you weren’t born, I know, but you heard it, right?”\n\nAs the sun set on Nissan Stadium, Carter closed her 30-minute set (after teasing a a surprise appearance from Wynonna Judd later in the night) with signature hit “Strawberry Wine” and a “thank you” to fans for coming out early.\n\n“God bless you,” she said after the set. “Thank y’all.”\n\nERNEST blends pop and country, a 'Flower Shops' performance blooms\n\n5 p.m.: Big Loud Records artist ERNEST has already achieved five No. 1 hits as a songwriter on the road to headlining on the Cumberland River on Friday afternoon at the Riverfront Stage. As the sweaty, blissful crowd eagerly awaited receiving the weekend's first performance of 2022 pop-country's favorite throwback anthem, \"Flower Shops,\" the star who frequently attended CMA Fest in his Nashville-based youth called his day-ending positioning a \"bucket list moment.\"\n\nHowever, as could be expected when he was announced as an artist inspired by \"everyone from Eminem to George Jones,\" he delivered a performance that expressed a breadth and depth of mainstream pop-friendly styles and influences. If -- as many were as the clock struck 4:30 on a delightfully balmy afternoon -- you were waiting to hear the previously-mentioned zooming to top-10 status country radio single, the broad scope of the Nashville native's impressive influences made waiting an unexpectedly enjoyable time.\n\nHe's a twanging, rock-adjacent crooner with an evident love of R & B. Thus, for as much as his 90s tastes err towards artists like Alan Jackson, listen closely and crossover soul crooners with flair like Babyface feel crucial to his sound, too. Dig deeper into his album cuts as live performances and vibes reminiscent of The Eagles' mid-70s work seep into \"Feet Wanna Run.\"\n\nIf thinking that ERNEST's artistry limited him to being a trucker-hat wearing everyman turned sepia-tinged jukebox, you discovered at the Riverfront Stage today that you're half right. In taking a longer listen to his \"Flower Shops\" The Album\" work like \"Comfortable When I'm Crazy,\" or songs like \"Wasted On You\" that he's penned for Morgan Wallen's record-setting streaming champion \"Dangerous: The Album,\" he's a pop-adoring songsmith still growing into his soon expected stardom\n\nFor the sun-kissed throng waiting for him to plug in his electronic acoustic guitar and sing about sad lovers' tear-filled blue and bloodshot-sad eyes, ERNEST emerged as a country performer worthy of keener attention.\n\nPowerful moments with country's next female stars\n\n2:30 p.m.:Here's a Friday afternoon report from Tennessean country music reporter Marcus K. Dowling.\n\nFor the past five hours at the 2022 CMA Fest, we've shared stories and incredible, transformative moments with a sextet of country music's next wave of female stars: Ingrid Andress, Priscilla Block, Ashland Craft, Miko Marks, Lily Rose and Hailey Whitters.\n\nWith three-time Grammy-nominated artist Andress, we conducted an in-depth interview for a forthcoming feature related to her new album.\n\nHaving taken a preview listen to the album, the track \"Yearbook\" (featuring the takeaway lyric that \"the pages only turn one way,\" a favorite for both the artist and reporter) took the early lead for the likely radio single-to-watch.\n\nCurrently, Andress has the Sam Hunt duet \"Wishful Drinking\" on country radio, and it's clear that she has more hyper-personal, open and aware songs to come.\n\nShe confronted a \"broken\" brain while writing her COVID-era breakout hit \"More Hearts Than Mine.\" Her desire to deny boredom in her songwriting led to a song that reflects people's ability to be more capable thinkers than they believe themselves to be.\n\nCMA Fest updates:The party rolls on Friday with Ingrid Andress, Miko Marks, boots and beers\n\nAs for Marks, her journey back to Nashville after dealing with racist slights by country's mainstream is a remarkable story (one we'll be telling soon). She joined the non-Andress quintet of previously mentioned artists at CMT's Next Women of Country songwriting round at the Country Music Hall of Fame's CMA Theater.\n\nThe last time many were present in the theater was when another influential female country artist — Naomi Judd — as posthumously inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nMarks was wistful when asked about being in a place where Wynonna feted Naomi.\n\nHowever, the power of being in the Hall of Fame in a moment wherein, like herself, more African-American female vocalists are being featured than ever (namely, Brittney Spencer, Mickey Guyton, Allison Russell and Rissi Palmer in the museum's American Currents exhibition in the past two years) was palpable.\n\nUpon being in space she's now shared with her sister artists, Marks was nearly overcome.\n\nFast-forward 90 minutes and while \"taking the CMA Theater to church\" (as event host and CMT Senior Vice President Leslie Fram noted) in front of a fan who saw her first at Fan Fair in 2005, Marks finally stood from her chair. Onstage, while singing an unreleased track, she loosed her throaty, gospel-tinged contralto to the world. And then, she cried tears of joy that left a room awestruck and similarly tear-jerked.\n\nThere may be no more heart-wrenching story, at least today, at CMA Fest.\n\nRegarding Whitters, Craft, Block and Rose, there may be no more rock-solid quartet of singer-songwriters (female or otherwise) currently set to impact country radio.\n\nGrammy-nominee Whitters performed \"Everything She Ain't from her 2022 star-making album \"Raised.\" Rose played her TikTok sensation \"Villain\" and followed it up with her single \"Stronger Than I Am,\" as two die-hard fans sang every word of both while sitting front-row center.\n\nBlock sang a stirring rendition of her 2020 hit \"Just About Over You.\" Her overwhelming, still-present humility and joy in the face of her rising stardom was noteworthy.\n\nCraft's \"Make It Past Georgia\" combines the one-time dive bar vocalist's vocal similarity to Janis Joplin with a song that compares heartbreak to exceptional weariness from life on the road. It'll be a slow-burning hit akin to Lainey Wilson's \"Things A Man Oughta Know,\" but it's a hit.\n\nA 'damn good time' with Willie Jones and more\n\n2 p.m.: Gabe Lee’s set had an intimate feel at the CMA Spotlight Stage starting at 2 p.m. in Fan Fair X. A crowd of around 50 sat, captivated by soulful “Susannah” in the middle of Lee’s acoustic set.\n\nLee’s honey-rich voice thanked the crowd and said CMA Fest has been an all-around pleasure this year. He finished his set with “Ol’ Smokey” from his 2019 album “farmland.”\n\nJoy and Allison Berringer were front-row for Lee’s set. They said they hadn’t heard him sing before but said they are big fans after seeing him sing live.\n\nThe couple is on their honeymoon from Nova Scotia, Canada. They are spending two weeks in Nashville, and Fan Fair X at CMA Fest has been their favorite event so far.\n\n“It’s great to see the newcomers perform,” Joy Berringer said. “We have our favorite stars, but then you come to this stage and say ‘okay they are getting big next.’”\n\nAllison Berringer scrolled through photos on his phone while he waited for the next artist to come onstage. He was particularly proud of the shots he took of Carrie Underwood on Thursday at her Amazon Prime concert.\n\nJoy looked on. “He’s the better photographer of the two of us,” she said.\n\nAbi and Candace Stoltzfus walked briskly into the Amp Stage around 12:15, weaving around the crowds of people heading out towards First Avenue. They had driven to Nashville from Pennsylvania on Wednesday.\n\nThe sisters hurried all the way to the barricade to be as close as possible before Willie Jones took the stage. Abi sported brown and white cow-print pants and Candance had suede cowboy boots to match her woven hat.\n\nCrowds cheered and fans stood up from their picnic blankets as Jones ran onstage and opened his set with “Slow Cookin.’”\n\n“We’re just gonna rock out and have a damn good time out here” Jones said before singing “Down For It.”\n\nJones followed “Back Porch” with an unreleased song he said would be out later this summer. He dedicated it to “all the pretty girls” in the crowd. Fans swayed and waved their arms to the music.\n\nCMA Fest for free:No tickets required for these concerts\n\nFive unforgettable moments:CMA Fest makes triumphant return\n\nShocker: Boots are flying off the shelves\n\n1 p.m.: A fleet of emergency vehicles lined 1st Avenue South, in between the Riverfront Stage and Amp Stage. The fleet included everything from a Vanderbilt Life Flight ambulance to an “ambubus” — a retrofitted school bus —that belongs to the Nashville Fire Department.\n\n12:30 p.m. Plenty of freebies were available at the Busch stand at the Amp Stage. Staffers were handing out custom coozies, cooling bandanas, CMA Fest posters and popsicles.\n\nFans were relaxing at the Busch bar, where a line-up of guest bartenders included Ashley Cooke and Breland Friday.\n\n12: p.m. Customers were nearly shoulder-to-shoulder inside Boot Country on Lower Broadway. The store is known for its “buy one, get two” deals on boots.\n\nMarketing coordinator Jessica Spencer said business has picked up overall in Nashville recently.\n\n“CMA has definitely picked us up,” she said. “It’s like having 3-4 Saturdays in a row.”\n\nDeb Wing was mulling over a choice between white and gray ankle boots. She was in from La Crosse, Wisconsin, with friends.\n\n“I’m gonna wear them around right now shopping to break them in for tomorrow,” Wing said.\n\nHer friend Lainee Nummerdor sprang for a pair of tall brown boots studded with rhinestones and sparkly stitching.\n\nTheir group was off for more shopping, with plans to grab drinks and catch some music inside Ole Red a few doors down later.\n\nA cloudy morning\n\n11 a.m.: A large crowd bobbed their heads and held phones high as Larry Fleet played the Riverfront Stage. Families, groups of friends and people of all ages gathered to listen to Fleet.\n\n“This is the first song I ever recorded. Sing along if you know it,” Fleet said as he kicked off “Where I Find God.”\n\nThe crowd didn’t disappoint, with many joining in as the chorus rang out.\n\nDay 2 was off to slower start under cloudy skies, but the crowd was steadily growing downtown by 10:45 a.m. Music was blaring from a few honky tonks and exhibits. A lone party bus with a few dancing patrons meandered down 4th Avenue as festival-goers waited to cross.\n\nThe temperatures hovered in the the mid-70s for the morning, but forecast calls for a high in the mid-80s and chance of scattered showers and thunderstorms later in the day.\n\nDay one highlights\n\nRead on for a look back at moments from Thursday, opening day of CMA Fest in Nashville.\n\nKeith Urban: 'You guys might’ve missed this whole thing as much as we did'\n\n11:45 p.m.: Keith Urban described in two words what those who trekked cross-country — or further — likely felt when gates finally opened and music began pouring out of CMA Fest.\n\n\"We're back,\" Urban said during his night-closing set at Nissan Stadium.\n\nHe added, \"I had the feeling you guys might’ve missed this whole thing as much as we did.\"\n\nAnd much like those who traveled a far distance to fill the stadium seats, Urban spent his time on stage covering as much ground as possible from a career rooted in six-string exploration. He opened with extended guitar ripper \"Days Go By\" before soulful fan-favorite \"Blue Ain't Your Color,\" dream-chasing anthem \"Wild Hearts\" and an unrestrained solo take on \"You'll Think of Me.\"\n\nOn returning to CMA Fest, Urban told The Tennessean backstage before his performance: \"The energy of this crowd is unlike anywhere. It's such a unique moment. This week in Nashville, period, is unlike any other time in the city. This year especially, [after] having a two-year, pent-up absence. I can already feel it – everybody's ready to make up for lost time.\"\n\n\"You guys are making up for lost time tonight,\" Urban said. \"This is insane.\"\n\nJason Aldean returns to 'his kinda party'\n\n2022's Academy of Country Music, iHeartRadio, and CMT Song of the Year award winner (with Carrie Underwood for the duet \"If I Didn't Love You\") Jason Aldean's solo CMA Fest performance showed he is engrossed by the third and wildly successful era of his two-decade-long country career.\n\nEarlier, he remarked that \"Trouble With A Heartbreak's\" current three-week run atop Billboard's Country Airplay chart was doubly important. Foremost, it's the first time he's had the No. 1 song in the genre during CMA Fest. It also continues a run of success that compares to the success achieved by his 2009 hit \"Big Green Tractor.\"\n\n\"If you expected me to bring out guests, you're gonna be sad tonight,\" he offered as he swaggered into the Tennessee Titans' press room earlier Thursday evening. To that end, his live set was highlighted by solid takes on his 2010 hits \"My Kinda Party\" and \"Dirt Road Anthem.\"\n\nPhysically, it appears he's decided to double down in the gym to elevate his delivery as a live performer. Since telling the Tennessean in April 2022 that he didn't expect to be here \"in a trillion years,\" he's clearly making an effort to be ready to fulfill the expectations of continued unprecedented acclaim.\n\nAldean's looking at spending much of the rest of 2022 on the road. Thus, his 45-minute set at Nissan Stadium was a rocking dress rehearsal of what will likely transpire over two hours on stage in venues across America.\n\nNotable also was the quality of his vocal performance. New single \"That's What Tequila Does\" (from the \"Macon\" half of now fully-released double-album \"Macon, Georgia\"), plus a solo, live piano-driven take of the previously-mentioned \"If I Didn't Love You,\" sans Carrie Underwood (a 2021 Aldean live tour staple) were strong, comfortable, and in line with expecting album-quality work from the superstar.\n\nZac Brown Band awes Nissan Stadium by 'Taking It To The Limit' (one more time)\n\n9:30 p.m.: In an interview before hitting the stage at Nissan Stadium, Zac Brown told The Tennessean that he has played 5500 shows in the past 22 years. The reason?\n\n\"I still feel like I'm winning over live crowds, man,\" he said. \"We don't get to open for acts too much anymore, so festivals like these let us connect with people who may only stream us, or aren't too familiar with our live show.\"\n\nCountry music's beloved traveling troubadours maintained that status with tracks like 2006's \"Toes,\" causing -- as expected -- the 50,000-plus in attendance to break out in impromptu stadium seat dance parties.\n\nHowever, most impressive was his cover of \"Take It To The Limit,\" The Eagles' 1975 smash. His vocal performance both pleased and stunned a crowd not entirely sure of what to make of a current superstar making a play for a larger stake as a genre-shaping icon. When the set airs as part of ABC's August 3 \"CMA Fest\" special, it's worth watching.\n\nBrown's desire to mimic the likes of Luke Bryan and Dierks Bentley as a mentor for younger country acts showcased itself on the big stage at Nissan as Nashville favorites King Calaway played their latest single, \"See You When I Get Home,\" alongside Brown. In addition, he's helmed the writing and production of their forthcoming album project.\n\nThe juxtaposition of the fresh-faced quartet of Chris Deaton, Simon Dumas, Chad Michael Jervis and Caleb Miller alongside Brown's much rougher presentation highlighted his ear and eye for talent supersedes stereotypical expectations.\n\nAlso, in a continuing trend after Billy Strings' appearance at Marty Stuart's Wednesday evening Late Night Jam at the Ryman Auditorium, breakout guitarist Marcus King joined Brown to perform their 2021-released track \"Stubborn Pride.\" King's blistering solo floored an audience seemingly largely unaware of his road-developed instrumental prowess.\n\nAnd yes, the set was bookended by his ever-reliable hits separated by just over a decade, 2008's \"Chicken Fried\" and 2021's \"Same Boat.\"\n\nDarius Rucker: 'I love this Weekend'\n\n8:30 p.m.: The sun set on Nissan Stadium, and everything's 'Alright' with Darius Rucker.\n\nThe Grammy Award-winning star took the stage in a throwback Rolling Stones tour t-shirt, singing his 2009 chart-topper \"Alright\" before reminding onlookers of his one-of-a-kind croon with the mandolin-backed \"Come Back Song.\"\n\n\"Ain't it great to be back in Nashville — in-person — seeing a show?\" Rucker said on stage. \"Man, I love this weekend.\"\n\nThe performance capped a day-long victory lap for Rucker, who kicked off performances at the Spotify House inside Ole Red on Lower Broadway Thursday morning and stopped by the Gibson Garage hours before his stadium set for an acoustic performance.\n\n\"I've been playing the CMA Fest since 2009 and it's awesome to see you guys come together to have this party in this beautiful building,\" Rucker said, adding: \"That's awesome to me.\"\n\nAnd it wouldn't be a Rucker show without a little Hootie & The Blowfish (or a lot of \"Wagon Wheel\"). He delivered on both, performing 1990s rock staple \"I Only Wanna Be With You\" before later closing with his award-winning Old Crow Medicine Show cover.\n\nReturning to Nissan Stadium\n\n7:55 p.m.: CMA Fest returned to Nissan Stadium with a taste of throwback country courtesy of 1980s and '90s hitmaking group Shenandoah.\n\nThe band revved up early showgoers with renditions of nostalgic '90s foot-stompers \"Next To You, Next To Me\" and \"If Bubba Can Dance (I Can Too)\" before cutting into tender ballad \"I Want To Be Loved Like That\" — the night's first stadium singalong — and signature song \"Two Dozen Roses.\"\n\n\"Let's throw a little gas on the fire,\" frontman Marty Raybon said to muchb approval as the band kicked into \"If Bubba Can Dance.\"\n\nPrior to Shenandoah, rising country singer Brittney Spencer took the stage for a stirring take on the \"Star-Spangled Banner.\"\n\nFans seek out shade (and go for a swim?)\n\n4:30 p.m. The crowds had thinned considerably downtown by 4 p.m. Sun-wearied festival-goers took advantage of the shade as the sun dropped lower into the sky and ducked into honky tonks and enclosed exhibits around downtown.\n\nA modest crowd gathered for Tenille Arts, signing along with arms waving.\n\n\"This is a bucket-list stage for me,\" she said at the top of the set.\n\nBehind her, boats floated on the river in the afternoon heat and a few jumped in for a swim.\n\nA religious experience on opening day\n\n3 p.m.: One word describes the first five hours on Lower Broadway: religious.\n\nJimmie Allen's opening stage banter at the Chevy Riverfront Stage at 10:45 AM included the 2021 CMA New Artist of the Year, noting that he believes in God and \"God's not a loser.\"\n\nTwo hours later, country hitmaker Hardy was leading the stage's capacity-packed, booze-filled and heartily-entertained crowd on a tour through \"God's Country.\"\n\nAt CMA Fest, it's readily apparent that country music's Mother Church is up the street. However, country music's time-worn Christian values are among the vibes governing day one of the 49th CMA Fest.\n\nRegarding all things timelessly country, the genre's close affiliation with easy-listening rock and roll was spotlighted as Darius Rucker opened Spotify House at Blake Shelton's Ole Red bar.\n\nHearing Rucker lament his emotional reaction to watching his beloved Miami Dolphins lose football games in 1994 Hootie and the Blowfish hit \"Only Wanna Be With You\" (\"Sometimes you're crazy then you wonder why / I'm such a baby 'cause the Dolphins make me cry\") is a heartwarming hallmark of his songwriting.\n\nThat same lyric sung by a bar crowd at a mega-massive festival sounds like a Catholic choir uttering a responsorial psalm.\n\nEven deeper, the day's sermon was delivered by 2022 Academy of Country Music Song of the Year award-winner Lainey Wilson.\n\nIn front of a crowd whipped into a Godfearing, devil-may-care, redneck country frenzy by Hardy, the Baskin, Louisiana native sang sweetly about maintaining self-respect while expecting a mate to show kindness via her singles \"Heart Like A Truck\" and \"Things A Man Oughta Know.\"\n\nAs brother-tandem LOCASH's new single \"Beach Boys\" sounded like timelessly-adored songs by the band sharing the track's title, a sweltering yet fun afternoon on the banks of the Cumberland River sweatily sauntered on.\n\nIn short, CMA Fest 2022, so far, has been highlighted by country music being in the throes of unearthing its core values and celebrating its most warmly beloved sounds.\n\nHardy rocks the Riverfront\n\n12:30 p.m.: The banks of the Cumberland were packed as Hardy got underway at noon, drawing loud cheers as he sang \"Boots\" before he launched into \"Give Heaven Some Hell.\"\n\nLainey Wilson joined him and handed him a beer as he kicked off \"One Beer.\" He encouraged the crowd to raise their respective drinks as they sang along.\n\n\"No more love songs, no more sad songs, we're just gonna play some country sh— and rock your face off for the rest of the set,\" he said before belting out \"Rednecker\" while the crowd roared.\n\nOther highlights from the artist and songwriter included the Blake Shelton hit \"God's Country,\" which Hardy said was one of the songs he's most proud of co-writing.\n\nHe closed the tight 30-minute set with \"Unapologetically Country as Hell.\"\n\n11 a.m. : The morning continued to warm up with Rita Wilson opening the Chevy Vibes stage at 11 a.m. A crowd of a little more than 150 reclined on picnic blankets and swayed to the music against the backdrop of Bridgestone Arena.\n\nMusic from honky tonks spilled onto the street nearby as crowds ambled in and out of line for concession stands and merchandise booths.\n\nA line of people stretched to more than 100 a few blocks down Broadway at the entrance of the Spotify House. People waved paper fans and squinted against the summer sun.\n\nTicket troubles, patriotic overalls and country's 'family'\n\nBack on Lower Broadway, Jolynn Grashorn and her sister-in-law Jenny McCloy ducked into a food tent along Broadway to get a slice of pizza around 11:30 a.m.\n\nGrashorn said she flew in from Omaha and met McCloy Tuesday, who had driven in from Marion, Iowa.\n\nThe two are spending time with family in town and had plans to catch the next acts on the Chevy Vibes stage at noon.\n\nThey said they're happy to be back at the festival after the two-year hiatus but were frustrated that everything is digitized — from tickets to festival maps and guides.\n\n\"I wasn't impressed with all that,\" Grashorn said.\n\nThey said they saw an older woman crying at the Fan Fair X area because she didn't have internet on her phone and no way to access her ticket. They also said they had trouble transferring tickets via Ticketmaster but eventually found a way.\n\nFans missed the fest the past two years and were thrilled to see it return. Abbey Tozzi was an intern for CMA in 2019 and was helping to plan the 2020 festival before it was cancelled.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking,\" she said of the cancellation.\n\nTozzi has been planning this weekend for a year, and waited in the Spotify House line for two hours with her friend Mary Putko, a 3rd grade teacher from Florida.\n\n\"It's the best lineup\" Putko said. \"I'm like, hello, we need to get in there.\"\n\nTozzi said her favorite part about seeing CMA fest return is the community of fans.\n\n\"Community is really important, and the country music community is like a family,\" Tozzi said. \"It's unlike any other genre.\"\n\nRodney Walls was clad head-to-toe in American flag overalls as he headed to see Hardy at the Riverfront Stage just before noon.\n\nHe said he hails from Capshaw, Alabama and has added his own flares to the overalls, including a few stars stitched onto the pockets.\n\nHe's been coming to CMA Fest since 2012 and said he's especially looking forward to seeing Mark Wills.\n\n\"I'm kinda old school — like Joe Nichols and all that,\" he said.\n\nHe was visiting with his friend, David Ellis, who's a Nashville resident. Walls said he drew looks and sparked conversation when he donned some \"Yee Haw\" overalls a few years back.\n\nA busy, beautiful morning\n\n10 a.m.: Crowds were already filling in along Lower Broadway under sunny skies and 75 degree weather. Music from a few honky tonks punctuated lines of food trucks downtown, featuring everything from beignets to gyros.\n\nCrowds were concentrated around the Fan Fair X at Music City Center and the Riverfront Stage, where Jimmie Allen was playing.\n\nMNPD officers were on hand directing traffic while security workers guided people to stages and checked bags.\n\nCMA has turned Fort Nashborough — which sits next to the Riverfront Stage — into the \"Riverside Retreat.\" Mist blowers, premium drinks, the whole nine yards. AND a lovely view of the Riverside barge.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2021/05/14/okc-live-music-showboat-concert-series-comes-to-bricktown-canal/5097270001/", "title": "OKC live music: Showboat Concert Series comes to Bricktown Canal", "text": "A new concert series believed to be the first of its kind is launching next week on downtown Oklahoma City's Bricktown Canal.\n\nTickets are on sale today for the Showboat Concert Series, which will offer live concerts by local musicians on one of the Bricktown Water Taxis Thursday nights through the end of August.\n\nStarting next week with OKC singer-songwriter Carter Sampson, the series will offer 7, 8 and 9 p.m. sets on Thursday nights.

Showcasing the group's brotherly harmonies, “Annalie” displays Hanson's influences from craftsmen like Paul Simon and the flavors of South African guitar, while the lyrics reflect Memphis and other musical places from which the band draws its inspiration.\n\n“Annalie welcomes people into this music with an uplifting spirit while highlighting much deeper meaning in the lyrics and story, which is a call out for grace amidst the journey of life. We felt like it was a great song to begin this epic journey” said Zac Hanson in a statement.\n\nOver the next few months, fans can anticipate tracks across the spectrum of pop and rock, from the power-pop of “Don’t Ever Change,” featuring Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Rick Nielsen of Cheap Trick on lead guitar, to “Fearless” which tips its hat to the symphonic work of the band’s previous project \"String Theory.\"\n\nAlongside the release of music throughout 2021, the Hanson brothers will launch a concert series that will take place from July-October at the legendary Cain's Ballroom in the band’s hometown of Tulsa. Along with the live debut of the latest single from\" Against The World,\" each show will be unique, highlighting different eras of the band’s career.

Songs from such legendary songwriters as Stevie Wonder, Donny Hathaway and Paul Simon are presented through a jazz lens with a compelling performance from the New York-based vocalist and her skilled band.\n\n\"Dreams of Waking\" features Tucker alongside pianists Cyrus Chestnut and Sullivan Fortner, bassists Dezron Douglas and Vicente Archer, drummers Johnathan Blake and Joe Dyson along with saxophonist John Ellis and trumpeter Giveton Gelin.\n\n“'Dreams of Waking' refers to the hope that our society will develop an awareness of the inequities that still exist,” Tucker said in a statement. “It’s the dream that we will become fully conscious and attuned to the hopes, dreams and needs of every human being.”\n\nTucker teamed up with blues and Americana artist Keb Mo’ to co-write the title track to his 2020 Grammy-winning album \"Oklahoma.\" Tucker’s sole original composition for her new album, “Do We Sleep?” issues a passionate call for cultural awakening that echoes the title of the album and comes with a dramatic music video:\n\n“Many of my original songs are internal statements that help to chronicle my growth, experiences and evolution that I hope will inspire others,” Tucker said in a statement. “This time, I decided to focus on the external. Are we really awake? What are we doing to give attention to the cries of injustice and inequality, or are we complicit by silence, ignorance or lack of interest and awareness?”\n\nBorn in Tulsa to a family of singers and ministers, Tucker and her siblings traveled the country singing with their parents. From there, Tucker has experienced a diverse array of locales that she has called home, including Interlaken, Switzerland; Nashville, Tennessee; and finally, New York City. Tucker has since toured nationally with her own bands and also with renowned hybrid guitarist Charlie Hunter.\n\nA 12-song project, \"Dreams of Waking: Music For a Better World\" was recorded by Grammy-winning engineer Mike Marciano and produced by Greg Bryant.

As a result, we created an epic sound, in which his guitar playing was icing on the cake. I always walk away in awe of his magic.”\n\nWakeley also is celebrating two No. 1 hits on Billboard’s Hard Rock Digital Song Sales, for his previous Satrini collaboration “Conflicted” and his new project's second single, “Sinners and Saints.”\n\n“Playing guitar on Kitt’s new album has been a fun, exhilarating experience, and a musical challenge too,” said Satriani in a statement. “Kitt's huge, cinematic sound makes each one of his songs a powerful sonic journey. I’m so happy I was able to contribute to this stellar album.”\n\nWakeley will perform live at 7 p.m. May 22 at Oklahoma City's Civic Center Music Hall in honor of the album release. Tickets range between $35 to $75 and are on sale at https://www.okcciviccenter.com.\n\n\"Symphony of Sinners and Saints,\" the follow-up to Wakeley’s album \"Midnight in Macedonia,\" features legends like Satriani, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Dallas All Star Choir.

And it's not just the horse races and fashion we're excited about. It's all the famous people we get to welcome to the city as we communally celebrate \"The Most Exciting Two Minutes in Sports.\"\n\nThe entire weekend of the Kentucky Derby is one big party that really gets rolling on Derby Eve at various glitzy charity balls, including the world-class Unbridled Eve Derby Gala held at the Galt House Hotel Grand Ballroom in downtown Louisville on Friday, May 5.\n\nFor a 10th year, Unbridled Eve co-founders Tammy York Day and Tonya York (yes, they're sisters), and their planning committee will roll out the red carpet — literally — for celebrities from film, television, music, comedy, and sports, including horse racing industry professionals, and influential national business leaders.\n\nSo who can we expect to walk the red carpet in 2023? Well, the list is long but we'll dish on just a few of the celebs to get things started.\n\nThe 2023 Unbridled Eve Derby Gala celebrity guest list includes country music superstar Randy Travis, actor D.B. Woodside (\"Lucifer,\" \"The Night Agent\"), Cheap Trick frontman Robin Zander, former University of Louisville quarterback Chris Redman, singer Macy Gray, television host Chris Harrison (\"The Bachelor\"), former pro basketball player Lisa Leslie, rapper Percy \"Master P\" Miller, best selling author Nora Roberts and dozens of other glamourous people including some of the jockeys who will be riding in the 149th Kentucky Derby.\n\nYou may like:Long dresses or short hems?

Your fashion guide for Derby 2023\n\n\"Unbridled has built a solid reputation on a quality guest experience and a big part is our entertainment,\" Tammy York Day, co-founder of the Unbridled Eve Derby Gala, told the Courier Journal. \"Every year we have top performers in pop, vintage rock, hip-hop, and country. This year's lineup is a continuation of that excellence.\"\n\nThe elegant annual party is an Offical Kentucky Derby event held the night after the exciting Kentucky Oaks and on the eve of the legendary Kentucky Derby.\n\n\"Of course, we have our Derby regulars who will be back, like Warren Moon, Bob Guiney, Bonnie-Jill Laflin, John Elefante, and Mike Mills,\" said Tonya York. \"We have an entire group who return every year and have become a Derby family.\"\n\nBetween the races at Churchill Downs and the Derby Eve galas, no wonder more than a few celebrities make the trip to Louisville an annual outing. Known for southern hospitality, posh specialty bars and star-studded entertainment, parties like Unbridled Eve may be swarming with celebrities but you can buy a ticket and get in on the celebration of the Kentucky Derby, too.\n\nIndividual tickets to Unbridled Eve, which include specialty cocktails, dinner and entertainment, start at $1,110. Dance party-only tickets are $400.\n\nWho knows, you may end up elbow to elbow with Warren Moon on the dance floor or sipping a curated cocktail like a Miami Mu11e created for the evening by E11EVEN Vodka.\n\nYou may likeHow Las Vegas showgirls inspired this duo's Kentucky Derby hat empire.

For 2023, silent auction items include a rare Prohibition Era Bourbon and \"Secretariat Sculpture in Mahogany,\" a stunning sculpture inspired by the iconic 1973 Triple Crown winner.\n\nTonya York told the Courier Journal this year's fundraising also includes a $100 raffle ticket that puts you in the running for a five-bottle collection of Pappy Van Winkle including Old Rip Van Winkle 10 Year, Van Winkle Special Reserve 12 Year, Pappy Van Winkle 15 Year, 20 Year and 23 Year bottles.

This January is the first month since it opened in September 2018 that Fiserv Forum hasn't had a concert scheduled. Thanks to the Democratic National Convention, bookings won't be possible from at least late June through July.\n\nBut Saha said the venue has already booked 21 concerts, nine of which have been announced.\n\nMeanwhile, this June, Summerfest will unveil the remodeled American Family Insurance Amphitheater with at least 14 shows, including three after the Big Gig.\n\nBeyond the acts we already know are playing Fiserv Forum and Summerfest's amphitheater, which superstars should you expect to see in Milwaukee in 2020?\n\nHere are 20 predictions.\n\nLuke Bryan\n\nThe country superstar has been one of the most frequent Summerfest amphitheater bookings of the past decade, but he hasn't played there since 2017. With none of the Wisconsin country festivals booking him, expect to see him at the Big Gig.\n\n(Editor's Note: After this story was published, Summerfest announced that Luke Bryan would headline the American Family Insurance Amphitheater June 25, with guests Morgan Wallen and Caylee Hammack.)\n\nBTS\n\nLast month, the K-pop boy band teased a tour kickoff in April. The past couple of years their U.S. tours have been just a couple dates in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles — but their average concert gross was only second to the Rolling Stones in North America in 2019, according to Pollstar. They're more than ready to expand their routing to other markets. Will Milwaukee be one of them?\n\nCardi B\n\nSummerfest will try to lock in a rapper for the amphitheater. Our best guess for 2020 is Cardi B, who was in Europe last summer but is more likely to be stateside during the fest's window.\n\nLuke Combs\n\nThe country star is the biggest name by far at Country Jam in Eau Claire in July, so a radius clause might prevent a Summerfest booking. But that doesn't rule out a Fiserv Forum stop in the fall.\n\nDixie Chicks\n\nNatalie Maines told the \"Spiritualgasm\" podcast last fall that the band is releasing its first album in 14 years, \"Gaslighter,\" in 2020, and touring arenas.\n\nSelena Gomez\n\nGomez releases her highly anticipated new album \"Rare\" Friday, her first in five years, and tour news is likely to come soon.\n\nHalsey\n\nHalsey also has a new album out this month, \"Manic,\" so expect a tour announcement soon, shortly before or after she performs on \"Saturday Night Live\" Jan. 25.\n\n(Editor's note: Two days after this story was first posted, Summerfest announced Halsey would headline the American Family Insurance Amphitheater July 3, with Chvrches and Omar Apollo also on the bill.)\n\nSam Hunt\n\nThe country star hasn't released an album or played Milwaukee since he released his first album six years ago. His sophomore release, and more touring, are expected in 2020.\n\n(Editor's note: Summerfest announced on Feb. 5 that Sam Hunt would headline the American Family Insurance Amphitheater June 26.)\n\nImagine Dragons\n\nImagine Dragons will forever be linked with one of Summerfest's most memorable nights — when 100,000 people descended on Maier Festival Park in 2013. It would make sense for Summerfest to book them for the redone amphitheater's first year.\n\nKendrick Lamar\n\nLamar has booked several summer festival dates in Europe. Could he be gearing up to release his followup to \"Damn\" with a fall arena tour?\n\nMy Chemical Romance\n\nLast month, the band played its first show since breaking up in 2013, and you just know there's going to be a lot more of them in 2020.\n\nNo Doubt\n\nThe group's breakout album \"Tragic Kingdom\" is celebrating its 25th anniversary, and drummer Adrian Young hinted on Instagram they might tour to mark the occasion.\n\nPearl Jam\n\nPearl Jam is celebrating its 30th anniversary in 2020, and the band already announced several European shows this summer, with rumors that a new album, and North American tour dates, are coming.\n\nKaty Perry\n\nWill we see Perry sing her latest single \"Harleys in Hawaii\" in Harley-Davidson's hometown? Regardless, you can see her at the Milwaukee Art Museum during an \"American Idol\" auditions episode in February.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nParton's been everywhere in recent months: a Grand Ole Opry primetime special, plenty of screen time in Ken Burns' \"Country Music,\" co-hosting the CMA Awards, a Netflix drama series based on her songs, even a Dollywood-set Hallmark Christmas movie. Could a victory-lap tour be next? Fun fact: Parton was a headliner when Summerfest first opened its amphitheater in 1987, so maybe we'll see her come back to do it again.\n\nRage Against the Machine\n\nThe politically charged rock group is back together ahead of the 2020 election, and considering Wisconsin's a battleground state, we suspect they'll play Milwaukee, likely in the fall.\n\n(Editor's note: On Feb. 10, Rage Against the Machine announced a show at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy on July 10, three days before the start of the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee.)\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers\n\nFans were thrilled to learn last month that John Frusciante is back in the fold for the first time in 10 years. Naturally, they're going to hit the road.\n\nShakira\n\nFiserv Forum's Saha told the Journal Sentinel the venue plans to host Latin music again in 2020. Will it be Shakira? She's playing the Super Bowl halftime show in February with Jennifer Lopez; performers frequently use the gig as a launching pad for a tour.\n\nBruce Springsteen\n\nThe Boss said last May he was going back to work with the E Street Band in 2020, with a new album and a tour to follow. Springsteen's at the top of the wish list for Summerfest's longtime talent buyer, Bob Babisch. Could they get a date for the new amphitheater's inaugural season?\n\nSugarland\n\nKristian Bush from the country duo told Billboard in November they were going to release a new album in 2020. It was surprising that they opted for Green Bay over Milwaukee for their reunion tour two years ago. It's doubtful they'll bypass the market again this year.\n\nEditor's Note: After this story was first posted, Sugarland announced a summer tour that includes a July 25 appearance at the American Family Insurance Amphitheater.\n\nRELATED:These are all the Milwaukee arena, stadium and amphitheater shows happening in 2020\n\nRELATED:Here's the latest look at Summerfest's $53 million overhaul of the American Family Insurance Amphitheater\n\nRELATED:In first full year, Milwaukee's Fiserv Forum is the 25th top-grossing arena for concerts in U.S.\n\nRELATED:From Billy Joel to Pink to Tool, these were the 18 top grossing concerts in Milwaukee in 2019\n\nContact Piet at (414) 223-5162 or plevy@journalsentinel.com.

There were no injuries from the event, and no munitions aboard the aircraft, though the Air Force’s 509th Bomb Wing Public Affairs announced days later there would be a “safety pause” of the fleet in order to inspect it further.\n\nThe 509th Bomb Wing said in a news release on Tuesday evening that the stand-down was directed by Air Force Global Strike Command, and that the B-2 fleet “can be flown if directed by the commander in chief to fulfill mission requirements.”\n\nMaster Sgt. Beth Del Vecchio, a spokesperson for the 509th Bomb Wing, confirmed on Tuesday that B-2 flights were currently paused as the fleet underwent an inspection, and said there is “no speculated end date for the safety pause.”\n\n“Every incident is unique, and we are currently evaluating the incident and how we can mitigate future risk,” Del Vecchio said. “Normal operations will resume at the conclusion of the safety pause.”\n\nAn Air Force spokesperson said Tuesday that the Whiteman Air Force Base runway was currently closed due to debris; the 509th Bomb Wing’s news release on Tuesday says it will reopen as soon as the debris is cleared, and B-2 operations “will resume at the conclusion of the safety stand-down.”\n\nThe B-2 Spirit is a multi-role heavy bomber, meaning it can carry both conventional and nuclear munitions.

Penney store closings 2020: Bankruptcy raises liquidation risk", "text": "With 846 stores and 85,000 employees, J.C. Penney could be the largest symbol of what COVID-19 may mean for retailers already struggling for survival.\n\nThe department store chain filed for bankruptcy Friday and is asking a federal judge to authorize the rejection of 20 leases in the opening salvo of the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company said it plans to \"accelerate\" permanent store closings as part of its bankruptcy but declined to provide details on which locations it plans to shutter.\n\nThe move sets in motion the process of beginning permanent store closings as the retailer aims to stabilize its finances and avoid outright liquidation – a fate that chains such as Papyrus, Modell’s Sporting Goods and Art Van Furniture haven't been able to avoid.\n\nJ.C. Penney proposed a restructuring plan that would shed billions of dollars in debt and allow the company to emerge from bankruptcy as a financially sustainable company.\n\nBut U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David Jones told J.C. Penney attorneys in a rare Saturday hearing that he has \"concerns\" that the company is not moving \"fast enough.\"\n\n\"I do think there is a genuine hope that the turnaround efforts will proceed, but it is kind of hard when people are prohibited from coming into your store and you can’t turn the lights on,\" Jones said.\n\nChapter 11 bankruptcy:J.C. Penney files for bankruptcy protection, plans some permanent store closings\n\nCan these 13 retailers survive?:Permanent store closings, bankruptcies coming amid coronavirus chaos\n\nHe indicated, however, that he would like to help mitigate the effects of the bankruptcy on the company's workers. \"There’s a special place in my heart for employees, more so in the current state of affairs in our country,\" Jones said.\n\nLater, he added, \"I want to keep everybody’s eyes focused on saving the business. This is middle America, at least in my view.\"\n\nAlthough the coronavirus came suddenly, J.C. Penney's troubles are far from new. And the company is not alone as shoppers' habits and tastes have changed and more consumers turn to online commerce. Fashion chain J. Crew Group and luxury department store retailer Neiman Marcus Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this month as they faced mounting losses with their stores temporarily closed.\n\nU.S. retailers have announced more than 2,000 permanent closures this year, most of which were made public before the pandemic began, according to retail analytics firm Coresight Research, a global advisory and research firm.\n\nJ.C. Penney might have been able to stave off bankruptcy by closing more stores sooner, Deborah Weinswig, CEO and founder of Coresight Research, told USA TODAY.\n\n“If they had shed real estate and been more draconian, this moment might not have happened, but they would have been a shell of their former selves,” she said. “Perhaps this teaches us that Macy’s has been right all along with shuttering stores and trying to get to a more manageable online/offline formula with a right-sized store base.”\n\nWhile J.C. Penney hopes to survive bankruptcy by separating into a real estate investment trust and an operating company, analysts say the retailer is facing a serious risk of outright liquidation.\n\n\"We believe this process will give us the financial strength to weather the pandemic and evolve our business while also reducing our debt and increasing our flexibility to better position JCPenney for the future,\" CEO Jill Soltau said in a letter to customers. \"This will allow us to better serve you, our valued customer.\"\n\nJ.C. Penney filed a motion late Friday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas Corpus Christi Division requesting permission to shed leases for 14 department stores, three home furnishings locations, two auto centers and one stockroom.\n\nThe company said in a court filing that it had \"already vacated the premises associated with all but one\" of the leases it proposed to reject.\n\nJ.C. Penney spokesperson Brooke Buchanan declined to provide further details.\n\nSucharita Kodali, a retail analyst at Forrester, believes COVID-19 has accelerated the inevitable for J.C. Penney and the other retailers who have recently filed for bankruptcy.\n\n“I think these are weak retailers that have been challenged for a long time and we’re going to see many more bankruptcies,” she said, adding some retailers might have been able to hang on another year or two before filing if not for the pandemic.\n\nSome other chains facing challenges going into the pandemic, according to analysts, are fashion retailers Forever 21; Ascena Retail Group, the owner of Lane Bryant, Justice and Ann Taylor; home furnishings chain Pier 1; bridal and formalwear seller David's Bridal; and vitamin and supplement retailer GNC Holdings.\n\nThe retailer had 846 stores as of Friday, including 387 that it owns, Chief Financial Officer Bill Wafford said in a court filing. Of those, 110 are operating on ground leases.\n\nMost of the company's locations have been temporarily closed since late March amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut with some states gradually reopening after several weeks of shutdowns, J.C. Penney has fully reopened 41 stores and is offering curbside-only service at another seven.\n\nWith nearly 85,000 employees, most of whom are furloughed, and a supply chain of almost 3,000 vendors, J.C. Penney remains a significant operation despite its struggles.\n\nThe company has gone from a small dry-goods store in Kemmerer, Wyoming, to a fixture in the shopping experience of the American middle class to the latest victim of the digital revolution.\n\nFounded in Wyoming in 1902 by James Cash Penney with $500 in personal savings and a $1,500 promissory note from his local bank, J.C. Penney was first known by the name Golden Rule.\n\nThe company grew quickly. It had 175 stores by 1917, 500 by 1924 and 1,000 by 1929, according to a court filing.\n\nJ.C. Penney went public in 1929 less than a week before the stock market crashed, marking the beginning of the Great Depression.\n\n\"To weather the downturn at this inflection point in the Company’s history, JCPenney proactively pared-back inventory, focused its merchandise on everyday goods, and identified lower-price suppliers, allowing for lower consumer prices and higher margins,\" Wofford said in a court filing.\n\nIn a way, that strategy mirrors what J.C. Penney has been trying to do in recent years. After taking over in late 2018, Soltau earned praise from analysts for refocusing the company on its core merchandise – namely, women's apparel and accessories – while ditching losing items like appliances and furniture.\n\nBut her strategy, they say, came too late for the company after it racked up nearly $5 billion in debt and failed to reinvent itself to take advantage of the digital age.\n\nTo be sure, the decline of the department store sector was virtually inescapable. Like archrival Sears, which filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late 2018, and luxury chain Neiman Marcus, which filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this month, J.C. Penney has faced declining foot traffic to malls and the rise of nimbler physical competitors like T.J. Maxx and Marshalls.\n\nStill, the company had a \"substantial liquidity cushion\" before the pandemic and \"was improving its operations,\" Wofford said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, that progress was wiped out with the onset of COVID-19,\" he said.\n\nIn April, total sales fell by 88% compared with a year earlier. That included \"nearly zero\" sales in physical stores.\n\nThe company hopes to survive the restructuring process by shedding billions of dollars in debt and emerging as a more sustainable entity.\n\nGreg Portell, lead partner in the global consumer practice of Kearney, a strategy and management consulting firm, said bankruptcy could help the company live on, but it must be determined not to return to business as usual.\n\n“Bankruptcy protection offers a fresh start. If companies use the time to commit to bold reinvention, the market is ripe for a success story,” Portell said.\n\nForrester's Kodali said many of the 36 million Americans who are unemployed because of the pandemic overlap with J.C. Penney’s shopper demographic.\n\n“I think that they would not be buying as much now in the best of circumstances,” she said, noting there are other stores that sell similar merchandise. \"It's a store that if it goes away I don't know that people would miss it tremendously.”\n\nShe added, “I don't think there's really salvaging J.C. Penney at this point.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporters Nathan Bomey and Kelly Tyko on Twitter @NathanBomey and @KellyTyko.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/01/21/tech-stocks-microsoft/22095717/", "title": "Tech Five: Microsoft to unveil Windows 10", "text": "Brett Molina\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIt's a big day for a certain tech giant from the Northwest.

Nobody was seriously injured.\n\nUber temporarily halted the program to investigate the accident and gain a better understanding of what happened, but a spokesperson said Monday the company will redeploy its fleet here and in Pittsburgh, where it also is testing.\n\nUber brought its fleet of self-driving cars to Arizona amid much fanfare last year following a dispute with the California Department of Motor Vehicles, which requires companies operating self-driving cars to report on their operations. Arizona has no rules specific to self-driving cars. The company confirmed Monday it has been transporting customers with self-driving cars in the state.\n\nMORE: What we know about self-driving cars in Arizona\n\nThe vehicles use a combination of cameras, lidar and other sensors to guide them, though all self-driving cars operating in Arizona today have test drivers behind the wheel to take control if needed.\n\nIndications are Uber is far behind rival Waymo in developing driverless cars. The two are involved in litigation regarding the technology.\n\nWaymo, formerly known as Google's Self Driving Car Project, was involved in three crashes last year in Chandler, but did not stop its vehicle testing.\n\nThe California DMV reports include figures on how frequently the drivers must take control of the cars.\n\nWaymo drives its cars in California an average of 5,000 miles before a human driver is required to take over and handle an unusual traffic situation, according to its 2016 report to the California DMV.\n\nWaymo's figures are exponentially better than Ford, Tesla, Nissan and other companies with similar reports filed at the California DMV; however, each company may define the disengagements differently according to how their cars work.\n\nEven though Uber has returned some cars to California, it has not yet reported on their operations.\n\nHowever, some of its internal documents reportedly leaked to the media show the Uber vehicles tested in Arizona only traveling about 200 miles on average before needing a driver to take over, and only about 2 miles between unpleasant braking or jerking.\n\nUber officials declined to comment on the figures Monday.\n\nHere are some frequently asked questions on self-driving cars:\n\nHow do they work?\n\nWaymo's vehicles use a system called lidar, which is like radar but using lasers, to scan for about 200 yards in all directions around the vehicle. Lidar can help the vehicles make predictions by determining which direction pedestrians are facing. The cars also use cameras, radar and internal maps that are more detailed than regular Google maps. For example, they include curb heights.\n\nDo the companies use different technology?\n\nYes. Tesla Motors uses a system called \"autopilot\" that is not intended to be fully autonomous. It also uses a series of sensors to keep the car in the lane and maintain a safe distance between cars, but it is not capable of point-to-point driving and requires drivers to remain attentive at all times. Tesla updates its software remotely to all drivers who have chosen to activate this feature on their cars. Waymo, Uber, GM and Ford are working toward cars that will operate without drivers and have dedicated employees testing their technology.\n\nThere are disputes involving the technology. In February, Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Waymo and Google, sued Uber. Waymo alleges that in December 2015, former Google self-driving car engineer Anthony Levandowski stole 14,000 files containing plans and technical specifications, then left the company a month later. He now works for Uber.\n\nWho is testing in Arizona?\n\nWaymo has a fluctuating fleet of vehicles operating out of Chandler, and its vehicles have expanded to parts of Phoenix, Mesa, Tempe and Gilbert. The company uses Lexus RX 450h and Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans. It also tests vehicles in Kirkland, Wash., Mountain View, Calif., and Austin.\n\nUber's Volvo SUVs can be seen in several parts of metro Phoenix, but the internal documents leaked to the media in early March indicate the main testing for self-driving vehicles is up and down Scottsdale Road and around Arizona State University, where Friday's accident occurred. It also is testing in Pennsylvania and California.\n\nGeneral Motors is testing self-driving electric Bolt vehicles in south Scottsdale. It has similar tests in San Francisco. The company wants to bring the technology to market though a deal with Lyft, a ride-hailing competitor to Uber.\n\nFord is testing self-driving technology at the company’s proving grounds in Wittmann, north of Phoenix. It also is testing in California and Michigan.\n\nWho is to blame in a self-driving car accident?\n\nNone of the cars being tested in Arizona is truly driverless today, so the test driver behind the wheel is responsible for the vehicle. One of those drivers was cited last year following an accident in a Waymo vehicle, although the company said that cameras on the car indicate the other driver actually ran a red light. The car was not in self-driving mode at the time of the accident.\n\nThe only accident so far caused by Waymo in autonomous mode was a widely publicized fender-bender last year in California when a Google car merged into a bus to avoid debris in its lane.\n\nTesla reported a fatal accident by one of its drivers using autopilot last year. In that case, a truck crossed in front of the Tesla and the car, set to cruise at 74 mph, did not avoid the accident. An investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found the Tesla driver was not paying attention as he should have been to take control and avoid the accident.\n\nPolice officers said there is nothing inherently tricky about accidents with self-driving cars.\n\n\"The Tempe Police Department investigates all traffic collisions in the same manner and it has no bearing whether it’s a self-driving vehicle or not,\" Detective Lily Duran said Monday. \"When we investigate a collision, we look to see if any laws were broken and cite if appropriate.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/04/19/fedex-shooting-indianapolis-company-officials-mum-security-changes/7277619002/", "title": "FedEx shooting Indianapolis: Company officials mum on security ...", "text": "Richard Reeves called off from his job at a Greenwood FedEx facility Friday because he felt uneasy going back to work after eight people were killed Thursday at the Plainfield Ground Operation.\n\n\"If it happened at their other locations, why couldn't it happen here,\" said Reeves. \"Mass shootings are everywhere now.

When he returned to work Saturday, he said he saw no changes, though the security guards seemed more alert.\n\nReeves is one of many employees who are uneasy about returning back to work. However, FedEx declined to say if the company is re-evaluating or changing its security measures.\n\nIf you need help:In the wake of FedEx shooting, how to get help with mental health, grief and anxiety\n\n“While we do not publicly disclose information about our security processes and procedures, the safety of our team members is our top priority at FedEx,\" a spokesperson said via email. \"FedEx Ground has a policy regarding employee conduct as well as a workplace violence awareness and prevention procedures.”\n\nWhile FedEx did not say if they were changing any security practices, the company released a statement that grief counselors were available to Indianapolis employees.\n\nFedEx did release one policy that won't change, despite criticism after the shooting: The rule banning most employees from having cellphones in its sorting and packing plants.\n\nSome family members of those who were killed called on FedEx to improve its security Sunday.\n\n“To FedEx — we want to know why is there no security at the gate?\" asked Ramandeep Chohan at a vigil at Monument Circle. \"Why was no one looking at the security footage while this was occurring? Why do you have more security to protect your merchandise than the people that actually work there?”\n\nChohan's aunt Amarjeet Kaur Johal was among those killed at FedEx.\n\nThe FedEx Ground facility on Mirabel Road, a few miles from the airport, was closed Saturday and has been temporarily suspended in the wake of the killings, a company spokesperson told the IndyStar.\n\nWorkplace violence\n\nWorkplace violence is a major cause of injury at work, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nIn 2017, more than 450 of the 5,147 fatal workplace injuries was caused intentionally by another person, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries.\n\nWhile the federal agency doesn't have a specific standard for preventing workplace violence, federal law requires employers to keep workplaces safe.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends a number of steps to mitigate the risk of workplace violence, including physical barriers, alarm systems, adequate staffing, video surveillance, arranging furniture to avoid entrapment, bright lighting and working with local police.\n\nIndiana Occupational and Safety and Health Administration said it is reviewing FedEx's facility operations to see if it meets the state and federal standards, a spokesperson told IndyStar.\n\nReeves said his boss checked in on him, but he wishes the company did more to acknowledge the shooting. He received a text that the company is saddened by the events and to please report to work on Friday.\n\nWhile Reeves wishes the company did more to acknowledge the pain and anxiety for FedEx workers in other locations, he thinks the responsibility to prevent gun violence falls more on government officials who regulate guns and ensure safety.\n\nAnd he doesn't think that more security with more weapons is the answer, especially if the security officials aren't trained to deescalate high tension situations.\n\n\"It doesn't make sense, why as individuals, we have to arm ourselves when there's supposed to be a government to act in our favor,\" he said.\n\nBhuang@gannett.com.

That was a benefit to Trump, given his support among the state's Republican leadership.\n\nFlexing their influence, many Trump Republicans used the Tuesday primary to cast ballots for \"None of these candidates,\" a category that carried more than 63% of the vote, well ahead of candidate Nikki Haley at just more than 30%.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nDemocrats hit Donald Trump ahead of caucus results\n\nThe Democratic National Committee on Thursday said Donald Trump can win a Republican caucus in Nevada but vowed that he will lose the Silver State in the general election this fall, just as he has done twice before.\n\n\"Nobody knows how to lose Nevada like− Donald Trump – his back to back losses in 2016 and 2020 made him the first Republican in decades to lose the state twice,\" said DNC Rapid Response Director Alex Floyd.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nNevada holds a primary, caucus and the Super Bowl\n\nNevada's Republican voters could participate in a primary and caucus this week, all as the state prepares to host the Super Bowl over the weekend.\n\nWhile thousands of Nevada Republicans were participating in caucuses Thursday night across the state, in Las Vegas more focus was falling on the upcoming game, which is being played at the hometown Allegiant Stadium, which seats about 65,000.\n\nHotels are beginning to fill up, CBS broadcasters have taken over the promenade in front of the Bellagio's famous fountains, and officially sanctioned NFL ambassadors were handing out commemorative buttons and snapping photos for fans.\n\nLas Vegas officials predict the game will bring more than 330,000 tourists and generate $600 million in revenue\n\n− Trevor Hughes\n\nWhen is the next primary? Donald Trump, Nikki Haley get ready for South Carolina\n\nWhile Nevada’s GOP caucus is set to hand a victory to Donald Trump, the party’s next race on Nikki Haley’s home turf in South Carolina could inject a bolt of energy.\n\nHaley, a former South Carolina governor and ambassador to the United Nations, is setting her sights on the state with renewed vigor after finishing behind a disembodied “none of these candidates” option in the Nevada primary.\n\nThough Haley is expected to fare better than in the Silver State, recent polling still shows Trump leading by a significant 26-point margin.\n\nBoth candidates will be in South Carolina this weekend as they prepare for the Palmetto State's election. Haley will begin a two-week-long bus tour crisscrossing her home state Saturday, while Trump will headline a rally Saturday at Coastal Carolina University near Myrtle Beach.\n\n− Kathryn Palmer\n\nNevada pronunciation: Here's what to know\n\nThe state is pronounced “Ne-VAD-uh” not “Ne-VAH-duh,” according to locals. Many Nevadans are frustrated by the latter pronunciation, typically used by non-residents.\n\nIt's a controversy Donald Trump has addressed in previous campaigns. In 2016, the then-candidate told a crowd of Nevadans that they have been mispronouncing the name of their state.\n\n\"When I came out here I said nobody says it the other way. It has to be Neh-VAH-da, right?\"\n\n– Anthony Robledo\n\nNikki Haley baits Donald Trump by making the Indiana ballot\n\nNikki Haley, who is skipping the Nevada caucuses because she says they are rigged for Trump, had a low-key Thursday. But she did find time to bait her Republican rival.\n\nOn the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, Haley posted a document attesting that she will be on the primary ballot in Indiana on May 7, despite Trump's insistence that she had failed to qualify.\n\n\"We are officially on the ballot in Indiana,\" Haley said. \"Donald Trump was confused ... again.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\n'I don't agree with everything Tom Brady says either'\n\nIn Las Vegas, caucusgoer and Trump supporter Bob Roberts, 69, said he thinks the former president should have a chance to finish the plans he started during his first term, citing the economy and immigration. Roberts, who works in construction, said he doesn’t always agree with how Trump says or does things, but generally supports his policies.\n\n“We need Trump in there now to finish what he tried to do the first time,\" Roberts said, speaking outside the Cambridge Recreation Center a few blocks from the Strip. “I don't agree with everything Tom Brady says either but he’s still the best quarterback ever.\"\n\nClyda Bird, 64, echoed Roberts’ remarks about Trump’s personality.\n\n“I wouldn’t want him for a husband but I liked him as a president. I wouldn’t want him to date my daughter, but I do want him to bring the price of gas down,” said Bird. “I’m tired of living Social Security check to Social Security check. Nobody has any money.”\n\nAlthough the stock market has been booming, several voters said the high price of gas, food and housing costs driven up by high interest rates make them long for a return to Trump-era policies they felt were better for them personally.\n\n“Bills are higher. It’s makes it really hard- the policies Biden has don’t even come close to solving our problems,” said church worker Watson Tanuvasa, 62. “And the border- we already have so many homeless in our country and we aren’t doing anything for them and yet we’re bringing in more.”\n\nAnd Yolanda Amunatigui said she had more money under Trump. She said Biden's policies are steering the United States away from the core values she thinks made it so successful: \"We want change to make America great again. Sounds familiar, right?\"\n\n−Trevor Hughes\n\nNevada caucus results\n\nIt's not guaranteed when Nevada's Republican caucus results will be finalized, but the caucuses began at 5 p.m. and end at 7:30 p.m. local time.

She also won 2.1% of the vote in the South Carolina Democratic primary compared to Biden’s 96.2%\n\nOn the Republican side, Trump has secured victory after victory in the Iowa Caucus, New Hampshire primary and Virgin Islands caucus against opponent Nikki Haley.

S. Supreme Court on Thursday heard the former president’s appeal on the state’s ruling to disqualify him from the state’s primary. Under a provision of the 14th Amendment, Colorado’s Supreme Court has challenged Trump’s eligibility for president, alleging that he engaged in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nDuring the just over two hours of oral arguments, U.S. justices discussed the practical implications of Colorado’s ruling and whether other state’s will be able to follow suit. Justices raised concerns about a mismatch of ballots across the country.\n\n“I think that the question that you have to confront is why a single state should decide who gets to be president of the United States,” Justice Elena Kagan, told the attorney for the Colorado voters challenging Trump’s eligibility.\n\n– Anthony Robledo\n\nDonald Trump takes Virgin Islands caucuses\n\nDonald Trump has wrapped up his first victory of the night, winning the caucuses in the Virgin Islands.\n\n\"Pending the final canvas by the Caucus Committee, Trump received 73.98 percent of the vote compared to 26.02 percent for former Ambassador Nikki Haley,\" said the Virgin Islands Republican Party announcement.\n\n“Going third-in-the-nation with an unrigged caucus using ranked-choice voting not only gave every candidate a fair and equal playing field, but it resulted in unprecedented attention for the Virgin Islands,” said Republican Party in the Virgin Islands chairman Gordon Ackley. “Based on the results, the Virgin Islands has put Donald Trump on track to become the presumptive Republican nominee.”\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWho is Ryan Binkley?\n\nWhile Nikki Haley isn't challenging Donald Trump in Nevada's caucus, Texas businessman and pastor Ryan Binkley is competing in the race on Thursday.\n\nBinkley announced his White House bid in April 2023, and he told the Des Moines Register he believed he could carve a lane in the GOP primary to prioritize unity and potential bipartisanship on financial, immigration and health care policy.

Voting for the U.S. Virgin Island caucus took place from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Atlantic Standard Time at the St. Croix and St. Thomas locations.

How Nikki Haley was defeated by 'none of these candidates'\n\nNikki Haley opted to participate in Nevada's Republican primary, which was held on Tuesday. That means she and Donald Trump won't directly compete against each other at all in the Silver State.\n\nBut Haley still didn't see a landslide victory this week, as more primary voters cast their ballots for a 'none of these candidates' option on their ballot than the former governor. It was an bizarre result – and perhaps a trap set by the former president's allies.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nIs Nevada having a Democratic caucus?\n\nNo, Nevada held a Democratic primary on Tuesday. Joe Biden quickly clinched victory over his Democratic challengers.\n\nOne of those challengers, author Marianne Williamson, ended her presidential campaign on Thursday, telling her supporters \"We articulated deeper, more authentic truths than those regularly acknowledged by the political establishment. And I’m not only glad we did that; I’m proud of it.”\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen is Super Tuesday?\n\nThursday's Nevada caucus isn't part of the all-important election day known as Super Tuesday. But what is Super Tuesday?\n\nThe day which received its nickname because it marks the date when the greatest number of states hold their primaries and caucuses.\n\nThe states conducting elections on 2024's Super Tuesday, March 5, include Alabama, Arkansas, Alaska, California, Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhy is Donald Trump participating in the Nevada caucus? Dual contests confuse voters\n\nWashoe County Registrar of Voters Cari-Ann Burgess said there has been ongoing confusion among voters about the difference between the primary and the caucus.\n\n\"We get a lot of 'why isn't President Trump on our ballot?,'\" Burgess said Tuesday morning ahead of the Nevada primary. \"And the answer is he opted out of participating in the Nevada presidential preference primary. He just decided not to participate in ours, but he's in the caucus.\"\n\nUnder a 2021 state law, Nevada is required to hold presidential primary elections as long as there are at least two candidates for a party's nomination.\n\nBut Republican Party officials ‒ many of whom participated in a 2020 effort to subvert the presidential election results in Trump's favor ‒ decided last year to hold a binding caucus. They also tried unsuccessfully to stop the state from holding the primary.\n\nBurgess said she isn't directly coordinating with the state GOP because her office is non-partisan, so her staff doesn't give out information about the caucuses. Instead, she has been trained to refer all questions to the party directly.\n\nNevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar said even his own friends called him up to complain about the dual contests, though his office alerted voters for months about the dueling contests, sending out postcards, posting signs and speaking to the media.\n\nNevada GOP has said previously it considered the primary election to be a waste of taxpayer dollars, and that party business should be funded and conducted by the party itself.\n\n-Trevor Hughes\n\nWhat is a caucus?\n\nWhile a primary election is run by state and local governments, a caucus is run by political parties. A traditional primary election resembles the general election, with voting via private ballot.\n\nA caucus, however, involves voters dividing themselves into groups based on the candidate they prefer and arguing for others to join them. At the end of the caucus, the number of members in each group determines how many delegates that candidate gets.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhere do Nikki Haley and Donald Trump stand in 2024 polls?\n\nWhile Nikki Haley is trying to pick up momentum ahead of pivotal 2024 contests, she's still trailing Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner.\n\nIn a Real Clear Politics average of polls of the Republican field, Trump garnered 74.4% support across the country. In comparison, Haley received 18.1% support, even after rivals such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and others dropped out of the GOP primary.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/01/25/trump-nevada-primary-caucus-delegates-explained/72325476007/", "title": "In Nevada primary, Trump will lose but he'll still win the delegates", "text": "Donald Trump is going to lose Nevada's Republican primary election Tuesday, and the victory instead will likely go to Nikki Haley. Or maybe just \"none of these.\"\n\nConfused? You're not the only one.\n\nTens of thousands of Nevada GOP voters are discovering Trump's name is absent from the primary ballots they've received in the mail or will get in the voting booth.\n\nVoters can participate in both contests but candidates had to pick one or the other.\n\nNevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar said even his own friends called him up to complain, though his office had alerted voters for months about the dueling contests, sending out postcards, posting signs and speaking to the media.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"It's one of those things where people aren't paying attention until now,\" he said. \"I don't know what else we could do.\"\n\nInstead of running in Tuesday's primary, Trump is participating in party-run caucuses on Thursday. Only the caucus results count toward selecting the state's 26 Republican National Convention electors, but state law still requires a primary.\n\nWhy does Nevada have both a caucus and a primary election?\n\nNormally, states hold either government-run primary elections or party-run caucuses, but not both.\n\nUnder a 2021 state law, Nevada is required to hold presidential primary elections as long as there are at least two candidates for a party's nomination.\n\nBut Republican Party officials ‒ many of whom participated in a 2020 effort to subvert the presidential election results in Trump's favor ‒ decided last year to hold a binding caucus. They also tried unsuccessfully to stop the state from holding the primary.\n\nNevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar said even his own friends called him up to complain, though his office alerted voters for months about the dueling contests, sending out postcards, posting signs and speaking to the media.\n\n\"Why is there a caucus? Because the state Republican Party thinks that will help Trump,\" said Dan Lee, an associate professor of political science at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.\n\nWhat did the Nevada Republican Party say about having caucuses?\n\nIn a statement, the Nevada GOP said it considered the primary election a waste of taxpayer dollars, and that party business should be funded and conducted by the party itself. Caucus supporters say they're the best way to test a candidate's appeal to the party faithful and require candidates to demonstrate they can organize and turn out voters.\n\n\"Simply put, candidates who participate in an illegitimate process cannot expect to earn legitimate delegates to the Republican National Convention,\" the party said.\n\nTo learn more:When is the next presidential election? Everything to know about Election Day 2024.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis was participating in the caucuses until he dropped out last month, while former Vice President Mike Pence chose to run in the primary until he dropped out at the end of October. Like Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator who also ended his campaign, Pence will still appear on the primary ballot because the ballots were finalized before he quit the race.\n\nHow are the Nevada caucuses and primary different?\n\nBecause party officials get to set their own caucus rules, Nevada GOP officials are requiring in-person participation and ID verification at the caucuses, which they argue provides better election security and saves tax dollars.\n\nIn the taxpayer-funded primary election, run by Aguilar's office and county clerks, voters can cast their ballots by mail or in person. It's also open to military members serving overseas.\n\nAguilar said primary elections are typically considered more inclusive than caucuses because more voters can participate, instead of only those able to attend on Thursday. And it's typically easier for a candidate to qualify for the primary ballot.\n\nFor the primary, polls are open Tuesday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. Polling locations can be found on the Secretary of State's website. Thursday's caucus runs from 5 to 7:30 p.m. Registered Nevada Republicans can find their precinct locations on the state GOP's website.\n\nWhy did Haley decide to run in the Nevada primary?\n\nWith Trump supporters in control of the Nevada GOP, Haley never stood a chance of winning the caucuses, which tend to draw the most die-hard party supporters, Lee said. Instead, Haley likely hopes she'll win enough votes in the primary to show she has broad support.\n\nAlso, candidates who wanted to participate in the caucus had to pay the state party $55,000 or host a fundraiser on its behalf, making it an expensive proposition for candidates lacking Trump's massive fundraising apparatus.\n\n\"In these early states, it's not about winning delegates per se. We're all small states, so it's about setting, or meeting and exceeding expectations to help build momentum,\" Lee said. \"It's easier to cast a wider net by running in the primary ‒ she was doing it to try to build a narrative, to display her support among primary voters. Early on in the race, everyone is just trying to be the runner-up to Trump.\"\n\nWhat are Republicans saying about the dueling Nevada caucus and primary?\n\nGov. Joe Lombardo and Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony have both said they plan to caucus for Trump and vote for \"none of these candidates\" in the primary.\n\nTrump visited Las Vegas in late January for a \" commit to caucus\" rally.\n\nGiven the situation, Lee, the UNLV professor, said it's possible Haley could lose the primary even though Trump isn't in it: \"It could be the case that 'none of these candidates' gets the most votes.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/02/09/nevada-caucus-takeaway-trump-wins/72437364007/", "title": "Nevada Republican caucus takeaway: Trump wins, Haley lost primary", "text": "LAS VEGAS ‒ Donald Trump trumpeted his caucus win, Nikki Haley lost her primary to \"none\" but still won and then said she wasn't trying anyway, and the confusing, dueling Nevada Republican elections finished with little change to the field.\n\nAmong the Democrats, President Joe Biden easily and without drama won the state's presidential preference election.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican side created confusion for some voters. The state ran a legally mandated primary Tuesday, but the state's Republican Party staged its own caucuses Thursday, and said only those votes would count for awarding 26 delegates to the Republican National Convention. It also said any candidate who participated in the primary would be barred from the caucuses.\n\nHaley, the former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador, skipped the caucuses, which she argued were rigged in former President Trump's favor from the start. In Tuesday's primary, she got fewer votes than \"none of these candidates,\" which Nevada law requires as an option, but still technically won because the law says only a named candidate can win.\n\nThursday night at a Republican caucus site near the Strip, Trump supporter Bob Roberts, 69, said he was frustrated the party decided to conduct a caucus and a primary, a process he felt was unnecessarily complicated.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n“They’re making it confusing at hell. And let’s face it, conservatives don’t like complication,\" said Roberts, who works in construction.\n\nBut at the end of the day, Roberts said, Trump was always going to triumph in the show of strength necessary to silence critics within the GOP: \"We need Trump in there to finish what he tried to do the first time.\"\n\nTrump stays in control\n\nA beaming Trump took the stage at the Treasure Island casino in Las Vegas late Thursday to celebrate his long-expected caucus victory.\n\n\"You broke the all-time record,\" Trump bragged to the crowd, which cheered in response. \"We wanted to get over 80 (percent) and we got 98.\"\n\nWith 40% of the votes counted, Trump actually received 99% of the caucus votes, with challenger Ryan Binkley, a Texas-based businessman and pastor, winning fewer than 1%.\n\nTrump spoke hours after the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a Colorado court case that's trying to keep him off that state's ballot over the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, in which thousands of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. The Colorado court ruled that Trump, by encouraging and supporting the mob, disqualified himself for re-election.\n\nTrump also attacked Biden over the special counsel's report Thursday that although the president mishandled classified documents after his service as vice president, he would not be charged. Trump is also under investigation for taking classified documents when he left office, and is also accused of trying to hide the documents when federal officials tried to recover them.\n\nThe special counsel investigating Biden noted the president cooperated with investigators after discovering the documents and voluntarily turning them over. The special counsel also cited the fact that Biden is an elderly man with \"diminished capacities\" as a reason not to press charges, a characterization that Biden's opponents immediately tried to use to their advantage.\n\nTrump supporters say it's unfair for a court to stop voters from choosing their preferred candidate, regardless of his legal status. Trump called the Supreme Court hearing \"a very beautiful sight to watch,\" referencing the skepticism justices displayed toward the case.\n\nTrump has lost Nevada twice to Biden. While large, rural portions of the state historically votes Republican, Las Vegas in particular is heavily Democratic, in part due to the well-organized casino-and-hotel unions.\n\nThis time, Trump promised he'd triumph.\n\n\"Go back home, rest, and then come back,\" Trump told the crowd. \"If we win the state of Nevada, it's over for them.\"\n\nHaley stays in the Republican primary\n\nAfter the primary results came in Tuesday night, Haley's campaign admitted they hadn't even tried to win the meaningless primary. Some Nevada political observers had suggested Haley might try to put up a strong showing as a way of persuading voters in the rest of the country that her campaign remains viable. But her campaign downplayed the Nevada primary results in which 22,000 people supported her, compared to more than 47,000 for \"none.\"\n\n“Even Donald Trump knows that when you play penny slots the house wins,” Haley campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas said in a statement Tuesday. “We didn’t bother to play a game rigged for Trump. We’re full steam ahead in South Carolina and beyond.”\n\nHaley's campaign this week announced upcoming events or supporters in Alaska, California, Idaho, Massachusetts and South Carolina, indicating her plans to keep pushing through, at least until Super Tuesday on March 5.\n\nThe Trump campaign has been touting polls showing he's well ahead of Haley in her own home state, and are hoping a strong victory there will force her to suspend her campaign.\n\nBuoyed by his win ‒ and Haley's flagging campaign, which he mentioned obliquely ‒ Trump joked that he wished the presidential election could be held next week. But in referring to Tuesday's primary, Trump mistakenly said it happened Wednesday.\n\n\"You know what happened last night, right? 'None of the above,\" Trump said as the crowd roared. \"I'd like to congratulate none of the above.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Biden saw the field against him clearing out, as author Marianne Williamson suspended her presidential campaign Wednesday, citing low support following the New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada votes.\n\nTroubling signs for both Trump and Biden when it comes to their ages\n\nMany voters who spoke to USA TODAY during the primary and caucus said the ages of Trump, 77, and Biden, 81, were a source of frustration. Some Haley supporters said they believe her candidacy provides a much-needed counter to Trump amid ongoing questions about his mental acuity.\n\nTrump In October confused the leaders of Hungary and Turkey while praising the authoritarian style of governing of one of them. Biden on Thursday referred to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as “the president of Mexico.”\n\nHaley, 52, has also knocked Biden's age, and called for him to take a mental competency test following the special counsel's comments about his \"diminished\" memory capacity.\n\n\"There's a reason 70% of Americans don't want to see a Biden-Trump rematch,\" Haley told Sean Hannity's Fox News program Thursday. \"The party that gets rid of their 80-year-old candidate is going to be the party that wins.\"\n\nBiden angrily rejected the special counsel's comments ‒ \"My memory is fine,\" the visibly emotional president said in a primetime address Thursday night ‒ but the report and his mixup over the leader of Mexico is yet another reference to his mental facility, a concern among even his strongest supporters.\n\nLongtime Democratic voter Bruce Bartlett, 80, said he saw his own memory and body weakening as he hit his 60s and decided to retire, and worried Biden lacks the strength to keep fighting. But more than that, he said, he worries the younger voters Biden needs to win reelection won't turn out in November.\n\n\"We are ready for a new generation of people to run for office,\" said Bartlett, a Reno-area retired peace officer. \"I realized at 62 that times had changed. It was time to turn over my job to a new generation. And it’s time to do that with elected offices too.\"\n\nDavid Jackson contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/01/23/when-is-nevada-primary-caucus-2024/72323683007/", "title": "When is the Nevada caucus and the primary election?

Joe Biden won the Nevada Democratic primary, and so he received the state's 49 delegates.\n\nThere was a state-run Nevada Republican primary on Feb. 6, where former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley lost to \"none of the above candidates.\" This election, however, was non-binding and did not decide who would receive the party's delegates. Instead, a Republican caucus organized by the GOP will take place on Thursday, Feb. 8. It will dictate who is awarded the state's 26 delegates.\n\nWhy is Nevada having a caucus and primary?\n\nIn 2021, Nevada's legislature passed a law that requires the state to hold presidential primaries, which inform the nomination process of the Democratic and Republican parties. The law was a response to reporting issues during the 2020 Democratic caucus that led to a recount.\n\nCaucuses are run by political parties, while primary elections are run by state and local governments.\n\nUnder the Nevada law, there must be a Republican and Democratic primary. However, each party is not bound to the results and can choose other methods to assign the state's delegates.\n\nThe Republican Party in Nevada has decided to stick with the caucus system. In May 2023, the party sued the state about the primary election law. Nevada's GOP then passed a rule barring any candidate who signed up for the state's primary from participating in its caucus and, therefore, receiving delegates.\n\nThere are two separate ballots for the Republican primary and caucus.

Nikki Haley faced an embarrassing result in Nevada's GOP primary on Tuesday, with Silver State voters technically selecting none of the candidates on the ballot to win the Republican race.\n\nHere's what that means: Nevada allowed voters to back a specific candidate or effectively pick none of the White House hopefuls. That option received more support than Haley in the Republican primary. Former President Donald Trump was not on the ballot, as he's participating in the state's GOP-run caucus on Thursday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden did notch a win in Nevada's Democratic primary on Tuesday evening, as his challengers struggle to pick up steam across the country.\n\nCatch up with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage of the Nevada primary.\n\nWhat is “None of these candidates?”\n\n“None of these candidates” received the most votes Tuesday in Nevada’s Republican primary − beating out Nikki Haley.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nNevada law requires voters to be offered the option to pick “none of these candidates.” Nevada does not offer a write-in option.\n\nDonald Trump declined to participate in the primary on Tuesday, which will not award Republican delegates. Some Trump supporters said they planned to select the “none” option in the primary as a protest vote against Haley's campaign.\n\n– Margaret Cullen\n\nNikki Haley's campaign tries to shrug off Nevada results\n\nNikki Haley's campaign on Tuesday claimed it did not mount a major campaign in Nevada because the race was ultimately set up for Donald Trump, who is competing in the GOP caucus on Thursday.\n\n“Even Donald Trump knows that when you play penny slots the house wins,” said Haley campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. “We didn’t bother to play a game rigged for Trump. We’re full steam ahead in South Carolina and beyond.”\n\nNevertheless, a win for Haley could have given her campaign momentum heading into the pivotal primary in her home state later this month.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump quickly criticizes Nikki Haley\n\nDonald Trump on Tuesday night immediately knocked Nikki Haley over Nevada's Republican primary results, posting on his Truth Social platform that it was a \"bad night\" for his one-time United Nations ambassador.\n\nNevada Gov. Joe Lombardo and other Trump allies had advocated a “none of these candidates” vote as a way to shake Haley’s continuing candidacy.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nNevada voters buck GOP candidates\n\nNikki Haley didn't see a sweeping victory in Nevada's Republican primary on Tuesday.\n\nInstead, more voters in the state selected a \"none of these candidates\" option on their ballot instead of supporting the former United Nations ambassador.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden wins Nevada primary\n\nJoe Biden won the Nevada primary on Tuesday, defeating his Democratic challengers as he seeks the 2024 nomination and another term in the White House.\n\n“Nevada Democrats represent the backbone of our nation: the union workers who built the middle class, immigrants who came here in search of opportunity, and families of all stripes who deserve dignity, personal freedom, and a fair shot at the American dream,” Biden said in a statement as results were finalized in Nevada.\n\nThe victory comes after Biden saw wins in two other pivotal states, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky, Margaret Cullen\n\n'There will be a little bit of confusion'\n\nFormer Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, laughed and declined to say who he voted for after casting his ballot. Sandoval, now the president of the University of Nevada, Reno, voted at the university's student union on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nSandoval told USA TODAY that he thinks most of the concern over the dueling primary and caucus has passed, and said he favors anything that gets more people to participate in the political process. Sandoval was first elected Nevada attorney general in 2003, and then after serving as a federal judge won the governorship twice starting in 2010, before term limits forced him to step down.\n\n“Yes, there will be a little bit of confusion but if it encourages more people to get out there and be part of the process I’m all for it,\" Sandoval said.\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nWhat time do Nevada polls close?\n\nPolls for Nevada's state-run Democratic and Republican presidential primaries close at 10 p.m. ET, which is 7 p.m. local time.\n\nHowever, polls will remain open as long as a voter is at least in line by 7 p.m. If the voter has gotten in line by that time, they will still be allowed to vote.\n\n– Margaret Cullen\n\nNikki Haley spends Nevada primary night attacking Donald Trump, Joe Biden\n\nNikki Haley in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, again stressed the age of her fellow candidates, Trump and Biden, on Tuesday.\n\n\"We all know 80 year olds who can run circles around us…and then we know Trump and Biden,\" she shared. \"We need a president who has the focus and stamina to deal with all the challenges facing our country.\"\n\nBiden is 81, and poll after poll has shown voters have concerns about his age. Trump, 77, isn't immune from the criticism either.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhy does Nevada have a primary and a caucus?\n\nIn 2021, the Nevada Legislature approved a change to make way for a presidential preference primary. It was intended to be a simpler way to pick the preferred presidential candidates for the two major parties.\n\nHowever, the Nevada Republican Party balked at the new format and went in another direction. Instead of sending delegates to the GOP National Convention based on primary results, the party will consider only results from its Feb. 8 caucus, which it will host and pay for itself.\n\nThe party says the caucus embodies the election reforms it seeks, such as the use of voter ID, a single election day with no early voting, paper ballots and less influence from super PACs.\n\n– Mark Robison\n\nWho is Hirsh Singh?\n\nHirsh Singh, an engineer and government contractor from New Jersey, is among the names on the Nevada primary ballot along with John Castro, Heath Fulkerson and Donald Kjornes.\n\nAfter multiple unsuccessful runs for office in his home state, he is now vying to be the GOP presidential nominee. In a July video, he described himself as a “lifelong Republican” who wants to fight the “grave threats from the corruption of both big tech and big pharma.”\n\nSingh has participated in several Republican primary races, including for a House seat in 2018, for a Senate seat in 2020 and for governor of New Jersey in 2017 and 2021. He came in third for the nomination during his latest run for governor, losing to eventual nominee Jack Ciattarell.\n\n– Anthony Robledo\n\nChris Christie: Donald Trump could be a \"convicted felon\" by convention time in July\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie on Tuesday said Donald Trump might have a new title if he formally receives the Republican nomination in mid-July: Convicted felon.\n\nChristie on Tuesday told CNN said the appeals court decision denying Trump immunity from prosecution could clear the way for a sweeping election fraud trial in the spring.\n\nA verdict could well come before the Republican convention in Milwaukee opens on July 15.\n\n“My guess is that he’ll be a convicted felon when he gets on the stage to accept the Republican nomination for president,\" Christie said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nSome Republican voters wanted to back Donald Trump in Nevada primary\n\nRepublican Michael Holton, who works in manufacturing, said he begrudgingly voted for \"None of these candidates\" at a South Reno polling site. Holton, 61, said he wished Trump could have participated in the primary so the former president could defeat Haley in a head-to-head competition.\n\nHolton said Haley, a former Trump ambassador to the United Nations, is disloyal in running against her former boss.\n\n\"I'm bummed he's not on the ballot,\" Holton said. \"I feel the caucus will be strong for him but I'm just bummed he's not on the ballot.\"\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nNevada caucus date approaches\n\nThe Nevada caucus is set for Thursday. The GOP will actually award delegates for the race, unlike the primary on Tuesday. Donald Trump is expected to participate, but Nikki Haley won't be an option for caucusgoers.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nAre Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson competing with Joe Biden in Nevada?\n\nRep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., one of Joe Biden's major challengers, will not be on the ballot in Nevada. He didn't meet a qualification deadline, but author Marianne Williamson and other challengers are running on the Democratic side in the Silver State.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nDonald Trump looks to Thursday's Nevada caucus\n\nDonald Trump hasn't said anything today about the Nevada primary, which isn't surprising. He wants Republicans to ignore the primary and focus instead on Thursday's caucuses, in which he is the only major candidate on the ballot.\n\nDuring a campaign rally in Las Vegas over the weekend, Trump told supporters: \"Don’t worry about the primary, just do the caucus thing.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nNevada voters weigh in on what brought them to the polls\n\nOutside a Reno voting site, Pedro Camargo, 65, said he voted for Biden in the primary, rejecting Trump as \"a bully and a liar,\" and saying he never considered Haley as a choice. He considered which candidate would better protect Social Security and Medicare, while trying to raise the minimum wage.\n\n“I voted for Biden. The other guy wants to be a dictator,\" said Camargo, an Uber driver in Reno. \"I mean, he says he'd be a dictator for a day, but no one believes it would be for a day.\"\n\nPaul Leason, 41, was stationed outside a polling place asking voters to sign his petition to put Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the general election ballot as a third-party candidate. He opted to skip Tuesday's primary and Thursday's caucus because he thinks Trump and Biden are too old.\n\n“(Kennedy's) just better than the other two,\" said Leason, who was recently inspired to get involved in politics by a podcast he listens to. \"I’d take Trump over Biden though, but everyone’s old. I don’t think any people collecting Social Security should be running for office. It’s just the Boomers don’t want to give up power.”\n\nWhat is a caucus?\n\nWhile a primary election is run by state and local governments, a caucus is run by political parties. A traditional primary election resembles the general election, with voting via private ballot.\n\nA caucus, however, involves voters dividing themselves into groups based on the candidate they prefer and arguing for others to join them. At the end of the caucus, the number of members in each group determines how many delegates that candidate gets.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhy is Donald Trump not on the Nevada primary ballot? Dual contests confuse voters\n\nWashoe County Registrar of Voters Cari-Ann Burgess said there has been ongoing confusion among voters about the difference between the primary and the caucus.\n\n\"We get a lot of 'why isn't President Trump on our ballot?,'\" Burgess said Tuesday morning. \"And the answer is he opted out of participating in the Nevada presidential preference primary. He just decided not to participate in ours, but he's in the caucus.\"\n\nUnder a 2021 state law, Nevada is required to hold presidential primary elections as long as there are at least two candidates for a party's nomination.\n\nBut Republican Party officials ‒ many of whom participated in a 2020 effort to subvert the presidential election results in Trump's favor ‒ decided last year to hold a binding caucus. They also tried unsuccessfully to stop the state from holding the primary.\n\nBurgess said she isn't directly coordinating with the state GOP because her office is non-partisan, so her staff doesn't give out information about the caucuses. Instead, she has been trained to refer all questions to the party directly.\n\nNevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar said even his own friends called him up to complain about the dual contests, though his office alerted voters for months about the dueling contests, sending out postcards, posting signs and speaking to the media.\n\nNevada GOP has said previously it considered the primary election to be a waste of taxpayer dollars, and that party business should be funded and conducted by the party itself.\n\n-Trevor Hughes\n\nCalifornia’s atmospheric river brings winter weather warnings to Nevada\n\nThe storm that slammed California with rain this week has also brought heavy snowfall to parts of Nevada. A ski resort near Las Vegas said it had received nearly a foot of snow in 24 hours, and an avalanche occurred Monday leaving several people missing temporarily.\n\nOn this Primary Day, much of Nevada is under either a winter storm warning or a winter weather advisory in effect until at least 4:00 p.m. PST Tuesday. The National Weather Service says that travel may be difficult, especially in high-altitude areas.\n\nTo see the full list of weather advisories in effect, see the weather service website. Nevada’s Road Weather Information System website also tracks weather conditions by roadways.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nTrump calls on supporters to end Bud Light boycott\n\nWhile waiting for Nevada primary results, Trump used his Truth Social account to propose an end to the conservative boycott of Bud Light because of its past partnership with a transgender influencer.\n\n\"The Bud Light ad was a mistake of epic proportions, and for that a very big price was paid, but Anheuser-Busch is not a Woke company,\" Trump said in his post.\n\nTrump applauded the Anheuser-Busch beer empire, saying it helps the nation's farmer, hires veterans, and raises money for the families of fallen service members.\n\n\"Anheuser-Busch is a Great American Brand that perhaps deserves a Second Chance?\" Trump asked rhetorically. \"What do you think?\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\n'Right on schedule' in Reno\n\nIn Reno, the state’s third-largest city, Washoe County Registrar of Voters Cari-Ann Burgess said the process was moving smoothly. Mail-ballot voting began Jan. 27 and workers at her office had been opening and preparing the ballots for counting after polls close.\n\nThe temperature as the polls opened at 7 a.m. was 28 degrees with clear skies, a major change from a significant weekend snowstorm days before.\n\n“We’re right on schedule, right on point,” Burgess told USA TODAY.\n\nAfter contentious 2020 and 2022 elections, the registrar’s office is now live streaming the ballot counting, hired a full-time security guard to monitor the counting room and installed a glass-enclosed observation room so people can watch the count without disrupting workers.\n\nAnd despite repeated news coverage, some Republican voters were still angry or confused as to why Trump isn’t appearing on the GOP primary ballot, she said.\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nNikki Haley requests Secret Service protection citing ‘multiple issues'\n\nThe only major Republican in Tuesday’s primary, Haley has requested Secret Service protection after saying she's received increased threats, according to reports.\n\n“We’ve had multiple issues,” Haley told the Wall Street Journal Monday. “It’s not going to stop me from doing what I need to do.”\n\nHaley has been the victim of two swatting attempts in recent months.\n\nWhen asked about heightened security at her events last week, Haley told reporters that “when you do something like this, you get threats. It’s just the reality, and that’s OK.\n\nThe Secret Service typically provides protection to “major presidential and vice presidential candidates as identified as such” by the Secretary of Homeland Security in consultation with an advisory committee, according to its website.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCan voters register at the polls?\n\nYes, Nevada offers same-day registration.\n\nHowever, to register at the polls or update your voter registration at the polls, you must have a valid Nevada driver’s license or ID card. This rule goes without exception.\n\nIf your Nevada ID has an outdated address, the state does allow you to provide an alternative proof of residence. Find the list of acceptable items on the Nevada’s Secretary of State site.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nWhere do Nikki Haley and Donald Trump stand in 2024 polls?\n\nWhile Nikki Haley is trying to pick up momentum in Nevada, South Carolina and other pivotal 2024 contests, she's still trailing Trump, the Republican frontrunner.\n\nIn a Real Clear Politics average of polls of the Republican field, Trump garnered 73.5% support across the country. In comparison, Haley received 18.8% support, even after rivals such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and others dropped out of the GOP primary.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden declared victory in South Carolina\n\nJoe Biden cruised to an easy victory Saturday in the South Carolina primary, the first official contest of the 2024 Democratic nomination process.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race for Biden about an hour after the polls closed at 7 p.m., even as Biden faced challenges from Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., and author Marianne Williamson.\n\nWhile the president is expected to win the 2024 Democratic nomination, the primary season could give clues as to where Biden stands with his party’s base and whether he has lost supporters since his 2020 White House bid.\n\n– USA TODAY staff", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/02/07/haley-loses-nevada-primary-biden-wins/72437321007/", "title": "Nevada primary takeaways: Haley loses to 'none.' Trump wasn't on ...", "text": "RENO, Nev. – In an embarrassing setback, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley lost the Nevada GOP presidential primary Tuesday to \"none of these candidates.\"\n\nThe loss is largely meaningless, because former President Donald Trump decided to skip the Nevada presidential preference primary and instead is expected to win the GOP-run caucuses Thursday night. That victory will give him all 26 of the state's delegates.\n\nBut it's a symbolic hit to the former governor who came in third in Iowa and second in New Hampshire and heads next to her home state's Feb. 24 Republican primary. She captured almost 32% of the vote, while \"none\" claimed nearly 62% with close to two-thirds of the state's votes counted.\n\nA number of Republican voters, initially confused about why Trump wasn't on their ballot, said they voted for \"none of these candidates\" in support of the former president.\n\n“I wanted Donald Trump to be on there,” said Republican voter Ron Stanley, 64, a truck driver, who dropped off a ballot in person in downtown Reno shortly before noon.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nAt first, when he saw Trump's name wasn't on his ballot, he thought maybe elections managers were pulling a fast one, but once he understood Trump chose to skip the primary, Stanley said he assumed the former president had his reasons.\n\nHe voted for \"none\" in protest, said Stanley, who used to work in the Texas oilfields.\n\n“Nikki Haley is not the answer. Trump’s the guy who has shown, from his business background, that he can make the hard decisions we need. Small business and family farms are just getting pounded by so many restrictions. The answer is not more government.”\n\nNevada's competing caucus and primary were the first nominating contests in the West.\n\nTuesday’s election was unusually quiet compared to past years, with no campaign signs visible and no enthusiastic volunteers cheering for their preferred candidate outside polling sites.\n\nTurnout appeared to be low, with no evident lines and fewer than 12,000 ballots cast by 2 p.m. About 150,000 Nevadans voted early or by mail-in or absentee ballot, roughly 13% of the eligible voters, according to the Secretary of State's office.\n\nHaley still the official winner\n\nAlthough \"none of these candidates\" received more votes, according to Nevada state law, the person who gets the most votes is declared the winner.\n\nOutside a Reno polling place on Tuesday, Gary Benedetti, 75, said he hoped Haley would stay in the race. A longtime Republican voter, Benedetti said he can't stomach the idea of another Trump presidency.\n\n“We need a change. I’m tired of the drama,\" he said. \"If it doesn’t work out with her, I’ll change to independent. I’m just not going to vote for Trump. There’s too many red flags hanging over his head.”\n\nBenedetti rejected the idea of participating in Thursday's GOP caucuses: \"If you want to argue with somebody, there are better places to do it, he said: “We should do away with caucuses. We need to get back to civility in the Republican Party.\"\n\nThe Haley campaign noted that it did not campaign in Nevada because the whole thing has been a setup for Trump.\n\n“Even Donald Trump knows that when you play penny slots the house wins,” said spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. “We didn’t bother to play a game rigged for Trump. We’re full steam ahead in South Carolina and beyond.”\n\nTrump wasn't on the ballot, but many wish he had been\n\nMany Republican voters on Tuesday remained confused why Trump's name was missing from the primary ballot, despite an extensive public-education campaign by the media and election managers.\n\nWashoe County Registrar of Voters Cari-Ann Burgess said most voters were understanding once her staff explained Trump himself decided to skip the primary.\n\n\"He opted out of participating in the Nevada presidential preference primary,\" Burgess said Tuesday. \"But he's in the caucus.\"\n\nRepublican Michael Holton, who works in manufacturing, said he begrudgingly voted for \"none of these candidates\" at a South Reno polling site.\n\nHolton, 61, said he wished Trump could have participated in the primary so the former president could defeat Haley in a head-to-head competition. Holton said Haley, a former Trump ambassador to the United Nations, is disloyal running against her former boss.\n\n\"I'm bummed he's not on the ballot,\" Holton said. \"I feel the caucus will be strong for him, but I'm just bummed he's not on the ballot.\"\n\nFormer Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, laughed and declined to say who he voted for after casting his ballot. Sandoval, now the president of the University of Nevada, Reno, voted at the university's student union.\n\nSandoval told USA TODAY he thinks most of the concern over the dueling primary and caucus has passed, and said he favored anything that gets more people to participate in the political process. Sandoval was first elected Nevada attorney general in 2003, and then after serving as a federal judge won the governorship twice starting in 2010, before term limits forced him to step down.\n\n“Yes, there will be a little bit of confusion but if it encourages more people to get out there and be part of the process I’m all for it,\" Sandoval said.\n\nBiden won, too\n\nPresident Joe Biden who faced no serious opposition on the ballot, cleared nearly 90% of the Democratic vote. He easily bested self-help author Marianne Williamson and a number of other challengers who met basic qualification rules. Nearly 6% of Democrats voted for \"none of these candidates.\"\n\nIn acknowledging his win in a statement shortly before midnight East Coast time, Biden thanked Nevada Democrats for supporting him and praised them as \"the backbone of our nation.\"\n\nVoter Bruce Bartlett, 80, said he voted for Biden to show support for the president. Bartlett, a retired investigator for the district attorney, said Biden has done a good job improving the United States given what he inherited from Trump.\n\n\"We’re concerned about our country and want to try to do that right thing,\" Bartlett said.\n\nLike several other voters, Bartlett said he was frustrated that Biden and Trump are both so old, and called for a new generation of leaders.\n\n“I realized when I retired at 62 that times had changed. It was time to turn over my job to a new generation,\" Bartlett said. \"And it’s time to do that with elected offices too.\"\n\nCollege student Emma Bergren, 21, said she also wanted to see younger candidates. After voting for Biden, who she said she supports because he's addressing student loan debt for young people like her, Bergren said younger candidates could spur more interest from young voters.\n\n“I think there needs to be more engagement with my generation,\" she said. “I don’t really care about parties. I care about who can do something for us.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/02/06/nevada-caucus-primary-trump-haley/72481446007/", "title": "Why does Nevada hold a caucus and primary?

Only Texas Pastor Ryan Binkley is going up against Trump.\n\nWhen is the Nevada primary?\n\nThe presidential preference primary is Feb. 6, with early voting starting Jan. 27. Only registered Republicans and Democrats can particiapte.\n\nIt will be structured like a typical election with sample ballots mailed out, mail-in ballots as the default and electronic voting at many of the usual vote centers.\n\nWho’s on the Nevada primary ballot?\n\nOn the Republican side, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is on the ballot, along with Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and former Vice President Mike Pence, both of whom have dropped out of the race. John Castro, Heath Fulkerson, Hirsh Singh and Donald Kjornes round out the Republican ballot.\n\nIf you're registered as a Democrat in Nevada, your ballot will include President Joe Biden, challenger Marianne Williamson and less-well-known candidates Armando Perez-Serrato, Brent Foutz, Stephen Lyons, Jason Palmer, Donald Picard, Stephen Leon, John Haywood, Gabriel Cornejo, Frank Lozada, Superpayaseria Crystalroc and Mark Prascak.\n\n“None of these candidates” will also be a choice on statewide primary ballots.\n\nWhy is Trump not on the Nevada primary ballot?\n\nTrump registered to run in the Nevada caucus, rather than the Nevada presidential preference primary, after the state's Republican Party announced it would not send delegates to the Republican National Convention based on results from the primary.\n\nThat means only the GOP caucus has the power to move a candidate closer to winning the Republican nomination.\n\nWhy does Nevada have a caucus and a primary?\n\nIn 2021, the Nevada Legislature approved a change to make way for a presidential primary.

(Likewise, only those registered as Democrats can vote in the Presidential Preference Primary for Democratic presidential candidates.)\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nAnd only voters who are registered Republican can vote in the Republican Presidential Caucus, to be held Feb. 8.\n\nBut can Republicans vote for candidates in both, as the reader asks?\n\nTo learn more, the RGJ reached out to Washoe County’s registrar of voters office and the Nevada Secretary of State’s office, which oversees elections for the state.\n\n“No law prevents people from voting in both,” said Washoe County’s ROV in an email.\n\nThe Nevada Secretary of State’s office texted the RGJ, “No, it’s not illegal to vote in both.”\n\nNevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar and Attorney General Aaron Ford confirmed this in a Jan. 10 news conference with media about election security.\n\nPerspectives on voting in both Nevada primary and caucus\n\nAlexis Hansen, a Republican member of the Nevada Assembly representing District 32, wrote an opinion column recommending that Republicans vote in both.\n\n“I imagine most of you are what we refer to as 4/4 voters, meaning you voted four times in the previous four elections,” she wrote. “This helps ensure you receive all important election information and communications — from the Secretary of State to the campaigns themselves. That is why I encourage you to vote in the primary to maintain your 4/4 voting record and not show an election absence.”\n\nNicholas St. Jon of Washoe Patriots encourages his email list to “Just say ‘no’ to the worthless primary.”\n\nHe followed up this message with the suggestion that people hold onto their mail-in ballots for the presidential primary in order to check later if someone fraudulently voted in their name.\n\nGov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has called the caucus “unacceptable for the voters and the understanding of how things should be done.”\n\nThe Nevada Republican Party has defended the caucus — which it pays for — as important because it will model an election process it considers more secure. The caucus will require voter ID, paper ballots and in-person voting on a single election day.\n\nWhy Nevada has a primary and a caucus\n\nIn 2021, the Nevada Legislature passed a law to have the state run a primary system to inform presidential choices for Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic and Republican parties can still use whatever method they want to allocate delegates who will represent the views of Nevada voters at the parties’ national conventions this summer.\n\nAs Aguilar said earlier this month, whether to use the results of the Presidential Preference Primary is purely “advisory” to the parties.\n\nThe 2021 law was passed largely along party lines and signed by then-Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat. It would make available sample ballots, mail-in ballots, voting machines, early voting and election oversight by the Secretary of State’s office — all paid for by taxpayers.\n\nThe Nevada Republican Party decided to stick with the caucus system. Toward that end, it set up a rule that any Republican candidate who signed up for the primary could not also participate in the caucus and would not be eligible for any Nevada delegates.\n\nIn other words, Nevada’s Republican Presidential Preference Primary became symbolic only.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is the main candidate still in the running to be on the Republican primary ballot. Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis are the top candidates on the Republican caucus ballot.\n\nTo learn more about the Nevada Republican caucus and find caucus locations, visit nevadagop.org/2024-presidential-caucus.\n\nTo learn more about the Nevada Presidential Preference Primary and find polling locations, visit nvsos.gov/sos/elections/election-information/2024-election-information.\n\nMark Robison is the state politics reporter for the Reno Gazette Journal, with occasional forays into other topics.

Nancy Mace but souring on Rep. Tom Rice, the first of the 10 House Republicans who voted for Trump’s impeachment last year to fall in a primary.\n\nState Rep. Russell Fry, who was endorsed by Trump, will defeat Rice in the 7th District, CNN projects.\n\nDespite facing a severe backlash over his impeachment vote, including death threats in its aftermath, Rice did not back off his criticism of Trump or decide, like some of his impeachment-backing GOP colleagues, to leave office at the end of his term rather than face voters again. A staunch conservative and Trump supporter before the insurrection, the five-term congressman instead took his case out on the campaign trail. Republicans in his 7th District rejected it – and delivered the nomination to Fry, who will clear the 50% mark to avoid a runoff.\n\nRice’s ouster underscores Trump’s enduring popularity with most Republicans, especially in conservative districts like the one Rice has represented since 2013. But results in the 1st District demonstrated that the former President’s hold is not entirely firm.\n\nMace did not vote to impeach Trump, but she refused to join congressional objectors to President Joe Biden’s victory, earning the former President’s wrath. Faced with charges of insufficient loyalty to Trump, she drew a challenge from Katie Arrington, who defeated then-Rep. Mark Sanford, another Trump critic, in the 2018 primary but went on to lose the general election.\n\nArrington, like Fry, had Trump’s endorsement. But it wasn’t enough. Mace will defeat Arrington in their three-candidate race, CNN projects. Mace had the backing of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who served as UN ambassador in the Trump administration.\n\nIn a rare conciliatory move, Trump congratulated Mace but declared Rice’s loss “the biggest News of the evening” in posts on his new social media platform.\n\nNevada, Maine, North Dakota and a special election in Texas’ 34th Congressional District were also on the menu Tuesday, with the most fierce contests featuring Republicans vying for nominations ahead of a midterm general election that looks increasingly dire for Democrats trying to hold on to their narrow majorities in the US House and Senate.\n\nRecent Democratic dominance in Nevada is in for a stress test in the fall from Silver State Republicans who are poised, after Tuesday night, to field a collection of general election candidates up and down the ballot who have embraced Trump’s lies about the 2020 election to varying degrees.\n\nFormer state Attorney General Adam Laxalt will win the Republican nomination, CNN projects, to take on Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents.\n\nEndorsed by Trump, he fended off a late push from political newcomer Sam Brown, a retired Army captain who received a Purple Heart after suffering severe burn injuries in Afghanistan.\n\nLaxalt, whose late grandfather Paul Laxalt served as Nevada’s governor and then as one of its US senators for two terms, had served as the former President’s 2020 campaign co-chair in the state and peddled unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud after Trump’s loss there became apparent.\n\nHe lost his last bid for statewide office, the 2018 gubernatorial race. This year, he has the backing of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other leading conservatives with eyes on the 2024 presidential race.\n\nThe contest for the GOP gubernatorial nomination, and a November date with Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, was particularly emblematic of the modern-day Republican Party – all three candidates aligned themselves with Trump, a symbol of his movement’s growing power. But it’s Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, the candidate with the former President’s endorsement, who will win the GOP nomination, CNN projects, defeating former Sen. Dean Heller and Joey Gilbert, a lawyer and retired boxer.\n\nIn years past, the race to fill the seat of term-limited Republican Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske might have flown under the national political radar. But in the wake of Trump’s bid to overturn the 2020 results – efforts Cegavske dismissed – and with more recent, successful Republican attempts to restrict ballot access in mind, Democrats are renewing their focus on offices that oversee elections.\n\nCisco Aguilar, an attorney and former staffer for the late Sen. Harry Reid, ran unopposed for the post in the Democratic primary. Former state Assemblyman Jim Marchant, who CNN projects will win the Republican nomination, filed an unsuccessful lawsuit after losing his 2020 House race and has said he would not have certified Biden’s victory in Nevada if he’d been in Cegavske’s seat after the election.\n\nDown the ballot, a handful of the state’s Democratic House members were facing primary challenges. Rep. Dina Titus will win renomination, CNN projects, defeating progressive challenger Amy Vilela, who was endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders last week. The Vermont independent won the Nevada caucuses during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.\n\nDown in Texas, the Tuesday night lights were on again, this time for a special election to finish out former Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela’s term in the soon-to-be-former 34th Congressional District. Vela’s resignation in late March to work for a law and lobbying firm opened the seat in a district Biden narrowly won in 2020 but that is poised to become more comfortably blue-leaning after redistricting comes into effect in the November election. The special election took place under the existing district boundaries.\n\nFormer Cameron County Commissioner Dan Sanchez, a Democrat, conceded to Republican Mayra Flores Tuesday night. CNN projected the race for Flores on Wednesday. Flores’ win gives Republicans an additional seat in the House – but only until January.\n\nRepublicans were heavily invested in the special election, hoping to give Flores – already their general election nominee for the new district – a head start in her coming race against Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, currently of the 15th Congressional District.\n\n“Based on the results, we came up short tonight despite being outspent by millions of dollars from out of state interests and the entire Republican machine,” Sanchez said in a statement. “Too many factors were against us, including too little to no support from the National Democratic Party and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.”\n\nFlores will become the country’s first Mexican-born woman elected to Congress – a piece of history Republicans are hoping to wield as a signal of the party’s growing foothold with Hispanic voters in South Texas ahead of her clash with Gonzalez.\n\nIn Maine, more familiar faces dominated the primary night landscape.\n\nFormer Republican Gov. Paul LePage – the man who once declared himself “Donald Trump before Donald Trump became popular” – is on the general election ballot again as he seeks to win back his old job from Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, a longtime political foe. Both were running unopposed in their primaries ahead of another November showdown.\n\nThe Republican field was more competitive in the state’s 2nd Congressional District, where the nominee will take on one of the Democratic Party’s most endangered incumbents, Rep. Jared Golden. Former Rep. Bruce Poliquin, who lost his seat to Golden in 2018 after neither managed to secure a majority and the race was decided by Maine’s ranked-choice system, will defeat Caratunk Selectwoman Liz Caruso in the primary, CNN projects.\n\nThere was less drama in North Dakota, where CNN projects Republican Sen. John Hoeven will win the nomination over conservative activist Riley Kuntz. Hoeven is expected to comfortably win reelection in November in the deep red state over Katrina Christiansen, who CNN projects will be the Democratic nominee.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story mischaracterized the historical significance of Flores’ win. She will be the first Mexican-born woman elected to Congress.", "authors": ["Gregory Krieg"], "publish_date": "2022/06/14"}]}

It was later adapted by meteorologist Robert Simpson in the early 1970s, and it has been an integral tool for alerting the public about the possible impacts of various intensity hurricanes ever since, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe scale does not take into account potentially deadly hurricane hazards such as storm surge, rainfall flooding and tornadoes.\n\nHurricane Ian live updates:Hurricane Ian nears Category 5 status, closes in on Florida\n\nThe Saffir-Simpson scale differs from the Fujita tornado damage scale in a fundamental way, according to the American Meteorological Society Weather Book. Meteorologists assign tornadoes a Fujita scale ranking only after examining the damage the tornado has done; the hurricane center assigns categories based on estimates of the hurricane's fastest sustained wind speed.\n\nThe Saffir-Simpson scale provides examples of the type of damage and impacts in the USA associated with winds of the indicated intensity. In general, damage rises by about a factor of four for every category increase.\n\nThough all hurricanes produce life-threatening winds, hurricanes rated Category 3 and higher are known as major hurricanes. Major hurricanes can cause devastating to catastrophic wind damage and loss of life. Hurricanes of all categories can produce deadly storm surge, rain-induced floods and tornadoes.\n\nThese hazards require people to take protective action, including evacuating from areas vulnerable to storm surge.\n\nWHAT IS A FLASH FLOOD WATCH OR WARNING? Here's what to know about this deadly weather hazard\n\nWHAT IS A TORNADO? Everything you need to know about these violent storms\n\nCategory 1 hurricane: 74-95 mph\n\nVery dangerous winds will produce some damage: Well-constructed frame homes could have damage to roof, shingles, vinyl siding and gutters. Large branches of trees will snap, and shallowly rooted trees may be toppled. Extensive damage to power lines and poles probably will result in power outages that could last a few to several days.\n\nCategory 2 hurricane: 96-110 mph\n\nExtremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage: Well-constructed frame homes could sustain major roof and siding damage. Many shallowly rooted trees will be snapped or uprooted and block numerous roads. Near-total power loss is likely, including outages that could last from several days to weeks.\n\nCategory 3 hurricane (major): 111-129 mph\n\nDevastating damage will occur: Well-built framed homes may incur major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends. Many trees will be snapped or uprooted, blocking numerous roads. Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm passes.\n\nCategory 4 hurricane (major): 130-156 mph\n\nCatastrophic damage will occur: Well-built framed homes can sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles downed. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.\n\nCategory 5 hurricane (major): 157 mph or higher\n\nCatastrophic damage will occur: A high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed; there will be total roof failure and wall collapse. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last for weeks to possibly months.

For the latest news on Hurricane Idalia's path, please check our live updates file for Tuesday, Aug. 29.\n\nFORT MYERS, Fla. − Idalia strengthened into a hurricane early Tuesday on its treacherous trek toward Florida's Gulf Coast, where it is expected to make landfall with potent storm surge and powerful winds.\n\nThe Category 1 storm was expected to \"rapidly intensify into an extremely dangerous major hurricane\" before striking Florida on Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said. Extremely warm waters in the Gulf were fueling Idalia, which now has maximum sustained winds of 75 mph.\n\nResidents along the Gulf Coast loaded up on sandbags and evacuated from homes in low-lying areas along the coast Monday as Idalia intensified.\n\nIdalia on Monday had been struggling with wind shear to its west but Cuban radar images show a partial eyewall forming, and the latest information from reconnaissance flights show Idalia is \"very near hurricane strength,\" according to senior hurricane specialist Richard Pasch. Tropical storm force winds were extending up to 150 miles from the center of the storm.\n\nRyan Truchelut, chief meteorologist at Florida-based WeatherTiger, said conditions remained ripe for rapid intensification starting Tuesday morning. He projected landfall in Florida to take place by midday Wednesday somewhere along the Big Bend and Nature Coast.\n\nIdalia could become just the second Category 3 or higher hurricane to make landfall there in the past 170 years, he said.\n\n\"Idalia will likely bring catastrophic surge to a broad swath of the west-central Florida and Big Bend coastline and a core of destructive winds to an unlucky but still unknown swath of North Florida,\" said Truchelut, who provides forecasts for the USA TODAY Network.\n\nHurricane watches were in effect along more than 300 miles of the Florida Coast − from Longboat Key, 60 miles south of Tampa, to the Ochlockonee River near Tallahassee. A major hurricane is a Category 3, 4 or 5 storm or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind speed scale; a storm becomes a Category 3 hurricane when maximum wind speeds reach at least 111 mph.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in 46 counties, a broad swath that stretches across the northern half of the state from the Gulf Coast to the Atlantic Coast. Pasco County, north of Tampa, issued a mandatory evacuation order for some areas − and throughout the county of almost 600,000 people for those living in manufactured or mobile homes or RVs.\n\nThe county will open shelters Tuesday morning.\n\n\"Please consider riding out the storm with family or friends,\" county officials said in a statement. \"If that’s not an option, you can evacuate directly to a Pasco County shelter.\"\n\nSpaghetti models:See latest satellite images, spaghetti models for Idalia\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Up to 12 feet of ocean water could surge over the Florida shoreline and along inland rivers and creeks as the storm rolls in, raising concerns for flooding that could be extensive.\n\n∎ The storm was 85 miles north of the western tip of Cuba and 370 miles south-southwest of Tampa early Tuesday. It was moving north at 14 mph.\n\nIdalia has 'infernal potential':Storm takes aim at Florida, forecaster warns\n\n'Dangerous situation' for Florida with 21 counties under evacuation orders\n\nWhile some parts of the state — such as Tampa Bay — will not see landfall, Truchelut warned that the key and \"number one\" threat from Idalia is going to be the storm surge. Life-threatening conditions are expected along portions of the Florida coast.\n\n\"It's a dangerous situation developing for north central and west central Florida,\" Truchelut said during a Monday night forecast.\n\nIdalia, according to Truchelut, was \"just shy\" of Category 1 hurricane intensity and is expected to strengthen into a major hurricane by the end of Tuesday before making landfall in Florida on Wednesday.\n\nIn addition to hurricane conditions, there is the potential for flash and urban flooding across Florida and portions of Georgia and the Carolinas. Truchelut also warned the possibility of storm and localized surges going higher than the predicted eight to 12 feet.\n\n\"If you're in a low lying area that floods anywhere in the Apalachee Bay and Nature Coast, you got to get out of there,\" Truchelut said.\n\nState expects power outages, preps for water rescues\n\nBy Monday, DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 46 of the state's 67 counties. The governor warned that trees will come down and power outages are \"just going to happen.\"\n\nThe state has mobilized more than 2,500 National Guard members and airmen with another 3,000 in pre-staged deployment, DeSantis said. They will be equipped with 2,400 high-water vehicles and 12 aircraft to prepare for rescues.\n\nSeven urban search and rescue teams are also ready for deployment once the storm passes. The state's emergency operations center in Tallahassee shifted into around-the-clock operations Monday morning.\n\n\"These things can wobble, so Floridians along our Gulf Coast should be vigilant, even if you are currently outside\" the likely track of the storm, he said.\n\nResidents prepare for Idalia: 'Better safe than sorry'\n\nThe Home True Value Hardware store in Holmes Beach has been humming with people stopping in and preparing for the storm, head cashier Gloria Creighton said Monday. The store’s sales have doubled, selling more than usual.\n\nSo far, the hardware store has run out of sandbags, bungee cords, and tarps. And many customers have bought flashlights, batteries, and all different sizes of propane canisters — which the store had a delivery on Monday.\n\nCreighton said the store will probably be closed on Tuesday. This comes as other stores throughout Holmes Beach began closing Monday, some with sandbags before the doors and others boarded up.\n\n\"Everybody’s getting ready, is what it is,\" Creighton added. “Better safe than sorry.”\n\nFor Destiney Lejander, 29, a Sarasota renter, the impending Idalia is her first hurricane. But Lejander, who previously lived in Tennessee, said she feels prepared for the hurricane.\n\n\"I have sliding glass doors in my bedroom, so I'm going to take these and pack that down to try to keep everything together,\" she said. \"I made sure I had flashlights, batteries, and I got groceries today, pet supplies, and even bug spray in case there is standing water. I thought about heading out, but I think I'm just going to hunker down.\"\n\n— Gabriela Szymanowska and Samantha J. Gholar, Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nPine Island, still recovering from Ian, braces for Idalia\n\nMatlacha-Pine Island Fire District chief Ben Mickuleit said that although the island's entire electrical grid was taken down less than a year ago by the wind and storm surge of Hurricane Ian, he wasn't as concerned about the potential for electrical grid damage as he was for homes hit by Ian that had not yet been fully repaired. Mickuleit advised residents prepare their homes by moving outdoor furniture inside. Sand and sandbags were available at the firehouse, he said.\n\nJulia Simpson, secretary of nonprofit charitable organization Matlacha Hookers, said people in Pine Island's St. James City who saw significant flooding during Ian have begun moving vehicles and themselves to higher ground and filling bathtubs.\n\n\"I think everyone's a little more hypervigilant about doing those things this time,\" she said. \"Since it's so uncertain and it is in the Gulf, people are trying to get the basics taken care of.\"\n\nHow do hurricanes form?An inside look at the birth and power of ferocious storms\n\nTampa airport, port announce closures ahead of Idalia\n\nTampa International Airport will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday and expects to reopen Thursday morning after assessments of the damage, authorities said. Port Tampa Bay already has closed for inbound ships because of the coming storm, although \"landside\" operations such as fueling remain open, authorities said. The Coast Guard has set the port conditions to YANKEE, meaning gale force winds are possible within 24 hours.\n\n\"The port has been in contact with our partner fuel terminal operators and have been assured they are prepared to deliver fuel and support consumers,\" the port said in a statement.\n\nCabbage Key 'battening down the hatches'\n\nOn Lee County's Cabbage Key, they are taking preparations seriously at the popular island spot Cabbage Key Inn & Restaurant, where Jimmy Buffett is rumored to have written the song \"Cheeseburger in Paradise.\" The popular post-fishing trip stop is closing down ahead of the storm, and employees who left the island were given Tuesday and Wednesday off.\n\n\"We are battening down the hatches,\" said restaurant manager Thomas James, explaining that the restaurant was doing its typical hurricane prep in case the storm turned or intensified.\n\nBecause of Cabbage Key's remote location, a number of employees live in dorm-style housing. James said the restaurant had not yet decided to evacuate its employees yet, but there was room at its Bokeelia-based sister restaurant Tarpon Lodge and \"plenty of boats to take employees off-island.\"\n\nMessage to Pine Island residents: Don't panic\n\nSome barrier islands along Southwest Florida, such as Pine Island, Matlacha, Sanibel and Fort Myers Beach saw widespread devastation from Hurricane Ian's heavy winds and 14-foot-high storm surge less than one year ago. Now, faced with Hurricane Idalia, local leaders are urging people to stay calm but prepare.\n\nJen and Kevin Russell, who run the popular Facebook page Things to do on Pine Island, are considered the unofficial mayors of the unincorporated island. The Russells' message to Pine Islanders was simple: Don't panic.\n\n\"We don't want to create any anxiety for people,\" said Jen, adding that fear might keep people from smart decisions. Kevin said they planned to keep Pine Islanders informed through their Facebook page, as they did during Ian.\n\nSanibel, blasted by Ian, awaits Idalia\n\nSanibel City Council member Holly Smith, who was mayor when Hurricane Ian devastated the island in September, said that as a hotelier she’s busy preparing while navigating a flurry of meetings Monday. On the schedule so far: the fire district, Lee County Electric Cooperative, a likely City Council meeting and a roundtable with Sen. Rick Scott about lessons learned from Hurricane Ian. She said she has asked Lee County officials for a state of emergency to prepare for evacuations and other responses as the storm grows stronger.\n\nShe estimated there are about 1,000 residents on the island and fewer than 100 visitors because of limited room availability.\n\nAfter Ian, “I would rather have a citizen upset with me for a couple of days if nothing comes to pass, then have to handle the mess we did post-Ian,\" she said.\n\nSchools closed as Idalia approaches\n\nAll public schools in Hernando County, which includes the Spring Hill and Weeki Wachee areas, about 50 miles north of Tampa, were closed Monday and will remain so until at least Wednesday. Multiple schools are being used as shelters for those living on the coast or in low-lying areas.\n\nPasco-Hernando State College canceled all in-person and remote classes scheduled after 5 p.m. Monday. The school's facilities, including its three campuses, are expected to reopen Thursday.\n\nSchool districts in Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, as well as Citrus and Pinellas counties, canceled classes Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nMultiple Central Florida school districts announced closures, too. No classes will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday in Marion County public schools. Lake County Schools announced classes would be canceled Wednesday. Other districts, including Orange County, which includes Orlando, said they were monitoring the movements of Idalia.\n\n– Christopher Cann\n\nState parks closed and famed mermaid show shut down\n\nOn Monday, voluntary evacuations were issued for all areas west of U.S. 19, including Hernando Beach, Pine Island and Weeki Wachee State Park.\n\nWeeki Wachee State Park, known for its mermaid shows and the head spring of the Weeki Wachee River, was closed on Monday and will reopen \"as soon as conditions allow,\" according to the Florida state parks website.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, a total of 80 state parks expected to be potentially impacted by the Idalia were closed.\n\nManatee and Pinellas counties each issued mandatory level A evacuations, which applies to vulnerable coastal areas as well as all mobile homes and RVs. A voluntary evacuation was also issued for others in areas at risk of being impacted by potentially deadly storm surge.\n\n\"We’re expecting significant storm surge along the barrier islands and coastal communities for Idalia, with the earliest arrival predicted for Tuesday,” said Jodie Fiske, the Manatee County public safety director, in a public statement. “This is a very dangerous track that we all need to be aware of.”\n\n– Christopher Cann\n\nIdalia could make landfall near Cedar Key\n\nIdalia could be headed for a landfall near Cedar Key, based on Monday’s forecast.\n\n“We’re not on the coast, we’re three miles into the Gulf,” Sue Colson, a Cedar Key city commissioner told USA TODAY on Monday. “It looks bad.”\n\nEverybody in the small island community was doing storm prep Monday, in advance of an expected evacuation, Colson said. She said the city and Levy County have a well-honed emergency plan. The town’s residents were trailering boats out of town, and moving things to higher ground.\n\n“We’re used to it,” Colson said. The small archipelago has been hit repeatedly by storms. The last major damage came with Hurricane Hermione’s 8-foot storm surge in 2016.\n\nThis time the community is forecast to have a 7- to 11-foot storm surge, with a potential for 115 mph winds, Colson said.

The National Hurricane Center increased and extended its surge forecast Monday with the expectation that Idalia will become a major hurricane, with winds in excess of 110 mph, as it nears the coast. Idalia will be making landfall during a full moon, the time of the month when tides are at their highest.\n\nThe center warned the surge could be as high as 7 to 11 feet from the Big Bend south to Homosassa Springs, and a storm surge warning is in place from St. Marks, Florida, south to Port Charlotte. The surge could be on the higher end of the forecast if Idalia makes landfall at high tide.\n\nThe peak surge forecast decreases by degrees further south along the coast, but could be anywhere from 3 feet to 9 feet, depending on the proximity to landfall, the hurricane center said.\n\n− Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nNeighbor helping neighbor in Manatee County\n\nDave Clement, 66, lives on the second level of a condo building in Bradenton Beach south of Tampa. He drove a couple of miles south to Coquina Beach, where Manatee County workers dumped sand and bags for locals preparing for the storm. Clement said he was shoveling sandbags for his downstairs neighbor, who was traveling.\n\nClement said that while it remained unclear where the storm will hit, it was best to prepared for whatever might come.\n\n\"When you live in a condo association, you know, you’re all connected,” Clement said. “That’s how I look at it.

AccuWeather meteorologist Brandon Buckingham said damaging winds of 40 to 60 mph can be expected across Florida and parts of the Southeast in coming days.\n\n\"Closest to where the tropical system makes landfall, however, wind gusts of up to 120 to 140 mph can occur,\" he said.\n\nWhat is storm surge?Explaining a hurricane's deadliest and most destructive threat\n\nContaminated gas complicates storm preparations\n\nDrivers along Florida's Gulf Coast were told they could have purchased gas contaminated with diesel fuel over the weekend as residents in the area prepared for Idalia. Florida officials warned Sunday that any fuel purchased after 10 a.m. on Saturday at stations supplied by Citgo from the Port of Tampa has a strong likelihood of being contaminated with diesel fuel.\n\nThe Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said contaminated gasoline and diesel could damage the engine or affect its operation.\n\n− Sarasota Herald-Tribune staff\n\nIdalia will also target Georgia, Carolinas, Virginia\n\nGeorgia, South and North Carolina and Virginia will be the next targets as Idalia sweeps over Florida, forecasters say. Up to 8 inches and wind gusts of more than 40 mph are likely through eastern Georgia and the Carolinas and possibly Virginia later in the week and approaching Labor Day weekend.\n\n\"By late week, the storm can turn toward the east and reemerge over the Atlantic Ocean,\" Buckingham said. \"At this point, little reintensification can be expected, and the system will be moving away from the East Coast toward Bermuda.\"\n\nHurricane Franklin is season's first 'major' hurricane\n\nHurricane Franklin was rapidly intensifying early Monday and reached Category 4 strength with maximum sustained winds estimated at 145 mph. The first \"major\" hurricane of the season, the storm was centered more than 400 miles north of Grand Turk Island and moving north-northwest at 8 mph. Later this week, Franklin will hit Bermuda, AccuWeather said. Franklin also is expected to be felt along the U.S. East Coast, where \"rough surf and rip currents could imperil swimmers as summer winds down,\" AccuWeather warned.\n\nWhat is the Saffir-Simpson scale?Breaking down the hurricane category scale\n\nContributing: Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2023/09/18/hurricane-nigel-atlantic-path/70892280007/", "title": "Hurricane Nigel spins in Atlantic, forecast to strengthen on Tuesday", "text": "The busy 2023 Atlantic hurricane season shows no signs of letting up.\n\nFar out in the open Atlantic Ocean, about 1,400 miles from the East Coast, Hurricane Nigel continued to strengthen Tuesday morning. It's the fifth hurricane of the season and is forecast to power up to Category 2 status early Wednesday.\n\nFortunately, the forecast path of the hurricane shows it curving out to sea long before nearing U.S. shores.\n\nAlthough Nigel was the only active storm on Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center was also keeping a wary eye on two other developing systems in the Atlantic, including one that's close to the Southeast U.S. coastline.\n\nWhere is Hurricane Nigel?\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, the center of Hurricane Nigel was located 630 miles east of Bermuda and was moving to the north-northwest at 16 mph, the hurricane center said. It had maximum sustained winds of 90 mph, making it a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity.\n\n\"Nigel is forecast to strengthen some through early Wednesday, with weakening likely on Thursday and Friday,\" the hurricane center said. \"Nigel is forecast to become a strong post-tropical cyclone on Friday.\"\n\nThe hurricane is forecast to turn northward late Tuesday, and then accelerate rapidly northeastward through the rest of the week.\n\nForecast track for Hurricane Nigel\n\nSpecial note on the NHC cone: The forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nSpaghetti models for Hurricane Nigel\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nForecasters tracking system near the Southeast coast\n\n\"A non-tropical area of low pressure is forecast to form near the southeastern coast of the United States late this week,\" the hurricane center said. \"This system could acquire some subtropical characteristics this weekend if it remains offshore while it moves slowly northward or northwestward.\"\n\nThe hurricane center said the system \"could bring gusty winds, heavy rain, and high surf conditions to portionsof the coastal Carolinas into the coastal Mid-Atlantic states this weekend.\"\n\nMeteorologist Jeff Masters from Yale Climate Connections wrote Monday that \"regardless of development, the system is likely to bring heavy rains to the coast; a NOAA forecast calls for 2-5 inches of rain along the coast from northern Florida to Virginia by next Monday. Coastal flooding from an extended period of strong onshore winds will also be a concern.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Jacksonville warned residents about marine and coastal hazards along the coast and Intracoastal Waterway Thursday through Saturday if a low-pressure system does develop offshore.\n\nGusts of 30-40 mph are possible, along with breakers of 5 to 8 feet. Residents could see hazardous seas, tidal flooding and beach erosion.\n\nTropical wave about to move off of Africa\n\nA tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa by Wednesday, forecasters said.\n\n\"Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for gradual development of the wave thereafter, and a tropical depression is likely to form late this week or this weekend while the system moves westward across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic,\" the hurricane center said. The system has a 70% chance of development by the early part of next week.\n\nMasters said Monday that \"preliminary indications are that this wave will take a track far enough to the northwest to avoid the Caribbean islands, but it is too early to be confident of this forecast.\"\n\nThe next two names on the list of Atlantic hurricane names are Ophelia and Philippe. Whichever of the two systems develops first would be called Ophelia, while the other would be called Philippe.\n\nTropical depression forms in Pacific\n\nMeanwhile, in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Tuesday, a new tropical depression formed Tuesday morning. The depression was located 805 miles southwest of the southern tip of Baja California in Mexico, and was moving to the west-northwest near 13 mph. It was expected to strengthen into Tropical Storm Kenneth later Tuesday.\n\nThe system poses no threat to any land areas as it's forecast to weaken and spin out to sea by later in the week.\n\nContributing: Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY Network - Florida", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/09/19/hurricane-florence-winds-not-best-way-measure-storms-ferocity/1349957002/", "title": "Hurricane Florence: Winds not best way to measure a storm's ferocity", "text": "From 1 to 5, the numbers we use to categorize hurricanes are ingrained in the minds of millions of Americans from Texas to Maine.\n\nBut the 47-year-old Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, which measures only wind speed, may not be the best way to gauge a storm's ferocity.\n\nLast week, powerful Hurricane Florence was downgraded from a Category 4 to a Category 2 and eventually a Category 1 as it made landfall – and this may have contributed to a false sense of security.\n\n“The concept of saying ‘downgraded’ or ’weakened' should be forever banished,” University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd said. “With Florence, I felt it was more dangerous after it was lowered to Category 2.”\n\nThis is because water – whether storm surge from the ocean or flooding from heavy rain – often ends up being much more deadly and destructive than the wind of a hurricane.\n\nWhen Florence’s winds weakened and it dropped in storm category, “we made it very clear that in no way, shape or form that this is going to reduce the impacts in terms of flooding and surge,” said Bill Lapenta, director of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction.\n\nThe storm killed at least 37 people and will probably cost several billions in damage.\n\nOther storms, such as Harvey, Ike and Sandy, have been far more destructive than their category might have suggested.\n\nA study published last year in the British journal Nature Communications said barometric pressure might be a better gauge of a storm's ability to inflict damage.\n\n\"Sandy is the classic example,\" said Dan Chavas, an atmospheric scientist at Purdue University and the study's lead author. \"It was a very big storm, but in terms of maximum wind speed, it was arguably not a hurricane.\"\n\nThe difference in pressure between the center of the storm and outside it is officially known as the \"central pressure deficit.\"\n\n\"If you looked at the central pressure deficit, you would have expected Sandy to cause a lot of damage,\" Chavas said. \"But if you used maximum wind speed, as people usually do, you wouldn't expect it to do the damage that it did.\"\n\nSandy killed more than 150 people and caused $70.2 billion in damage in the USA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.\n\nProperty damage is better predicted by variations in central pressure than by peak storm wind speed since the central pressure combines both wind speed and storm size, the study says.\n\nThe size of a storm is a critical factor in damage potential, particularly because of storm surge.\n\nThe limitations of the Saffir-Simpson scale have come under scrutiny in recent years. Wind speed is often only an estimate that depends on a speed sustained for a short time in one location. The scale is popular with the public and news media because of its simplicity.\n\nSusan Cutter of the University of South Carolina said the National Hurricane Center and National Weather Service “have not done a good job at communicating the risks associated with tropical systems beyond winds.”\n\nNew ways of categorizing hurricanes have been proposed by many groups over the years, including the Hurricane Severity Index, the Cyclone Damage Potential Index and the Integrated Kinetic Energy Index.\n\nAll take into account factors other than wind speed, the idea being that more variables make a scale more valuable.

There’s no new normal. It’s an ever-shifting baseline toward more destructive storms as long as we continue to burn fossil fuels and load the atmosphere with carbon pollution.\"\n\nA Category 5 hurricane is the most destructive hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale, generating winds of 157 mph or higher.\n\nCategory 5 winds can cause \"catastrophic\" destruction, the National Hurricane Center says: \"A high percentage of homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse.\" Power outages can last for weeks to months, and most of the affected area could be uninhabitable for weeks or months.\n\nVisa mess:Hundreds of Bahamian refugees kicked off US-bound ferry over visa confusion\n\nThis isn't the first onslaught of Category 5s: The early to mid-2000s had more than their share of these violent storms. \"In 2005 alone, we had four Category 5 hurricanes (Emily, Katrina, Rita and Wilma),\" Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach said. \"And we had seven Category 5 hurricanes from 2003 to 2005 – including Isabel in 2003 and Ivan in 2004.\"\n\nThe reason for more Category 5s is clear, Mann said: \"The basic physics is indisputable.

That's what a new study suggests. Here's why.", "text": "As fearsome as Category 5 hurricanes can be for people living in harm's way, a new study reports global warming is supercharging some of the most intense cyclones with winds high enough to merit a hypothetical Category 6.\n\nThe world’s most intense hurricanes are growing even more intense, fueled by rising temperatures in the ocean and atmosphere, according to the study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. And, the authors say, a Category 5 on the traditional wind scale underestimates their dangers.\n\n“As a cautious scientist, you never want to cry wolf,” said Michael Wehner, co-author and climate scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. But after searching for the signature of climate change in the world’s most intense cyclones, Wehner said he and co-author Jim Kossin found “the wolf is here.”\n\n“Significantly increasing” temperatures, fueled by greenhouse gas emissions, up the energy available to the most intense tropical cyclones, reported Wehner and Kossin, a retired federal scientist and science advisor at the nonprofit First Street Foundation.\n\nMore cyclones are making the most of it, gaining higher wind speeds and more intensity, the authors said, and their evidence shows that will occur even more often as the world grows warmer.\n\nThey used a hypothetical Category 6, with a minimum threshold of 192 mph, to study hurricanes that have occurred in the modern satellite era, since around 1980. They found five hurricanes and typhoons that would have met the criteria and all five occurred within the last decade.\n\nTo be clear, they aren’t proposing adding that category to the National Hurricane Center’s wind scale, which experts say would require a lengthy process and many partners. But they are hoping to “inform broader discussions about how to better communicate risk in a warming world,” Kossin told USA TODAY.\n\nTheir findings emphasize that the dangers associated with a Category 5 cyclone are increasing as storms intensify above the Cat 5’s 157-mph threshold and that results in an underestimation of risk, he said.\n\nThey found the chances of that potential intensity occurring in such storms have more than doubled since 1979. They say the areas where the growing risks of these storms are of greatest concern are the Gulf of Mexico, the Philippines, parts of Southeast Asia and Australia.\n\nTheir peer-reviewed, scientific research provides the evidence pointing to climate change that some scientists have been waiting for.\n\nFor more than 35 years, the scientific community has expected to see thermodynamic wind speeds increase in hurricanes, said Kerry Emanuel, the climate scientist who edited the paper for the journal. “And now we are seeing this increase in both climate analyses and models..”\n\nWhat is the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale?\n\nThe hurricane center has used the well-known scale – with wind speed ranges for each of five categories – since the 1970s. The minimum threshold for Category 5 winds is 157 mph.\n\nDesigned by engineer Herbert Saffir and adapted by former center director Robert Simpson, the scale stops at Category 5 since winds that high would “cause rupturing damages that are serious no matter how well it's engineered,” Simpson said during a 1999 interview.\n\nThe open-ended Category 5 describes anything from “a nominal Category 5 to infinity,” Kossin said. “That’s becoming more and more inadequate with time because climate change is creating more and more of these unprecedented intensities.”\n\nA Category 6?\n\nScientists, including Kossin, have occasionally brought up adding another category to the scale for more than 20 years.\n\nClimate scientist Michael Mann, director of the Penn Center for Science, Sustainability & the Media at the University of Pennsylvania, has argued for years that the Earth is “experiencing a new class of monster storms – ‘Category 6’ – hurricanes,” thanks to the effects of human-caused warming.\n\nMann wrote a commentary to the Wehner and Kossin study, published in the same journal Monday, saying their work lays out an objective case for expanding the scale to include the “climate change-fueled stronger and more destructive storms.”\n\n“We are witnessing hurricanes that – by any logical extension of the existing Saffir-Simpson scale – deserve to be placed in a whole separate, more destructive category from the traditionally defined (category 5) 'strongest' storms,” Mann wrote.\n\nThe research adds to a growing discussion about how the center, emergency managers and others could better convey the full range of hazards from a major hurricane.\n\nClimate changeIs it fueling hurricanes in the Atlantic? Here's what science says.\n\nHurricane scale doesn’t measure other, greater risks\n\nThe Saffir-Simpson scale only describes the wind risk and does not account for coastal storm surge and rainfall-driven flooding, the two biggest killers in hurricanes.\n\nAdding a sixth category to the wind scale wouldn’t help address those concerns, Kossin said.\n\nThe hurricane center has tried to steer the focus toward the individual hazards, including storm surge, wind, rainfall, tornadoes and rip currents, Jamie Rhome, the center’s deputy executive director, said last week. “So, we don't want to over-emphasize the wind hazard by placing too much emphasis on the category.”\n\nDespite the center’s efforts, the storm’s wind category always gets the most attention from the public when a storm approaches.\n\n“That focus on category over the years has detracted from effective communication of the other hazards,” said James Franklin, a retired branch chief for hurricane specialists at the hurricane center. \"The emphasis at the NHC, rightly, has been to focus on the hazards,” he said.\n\nUltimately, the decision would likely rest with the center, but Kossin said the conversation would “have to happen over time with a lot of input” from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, social scientists and others.\n\nIt’s likely the World Meteorological Organization would be asked to weigh in because of the international scope involved in hurricane and typhoon forecasting, Franklin said. That’s the same group that sets the list of hurricane names for each season.\n\nTo Franklin, the question is what would a sixth category accomplish?\n\n“If there are things that emergency managers would do differently, or the public might do differently because a storm has 195 mph winds versus 160 mph winds, then maybe the categories should be changed,” he said. “Personally, I’m getting out of the way if it’s 165 mph winds or 195 mph winds.”\n\nWhich storms fit the study’s hypothetical Category 6 description?\n\nOne hurricane in the eastern Pacific, Patricia, and four typhoons in the western Pacific:\n\n◾ Haiyan, November 2013: Struck the southern Philippines with 196-mph winds and a storm surge of almost 25 feet, killing 6,300 people and leaving 4 million homeless.\n\n◾ Patricia, October 2015: Reached winds of 216 mph at sea, then dropped before it made landfall in Jalisco, Mexico as a Category 4 storm.\n\n◾ Meranti, September 2016: Moved between the Philippines and Taiwan before making landfall in eastern China. Its winds reached 196 mph.\n\n◾ Goni, November 2020: Made landfall in the Philippines with winds estimated at 196 mph.\n\n◾ Surigae, April 2021: Reached wind speeds of 196 mph over the ocean, tracking east of the Philippines. Its max winds were the highest ever recorded for a storm from January to April anywhere in the world.\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver covers climate and environmental issues for USA TODAY.

With damages of $70 billion, 2012's Sandy has been pushed down to fourth place. Sandy was popularly labeled a \"superstorm\" as it neared landfall despite being a hurricane for nearly its entire life cycle.\n\n(On this list, the damage costs of both Katrina and Sandy are adjusted for inflation.)\n\nNOAA said the dollar amounts are \"the estimated total costs of these events — that is, the costs in terms of dollars that would not have been incurred had the event not taken place. Insured and uninsured losses are included in damage estimates.\"\n\nIn all, 2017's hurricanes caused more than a quarter-trillion dollars in insured and uninsured losses, the National Hurricane Center reported.\n\nThat makes 2017 the costliest hurricane season in U.S. history, even topping the disastrous 2005 season, which included Rita and Wilma in addition to Katrina.\n\nSeptember was the true behemoth, the single-most powerful month ever recorded in the Atlantic in terms of hurricane intensity.\n\nIn a statistic known as \"Accumulated Cyclone Energy,\" Hurricanes Irma, Jose, Katia, Lee and Maria that month generated the largest amount of energy for any month on record, according to Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach.\n\nBoth Irma and Maria soared to Category 5 strength, the top of the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity. Irma’s landfall on Barbuda and Maria's landfall on Dominica makes 2017 only the second season on record to feature two hurricanes that hit at Category 5 strength.\n\nOther records from the season included the 60.58 inches of rain that fell near Nederland, Texas, during Harvey. This broke the record for the greatest rainfall amount ever recorded in the 48 contiguous states from a single storm, WeatherBug reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Irma was the strongest storm on record in the Atlantic — excluding the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico — with maximum winds of 185 mph and an unofficial wind gust of 199 mph.\n\nAnd Maria was the worst natural disaster in Puerto Rico's history, leaving potentially hundreds dead.\n\nThe 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was also the first season since records began in 1851 to have two Category 4 hurricanes make continental U.S. landfall in the same year (Harvey and Irma), according to Klotzbach.\n\nBumped out of the top 10 costliest hurricane list were Charley (2004), Irene (2011) and Hugo (1989), the Weather Channel reported.\n\nNo hurricanes will ever have the names Harvey, Irma and Maria again, as they will all certainly be retired by the World Meteorological Organization due to the storms' ferocity and impact.\n\nThat official designation will come at the organization's meeting in April, the hurricane center said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/09/28/hurricane-ian-category-5-explained/10448374002/", "title": "Category 5 hurricanes in the US: How Ian compares to worst storms", "text": "Hurricane Ian was intensifying Wednesday, with winds topping 155 mph — just 2 mph shy of becoming a Category 5 storm.\n\nThat status, which forecasters consider catastrophic, is actually rare for the United States: Only four Category 5 hurricanes have made landfall since 1851.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nHow are hurricanes ranked? The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale ranks the storms on a 1 to 5 rating based on its maximum sustained wind speed, according to the National Hurricane Center. The scale does not take other factors — like storm surge, rainfall or flooding — into account.\n\nWhat's considered a major hurricane? Storms rated Category 3 and higher are considered \"major hurricanes.\" A hurricane is classified in Category 5 once winds reach 157 mph and above. At this level, \"catastrophic damage will occur,\" according to the National Hurricane Center, including a high percentage of homes destroyed, trees and power lines downed, and power outages lasting for weeks to months.\n\nHow storms are measured: A drop in pressure, measured in millibars, often indicates the approach of a storm. Typically, the farther barometric pressure drops, the stronger the storm will be.\n\nHow common are Category 5 storms? Since 1924, only 37 hurricanes have hit Category 5 status at least briefly in the Atlantic Basin, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Sandy is a good example of how wind speed can be an inadequate measure of a hurricane's ferocity.\n\nSandy killed dozens of people and did $65 billion damage in the USA. alone, the National Climatic Data Center reported.\n\nHurricane Ike battered the Texas coast in 2008, killing at least 112 people and doing $27 billion in damage, but it missed the \"major\" hurricane label by 1 mph when it slammed ashore with winds of 110 mph.\n\nOne explanation for the hiatus in major hurricanes: \"Luck, and it will run out,\" says Dennis Feltgen, a spokesman with the National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n\n\"Luck has certainly played a role,\" agrees Klotzbach. Also, steering currents have helped guide storms out to sea, he says.\n\n\"We have tended to have a trough of low pressure along the East Coast of the U.S. during the past eight years, which has helped steer storms away from the mainland,\" said Klotzbach.\n\nFlorida's nine-year hurricane-free streak is also notable for the state that sticks out into the hurricane zone like a sore thumb: Since 1851, 114 hurricanes have hit Florida, according to data from the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory. This is 39% of the total number of U.S. hurricane strikes.\n\n\"These remarkable streaks must end sometime.\" noted Roger Pielke, Jr., a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado,\n\n\"We need to be prepared that this would be the year that both streaks end,\" added Feltgen.\n\nHurricane season begins June 1. Klotzbach and his team at Colorado State, which includes William Gray, the dean of hurricane forecasting, are predicting a below-average season, with only three hurricanes forecast to form in the Atlantic.\n\nAccuWeather's forecast, released today, also predicts a below-average season, with five hurricanes.\n\nA season with few hurricanes doesn't mean that the ones that do form will be weak: In 1992, only four hurricanes formed, but one of them was monstrous Hurricane Andrew, which killed dozens and caused $27 billion in damages as it battered south Florida.\n\nFederal forecasters from the Climate Prediction Center will issue their forecast on May 22.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/05/14"}]}

It will be the second time the U.S. hosts the men’s competition, after hosting the 1994 World Cup. It will be Canada’s first time hosting the men’s tournament, and Mexico’s record third time as World Cup hosts after hosting it in 1970 and 1986.Here's what to know about the next FIFA World Cup, including host cities, tickets and a new expanded field.\n\n2026 World Cup host cities and stadiums\n\nFIFA announced the list of host cities in June.\n\nUnited States: 11 cities\n\nMexico: 3 cities\n\nCanada: 2 cities\n\nUSA eliminated:Netherlands knocks off USMNT in World Cup round of 16 with dominating 3-1 win\n\nWhy is the 2026 World Cup between three countries?\n\nThe soccer federations of the U.S., Canada and Mexico agreed to submit a joint bid to FIFA to host the competition. The bid won in 2018, with a majority of FIFA’s congress voting to grant rights to the three nations.\n\nThe World Cup has been jointly hosted once before, in 2002 by South Korea and Japan. This is the first time three nations will host the World Cup.\n\nThe North American nations called the bid “United 2026” and contended that their combined sporting event infrastructure made them the best equipped to handle an expanded 48-team tournament.\n\nWhat are soccer's yellow card rules?

In Brazil’s case, some locals were displaced from their homes to make way for new World Cup stadiums, according to the Washington Post.\n\nHuman rights:Migrant workers were deceived and died for Qatar's World Cup.

The ultimate soccer showcase, explained\n\nAre 2026 FIFA World Cup tickets on sale?\n\nNo not yet, according to FIFA’s website. Tickets will go on sale in 2025, according to the United 2026 World Cup bid book.\n\nFor reference, Qatar 2022 tickets went on sale in January, 10 months before the tournament’s start.\n\nWhat happens if a World Cup game ends in a tie?FIFA extra time and penalty shootouts, explained\n\nHow much will 2026 FIFA World Cup tickets cost?\n\nFIFA has yet to provide pricing information, but ticket prices for the opening match of the 2022 World Cup were as low as $54 for Qatar residents and $302 for non-Qatar residents as of Nov. 16. The cheapest group stage match tickets were priced at approximately $11 for locals and $69 for fans from abroad.\n\nThe cheapest tickets for the 2022 World Cup final were roughly $604 for fans from abroad and $206 for locals.\n\nIt’s unclear if FIFA will offer discounted ticket prices for U.S., Canada and Mexico residents as it did for the residents of 2022's host nation.\n\nUSMNT World Cup roster:Surprises, heartbreak and the countdown to Qatar\n\nAn expanded tournament\n\nFIFA in 2017 voted to expand the 2026 World Cup from 32 teams to 48 teams. It will consist of 16 groups of three, with the top two teams in each group advancing to a round of 32.\n\nWhat time of the year will the 2026 World Cup be?\n\nThe 2026 World Cup is slated to return to the summer. Final dates have yet to be announced, but the tournament will likely span from June to July in line with past World Cups.

They will be invaded by a big wake of joy and happiness.\"\n\nHe added 2026 will be \"much bigger\" than the last time the United States hosted the World Cup in 1994.\n\nFIFA and Concacaf — the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football — narrowed 22 finalist locations to 16 cities that will host games in 2026.\n\nThat includes 11 U.S. cities: Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle.\n\nThere will be three host cities in Mexico: Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey; and two in Canada: Toronto and Vancouver.\n\nOne of the biggest surprises was Washington, DC not making the list. It will be only the second time in the men’s tournament history that a host nation's capital does not host a game. Bonn was the other capital city snubbed when West Germany held the competition in 1974. (In 2002, when Japan and South Korea held the tournament, the closest game to Tokyo was in Yokohama — a suburb of the city.)\n\nMISSED OPPORTUNITY: Why Nashville lost bid to host 2026 FIFA World Cup\n\n\"This was a very, very difficult choice,\" FIFA chief tournaments and events officer Colin Smith said. \"You can't imagine a World Cup coming to the U.S. and the capital city not taking a major role as well. So, we'll be engaging with all the cities that weren't chosen to host matches. There's still lots of other areas of cooperation and working together and celebration.\n\n\"We know what a fan fest on the National Mall would be like (on the) 250th anniversary of the U.S.A. on the Fourth of July.\"\n\nInfantino confirmed a fan fest will still be held in D.C., which combined its bid with Baltimore in April 2022 in an attempt to strengthen its hosting chances.\n\nUnited States Soccer Federation president Cindy Parlow Cone didn’t want to focus on the cities not selected Thursday, but rather celebrate the ones that will host games.\n\n\"This is an exciting day, right? One that we have been waiting for a long, long time to announce who are going to be the host cities,\" Parlow Cone said. \"And look, our nation's capital is very much going to be a huge part of this World Cup, even though they're not hosting games.\"\n\nAnd there will be another chance, if the U.S. hosts the women’s World Cup in 2027 or 2031. Parlow Cone said U.S. Soccer plans to bid for those tournaments, but is waiting on further guidance from FIFA.\n\nThe 1994 World Cup holds the record for highest attendance. About 3.58 million spectators watched, with an average match attendance of 68,991, according to U.S. Soccer.\n\nBoston, Dallas and San Francisco hosted games in 1994 and will again in 2026. But Los Angeles, Atlanta and New York could really compete for record crowds based on stadium capacities and their appeal as international hubs.\n\n\"This is really a luxury problem that we have (selecting a location for the final) that is probably unique to this part of the world.\" Infantino said. \"We have cities here that are not just important cities in America, but global capitals.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles County, matches will be held at the splashy SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, which opened in 2020 to the tune of $5.5 billion. The venue has a 70,000-person capacity and is home to the NFL's Los Angeles Rams and Chargers. It also hosted the most recent Super Bowl in February.\n\nThe LA metropolitan area is no stranger to record soccer crowds. The Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California hosted the 1999 women’s World Cup final in front of 90,185 people. The attendance set the world record for a women’s sporting event for nearly 23 years.\n\nThe record was broken this year. In March, 91,553 fans packed Camp Nou in Barcelona to watch the UEFA Women's Champions League quarterfinal between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\nMercedes-Benz Stadium has also become a soccer hub. The Atlanta venue has superb appeal thanks to an investment from owner Arthur Blank. Major League Soccer’s Atlanta United has experienced early success by winning the MLS Cup in 2018 in its second season.\n\nAtlanta United holds the league's attendance records for a regular-season match (72,035, March 2018 vs. D.C. United), MLS All-Star game (72,317, August 2018 vs. Juventus) and for single-game attendance (73,018, December 2018 vs. Portland Timbers for the 2018 MLS Cup final). It also owns a Campeones Cup record (40,128, August 2019 vs. Club América).\n\nNew York/New Jersey is a host with a particular edge at nabbing the 2026 World Cup final because MetLife Stadium, home of the NFL’s New York Giants/Jets has a capacity of 82,500.\n\nBut the location for the culmination of the tournament has not yet been determined.\n\n\"We haven't even started that process,\" Concacaf president Vittorio Montagliani said. \"We've been laboring at the last four years of venue visits to get to this point. There'll be a whole other process to pick — and it's not just the final, there's a lot of big matches, knockout matches and the opening match.\"\n\nFIFA and Concacaf will have to consider multiple factors, including the impact of travel across an entire continent, with multiple time zones and weather conditions.\n\nThe 2026 World Cup will be the first hosted by three countries. Nearly 3,000 miles separate Mexico City (the southern-most host) and Vancouver (the farthest north); Los Angeles (farthest West) and Boston (farthest East).\n\nIt will also be the first World Cup with an expanded 48-team field, which will be divided into 16 groups of three teams to begin play. Thirty-two teams will advance to the knockout stages.\n\nFor comparison, the 2022 World Cup taking place in Qatar in November has 32 teams total, with a 16-team knockout round.\n\n\"When we design the calendar, when we decide on the kickoff times, when we look at the different schedules . . . in such a big region like North America, we need to make sure that teams are playing in clusters that the fans don't have to travel crazy distances, and the teams as well,\" Infantino said.\n\nAnnouncing the host cities was just the start. Now the real work begins, according to Parlow Cone.\n\n\"We know we feel like 26 is far away,\" she said, \"but it will be here before we know it.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2024/02/04/world-cup-2026-schedule-stadium-locations-city-metlife/72457612007/", "title": "World Cup 2026 schedule announced with final cities and stadiums", "text": "The schedule for World Cup 2026 was revealed Sunday in a live stream that featured comedian Kevin Hart, rapper Drake and socialite Kim Kardashian.\n\nThe show laid out the timetable for the tri-country edition of the World Cup and announced that MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, will host the final on July 19.\n\nGroup stage matches will run from June 11, when Mexico opens the tournament in Estadio Azteca, through June 27.

On Tuesday, France beat Belgium, 1-0, to reach the final. England and Croatia face off Wednesday.\n\nNJ soccer stars\n\nNew Jersey has a history of producing some of the best talent in soccer, including U.S. national team stars Carli Lloyd, Tim Howard and Christie Pearce. Former U.S. goalkeeper and current soccer commentator Tony Meola grew up in Kearny, while up-and-coming youngster Matt Miazga, who moved to English soccer giant Chelsea FC from the New York Red Bulls in 2016, hails from Clifton.\n\nThe state also hosted games at the former Giants Stadium during the Women’s World Cup in 1999, which the U.S. team won on a dramatic penalty kick by Brandi Chastain, and the Men’s World Cup in 1994.\n\n“It really catapulted the MLS,” Murphy said of the 1994 tournament. “It catapulted youth engagement in the sport. Thanks to Title IX, women’s soccer in the United States was already world-class in `94. It’s gotten even stronger.

For example, we will have the Red Bull Arena, Princeton University, Kean University; and in New York, there’s the New York City Football Club,” Hasenbalg said. “It’s not just one party. There are various components.”\n\nGiants Stadium, which once stood in the complex, was home to a series of World Cup soccer games in 1994.

It hosted WrestleMania 29 in 2013, the Super Bowl in 2014, and the Copa America Centenario soccer series in 2016, in which the final set the record for the most-attended soccer game in New Jersey, with 82,026.\n\nLast summer, the stadium hosted the International Champions Cup soccer game. In 2021, on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, it will host the annual Army-Navy football game.\n\n“We have proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that the stadium and the team there, along with the region, has the ability to host some of the biggest events in the world, which we already have,” said Jim Kirkos, president of the Meadowlands Chamber of Commerce.\n\nKirkos recalled being on the host committee in 1994. “We are so much better suited now” to host a World Cup, he observed.\n\nWith the opening of the adjacent American Dream development, projected for 2019, the entertainment complex promises to keep attendees in New Jersey during their stay, Kirkos said.\n\nSoccer’s popularity has exploded, he said, noting that Major League Soccer has gone from being held in football facilities to having its own soccer-specific stadiums.\n\nKirkos said the prospect of bringing visitors to the Meadowlands means a boom for hotels, restaurants and regional businesses.\n\nStadiums must have at least 40,000 seats for a group stage match, and a capacity of at least 80,000 to be considered for the opening and final matches, the joint committee bid specifications say.\n\nHasenbalg said it’s ideal to host a final or semi-final, as those are the big matches.\n\nGiants Stadium saw upwards of 70,000 fans at each of the five games it hosted during the 1994 World Cup.\n\nMetLife Stadium was named the Venue of the Year for 2016 at the Stadium Business Awards earlier this year. In 2016, the stadium hosted 20 NFL games, 41 non-NFL events and 210 special events that drew nearly 3 million fans. Among those special events were 11 concerts, the most in any stadium in the United States.\n\nThe United 2026 committee noted that the 2026 World Cup will be the first with an expanded 48-team format. After FIFA receives the bids, it will select 12 venues through the course of the next two years.\n\n“If the United Bid is selected by FIFA as the host for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, at least 12 cities will be selected as venues for games. Canada, Mexico and the United States have a long and successful history as hosts — 13 FIFA events have been hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States, five of which set attendance records,” the United 2026 website reads.\n\nThe joint committee is scheduled to submit its official bid by the March 16 deadline. It is expected to include 20 to 25 venues in the United States, Mexico and Canada.\n\nFIFA will announce its final decision at the 2018 FIFA Congress in Moscow this June.\n\nHasenbalg said bringing the World Cup to the Meadowlands will not happen overnight.\n\n“It’s a multi-year process, with different milestones along the way that we will be involved in, advancing our various interests,” he said. “There are other events we will be announcing in the near future, where we’ve been hand-in-hand partners with MetLife Stadium in trying to attract those events and with the Chamber.”\n\nThe New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority board will vote on Thursday whether to authorize NJSEA staff to continue with the process of joining the bid.\n\nEmail: grantm@northjersey.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2024/02/04/hard-rock-stadium-lands-2026-world-cup-quarterfinal-consolation-rodney-barreto-miami-dolphins-fifa/72473440007/", "title": "Hard Rock Stadium lands 2026 World Cup quarterfinal, consolation", "text": "Hard Rock Stadium was awarded seven matches of the 2026 FIFA World Cup on Sunday including a quarterfinal and the consolation match.\n\nIn June and July of 2026, the Dolphins’ home also will be the site of four first-round matches, plus a match in the new round-of-32 knockout stage, which becomes necessary as FIFA expends the field to 48 teams. Hard Rock’s matches will run from Monday, June 16, to Saturday, July 18.\n\n“We’re ecstatic,” said Rodney Barreto, co-chair of the Miami Host Committee with Beau Ferrari of NBCUniversal. “It’s going to be exciting for football fans. And it's a whole new level for South Florida and Miami.”\n\nMetLife Stadium, home of the New York Jets and Giants, was awarded the final on July 19.\n\nThe United States is co-hosting the tournament with Canada and Mexico. The opening match of the tournament will be June 11 in Mexico City’s historic Azteca Stadium.\n\n“We will put on the biggest spectacle the universe has ever seen,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said.\n\nMatchups for each stadium won’t be known until late next year, after qualifying is completed, although the United States will play all three of its group matches on the West Coast. Los Angeles’ SoFi Stadium was awarded the opening match for the U.S. team. Ticket information also is to be announced. Fans can pre-register for tickets at FIFA.com.\n\nSunday’s announcement caps a local wait that began in June 2022 when FIFA revealed that Hard Rock was selected as a site. The level of matches assigned was not surprising. Before the 2018 World Cup in Russia, FIFA released an evaluation report on all cities and regions competing to host matches. Hard Rock Stadium’s “highest proposed match category” was listed as “quarterfinal or third place.” So from that point of view, Sunday was a double victory for Miami Gardens.\n\nBarreto is no stranger to organizing such events. He’s a third-time chairman of the South Florida Super Bowl Host Committee, most recently serving in that capacity for the February 2020 game at Hard Rock. Because of the intense global interest in the World Cup, he now faces the challenge of staging seven mega sporting events, not one, over a five-week span.\n\n“We’ve always come up to the challenges, so we’d like a good challenge,” Barreto said. “We can’t just do the same thing. I’m sure we’ll all come together and it’ll work out.”\n\nCo-chair Rodney Barreto: This will be a regional event\n\nFIFA knows ticket demand will far exceed supply, so it’s requiring hosts to include events for fans without tickets, similar to the NFL’s Super Bowl Experience.\n\n“We'll have all kinds of activations throughout the community,” Barreto said. “And we'll make sure the fans feel like they're part of it. But yes, that is a concern. But it's one that all these major events have.”\n\nBarreto plans to include the entire tri-county area, although he pointed out he already has had his arm twisted to not forget about Monroe County.\n\n“This is going to be a regional event,” Barreto said. “It’s got to be. All the regions are going to benefit from it through the airports, hotels, transportation, restaurants. It’s phenomenal.”\n\nTom Garfinkel, vice chairman, president and CEO of the Dolphins and the stadium, called the inclusion of Miami in the world’s largest sporting event “an incredible moment for Miami-Dade County.” Argentina’s victory in the last Cup final was seen by nearly 1.5 billion.\n\nJoe Robbie's vision for stadium is realized\n\nThis culminates a dream of original Dolphins owner Joe Robbie, who built the stadium with his own money not just for the Dolphins, but with the World Cup in mind. The other World Cup in the United States, in 1994, bypassed Miami in favor of Orlando because of scheduling conflicts with the Marlins.\n\nAt one point, Garfinkel made a pitch to FIFA for the final, but the three regions considered for that honor — Dallas, Los Angeles and New York/New Jersey — have facilities considerably larger than Hard Rock.\n\nThe third-place match offers players a final shot at earning a World Cup medal and sometimes is more free-flowing than the pressure-packed final. Since 2002, the consolation match has averaged 3.7 goals, with Croatia beating Morocco 2-1 in the 2022 edition in Qatar.\n\nThe first-round matches at Hard Rock are scheduled for June 16 (a Monday), June 21 (Sunday), June 24 (Wednesday) and June 26 (Friday). The round-of-32 match will be on July 3 (Friday), the quarterfinal on July 11 (Saturday) and the consolation on July 18 (Saturday).\n\nSince Dolphins training camp typically begins in late July, there should be no conflicts with the team even if World Cup sides use the complex for training.\n\nHard Rock Stadium also will host matches in this summer’s Copa America tournament, including the final on July 14.\n\nDolphins reporter Hal Habib can be reached at hhabib@pbpost.com.

But his participation could be limited in the match.\n\nInter Miami also has four more games in a 10-day stretch to wrap the month of September, with three home matches at DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida – where Messi could either come off the bench or leave matches early depending on his participation.\n\nInter Miami will host Toronto on Sept. 20 and visit Orlando City on Sept. 24, and host the New York City FC on Sept. 30. Inter Miami will also host the U.S. Open Cup final against Houston on Sept. 27.\n\nMessi already missed Inter Miami’s 3-2 victory against Sporting Kansas City last Saturday at DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale.

We see as it goes.”\n\nHis playing fate was decided hours before Tuesday’s match at the Estadio Hernando Siles in La Paz, Bolivia, as Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni alluded to in a press conference Sunday.\n\nHow did Leo Messi perform in Argentina’s 1-0 win over Ecuador?\n\nMessi delivered in a big way for fans in his home country last week.\n\nMessi – playing in his first game with Argentina since the 2022 World Cup final – scored a free kick in the 78th minute to lead Argentina to a 1-0 win over Ecuador at Estadio Más Monumental in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nMessi scored in patented fashion, his left boot finding the left side of the net and leaving Ecuadorian goalkeeper Hernán Galíndez cowering down to one knee after the score.\n\nHow will Argentina fare in 2026 World Cup qualifying?\n\nArgentina is expected to reach the World Cup again.\n\nArgentina has three points in Conmebol qualifying, following its win over Ecuador.

It’ll happen when it happens,” Messi said when asked about retiring during an interview broadcast on Argentine television in July. “After winning everything I want to enjoy the moment and wait for time to tell me when it's the moment.\n\n\"Logically, given my age, one would expect it to be soon, but I don't know for sure.”\n\nWhile Messi’s World Cup final was expected to be his last World Cup game, Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said in January “the door will always be open\" for the country’s biggest star.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/worldcup/2022/10/22/uswnt-potentially-clear-path-third-consecutive-world-cup-soccer-title/10574651002/", "title": "USWNT have potentially clear path to third consecutive World Cup title", "text": "The U.S. women's soccer team could have a relatively straightforward path to a third consecutive, and fifth overall, World Cup title.\n\nDrawn into Group E on Saturday for next summer’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, the Americans would not see European champion England, Olympic gold medalist Canada, two-time World Cup winner Germany or France until the finals. Spain, which routed the USWNT in a friendly earlier this month, and old foe Sweden are on the same side of the bracket, but the Americans aren’t likely to see either until the semifinals.\n\nSo long as the USWNT wins the group, that is, which includes a rematch with the Netherlands, their opponent in the 2019 World Cup final.\n\nNEVER MISS A MOMENT: Follow our sports newsletter for daily updates\n\n2026 WORLD CUP: 16 North American cities will host games\n\n“We’ve got a good but somewhat tough draw. I’m excited about it,” U.S. coach Vlatko Andonovski said on FS1 after the draw, which took place in Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nThe Americans open the tournament July 22 against Vietnam, a team it’s never played. They then face the Netherlands on July 27 and wrap up group play on Aug. 1 against the winner of a February playoff involving Portugal, Thailand and Cameroon.\n\nThe travel schedule is also favorable to the Americans’ title hopes. The tournament is being played in both Australia and New Zealand, but the U.S. women could have all but one game in New Zealand until the final in Sydney on Aug. 20.\n\n“We started preparing for the World Cup a long time ago. Now when we know the opponents, it’s digging deep, getting into details,” Andonovski said. “It’s not just preparing for the World Cup, we’re preparing for the opponents, as well.”\n\nThis will be the first women’s tournament with 32 teams, a sign of the game’s growing strength. But it will also make for some mismatches – think that 13-0 drubbing of Thailand in the USWNT’s group-stage opener four years ago – and some obvious choices to advance.\n\nIn Group E, that will be the U.S. women and the Netherlands. In addition to beating the Netherlands 2-0 in the 2019 final, the Americans outlasted the Dutch on penalty kicks in the quarterfinals of the Tokyo Olympics last summer.\n\n“I don’t see this as a rematch of any of those matches,” Andonovski said. “We are bringing a different group, they are going to have a slightly different lineup, as well. Even though it’s going to be a good game, it’s going to be a good matchup, it’s going to be a good show, it’s not going to be a rematch of any of the previous games.”\n\nShould the Americans win Group E, they would play the second-place team in Group G, likely Italy. That would set up a quarterfinal match likely against either Japan or Norway, and a semifinal match possibly against either Spain or Sweden.\n\nBut if the USWNT finishes second to the Netherlands in the group stage, the path to an unprecedented three-peat gets a lot tougher. It would mean the Americans would likely face Sweden in the round of 16.\n\nThe USWNT has played Sweden more times at the Olympics and World Cup than any other opponent, including being in the same group at the last five World Cups and last summer’s Olympics. Sweden dominated the Americans 3-0 in that opener in Tokyo, setting the tone for unsettled performances throughout the Olympics that resulted in a bronze medal.\n\nIt also was Sweden that ousted the Americans in the quarterfinals of the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, the USWNT’s earliest exit ever at a major tournament.\n\n“We have a lot of work to do in the next year,” Lindsey Horan said on the post-draw show on FS1. “We obviously come off these two (losses) against England and Spain (this month), and you see the competitiveness, you see the game changing and how the game is evolving.\n\n“We lost two games,” she added. “Of course you can talk about all the players that were missing and whatnot, but we need to be better.

The first permanent addition to the Coke lineup in three years is laced with flavors of raspberry and spice, according to Coke, and comes in both regular and zero sugar variations.\n\n\"It’s Coca-Cola, only spiced,\" says Coke about the new flavor. \"Coca-Cola Spiced transforms the familiar into the extraordinary, blending the iconic taste of Coca-Cola with a burst of refreshing notes from raspberry and spiced flavors.\"\n\nThe new offering is \"Coke’s boldest tasting brand innovation yet,\" says the company about the new flavor, adding that the drink is not necessarily spicy but provides an \"uplifting taste experience unlike any other.\"\n\nWhen does Coca-Cola Spiced come out?\n\nCoca-Cola Spiced will be hitting shelves at retailers across the country on Feb. 19.\n\nWhat does Coke Spiced taste like?\n\nCoke Spiced includes notes of raspberry and an aromatic blend of spices, as per Coke. In the regular Coke variant, the raspberry flavor takes dominance while the spices go undetected in the first few sips. You really have to focus on each sip to pick up the spicy notes. Coke has not revealed what spices have been included in the drink, which makes it even harder to tell.\n\nHowever, in Coke Spiced Zero Sugar, the flavor of Coke Zero Sugar itself is more prominent with the notes of raspberry somewhere in the background and the spice blend barely felt.\n\nSuper Bowl LVIII:The cost of hosting a watch party.

It’s not about to tell you what’s in its new limited-time flavors, either.\n\nOver the past several months, Coca-Cola has rolled out a number of curious products: Coca-Cola Starlight, Byte and Dreamworld. For each of the limited-time flavors, the beverage company offered high-concept descriptions of an experience, rather than specific flavors. For Coke, the mystery is the point.\n\n“We’re engaging with people,” said Selman Careaga, global category president of Coca-Cola Trademark, which includes Coke drinks but not other Coca-Cola products like Fanta, Sprite or others. “They’re interacting with us, and they’re trying to guess what’s in it.”\n\nGetting people talking is an important marketing strategy for Coke, especially if it can spark interest among young consumers.\n\nRecently, Coca-Cola has been “really trying to encourage consumers to debate” over their products, noted Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest. When the company unveiled its new Coke Zero recipe, for example, it encouraged customers to decide whether it was the “best Coke ever.” And it’s been selling mystery Fanta flavors as part of its “What the Fanta?” campaign.\n\nStarlight is inspired by space.

Coca-Cola (KO) wants people who engage in these discussions, or see them online, to think about Coke when they walk into a store, noted Stanford.

Each comes with a dedicated online experience. Together, they’re designed to capture the attention of a coveted demographic: Gen Z.\n\nCotton Candy, Creamsicles or Bubblegum?\n\nInstead of a traditional flavor like “vanilla” or “cherry,” Coca-Cola provided each product with its own vague description, and let fans fill in the blanks.\n\nThe company described Starlight as having “notes reminiscent of stargazing around a campfire, as well as a cooling sensation that evokes the feeling of a cold journey to space.” Byte “invites you to explore what pixels might taste like,” and Dreamworld is somehow even more conceptual, promising consumers that they will “experience the familiar Coca-Cola taste now with a surprising and unexpected flavor from a dream world.”\n\nYouTubers reviewing the product groaned over the cheesy advertising, but still tried to puzzle out the taste, encouraging commenters to weigh in.\n\nGuesses were all over the map: Some thought that Starlight tastes like cotton candy, funnel cake or S’mores. After trying Byte, some guessed blueberry or grapefruit. People said that Dreamworld tasted of mango, peach or orange. Or maybe cough syrup.\n\nSome brands roll out mystery flavors, but reward customers with a reveal. Mountain Dew has made a tradition of releasing a secret VooDew flavor, and eventually telling customers what it is. Coca-Cola’s Fanta flavors will be unveiled, as well.\n\nBut Starlight, Byte and Dreamworld’s flavors are staying in the vault, said Careaga.\n\n“In a way, [it’s] like our secret formula,” he said. And in this case, the flavors aren’t really the point.\n\nTargeting Gen Z\n\nCoca-Cola didn’t share sales figures for these products. But it is pleased with the results so far, said Careaga. Efforts like the mystery flavors have contributed to sales growth in Coke drinks overall, he said. Trademark Coke grew 7% in the second quarter.\n\nThe beverages were developed to fit into the broader themes of space, computing and dreams, respectively. But the flavors themselves? Not so important.\n\n“It’s really not so much about the taste of the product, but really around the experiences that we create,” he said. Those experiences are often virtual, intending to capture a younger audience that spends lots of time online.\n\nEach of the limited-time flavors was launched among a slew of digital experiences. To name a few: Starlight’s can featured a QR code that granted customers access to a holographic Ava Max concert. Byte was launched in Fortnite, and Dreamworld customers could buy virtual merchandise for their online avatars.\n\nWhat is important, however, is that every Coke product tastes like a Coke.\n\n“The R&D team does a great job [of] developing these new flavors, which are Coca-Cola based, but then we kind of play a little bit with the taste.” Careaga said. “Without a doubt, it’s a Coca-Cola product.”\n\nDeveloping new Coke flavors can be risky if they stray too far from the signature flavor, Stanford noted.\n\n“When you create these formulas that could be hit or miss, you’ve got to be very careful,” Stanford said. “The longevity of the brand has been all about that very unique Coke taste,” he added. “You want to make sure you don’t undermine that long-term message.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/business/coca-cola-new-flavor/index.html", "title": "Coke's latest flavor is here.

It’s “the Coca-Cola taste you know and love with bright elements upfront and refreshing with the finish,” she said.\n\nByte is the second beverage — after Starlight — from Coca-Cola Creations, the company’s new innovation division.\n\nThe company decided to discontinue half of its portfolio a few years ago, dropping some outdated but beloved drinks including Tab. Since then the soda giant has been focusing on promoting its core product, Coke.\n\n\"Byte\" is supposed to taste like pixels. Coca-Cola\n\nThat means coming up with creative, limited-time flavors and rolling out intriguing marketing campaigns to promote them. It also means letting customers puzzle over what some of these new flavors actually taste like.\n\nThe reaction to Starlight has been very good, according to Vlad. “We are seeing lots of discussion and speculation about its mysterious space flavor,” she said.\n\n“Our fans are intrigued — they love the playful novelty,” she added. “The abstract nature of the flavor descriptions offers an opportunity for debate and discussion.”\n\nIn other words, the weird flavors are inspiring some buzz.\n\nBeverages launched by Coca-Cola creations are also served up with marketing campaigns that cater to customers who love to be online. The push for “Starlight,” for example, featured a holographic concert by pop star Ava Max which could be accessed by a QR code on the drink’s label.\n\nWith “Byte” it’s all about gaming.\n\nAppealing to gamers\n\n“Byte” existed online before it did in real life: The product appeared globally in late March on an island in the video game Fortnite. The island, named Pixel Point, was created by Coca-Cola and its partner PWR, which creates virtual experiences within Fortnite.\n\nPlayers who arrive at Pixel Point can play different games, including one which takes place inside a classic glass Coke bottle.\n\nOnce customers get their hands on a can of Byte in the real world, they’ll be able to play an augmented reality game by scanning the pixelated label with their phones.\n\nBeverage brands have long been advertising directly to gamers, but with more companies jumping on the bandwagon, the competition is heating up.\n\n“We believe it’s important to be present in the spaces where gamers play,” Vlad said, noting that “Coca-Cola has long supported the gaming community.” The company has a partnership with video game developer Riot Games.\n\nUS customers can buy Byte online starting May 2 while supplies last.

Creations is a way for Coca-Cola to shine a spotlight on its core product, while trying to bring gamers and younger audiences into the fold.\n\nA few years ago, Coca-Cola cut its portfolio in half, ditching beloved products like Tab.

Coca-Cola\n\nThat may well be the case, but beverage brands — including Coke — have long advertised directly to gamers. Red Bull has been active in the e-sports world for years, Monster Energy made waves when it appeared prominently in the game Death Stranding and PepsiCo (PEP) has even developed a product called Mountain Dew Game Fuel specifically for gamers.\n\n“We believe it’s important to be present in the spaces where gamers play,” Vlad said, noting that “Coca-Cola has long supported the gaming community.” The company has a partnership with video game developer Riot Games.\n\nThe beverage’s Fortnite debut is another sign of how brands are using video games to market their products directly to gamers.\n\nFood brands make their move\n\nSnack makers are “definitely underrepresented” when it comes to advertising to gamers, said Caleb Bryant, associate director of food and drink at Mintel.\n\nBut that’s starting to change. Virtual billboards for Cap’n Crunch have popped up in several games. Lunchable logos show up in Roblox. And Heinz-sponsored rest areas can be found in Call of Duty.\n\nIt’s still early days, but the food makers think this strategy has big upside.\n\nKraft Heinz (KHC), which owns Heinz condiments, Lunchables, Oscar Mayer and other brands, has started to think more deliberately about how to advertise to gamers, said Sanjiv Gajiwala, the company’s US Chief Growth Officer. Last year marked “the initiation of our marketing transformation,” he said, including “getting involved in gaming in more intentional ways.”\n\nIn December, Heinz launched an ad campaign within the first-person shooter game Call of Duty. Here’s the gist: Taking a snack break can open players up to attack by opponents. So Heinz paired up with the game’s designers to set up safe spots in the virtual world, where players’ avatars could hide out while they take a quick bite.\n\nA Roblox avatar races in a Lunchables kart within the Lunchables Racing game in Roblox. Courtesy Luncheables\n\nAround the same time, Lunchables launched a branded game within the kids gaming platform Roblox.\n\n“It’s really important for us to recognize that gaming is more pervasive and is an important part of culture today,” said Gajiwala.\n\nAs evidence of the relevance of gaming, Gajiwala pointed to Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, creator of Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft and more. The tech company announced in January that it would pay nearly $70 billion for the gaming firm, even though Activision and its controversial CEO had been accused of fostering a toxic work environment.\n\nThe Microsoft acquisition is just one piece of the puzzle. Globally, consumer spending on games, including subscriptions and in-app purchases, hit $180.3 billion in 2021, according to Newzoo, an gaming-industry analytics company. Newzoo predicts that spending will grow to $218.8 billion in 2024.\n\nAnd it’s not just current gamers spending more cash — more people are becoming gamers, too. According to Newzoo, the number of people who said they played games on computers, consoles or mobile devices in the last six months grew 5.3% globally in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nBut for some big snack makers, including PepsiCo, gaming is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nWelcome to the metaverse\n\nAs gaming evolves, so does the food giants’ approach in advertising to gamers, said Adam Harter, SVP of media, sports and entertainment at PepsiCo.\n\n“There was a point in time where we would look at a brand like Mountain Dew and say, ‘well, Mountain Dew is the best fit for a gaming platform. So Mountain Dew is going to be the brand that we go to market and advertise around gaming,’” he said. “That’s not the way we do it anymore. Now, for virtually all of our brands, this is a must-have component of our media communication strategy.”\n\nPepsiCo began marketing more products to gamers in earnest about three years ago, said Harter. In 2021, it worked with Anzu, an in-game advertising company, to place ads for Cap’n Crunch in several games. It has also promoted Doritos, Ruffles potato chips and, of course, Mountain Dew in those virtual spaces.\n\nFor Harter, it’s not enough to market more products to gamers in general. PepsiCo also has to reach different types of gamers.\n\n“Gaming has exploded to such a massive audience,” he said. “It’s not just about those competitive gamers … I see this now as an opportunity to become more surgical in how we reach consumers.”\n\nHe also sees gaming as an entry point to the next wave of the web.\n\nGaming is “really the springboard into this new phenomenon we call the metaverse,” he said. “As people live their lives in the metaverse on a more daily basis over the next few years … it’s critical for brands like ours to make sure we are where those consumers are living their lives.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2023/01/13/starry-pop-pepsis-lemon-lime-soda/11046280002/", "title": "Starry soda: Pepsi's latest strike at Sprite in the soft drink wars", "text": "Sierra Mist is being sidelined again.

Over the years Dr Pepper has found success as a quirky alternative to Coke and Pepsi.\n\nToday, Dr Pepper is hardly a scrappy underdog — it’s the hero brand in Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) which, along with Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP), make up the three largest soda companies in the $37 billion US market, as measured by NielsenIQ in retail and convenience stores.\n\nAnd recently, Dr Pepper has been gaining ground on its competitors, even as the overall soda market goes flat.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper is the third-largest soda maker in the country. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDr Pepper soda grew its dollar share by 9% from 2003 to 2021, compared to a 26% drop in the carbonated soft drinks category overall, according to Keurig Dr Pepper, citing IRI and the Beverage Digest factbook. Today, Dr Pepper is the fourth most popular soda in the country after Coke, Pepsi and Mountain Dew.\n\n“Over the past 20 years, carbonated soft drinks have been declining in volume,” said Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest. “One of the bright spots … has been Dr Pepper.”\n\nFounded in 1885 in Waco, Texas, Dr Pepper was the first in a wave of 19th-century upstart soda companies. (It dropped the period in the 1950s for design reasons.) The little brand rose to prominence in the latter half of the 20th century and helped shape the soda industry, all while cultivating its reputation as an outsider.\n\nThe early days of Dr Pepper\n\nThe drink was invented by Charles Alderton, a pharmacist at a drug store owned by Wade Morrison, who is credited with patenting the drink and naming it.\n\nLegend has it that Morrison named the beverage after one Charles Pepper, the father of a woman he loved, hoping that the gesture would facilitate a match. That’s the tale on the Dr Pepper website. But Joy Summar-Smith, associate director of the Dr Pepper Museum in Waco, said there are several origin stories, and this one doesn’t hold up.\n\n“By the time [Morrison] came across Dr. Pepper he was married and he had a son,” said Summar-Smith.\n\nCoca-Cola was created in 1886. Pepsi was invented in the 1890s, but got its name in 1898.\n\n“The soft drink industry itself, as a whole, was still really trying to figure itself out in the late 1800s, early 1900s,” Summar-Smith said. “Each town had their own soft drink manufacturing facility.”\n\nCoca-Cola established itself most quickly, aided by its invention of the coupon, which offered free samples of its new beverage. Pepsi positioned itself as a less expensive competitor to Coke.\n\nAds for Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola on a store in North Carolina, in April 1938. John Vachon/Everett/Shutterstock\n\nWhile Coke and Pepsi were making waves, Dr Pepper “just didn’t push it that hard,” said Tristan Donovan, author of “Fizz: How Soda Shook Up the World.”\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Dr Pepper encouraged customers to drink a Dr Pepper three times a day, at around 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., to keep their energy up. While successful, the campaign never focused on the product’s unique, non-cola flavor.\n\nIn the 1950s, Dr Pepper branded itself “the friendly Pepper-Upper,” once again focusing on the rush of energy you could get from any can of soda.\n\nThen, everything changed.\n\nNot a cola\n\nIn the early 20th century, national bottlers that worked with with Coke or Pepsi shied away from Dr Pepper, fearing they would run afoul of agreements that barred them from partnering with a competitor. As a result, Dr Pepper had little national distribution, focusing primarily on Texas and nearby states.\n\nIn the 1960s, PepsiCo sued Dr Pepper for trademark infringement. Dr Pepper countered, accusing Pepsi of denying the beverage entry to its distribution platform. In 1963, a judge ruled for the bottler, opening the door to the product’s national expansion.​​\n\nDr Pepper “pulled off a legal coup that gave it the necessary leg up: It argued effectively in a US District Court that Dr Pepper was not a cola,” a 1984 article in D Magazine explained. Or as the Federal Trade Commission put it, “the suit opened up PepsiCo and Coca-Cola bottlers to Dr Pepper and its sales rose immediately.”\n\nWith new-found access to the whole country, the brand “started promoting [itself] much more heavily,” said Donovan, the author of “Fizz.”\n\nThrough the 1970s, Dr Pepper marketed itself to a national audience as a unique flavor, a shift that D Magazine said “fleshed out an identity for Dr Pepper that may be its most formidable asset.” In 1977, the company launched its “Be a Pepper” campaign, encouraging people to identify as Dr Pepper drinkers.\n\nThe \"Be a Pepper\" campaign ran from 1977 to 1983. Courtesy Keurig Dr Pepper\n\nToday, Dr Pepper advertises itself as a treat, using a pint-sized mascot called Lil’ Sweet in its commercials. Another campaign, Fanville, is set in a fictionalized world where people are obsessed with college football and also Dr Pepper, positioning the beverage as a cult favorite.\n\nAfter Dr Pepper established itself as an alternative to mainstream colas, it launched on a path that ultimately made it part of the country’s third-largest soft drink maker, Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\nDr Pepper hits the scene\n\nDuring the wave of mega-mergers in the 1980s, Coca-Cola tried to scoop up Dr Pepper.\n\nIn 1986, soon after PepsiCo announced its intention to purchase 7Up, Coca-Cola said it had agreed to acquire Dr Pepper. The plans would have made Coke and Pepsi the most formidable players in the market by far, the Los Angeles Times reported at the time.\n\nBut both Coke’s and Pepsi’s deals were blocked, as the FTC decided the beverages were similar enough to pose a possible antitrust threat.\n\nA whirlwind series of mergers, acquisitions and spinoffs ensued. Dr Pepper and 7Up merged in the late 1980s. Over the years, Cadbury Schweppes took stakes in the combined company and, eventually, full ownership of the brands. In 2008 Cadbury spun off its North American beverage division to create the Dr Pepper Snapple Group. A decade later, Keurig Green Mountain merged with that company, creating Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\nBottles of Dr. Pepper move down a production line at the Swire Coca-Cola bottling plant in Utah. George Frey/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDr Pepper, soda giant\n\nToday, KDP still trails behind Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, but it’s narrowing the gap.\n\nBy volume, Coca-Cola controlled about 40% of the US retail market in the first nine months of 2022, followed by PepsiCo with about 29% and Keurig Dr Pepper with roughly 25%, according to Beverage Digest’s data.\n\nCompared to the year before, PepsiCo’s share fell by 1%, while Keurig Dr Pepper’s ticked up. And over the years, the Dr Pepper brand has been gaining momentum while some of its competitors struggle. That might be because of consumers’ increasing interest in flavored soft drinks, said Stanford, the publication’s editor.\n\nThere are other advantages to existing outside of the cola dichotomy. Food-service providers typically have an agreement with either Coke or Pepsi for its soda fountains, and one fountain won’t feature products made by the other. But the fountains often offer Dr Pepper, making it a widely available choice.\n\n“Dr Pepper is the number one most differentiated trademark in beverage — not just soft drinks, but in beverage,” said Derek Dabrowski, general manager of juices, mixers and sauces at KDP. People reach for Dr Pepper when they want a treat, he added. That’s “where we have been winning.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2023/09/08/uaw-president-shawn-fain-reacts-to-new-ford-gm-stellantis-proposals/70798851007/", "title": "UAW President Shawn Fain trashes new Ford, GM, Stellantis ...", "text": "UAW President Shawn Fain took to Facebook Live on Friday night to tell autoworkers that contract counterproposals from the Detroit Three automakers were in the trash where they belong, gesturing to a bin behind him labeled \"Big Three Proposals.\"\n\n\"It's disgusting,\" Fain said, claiming that retirees have been left completely in the cold by the latest offers.\n\nThe UAW wants a \"significant increase\" for retirees, Fain said, but Ford Motor Co., General Motors and Stellantis have rejected all increases to retiree compensation.\n\nHe lined up written proposals on topics including wages, cost-of-living adjustments (COLA), job security, profit sharing, work-life balance and retiree benefits — and tore them to pieces as more than 11,000 viewers watched on camera, according to the viewer total appearing in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.\n\nWhen it comes to wages, the UAW wants them to keep up with inflation.

He added that while \"the cost of a strike might be high, the cost of doing nothing is much higher.\"\n\nFord: Scab accusation\n\nDuring his remarks on Facebook, Fain accused Ford of taking out loans and arranging for \"scabs\" to do the jobs of union employees as strike preparation. Ford has acknowledged arranging to keep some of its parts depots running with salaried workers, as first reported by the Detroit Free Press.\n\nIn response to Fain's strike prep claims about Ford on Friday, Enoch said in a statement: \"Our focus is on reaching a deal that rewards our employees, allows for the continuation of Ford’s unique position as the most American automaker and enables Ford to invest and grow. We are developing responsible contingency plans in the case of a work stoppage.

It’s the company’s third boozy beverage as it taps into the growing canned cocktail craze.\n\nIn a partnership between Molson Coors (TAP) and Coke, the companies are launching Simply Spiked Lemonade, an alcoholic drink inspired by the Simply brand’s fruit juice. Flavors include strawberry lemonade, watermelon lemonade, blueberry lemonade and regular lemonade. The alcohol will be derived from fermented sugar cane.\n\nMolson’s Chief Marketing Officer Michelle St. Jacques said there was a “big opportunity” for Simply because it’s a “powerful and beloved” product. “Simply is known for its bold flavor and real fruit juice and there’s a great opportunity to create a new brand (in the alcohol aisle),” she told CNN Business in an exclusive interview.\n\nSimply Spiked Lemonade is coming this summer. MolsonCoors\n\nSimply Spiked Lemonade will be sold in a variety of 12-pack of slim cans, which has 5% alcohol-by-volume, and 24-ounce standalone cans. Prices weren’t yet released, but it will go on sale this summer.\n\nDespite consumers shifting away from sugary drinks and juices, Molson is optimistic about the new product’s success because consumers are looking for bold flavors in the alcohol category.\n\nSimply is Coke’s second-biggest brand in the US, generating $1 billion in revenue, St. Jacques said. Coke credited the “solid performance” of Simply in its annual report, despite its juice, dairy and plant-based beverages unit declining 9% last year. Slowing juice sales prompted Pepsi to offload its Tropicana brand to a private equity firm in a multibillion dollar deal last year.\n\nSimply Spiked Lemonade joins Coke’s growing roster of alcoholic drinks leveraging its popular brands and looking for areas of growth. It recently revealed Fresca Mixed, a spirit-based cocktail, that will be released this summer in conjunction with Corona-maker Constellation. In 2020, Molson and Coke started selling Topo Chico hard seltzer and added a new tequila-based flavor, called Ranch Water, this year.\n\nReady-to-drink cocktail sales have exploded as drinkers look for convenience and new flavors beyond wine and beer. The beverage category grew 53% last year and is projected to grow another 29% over the next three years, according to data from IWSR Drinks Analysis.\n\nThe craze is overshadowing spiked seltzers. Following strong sales over the past few years, the low-calorie drinks have faded in popularity — and sales — as customers get bored with them. For Molson, sales of its hard seltzer brands have been performing well, but the company quietly discontinued Coors Seltzer last year to focus on its Topo Chico and Vizzy brands.\n\nCoke rival Pepsi (PEP)Co announced its entry into the alcohol market last year with “HARD MTN DEW,” a sugar-free canned beverage with 5% alcohol by volume that is being created with the Boston Beer Company (SAM).", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/01/09/mountain-dews-new-lemon-lime-flavor-takes-aim-sprite-7-up/1013756001/", "title": "Mountain Dew Ice: New lemon lime flavor takes aim at Sprite, 7up", "text": "You will now be able to do the Dew in a new flavor -- and the move could shake up the carbonated-beverage market.\n\nMountain Dew will launch its latest version, a lemon-lime soda called Mtn Dew Ice, on next Monday, PepsiCo announced.\n\nThe new drink treads on Coca-Cola’s turf with Sprite and Dr Pepper Snapple Group's 7Up. Like Sprite and 7Up, Mtn Dew Ice is clear. The original version is known for its iconic neon green color. There's one key difference, though. Mountain Dew's version has caffeine, an ingredient found in colas but mostly missing from the lemon-lime category.\n\nLemon-lime isn't a rapidly growing flavor. According to the Beverage Marketing, a consulting and research company, it represented 9.92% of carbonated soft drinks consumed in 2016, compared to 9.76% the year before and 11.33% in 1990, the farthest back its data goes.\n\nMore:PepsiCo deal shows companies not shying away from Redskins\n\nMore:Seattle's new tax on sugary drinks kicks in on New Year's Day\n\nMore:Craft soda makers add fizz to flat soft drink sales\n\nThe lemon-lime category has two core consumer groups -- parents who buy the drink at the supermarket for their family and multicultural Millennials looking for a refreshing beverage, said Roberto Rios, PepsiCo North America Beverages' senior vice president of marketing for carbonated soft drinks.\n\n\"What was missing was something that would give them a charge, like Dew does,\" he said. The charge comes from caffeine, a stimulant.\n\nBrett Cooper, a vice president at the New York-based boutique equity research firm Consumer Edge Research, said the Mountain Dew brand has been suffering a bit lately.\n\nA new flavor \"is consistent with what we’ve seen over years,\" he said. \"They have an innovation track record and the need to get Mountain Dew growing again.\"\n\nMtn Dew Ice is a permanent addition to the Mountain Dew line-up, like cherry Code Red and orange Live Wire. The company also creates limited-time varieties, like this summer's purple Dew-S-A and red Holiday Brew during the holiday season. Dewshine, introduced in 2015, is a craft soda -- clear in color, and citrus-flavored and made with real sugar.\n\nThat Mtn Dew would make a move was foreshadowed by PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi's comment during the company's analyst call in October.\n\n\"We underperformed the industry in carbonated beverages. This summer, we directed too much of our media spending and shelf space to new low-calorie, much smaller brands at the expense of our Pepsi and Mountain Dew trademarks,\" she said. \"We are stepping up marketing spending on Pepsi and Mountain Dew.\"\n\nDuring the third quarter, PepsiCo's North American beverages division's revenues were $5.33 billion, down 3% from $5.52 billion for the same period in 2016.\n\nPepsiCo's other big soda brand is its namesake Pepsi.\n\nMtn Dew Ice will come in 20-ounce and two-liter bottles and 12-ounce cans. The 20-ouncer has 167 calories and the can, 100, according to PepsiCo.

The toxic stew seeped down into the soil and migrated with the groundwater off the company's site, eventually vaporizing up through the soil into the basements of nearby homes, posing a health risk to residents.\n\nThe solvents remain today — more than 30 years after they were discovered, and after countless public meetings, debate and study — beneath homes and backyards where DuPont workers and other residents raised families, played with children and planted vegetable gardens.\n\nBut now, a trove of government documents and emails obtained by The Record and NorthJersey.com reveal for the first time how extensively DuPont — the chemical giant that gave the world non-stick pans, stain-resistant carpets, nylon and other ubiquitous products — worked behind the scenes for more than three decades to keep secret and then downplay the extent of overall contamination from the site and the potential health risks they posed.\n\nThe company pushed back against regulators and chose not to tell residents that the cancer-causing chemicals could be vaporizing up from the groundwater into their homes, those documents reveal.\n\nThe plume of chemicals remains largely unaddressed, even as many residents blame DuPont for elevated levels of cancer and for other illnesses in their neighborhood.\n\n\"This was our home, and they did this, and we were lied to — lied to,\" said Helen Martens, who moved to the Pompton Lakes neighborhood in 1977. \"I lost all faith in the law, and in our town elected officials, and DuPont. I couldn't believe they had done this to people.\n\n\"I love my home,\" the 72-year-old said. \"I just fear it.\"\n\nThe Record reviewed hundreds of state and federal government emails and 100 boxes filled with government documents, obtained through open records requests, and conducted more than 70 interviews with residents, regulators, lawyers and environmental experts.\n\nThe investigation reveals that:\n\nDuPont told residents in 1997 that vapors from cancer-causing solvents weren't entering homes – even though the company was aware of the potential for the solvents to vaporize and had not conducted tests beneath or inside any houses.\n\nthat vapors from cancer-causing solvents weren't entering homes – even though the company was aware of the potential for the solvents to vaporize and had not conducted tests beneath or inside any houses.

That prevented unsuspecting residents from acting on their own to protect themselves, while potentially breathing cancer-causing vapors in their homes.\n\nof vapor intrusion for seven years – from 2001 to 2008 – without informing the public, documents show. That prevented unsuspecting residents from acting on their own to protect themselves, while potentially breathing cancer-causing vapors in their homes. Even as residents were kept in the dark, regulators pushed DuPont to test for vapors. The company was \"adamantly opposed.\" Internal government documents show why: DuPont didn't want test results that could be used against the company by residents in an ongoing suit about other pollution from its Pompton Lakes facility.\n\nThen, as part of the settlement of that suit, DuPont required residents to sign a release that kept them from suing DuPont if additional pollution was discovered.\n\nOnly after those releases were signed did DuPont test for vapors. But when residents were finally told about the danger in their homes and tried to sue, a judge said those who signed the releases were out of luck.\n\nThe Record and NorthJersey.com's investigation also found:\n\nDocuments dating to 1979 show the company's behavior on the vapor intrusion issue was part of a larger, decades-long pattern in which DuPont obscured and then downplayed the extent of various toxic pollutants migrating off its property.\n\non the vapor intrusion issue was part of a larger, decades-long pattern in which DuPont obscured and then downplayed the extent of various toxic pollutants migrating off its property. Experts say it is hard to definitively link a particular polluted site to specific cases of cancer or other illness. Still, a door-to-door canvass by The Record of more than 50 households in the plume neighborhood identified many cases of various cancers that have been linked in studies to solvents that have been found in the plume, as well as other diseases, across multiple generations.\n\na particular polluted site to specific cases of cancer or other illness. Still, a door-to-door canvass by The Record of more than 50 households in the plume neighborhood identified many cases of various cancers that have been linked in studies to solvents that have been found in the plume, as well as other diseases, across multiple generations. A federal regulator told The Record she pushed to have the DuPont site added to the Superfund list so it could receive more federal money and contractor support, enjoy potentially quicker approvals for cleanup measures, and take into account public input. But state and local political leaders, including Bob Martin, the state's top environmental official under then-Gov. Chris Christie, blocked those efforts.\n\n\"It always seemed to me that the company was trying to slow-walk the problem,\" Judith Enck, former regional administrator of the federal Environmental Protection Agency during the Obama administration, said in a recent interview. \"They worked hard to pay as little money as possible and stretch it out over a long period of time, and sadly I think they are succeeding at that.\"\n\nThe delays at times generated expressions of frustration. At one point in 2007, for instance, Frank Faranca, a state regulator, emailed DuPont about vapor testing beneath homes: \"I find it increasingly hard to believe that it has taken this long to do the work. If you are truly trying to protect human health, it should not have taken this long.\"\n\nThe Pompton Lakes residents affected by the plume of vaporizing solvents are not alone.\n\nIn New Jersey and across the nation, vapor intrusion is a growing concern, and not only for newer contaminated sites that are just starting to be cleaned. Over the past decade, for instance, New York's environmental agency has revisited 147 legacy sites that had already been considered cleaned up to check for vapor intrusion.\n\nDuPont — which had a gross profit in 2016 of more than $10 billion — has spent money in Pompton Lakes over several decades to address some aspects of its legacy of pollution.\n\nA $50 million cleanup of Pompton Lake is underway to remove lead and mercury that washed into the lake sediment. DuPont also spent $70 million in the early 1990s to remove and replace soil tainted with lead and mercury from the backyards of homes that lined Acid Brook, a stream that runs through the DuPont property and through the adjacent neighborhood before it empties into Pompton Lake.\n\nDuPont spent nearly $40 million to settle lawsuits in connection with the mercury and lead contamination over the years, and offered a \"groundwater benefits program\" — payouts of $5,000 each to residents who promised not to sue the company.\n\nBut far less has been done to address the source of the vapor intrusion, which affects a much greater area.\n\nThe company built a $1.2 million pump-and-treat system to prevent more chemicals from leaving its property. And since 2008, DuPont has paid to install and cover the operating costs of venting systems intended to remove the harmful vapors from homes.\n\nStill, the underground plume of chemicals remains beneath 400 homes. One pilot study to test a method to treat the chemicals failed. A second controversial pilot study awaits state approval. There is no plan to buy out residents who have seen their property values plummet.\n\nDuPont declined to discuss its former operations in Pompton Lakes, referring all questions to Chemours, a spinoff it created in 2015. Chemours inherited about 170 contaminated DuPont sites nationwide, including the 600-acre Pompton Lakes site in Passaic County.\n\nChemours calls the Pompton Lakes cleanup challenging and said its goals ultimately mesh with those of residents.\n\n\"The remediation of a complex site like Pompton Lakes is a lengthy and complicated process,\" Chemours spokeswoman Robin Ollis Stemple said by email.\n\n\"While we all wish that this could be done more quickly, Chemours is committed to doing the work in a way that is thorough, science-based, protective of people and the environment and in accordance with all guidance\" provided by regulators.\n\n\"While this takes time, we believe this is the right approach for the Pompton Lakes community,\" she added. \"Ultimately, Chemours and the community have the same goal: to complete protective remediation and return the site to productive use.\"\n\nBut many wary residents — some of whom suffer from an array of illnesses — say they have been betrayed for decades by DuPont and let down by regulators and elected officials. They say they have no confidence the plume will be addressed. Some said they feel trapped, and want nothing more than to escape the neighborhood they once loved.\n\n\"I wind up with Stage 4 kidney failure,\" said longtime resident Ron Merlino. \"Guess what,\" he said. \"Buy our homes. Get us out of here. They should have got us out of here as soon as they knew we were getting poisoned in our own homes.\n\n\"It's time to go,\" Merlino added. \"I can't wait to get out.\"\n\nToday, more than three decades after regulators became aware toxic chemicals were migrating off the DuPont site, the plume of contamination remains unaddressed beneath more than 400 homes, making it one of the country's larger vapor intrusion sites.\n\nHere's how that happened.\n\nBecause it plays such an ominous role in their lives, some Pompton Lakes residents refer to the contaminated groundwater beneath their homes simply as \"The Plume.\"\n\nMany residents insist the plume of solvents has caused dozens of cases of brain, cervical, kidney and other cancers, as well as other illnesses.\n\nTheir argument was bolstered by a 2009 state health study that showed kidney cancer rates among women in the neighborhood were elevated and that non-Hodgkin lymphoma among men was elevated compared with the state average. New Jersey's rate of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in men is among the highest in the country.\n\nThe Health Department said in its 2009 study that while it could not definitively link the elevated cancer rates to solvents in the plume, \"the contaminants cannot be ruled out as a potential cause.\"\n\nWhen asked to comment on the array of illnesses among residents living above the plume, Chemours said in an email, \"It is an unfortunate fact that illnesses, including cancer, occur in all communities and neighborhoods in the state and the country.\"\n\nResidents say the plume has pushed down property values and prevented people from cashing in on life savings tied up in their homes.\n\nThe state first concluded solvents were migrating off the DuPont site and under homes as early as 1984, documents show. In 1988 the state and DuPont signed an agreement that required DuPont to drill monitoring wells to determine the extent of the plume — and to clean the contaminated groundwater.\n\nThe state Department of Environmental Protection called cleaning the plume a priority. Private wells in the neighborhood were the initial concern. Most were used to water lawns and fill swimming pools. But a few provided drinking water.\n\nRichard Marsh, a former DuPont employee and longtime resident, recalled a neighbor who had multiple dogs die from tumors.\n\n\"He fed them well water,\" Marsh said. \"My dogs never died of tumors. We used municipal water.\"\n\nThe solvents in the plume — TCE and PCE — belong to a group of chemicals called volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, which easily evaporate in the air. Private wells in the neighborhood, tested in 1985 and 1986, had volatile organic compounds as high as 5,592 parts per billion. One well had 408 parts per billion of PCE and 167 parts per billion of TCE.\n\nThe state drinking water limit for either of those solvents is 1 part per billion — the equivalent of one drop of solvent in an Olympic-size swimming pool — illustrating their potency.\n\nGiven the health concern, DuPont had the wells disconnected and the homes hooked up to municipal water.\n\nNot until 2001 — 17 years after the plume was identified — did regulators first mention in private exchanges with DuPont about the potential for the plume to be a health threat to residents through toxic vapors seeping into homes.\n\nVapor intrusion occurs when contaminants in the groundwater turn to vapor, move up through tiny spaces in the soil and enter basements through cracks in foundations or openings for utility lines.\n\nScientists have known about the threat for decades.\n\nTests for toxic vapors were conducted at the infamous Love Canal in upstate New York in the mid-1980s, and a few years later, vapor intrusion tests were conducted in residential areas of Rochester, New York, near a contaminated Kodak facility.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the federal Environmental Protection Agency issued some guidance on dealing with vapor intrusion at Superfund sites.\n\nNew Jersey was among the first states to focus on it. The state issued guidance in 1999 to test indoor air. The science was evolving rapidly, said John Boyer, a vapor intrusion expert with the state. Over the next few years the EPA and state Department of Environmental Protection put out new guidance on how to handle vapor intrusion, reflecting the evolving science.\n\nDuPont was aware of the potential for the solvents in the Pompton Lakes plume to vaporize into homes as early as 1997, documents show. But they told residents it wasn't happening, even though they had not tested the air in homes, or the soil underneath.\n\nHere is an excerpt from a letter DuPont sent residents in September 1997:\n\n\"… in addition to monitoring the groundwater plume, DuPont has also investigated the potential for vapor emissions to occur from the plume. (M)easurements … provide no indication of vapor migration.\"\n\nBut the measurements weren't taken under or inside people's homes. They were conducted in an old dry well on DuPont's former property.\n\n\"As far as the assumptions they were making, the science really wasn't there,\" said Boyer, the state vapor intrusion expert. \"There was no basis for us to disagree, I guess, at that point. But as time went on, the science got better, and as we moved forward we started recognizing this was more of a problem than we may have anticipated.\"\n\nChemours, in an email to The Record, said the best environmental investigation practice requires sampling \"where concentrations are likely to be highest,\" and the old well site was in the direct path of the groundwater flowing from the DuPont site \"where contamination would be expected to be highest.\"\n\nChemours also said \"the science of understanding vapor intrusion continued to evolve after 1997.\" It noted that DuPont conducted tests in the plume neighborhood from 2003 to 2005, though not under or inside homes.\n\n\"The data collected up to that point indicated that there was no vapor intrusion pathway,\" Chemours said.\n\nThough residents would be told nothing about vapor intrusion until 2008 — more than a decade after DuPont's 1997 letter — internal DEP and EPA emails and documents show that as early as March 2001 the regulators worried that vapors could be a health risk.\n\nIt took seven years for residents to be alerted.\n\nBecause the state at the time had little regulatory power on vapor intrusion, they relied on the federal EPA's push.\n\n\"We did not have the regulatory gun in a holster,\" said DEP spokesman Larry Hajna.\n\nAt a meeting in March 2001, regulators told DuPont that vapor intrusion \"must be addressed.\"\n\nAnd an EPA document a few months later noted that because the solvents were detected in elevated levels in monitoring wells in the neighborhood, \"indoor air may be of concern at off-site locations in the residential community.\"\n\nThe issue should be investigated, the report said.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nMore than a year later, in March 2003, DuPont and the regulators held a private meeting, documents show. The regulators underscored that \"there are potential impacts of the plume on people in the residential houses … through indoor air.\"\n\nBut that message was not conveyed to the residents.\n\n\"The public has a right to know about a problem,\" Enck, the former EPA regional administrator, said in a recent interview.\n\n\"I think it's crucial for government regulatory agencies but also for big companies to share information early,\" said Enck, who left the EPA in January 2017 after seven years. \"Unfortunately that didn't happen here.\"\n\nInstead, DuPont made it clear to the agencies that the company opposed sampling homes in the plume. In April 2003, an EPA official noted in an internal email: \"DuPont to fight if indoor air sampling required.\"\n\nDuPont sent a report a few months later saying there was no vapor intrusion — a report that relied on the same 1996 test of the dry well on DuPont's former property.\n\nThe state disagreed.\n\nAn agency memo noted that samples from monitoring wells in the plume neighborhood found elevated levels of PCE and TCE, which indicated the need to test for vapor intrusion. The 2003 memo also questioned DuPont's assumptions.\n\nIt noted that other wells had not been tested since 1995, so \"it is questionable whether one can conclude … that the concentration levels in the off-site plume are decreasing.\"\n\n\"If you know there's contamination and it's inexpensive and easy to mitigate, then do it,\" said Lenny Siegel, executive director of the Center for Public Environmental Oversight, which advocates for victims of environmental pollution.\n\n\"If you can install mitigation systems, just do it,\" he said. \"If installed properly they are effective.\"\n\nChemours defended DuPont's decision not to alert residents about the potential for vapor intrusion until 2008.\n\n\"In 1997, the science of vapor transport from groundwater … (was) still developing,\" Chemours wrote. \"We understand that DuPont followed relevant, applicable guidance as it was developed by regulatory agencies over time, and that DuPont communicated with residents appropriately.\"\n\nThat explanation does not sit well with some plume residents.\n\n\"The safest thing obviously is to move the people out,\" said longtime resident Cheryl Rubino. \"They should not be exposed to the contamination. But for those who don't want to go — make them whole. It's not fair what's happened to these people. Their homes, their investments, their life savings are in their house. They will always need to disclose the contamination.\n\n\"Personally, I don't feel it's going to get cleaned up,\" Rubino said. \"I really don't. It's too difficult and too expensive. And there's going to be a very difficult and long haul, and it will not happen before my mother dies, and it will not happen before I die.\"\n\nDuPont adamantly opposed testing for cancer-causing vapors beneath the Pompton Lakes neighborhood because it didn't want the test results to become a cudgel the public could use against the chemical giant in court, documents and emails reviewed by The Record and NorthJersey.com show.\n\nAnd as DuPont pushed back against regulators, Pompton Lakes residents, unaware of the vapors potentially seeping into their homes, continued to use their basements to do laundry, check their computer email, play video games — all while potentially breathing in the dangerous vapors.\n\nDuring that seven-year period when the public was kept in the dark about the potential danger lurking beneath their homes, not only did DuPont resist regulators who had pressed for vapor tests — at times the regulators' own bungling exacerbated the delays, according to dozens of internal emails and government documents obtained by The Record and NorthJersey.com.\n\nDocuments show that DuPont was unhappy with the regulators from the state and the federal EPA for pushing to have vapor tests conducted.\n\nIn an August 2003 email to officials at the EPA's Region 2, which covers New Jersey, DuPont complained that \"generally we feel that Region II wants more documentation and investigations tha(n) we have experienced with other Regions.\"\n\nA month later, DuPont and the regulators met to discuss ways to test for vapor intrusion in the plume. An internal EPA memo, uncovered by The Record and NorthJersey.com through a public records request, summarized the meeting.\n\nIt noted that if the geology of the site made it impossible to use generic testing methods, DuPont would need to conduct air sampling beneath and inside plume homes, \"which DuPont has adamantly opposed. They are involved in several citizen suits and they are concerned that such an assessment could be detrimental to the cases.\"\n\nIn other words, DuPont told environmental officials that if the tests showed elevated levels of solvent vapors, that could be used against them in ongoing lawsuits related to other contaminants that had left DuPont's property.\n\nOne of those suits had been filed on behalf of Pompton Lakes residents in 1998.\n\nThe case, Agnes v. DuPont, focused on health impacts and falling home values allegedly caused by mercury and lead that had washed off the DuPont site and into backyards, brought there by Acid Brook. The case also looked at solvents that contaminated private wells.\n\nBut it didn't focus on vapor intrusion, since the public had not yet been told it was a concern.\n\nWhen DuPont settled the Agnes case, the public remained uninformed about the danger of vapor intrusion.\n\nThe settlement provided most residents $950, a third of which went to their lawyers. In exchange, DuPont required residents to sign a release in which they relinquished their right to sue DuPont in the future over any illness other than cancer related to contamination from DuPont's Pompton Lakes site.\n\nWhen they signed those releases, residents were still in the dark about the ongoing talks between regulators and DuPont about vapor intrusion.\n\nAfter DuPont told the public in 2008 that tests indicated vapor intrusion was occurring, residents filed another suit, this time focused on vapor intrusion.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Dennis M. Cavanaugh ruled that 113 of the residents had no standing to sue DuPont because they had signed the 2004 releases — even though they knew nothing about vapor intrusion at the time.\n\n\"We were basically told after the fact — after giving them amnesty, if you will, that, oh, by the way — there is contaminated groundwater under your home, there are gases that are potentially seeping through the cracks in your basement, and they are carcinogenic,\" recalled longtime resident Jefferson LaSala.\n\nDuPont declined to comment on any aspects of its Pompton Lakes operations for this series. Chemours, a spinoff company that inherited responsibility for 170 of DuPont's contaminated sites across the country, including Pompton Lakes, told The Record in an email that \"there was no effort\" by DuPont \"to delay testing\" in the plume because of the lawsuits.\n\nDelays abounded, however, lasting years. Emails show that some delays were caused by DuPont, and some by regulators.\n\nMeanwhile, residents continued to use their basements, unaware they could be breathing cancer-causing vapors.\n\n\"I worked on vapor intrusion in upstate New York 20 years ago — it's not brand new,\" Enck, the former EPA regional administrator overseeing New Jersey during the Obama administration, told The Record. \"One of the most basic things is you do indoor air samples to decide if there is a problem and need a widespread solution.\"\n\nAt the same time, the state DEP had only a handful of vapor intrusion cases by 2005. \"So there was no precedent, no standard approach,\" recalled John Boyer, the DEP's vapor intrusion expert. \"We sort of broke ground when it came to the DuPont case in how to go about doing things.\n\n\"We were sort of feeling our way through this process,\" Boyer said.\n\nAnd DuPont didn't help.\n\nThe company submitted multiple reports over several years using screening levels and other factors the regulators had already rejected as lax or inappropriate, stalling the agencies in the process.\n\n\"History shows that in the absence of an active community and regulators, most polluters will drag their feet,\" said Lenny Siegel, executive director of the Center for Public Environmental Oversight, which advocates for victims of environmental pollution. \"They will try to do study after study showing the contamination isn't as bad as everyone thought. They are responsible to their shareholders.\"\n\nIn their 2010 book \"The Polluters,\" authors Benjamin Ross and Steven Amter, scientists who ran an environmental consulting firm, wrote that \"one of the industry's common tactics can be summed up as ‘spill, study, and stall.' When outside pressure to do something about pollution became strong, a study of the problem would be launched as an alternative to expensive action.\"\n\nEnck agreed.\n\nCompanies such as DuPont \"know how to tie regulatory agencies in knots,\" she said. \"They spend money on scientists who just question everything an agency wants to do.\"\n\nWhile the DEP and EPA kept prodding DuPont to test for vapor intrusion in Pompton Lakes, at times the regulators themselves dropped the ball, inadvertently exacerbating DuPont's delay, and causing residents to be victims of bureaucratic bungling.\n\nFor instance, early in 2004 DuPont sent an email to the DEP asking it to approve some sampling procedures. When the EPA asked three months later for the test samples, DuPont said it hadn't conducted the tests because it never heard back from the state.\n\n\"We prefer feedback before we proceed,\" DuPont wrote.\n\nA DEP official countered that he never received DuPont's correspondence, and besides, he was overwhelmed with work. \"I have to keep switching between my other 17 hazardous waste sites, which leaves me little time to devote to any specific project,\" he wrote. \"If any one project becomes a high priority, that gets 100% of my attention, and everything else gets dropped.\"\n\nLater that day, he acknowledged that he found DuPont's earlier email.\n\n\"Since my desk is buried beneath a Solid Waste landfill, I could not determine if I got the document,\" he wrote, somewhat sarcastically.\n\nThe new sampling was scheduled for Aug. 9.\n\nOn Sept. 14, the EPA followed up, asking for results.\n\nOn Dec. 22, the EPA asked again for the results.\n\nMore than a week later, DuPont replied: \"We had some problems with the last set of samples.\"\n\nWhen samples were taken at seven homes in early 2008, results showed elevated levels of PCE in all seven, and elevated TCE in six.\n\nA hydrogeologist hired as an expert for resident plaintiffs in a 2010 court case said that, since the solvents had likely been in the groundwater since the 1940s, \"vapor intrusion must have also occurred in the neighborhood for decades.\"\n\nAfter the 2008 test results, DuPont installed vapor intrusion systems on more than 330 homes to suck the vapors out from beneath the foundations and release them into the outside air to dissipate. In 2014, tests at Lakeside Middle School, adjacent to the plume, did not detect toxic vapors above state safety standards.\n\nHowever, the source of those vapors — the plume of contamination in the soil — is still there, unaddressed. Chemours has proposed a new pilot study to flush water into the ground to create a barrier between the vapors and the homes, but residents worry it will raise the water table and flood their basements with contamination.\n\n\"We're dealing with a very affluent company that knows science,\" said Enck, the former EPA regional administrator. \"They make billions of dollars every year, and someone inside the company has to take a very close look at the toxic legacy here and decide to do something differently.\n\n\"I think we need a new set of experts inside the company addressing this, because the old way is not working,\" Enck said.\n\nShe urged New Jersey's new governor, Phil Murphy, to make the site a priority. \"I think the community members are raising very legitimate concerns,\" Enck said.\n\nThe test results showing vapor intrusion in Pompton Lakes came nearly eight years after regulators first started raising concerns to DuPont about the potential for vapor intrusion in the neighborhood.\n\nThey arrived 11 years after DuPont told residents vapor intrusion was not occurring in the plume.\n\nAnd it was nearly 25 years after state environmental officials first suspected solvents were migrating off the DuPont site and under adjacent homes.\n\nWhen DuPont told Pompton Lakes residents in June 2008 that vapor intrusion could be occurring in their homes, the company said it would pay to install vapor mitigation units on each home in the plume.\n\nThe systems work by sucking the toxic vapors out from under a home and sending them up through a pipe, which releases them to the outside air, allowing them to dissipate.\n\nThe vapors came from the cancer-causing solvents PCE and TCE, which had contaminated a plume of groundwater beneath about 400 homes. The solvents had migrated off DuPont's former munitions facility nearby, and had moved their way up through the soil and into some basements.\n\nDuring tests to determine the extent of vapor intrusion in the neighborhood, two-thirds of samples taken beneath homes showed that PCE levels exceeded the state standard of 16 parts per billion. Levels were as high as 6,800.\n\nSimilarly, a third of samples tested high for TCE. The state standard was 11 parts per billion. Readings were as high as 1,200.\n\nAs for indoor air results, elevated levels of PCE were in 29 percent of the samples. The state standard was 1 part per billion, and readings were as high as 68.\n\nIn its 2010 report on the test results, DuPont said this about providing the vapor mitigation systems: \"DuPont believes that proactively offering systems to those residents located above the groundwater plume is an appropriate measure while efforts continue to assess potential remedial technologies for implementation in the offsite groundwater plume.\"\n\nThe company could have \"proactively\" provided those systems eight years earlier, when regulators first raised concerns about the potential for vapor intrusion.\n\n\"Companies are always free to proactively take steps to protect public health when they have contaminated communities,\" former EPA regional administrator Judith Enck said in a recent interview.\n\nIn December 2009, a state Health Department study found that women living in the plume had elevated rates of kidney cancer and men had elevated rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The Health Department said it could not definitively link the elevated cancer rates to the solvents in the plume — but \"the contaminants cannot be ruled out as a potential cause.\"\n\nBy that time, homeowners had grown so distrustful of DuPont that many refused to let the company's contractor into their homes to install the vapor mitigation systems. In some cases, their lack of faith was warranted.\n\nEarly in 2009, the Pompton Lakes building inspector failed 22 of the venting systems because the top of the outdoor pipe was installed too close to a window or chimney. Eventually, regulators allowed homeowners to choose their own state-approved contractors to install the systems. More than 330 homes in the plume neighborhood now have vapor mitigation systems.\n\nBut today, nearly 30 years after DuPont signed an agreement with New Jersey to clean up the groundwater plume — which is the source of those cancer-causing vapors — the land beneath the homes remains contaminated.\n\nBlasting caps and explosive powder have played a major role in the history of Pompton Lakes and neighboring Wanaque for more than a century.\n\nEven before DuPont arrived on the scene, several smaller companies made explosive powder in those towns as far back as the 1880s.\n\nThe first plant on the Wanaque portion of the future DuPont site was built in 1886 by H. Julius Smith, who had patented a spark-fired blasting cap filled with mercury fulminate.\n\nIn 1894, the American Smokeless Powder Co. took over production on the property. Its smokeless powder was a vast strategic improvement for soldiers over black powder, which had produced smoke that obscured enemy targets during battle and also gave away the location of the soldiers doing the shooting.\n\nThe Haskell Plant, as it was known, was purchased in 1898 by Laflin & Rand, which expanded the site. The factory was so important that American troops were stationed to guard it during the Spanish-American War.\n\nDuPont acquired control of Laflin & Rand in 1902, and set up its DuPont Electric Exploder Company, which included blasting cap and powder production facilities on the west side of Lake Inez along the Wanaque River. The facility would play a key production role in World War I.\n\nIn 1908, DuPont opened the DuPont Cap Works in the Acid Brook Valley.\n\nInitially the company made mercury fulminate as a powder to use in its blasting caps, then later switched to lead azide.\n\nTroops were stationed around the facility during World War I to guard against any potential sabotage by foreign agents.\n\nWith good reason.\n\nAn incident in January 1917 provided a stark reminder of the danger posed by the materials on the site. Some 400,000 pounds of smokeless powder ignited, causing explosions that could be felt as far away as Massachusetts. Houses shook in Brooklyn, windows shattered in Westchester County, and telephone and telegraph service throughout North Jersey was disrupted, according to a New York Times story at the time of the disaster: \"At the Pompton Lakes Hotel the floors were forced up and the guests ran to the street in terror, many not fully dressed.\"\n\nDuPont built a series of homes just south of its plant around World War I to house employees. The neighborhood became known as DuPont Village.\n\nIn 1926, DuPont shuttered its Wanaque facility and consolidated operations to the southeast, in Pompton Lakes.\n\nAs the nation ramped up for World War II, so did DuPont's hiring at its Pompton Lakes site. Employment peaked during the war at about 7,500, providing steady, well-paying jobs for many in the area.\n\nIn fact, DuPont provided more than jobs — it provided a way of life, a sense of community, even recreational opportunities such as athletic teams.\n\nIn 1943, amid World War II, operations and staff at the Pompton Lakes site had grown so large that DuPont introduced a monthly newsletter, aptly named \"The Exploder.\"\n\nThe first issue noted that it was created \"to unite the thousands of workers at the plant in a spirit of harmony, friendliness and above all, grim determination to keep at its peak the production for which we have taken solemn obligation.\"\n\nThe newsletter provided personal updates on workers in various parts of the sprawling facility, including the \"Twisting Line,\" \"Inspecting Line\" and \"Coiling Line.\"\n\nThat first issue also warned against absenteeism.\n\n\"They're beginning to use some pretty sharp words, including ‘deserter' for those who are absent without excuse from war plants,\" it read. \"The way to get to work every day is to bear constantly in mind that somewhere out in the Pacific or in Africa, some teenage son or somebody's husband may reach out desperately for ammunition to protect himself against the fiendish enemy and find that there isn't any…production was short that day you stayed out to get your hair set.\"\n\n\"The Exploder\" even had New Yorker-style cartoons, including one in which a female employee holds out a cup to a woman on another assembly line and says, \"Can you lend me a cup of Thermite — I just need a little to finish up a batch of incendiaries!\"\n\nAfter World War II, DuPont operations in Pompton Lakes slowly declined, until the plant closed in 1994.\n\nRemnants of structures — primarily concrete footings, stone and concrete foundations and masonry walls — remain on the 600-acre property, along with Cannonball Road, which had served as the facility's spine.\n\nFounded in 1802 as a gunpowder mill on the Brandywine River in Delaware by chemist and industrialist E. I. du Pont, who had fled the violence of the French Revolution with his family in 1799.\n\nHeadquartered in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nPlayed key role in making blasting caps and other ammunition at its Pompton Lakes facility for the U.S. military during both world wars.\n\nPlayed a major role in the Manhattan Project, which ultimately developed nuclear weapons for the United States during World War II.\n\nInvented Nylon, Lucite, Dacron, Mylar, Kevlar, Tyvek, Lycra, Teflon, Corian, Stainmaster carpets, and other now-ubiquitous products.\n\nIn 2015 spun off a separate company, Chemours, which inherited responsibility for cleanup of more than 170 of DuPont's contaminated sites, including Pompton Lakes.\n\nHad $10 billion in net profit in 2016.\n\nIn September 2017 completed a $130 billion merger with Dow, another chemical industry giant, to become DowDuPont. DowDuPont is expected to break into three independent, publicly traded companies focused on agriculture, materials science and specialty products.\n\nAbout the Project\n\nJames M.

The plan involves the swap of 1.53 acres of state land for 3.92 acres – much of it along the bottom of the Brandywine – owned by The Buccini/Pollin Group.\n\nThe land is part of the former Bancroft Mills site, which the development group took over in 2015, embarking on a mission to repurpose it into multifamily residential units. While Buccini/Pollin had hoped to start demolition in early December in preparation for the project, a large fire in November destroyed much of the old mill complex.\n\nThe timeline for the $70 million plan was thrown off because of the fire, said the company’s Senior Vice President for Development Michael Hare about a week after the incident. Redevelopment costs were likely to increase, Hare said, because the old wood timbers within the structure now cannot be sold.\n\nThe council, by law, can't approve the land swap with Buccinni/Pollin, but on Wednesday it voted to ask state lawmakers to authorize it.\n\nThe move is a rare one. The council has requested a land swap just one other time in its 26-year history. It exchanged a piece of land with Epworth United Methodist Church just outside Rehoboth Beach several years ago.\n\nIronically, a second land swap proposed earlier this year with Epworth was scuttled by the council. Council members raised concerns about trading land that was purchased with land conservation in mind.\n\nOn Wednesday, they agreed to an outright purchase of ball fields owned by Epworth – land that was part of the former swap proposal. The state will pay $225,000 to buy the 5.76 acres, adjacent to ball fields the state already owns off Holland Glade Road. The purchase price may sound low given resort area real estate prices, but the council purchased a conservation easement on the land years ago. With this latest deal, the state ends up the outright owner of the property.\n\nSTORY: Bancroft Mills still smoldering, one week after fire\n\nSTORY: Abandoned Bancroft Mills in Wilmington burns\n\nThere was some initial concern about the Brandywine land swap until state park officials explained the long-standing access issues at Alapocas Run.\n\nEven though the land will be transferred to a private owner, \"this is an exception where it should be done,\" said Wayne Holden, a council member.\n\nState Rep. Gerald L. Brady, D-Wilmington, said he was born and raised in the area, as were five generations of his family.\n\n\"I know every square inch\" of the old Bancroft Mill, he said.\n\nBrady, an Open Space Council member, said he's been involved in the park access issue for years.\n\n\"I've worked with just about every personality you can imagine,\" he said. \"Land swaps are the least of our legal issues.\"\n\nThe swap, he said, would improve access and provide the state with additional amenities.\n\n\"This is a good deal. Trust me,\" Brady said.\n\nThe Open Space Council has signed off on four land acquisitions at Alapocas Run. The first was in 1988 when River Gardens, LLC transferred 12.19 acres to the state at no cost. The second came in 1999 when the state spent $4.5 million to buy 152.33 acres from Al-Zar Ltd. The third land purchase was in 2000 when the state paid CCM Realty LLC $350,000 for 1.53 acres. The last acquisition was last year when the state acquired 45.94 acres from the Nemours Foundation at no cost. The urban park stretches from its boundary with Rockford Park to beyond U.S. 202.\n\nCouncil member Lorraine Fleming said she visited the park section along the Brandywine on Tuesday.\n\n\"I guess I was a little stunned to see how dismal the park entrance was,\" she said.\n\nFleming was more concerned that a swap might set a precedent.\n\nBut once she learned there had been a previous swap, she said she was satisfied.\n\nState Park staffers characterized the Brandywine land swap as a unique opportunity to resolve long-standing issues, improve access and gain some park improvements.\n\n\"There are such a limited number of parking space,\" said Ray Bivens, state parks director.\n\nBivens said state park officials can't promote the park because they depend upon an easement with private landowners to reach the tiny parcel. In addition, there is limited parking for visitors.\n\nWith the swap, Bivens said, the developers have agreed to install a 25-space parking lot, a pavilion and restrooms, and provide an improved access route into the state holdings.\n\nIn addition, the state gets control of the river along the old Bancroft Mill site. This area includes an old dam. Bivens said state park officials would ultimately like to remove the dam to allow passage of American shad during their spring spawning run.\n\nContact Molly Murray at (302) 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.

The state wildlife agency says a limited number of hunters will be allowed to kill the migratory birds over two periods beginning Dec. 3. The state says it last allowed sandhill crane hunting in 1916. It says the species has made enough of a comeback in recent decades to allow hunters to go after them. Kentucky and Tennessee are the only other states east of the Mississippi River to allow hunting of the animals. More than a dozen Western states have crane seasons. The department says it will allow 400 permits for sandhill crane hunters over the season. Some people like eating the big birds.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The governor is seeking to tighten the rules for food stamp recipients. The Anchorage Daily News reports Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s administration wants to implement federal work requirements for low-income adults who receive food assistance. The change would affect recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in a state that has long had a waiver from work or employment program requirements. The Republican governor’s spokesman says the administration wants the change in order “to comply with the spirit and intent” of federal rules. The Food Bank of Alaska says the change will further heighten food insecurity at a time when assistance services are already strained by the governor’s recent, deep budget vetoes.\n\nArizona\n\nFlorence: Pinal County authorities want to prepare inmates with skills to help them have a successful future once they get out of jail. The county Sheriff’s Office is partnering with a technology company to bring computer tablets to the inmates at the adult detention center. The county’s jail houses an average of 500 inmates a day. The tablets are monitored, and the inmates are aware that their activities and all forms of conversations are monitored, which is standard practice at all detention facilities. Sheriff Mark Lamb told the Casa Grande Dispatch that inmates can use tablets to help advance their education and gain skills while they are incarcerated, prepare themselves for a future job or even work toward a high school diploma.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: Initial information for the Connect Northwest Arkansas transit development plan confirms the region’s residents want a more developed transit system. Tim Simon of Alliance Transportation Group, the consulting firm commissioned by the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission to do the $280,000 study and plan, recently presented the first draft to stakeholders. A transit plan for the region was last adopted in 2010. The new plan will focus on public education and establishing fixed bus routes throughout the region, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The plan will be developed specifically for the two public transit providers, Ozark Regional Transit and University of Arkansas Razorback Transit, to define their roles in a regional system.\n\nCalifornia\n\nHoopa: They probably don’t train people for this at the Sheriff’s Academy. A patrol car was struck by a falling bear, officials in Northern California say. A Humboldt County sheriff’s deputy was driving on State Route 96 on Aug. 3, answering a report of a drug overdose in the community of Orleans, when the bear fell or jumped onto the car, apparently from a steep embankment, authorities say. The bear smashed the hood and windshield. The patrol car hit an embankment, rolled onto its side and burst into flames. The deputy managed to escape without serious injury. The fire was contained to about half an acre, but the car was gutted. However, the California Department of Transportation offered a reassurance: “Don’t worry, the bear also fled the scene.”\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: Another city in the Centennial State is refusing to do business with a company partly due to its ties to immigration enforcement. Boulder police told ankle monitor maker BI Incorporated last week that it will no longer allow off-duty police officers to be hired for extra security at its headquarters. It works with immigration and other authorities and is owned by GEO Group, which operates the immigration detention center in suburban Denver. The decision was prompted by objections from residents and citizens’ groups to the city having contracts with GEO and CoreCivic or its subsidiaries following Denver’s decision to cut ties with the halfway houses they operate. A BI spokesman, Rich Coolidge, says the move sets a dangerous precedent because he says it puts partisan political decisions above public safety.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s “distressed” dairy industry will be the subject of an informational forum Tuesday at the Legislative Office Building. Members of the General Assembly’s “rural caucus” have invited dairy farmers from Franklin and Hebron, the executive director of the Connecticut Farm Bureau, the assistant director of the Cooperative Extension System at the University of Connecticut, and Department of Agriculture Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt. In Connecticut and across the country, farmers for years have been grappling with low milk prices they cannot control. As of January, there were 108 dairy farms in the state, including cattle, goat and sheep milk producers. Connecticut’s dairy industry has been estimated to contribute more than $1 billion annually to its economy.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Students soon will be able to ride a DART bus with passes paid for by their schools. A new state law will allow district and charter schools to buy and provide annual passes for students to use buses from the Delaware Transit Corp. Sen. Laura Sturgeon D-Brandywine West, the legislation’s main sponsor, says it is designed to make school choice more equitable. It will also help students get to after-school jobs and volunteer opportunities and help a new generation become more familiar with public transportation. “We have school choice in Delaware, but not all students can access it,” she says. The bill is aimed at students in grades six through 12. Schools will not be required to provide the passes. Each district and charter school will negotiate the purchase with DART, but each pass is expected to cost $450 annually, a steep discount, says John Sisson, DART’s chief executive officer.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With the district reaching its 100th homicide of the year, one teen is coping by opening up a conversation on YouTube. Sean Johnson, 15, has grown up in southeast D.C., witnessing regular violence, WUSA-TV reports. He tutored 11-year-old Karon Brown, who was shot to death in July. “When I heard about the shooting, it really got me heartbroken because, you know, I used to help this kid,” Sean says. Moments like that pushed him to start the series set up like a Q&A about the neighborhood. “Basically, people who have never been to southeast, they need to know how it is because people are quick to put stereotypes on southeast and say, like, ‘Oh, it’s a bad neighborhood,’ but it really depends,” he says. Sean says kids are afraid to speak up and stand out, thinking they’ll become a target, but it’s important to open up the conversation to create any kind of change.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: After 2018’s high ecological toll, red tide is at normal background levels this year. A blue-green algae bloom this summer has stayed mostly on Lake Okeechobee since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers lowered lake levels earlier this year to avoid discharging large volumes of water to the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie rivers. Large fish kills haven’t been reported along the coast in several months, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, and the number of sea turtle hatchlings across the region may set a record by autumn. “We ended up with 133 (sea turtles) stranding last year, which is really bad. It was a terrible red tide,” says Maura Kraus, with Collier County’s sea turtle program. Sea turtle nesting season runs through Oct. 31.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A drug charge has been dropped against a Georgia Southern quarterback after a white substance he identified as bird poop on his car’s hood tested negative for cocaine. A Saluda County Sheriff’s Office police report says deputies pulled Shai Werts over for speeding July 31 and noticed two white spots on his car they thought were cocaine. The report says Werts told them it was bird poop he had tried to wash off. The deputies then did a field test that came back positive for cocaine and charged him with possession of the drug. Werts’ lawyer Townes Jones IV told The Savannah Morning News more sophisticated lab testing showed the substance was not cocaine, and the drug charge was dropped. Jones says prosecutors told him the original speeding charge remains.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Astronomers across 11 observatories on the state’s tallest mountain have canceled more than 2,000 hours of telescope viewing over the past four weeks because a protest blocked a road to the summit. The lost research atop Mauna Kea includes work on clouds of gas and dust on the verge of forming stars, as well as asteroids that might come close to or even hit Earth. Mauna Kea is one of the world’s premier sites for studying the skies. Native Hawaiian protesters are blocking the road to prevent the construction of another telescope, which they fear will further harm a peak they consider sacred. Astronomers said Friday that they’ll attempt to resume observations but in some cases won’t be able to make up the missed research. Protesters say they shouldn’t be blamed for the shutdown.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Nez Perce Tribe is suing a Canadian mining company contending the company is illegally allowing arsenic, cyanide and mercury to pollute a central Idaho area to which the tribe has hunting and fishing rights from an 1855 treaty with the United States. The tribe filed the lawsuit Thursday in U.S. District Court seeking to force British Columbia-based Midas Gold and three Idaho-based subsidiaries to stop discharging pollutants. Midas Gold has never mined in the area about 40 miles east of McCall but in the last decade has acquired mining claims and developed a plan it says will ultimately clean up the mess left by a century of mining by other companies. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has spent $4 million since the 1990s trying to clean up the area that includes streams with federally protected salmon.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The University of Illinois has launched a two-year study and is offering free soil tests to home gardeners and urban farmers across the area. It’s called the Chicago Safe Soils Initiative. Professor Andrew Margenot, the leader of the project, says cities can often be “hotspots” for heavy metals like lead. He and others will be collecting thousands of soil samples from backyards, community gardens and urban farms in the next two years. They plan to map out what they find and make it publicly available. University officials say it’s common to find high lead levels near roads and houses built before 1978, when paint containing lead was banned. Participants will have to fill out a sample soil intake form.\n\nIndiana\n\nYorktown: Elected officials have come out against a proposed steel dust recycling plant, saying the nearby project would hurt local property values. The Yorktown Town Council posted a notice Friday on the town’s Facebook page declaring its opposition to the plant proposed in adjacent Muncie. That notice says the construction and operation of the hazardous waste recycling plant would harm property values and wouldn’t be “an attractive nor viable partner in the development of our community.” Waelz Sustainable Products has not yet obtained a construction permit from Indiana regulators. The plant would recycle trainloads of steel dust, a hazardous waste. Mercury, lead and other toxic air pollutants would be released during a rotary kiln process to recover zinc and iron.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: The city has hired an engineering firm to help guide repairs to the inflatable dam on the Cedar River downtown. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reports the City Council has authorized spending up to $27,500 for AECOM Technical Services to develop plans for a process to determine why the rubber bladder dam is leaking air. The company will prepare a contract for a private contractor that will install temporary gates to keep water away while engineers inspect the dam to find the leak or leaks and make plans for repairs. The city intends to have parts and patches on hand to make repairs while the water is diverted for the inspection. The city has inflated the bladder dam since 2009, raising the Cedar River level by about 4 feet to enhance boating. It’s usually inflated in June and deflated in October.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Leaders of an anti-vaccination group in the state say their membership numbers are surging in response to two new immunization requirements for schoolchildren. As of Aug. 2, Kansas is requiring students beginning in seventh grade to receive a meningitis vaccine. And students entering kindergarten or first grade need two doses of the hepatitis A vaccine. The shots are required for children in public or private schools. Connie Newcome, president of Kansans for Health Freedom, says the nonprofit group has grown dramatically. She says Kansans want to make their own decisions about vaccines without the government telling them what to do. The Kansas City Star reports the opposition comes as state health officials are trying to improve Kansas’ low ranking for the meningitis vaccine, and an only slightly better ranking for hepatitis A vaccinations.\n\nKentucky\n\nCave City: Officials say a section of Mammoth Cave National Park will be closed for more than a year for renovations. Park spokeswoman Molly Schroer told the Daily News that a 2-mile section of cave stretching from the Snowball Room to Grand Central Station will close sometime this fall and isn’t expected to reopen for 18 months. Schroer said the dirt and stone cave floor has become degraded, and the project will make the path smoother and more durable while making steps and handrails more user-friendly. She said the Grand Avenue Tour and the Wild Cave Tour won’t be available for the entire closure. Others tours, including Domes and Dripstones and Frozen Niagara, would be closed for only part of the renovation.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state has a new poet laureate, with a background well beyond fine arts. John Warner Smith’s tenure in the two-year position begins Wednesday. He teaches English at Southern University in Baton Rouge and has published four collections of poetry since 2015. But before that, Smith worked as Louisiana labor secretary under former Gov. Kathleen Blanco, and he has been a banker. He has degrees in fine arts, business administration, psychology and accounting. Gov. John Bel Edwards and the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities announced Smith’s selection. Edwards described Smith’s poetry as passionate and called him a “trailblazer” who is devoted to education. Smith takes over from Jack Bedell, who has been Louisiana’s poet laureate since 2017.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Endangered piping plovers have fledged 165 chicks so far this summer for a new record in the state. The Maine Audubon reports that the number of chicks represents a 29% increase over last year. And it follows a 30% increase last year. Laura Minich Zitsk, director of Maine’s Piping Plover Project, tells the Portland Press Herald that the number of nesting pairs is “incredible.” The most recent state tally found 89 nesting pairs of piping plovers on Maine beaches. That’s up from 68 last year. Henry Jones of the Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department says the gains were aided by work by federal, state and local agencies over the past decade. The shorebird has been on the federal endangered species list since 1986.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Johns Hopkins University has fired an associate research professor over his confrontation with students participating in a sit-in at a campus building where he worked. The Sun reports that a letter written by the university’s vice dean for faculty says Daniel Povey has been fired for jeopardizing student safety. The newspaper says Povey posted his termination letter online. His firing takes effect Aug. 31. Povey initially was placed on administrative leave after the night in May when he used bolt cutters to enter a building and access computer servers hosting his research. Students who had occupied the building for weeks were protesting legislation that would allow John Hopkins to create an armed campus police force. Povey told The Sun he believed protesters “weren’t going to get what they wanted.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state Registry of Motor Vehicles is holding its annual lottery for much sought-after low-number vehicle license plates. Entries are being accepted online until Aug. 23. Mailed entries must be postmarked by that date. The winners will be announced Sept. 15. Only one entry per applicant will be accepted, and applicants must be a Massachusetts resident with a currently active, registered and insured passenger vehicle. People with suspended or revoked registrations or licenses are not eligible. Applicants are not allowed to request specific numbers. Among the numbers available in this year’s lottery are B1, 3000, 27A and K5. For years, low-number plates were handed out to the politically connected until the lottery system was put into place.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Wayne County prosecutors are commemorating the 10th anniversary of a push to test thousands of sexual assault kits found in a Detroit police evidence warehouse. Highlights of the initiative will be discussed Wednesday during an invitation-only event. More than 11,000 rape kits were discovered in the warehouse in 2009. Those kits contained DNA and other evidence from rape cases, but a majority of the 11,000 kits were never tested in a lab. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy pushed efforts to test the kits and prosecute old cases. Through May 2018, 130 people had been convicted and 818 serial sex offenders identified after authorities started investigating earlier batches of the kits. Thousands of untested kits also have been found at other police departments across the nation.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Local planners say the city is the first of its size in the country to ban new drive-through windows. The City Council voted Thursday to ban new construction of drive-through facilities. The existing ones are grandfathered. Council President Lisa Bender proposed the ban last year to cut down on vehicle noise, idling and traffic and to make sidewalks safer for pedestrians. New drive-through windows have already been prohibited in 17 of the city’s 23 zoning districts. The Minneapolis 2040 Comprehensive Plan approved by the council last year directs the city to outlaw new drive-through facilities and gas stations.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Tulane University is no longer operating on Mississippi’s Gulf Coast. WLOX-TV reports students took their last final exam Thursday – the last day of classes for the campus in Biloxi. The campus has been in Biloxi since 2001. The university announced the closing in 2018. Officials said dwindling numbers of enrollment created the need to close. At the beginning of the 2018 fall semester, 92 students were enrolled. The largest enrollment was in 2011 with 205 students. Media arts instructor Ronald Warr tells the station the closure hurts. He says it feels like he’s been punched in the gut. Affected students have opted to continue with online classes, attend classes at the New Orleans campus, or take their credits and transfer to another institution.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence: A museum dedicated to the late actress Ginger Rogers will close after only one year of operation. Rogers, who was born in Independence, is most famous as the dancing partner for Fred Astaire in the 1930s and ’40s. Marge and Gene Padgitt opened the museum last year in the home where Rogers and her mother, writer Lela Owens-Rogers, lived. The Independence Examiner reports Marge Padgitt said the museum didn’t have enough visitors and doesn’t have enough space to hold donated items. The museum will be open Wednesdays and Saturdays through September. The couple still hopes to acquire a larger building for a museum dedicated to Jackson County history and celebrities who lived in the area, including Rogers, Walt Disney, actor Jean Harlow, actor William Powell, and Jesse and Frank James.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Health officials have proposed a series of rules for schools in the state, including requiring districts to create plans for how they would make buildings airtight. The Billings Gazette reports the state Department of Health and Human Services’ rule for sealing school buildings from the outside air aims to protect against wildfire smoke and other air hazards. The proposal also includes requirements for schools to regularly inspect air systems and to test water for lead. Education groups have been critical of the proposed rules, saying the process was rushed and hoping the department would clarify its expectations. The department says several school groups had the chance to weigh in, and it has considered the economic impact of the rules. The department is taking public comment on the proposal until Sept. 16.\n\nNebraska\n\nFairbury: A living history event scheduled for this weekend at Rock Creek Station State Historical Park will show what everyday life was like in the Nebraska Territory in 1864. Historians will inhabit the park’s reconstructed road ranch Saturday, demonstrating haying, carpentry, blacksmithing and stock tending. Rock Creek Station was established in 1857 along the Oregon and California trails. It was a supply center and resting spot for westward emigrants and later became a Pony Express relay station. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission developed it as a state historical park in 1980. The park sits about 6 miles east of Fairbury in Jefferson County. Call the park at 402-729-5777 for more information. A park entry permit is required.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Wild horses are being rounded up throughout the state this summer by federal land managers who say they are preserving land and protecting herds while water and food sources become scarce. A U.S. Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman tells the Las Vegas Sun it’s horrifying to see animals starving on the range, and the logical and humane thing to do is manage the population. But some wild horse advocates want to do away with roundups, saying they rely on faulty figures, waste resources and harm horses. They say the bureau already has 46,000 captured horses in taxpayer-funded corrals. The Sun reports the number of mustangs and mares in captivity nearly equals the estimated 48,300 on the range in Nevada, a state with more than half the U.S. wild horse and burro population.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPittsfield: The state has put the kibosh on a farm stand’s ice cream made from raw milk. Jill Fudala says her ice cream made from goat milk and sold in cherry walnut, black raspberry and other flavors was a hit – until the state stepped in. The Boston Globe reports that customers could pay on the honor system at her farm stand. That was before the state Department of Health and Human Services threatened to fine Fudala unless she stopped selling the ice cream. The department contends processed dairy products must be made with pasteurized milk. State Rep. James Allard says he hopes to help Fudala return to her ice cream production. He’s exploring whether to submit a bill “to update the language” of the state law.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nLacey Township: Heinz is offering to help a person who fears that the theft of a bottle of ketchup has led to bad luck. The thief took a bottle from a New Jersey restaurant. But when the person got into a car accident and experienced other misfortunes, they returned two bottles to the eatery, with a note of apology. The note said the theft of the ketchup was the worst thing the person had ever done, but he or she was seeking to do something “risky.” Heinz offered on Twitter to pay for the damage from the car accident if the thief contacted the Pittsburgh-based company. The company said: “Heinz makes you do crazy things.” Heinz posted Friday that it found the person, whose identity it has promised to protect.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Officials believe they may have found one of the missing trees planted in the state from seeds taken to the moon during the Apollo 14 mission. KOAT-TV reports former New Mexico first lady Clara Apodaca and a naturalist identified a tree last week that they believe to be one of those planted in the state four decades ago. Apodaca and the naturalist say a Douglas fir in a grassy area north of the state Capitol in Santa Fe is a moon tree. Apodaca helped plant it. The discovery comes after the Albuquerque station reported that officials where the trees were planted decades ago said they have lost track of the trees. Moon trees were grown from 500 seeds taken into orbit around the moon by former U.S. Forest Service smokejumper Stuart Roosa during the 1971 mission.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is appealing a court decision that has halted trail work in the Adirondacks. The Department of Environmental Conservation is asking the state’s highest court to reverse a mid-level court ruling in a lawsuit filed by the environmental group Protect the Adirondacks. The group sued in 2013, claiming the state was cutting 25,000 trees to make its new “community connector” snowmobile trails. The state said the number was far less. The “Forever Wild” clause of the state constitution prohibits removal of excessive amounts of timber in the Forest Preserve. At issue in the court case is the definition of “tree.” The state says trees less than 3 inches in diameter don’t count, but the lawsuit argued slender trees can be very old and important to the forest ecology.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Thousands of old court documents – some going back 350 years – could soon be more accessible to the public thanks in part to a federal grant. The State Archives of North Carolina is getting $140,000 toward a project designed to expand an online catalog that helps historians and other citizens know names and places within hard-to-decipher records. An improved index means they’ll know which documents they want to go read in person. State Archivist Sarah Koonts says the documents shed light on early North Carolina society and include wills and estates and bridge and road information. A sample of these documents will be posted online as part of the project. Workshops will be held for participants to learn how to transcribe the documents’ elegant cursive handwriting.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: As law enforcement agencies across the state begin a concentrated effort to catch impaired drivers, some 60 law enforcement officers will be using their specially trained skills to detect motorists who are high on drugs. About 20 agencies across the state employ officers who have taken the rigorous, internationally utilized program that helps law enforcement identify drivers who are under the influence of drugs other than alcohol. North Dakota Highway Patrol trooper Tarek Chase coordinates the state’s drug recognition expert training program. Chase tells the Bismarck Tribune law enforcement officers statewide have noticed an increase in drug-impaired driving. Agencies statewide begin a “Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over” enforcement campaign Friday. It runs through Sept. 2.\n\nOhio\n\nMansfield: It’s been 25 years since Red and Andy were reunited at the edge of the Pacific Ocean, and an event this weekend will reunite many of those who helped film “The Shawshank Redemption” here. Fans can meet cast members Friday through Sunday. The weekend’s festivities start at 6 p.m Friday with a screening of the movie at the Renaissance Theatre. The following two days will be filled with events at the Ohio State Reformatory, the facility also known as Shawshank State Prison. But to the tens of thousands of inmates who lived there between 1896 to 1990, the prison was known as “Dracula’s Castle,” Mark Dawidziak explained in his recently published book, “The Shawshank Redemption Revealed.” Dawidziak will be among those available to meet guests over the weekend, to tell them about his behind-the-scenes look into the making of the film.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A Democratic lawmaker from the city is joining forces with gun safety advocates seeking a public vote on whether to overturn a state law that will allow people in the state to openly carry firearms without a background check or training. Rep. Jason Lowe announced plans Monday for a referendum petition on the bill that passed overwhelmingly last session and quickly became the first signed by new Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt. The bill is scheduled to take effect Nov. 1. Supporters of the repeal will face a tight deadline to gather the nearly 60,000 signatures before the end of August to get the question on ballot in 2020. Lowe’s announcement comes less than two weeks after mass shootings in Texas and Ohio left more than 30 people dead.\n\nOregon\n\nGrants Pass: A county fair is setting up a “free-expression area,” with restrictions on bullhorns, signs and sound systems. The Daily Courier reports the Josephine County Fair is setting up a 30-by-30-foot outdoor area near two of the entrances to a building where vendors will be set up for the upcoming fair. The fair board recently banned signs except in areas where vendors and others have paid a fee to use them. Fairgrounds director Tamra Martin says efforts have been made to create a “family-friendly,” entertaining event. She says the location of the “free-expression area” provides visibility for those wanting to be heard. Kelly Simon with the American Civil Liberties Union in Portland says limits on free speech must be narrowly tailored to serve a government interest.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWilkes-Barre: Officials say a man broke into a Planned Parenthood office, smashing glass doors and painting graffiti on the walls. Melissa Reed, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Keystone, said surveillance images show a man throwing a brick through a window of the Wilkes-Barre office about 2 a.m. Monday. She said the same man returned about an hour later with another brick, smashed other windows, climbed through the door and spray-painted graffiti including a biblical verse in red. Planned Parenthood Keystone said in a statement that the act was “aimed to intimidate, threaten and instill fear.” Reed said the office offers birth control, cancer screenings, general health care, STD testing, pregnancy testing and the morning-after pill but does not perform surgical abortions on site.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Department of Environmental Management is surveying the state’s lakes, ponds and rivers this summer as part of an annual monitoring program to identify invasive aquatic species. During a survey June 12 in Barney Pond in Lincoln, DEM staff removed several small water chestnut plants that were scattered throughout the pond. Water chestnut hadn’t been previously documented in Barney Pond or its watershed, so DEM alerted the town of Lincoln and searched for the source of the invasive plants. A large patch of water chestnut plants was found upstream in Olney Pond. The invasive plants were removed as part of conservation efforts to protect Olney Pond’s habitat. The public is asked to take photos and report suspected new findings of water chestnut plants to DEM.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nYork: A 101-year-old farming and fellowship tradition won’t continue this year in rural South Carolina and may be over for good. The Herald of Rock Hill reports the annual Hopewell Day where people in western York County gather to eat beef hash and listen to gospel music and political speeches won’t take place in 2019. Hopewell Day was celebrated the third Wednesday in August after many farmers finished their harvests. But organizer Melvin Howell says attendance is dwindling, and there aren’t enough volunteers because of school starting back. Other organizers say they will discuss moving the event to the weekend if it is held in 2020. Hash is made from beef, onions, butter and salt.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: An official of Rapid City Regional Airport acknowledges the airport recently dumped sewage without permission from state regulators. The Rapid City Journal reports the airport dumped about 74,100 gallons of sewage on the northern end of its property this past week without permission of the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources. Airport executive director Patrick Dame says that the airport contacted the department before it dumped the sewage but that the agency did not make it clear a permit was necessary. He says the airport has been looking at ways to remove excess wastewater that accumulated in its septic lagoon due to the combination of heavy rain and increased passenger traffic this summer. A DENR spokesman says the agency is trying to determine if any contamination has occurred.\n\nTennessee\n\nRed Boiling Springs: News outlets report two former students are accused of breaking into their high school and stealing an AR-15 and bulletproof vests from the resource officer’s gun safe. Clay and Macon County authorities say Lee Clark and Adam Cisneros were spotted on video inside Red Boiling Springs School last week. Deputies say the items were found buried behind Clark’s home. WTVF reports Macon schools director Tony Boles says a sheriff’s department policy allows officers to bring personal guns to campus along with their service weapons. Groups advocating against gun violence are questioning how the kids got into the safe. Beth Joslin Roth of the Safe Tennessee Project says she also wonders why an officer would have an assault weapon at school, given how imprecisely they are designed to fire.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Joe Walsh will be joined by ZZ Top, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, and Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit at his VetsAid music festival to benefit veterans. The award-winning musician announced Monday that tickets for the Nov. 10 concert at the Toyota Center in Houston will go on sale Friday. In its first two years, net proceeds have allowed VetsAid to disburse nearly $1.2 million in grants. Grants this year will go to Houston-area organizations. In a statement, Walsh says that “all are welcome to celebrate the things that unite us as Americans: good friends, open hearts and great music!” Walsh’s father died while stationed on Okinawa, Japan, when the musician was 20 months old. He offers free guitar lessons to wounded veterans at Walter Reed National Medical Center, outside Washington.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Authorities say the state’s prison population has grown faster than most states in the past few years. KSL-TV reports the Utah Sentencing Commission saw a dramatic surge in prison population as new crimes and drug violations led to more convictions. The U.S. Department of Justice reported in April that Utah’s prison population increased by 4.3% from the end of 2016 to the end of 2017, faster than every state except Idaho at 5.1%. State authorities say the average daily inmate population continued to increase, adding 165 prisoners between August 2018 and July 2019. Authorities say more people returning to prison on technical violations, including nonviolent petty crimes, drove increases. Officials say they expected Utah’s prison population to rise with the increase in the state’s general population.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Vermont Fish and Wildlife staff have been busy as beavers this summer trying to prevent flooding on roads and private property. The agency has installed 11 water control devices on beaver dams throughout the state. Known as “beaver baffles,” the devices allow some water to pass through the dam without breaching it and destroying wetlands. Officials say the devices can help reduce flooding and minimize property damage while preserving wetlands that provide critical habitat for songbirds, otters, moose and other wildlife. Beavers had disappeared from Vermont by the early 1700s due to unregulated trapping and habit degradation. Fish and Wildlife reintroduced them in the 1920s, and they are now widespread.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: City residents marked the second anniversary of a deadly white nationalist rally with a series of peaceful community events. About 20 people gathered Monday afternoon for a moment of silence at the site where an avowed white nationalist plowed a car into a crowd of people, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring dozens more. Flowers and signs decorated a memorial to Heyer. The Aug. 12, 2017, rally drew a mix of violent far-right extremists. Brawls broke out with anti-racism protesters, and authorities eventually forced the crowds to disperse. The car attack came later as peaceful counterprotesters were marching through downtown. Two state troopers involved in surveillance were killed when their helicopter crashed. Other events marking the second anniversary included a ballet performance and a worship service.\n\nWashington\n\nMetaline Falls: Times are tough in a rural county in the state’s northeast because one of the region’s biggest employers is shutting down. The Pend Oreille Mine, just north of Metaline Falls, closed July 31, at a cost of about 200 family wage jobs in an area of less than 1,000 residents. It’s another sign of the imbalance of prosperity in Washington state. While the Seattle area gorges on high-paying jobs, many rural counties like Pend Oreille County that depend on natural resource industries – logging, fishing, mining – are suffering. This divide is part of a national trend. People in urban areas had higher per-capita income, lower poverty rates, lower unemployment rates and higher education levels than people in rural areas in recent years, according to federal data.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Pagan gatherings are scheduled for three parks in the state in coming weeks, but those considering attending the public events and expecting to see witchcraft in action or arcane rituals being observed may be disappointed, The Gazette-Mail reports. “You won’t see any spell-casting or sacrifices,” Gwendolyn Blake of Clarksburg said with a laugh. “But we do have a ceremony where we break bread and have a drink of something from nature, like water or wine.” Blake’s Rowan Temple of Light Coven is organizing Pagan gatherings at Kanawha State Forest on Aug. 17 and at Summersville Lake on Sept. 21. A Charleston Area Pagan Pride gathering is scheduled for Sept. 28 at Ordnance Park, in St. Albans. A Morgantown Pagan Pride Day, held July 27 at Mason-Dixon Historical Park at Core, drew about 300 attendees, according to Blake.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Law enforcement authorities in Dodge County say anyone arrested on suspicion of drunken driving will be identified and have their photos posted on social media. The sheriff’s office already releases the names of all alleged drunken drivers to local media. In a statement on Facebook, the office says the new policy on disclosure of drunken driving arrests is legal because records of such arrests are public record. It will begin this month. The initiative is part of the sheriff’s office’s crash reduction strategy that has focused on drunken driving, speeding, stop sign offenses, seat belt violations and other enforcement efforts.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Firefighters in the area worry the danger of wildfires could increase after wet spring and summer weather. The wet weather encouraged lush growth on northeast Wyoming’s grasslands. Campbell County Fire Department Operations Chief J.R. Fox says it doesn’t take many hot, dry days to dry out vegetation. He’s especially concerned about heavy growth of sweet clover. Fox told the Gillette News-Record on Friday that fire danger remains moderate. Firefighters quickly put out two small wildfires in Campbell County on Thursday. The department responds to 140 to 150 wildfires in an average year. They’ve responded to just 20 to 30 small fires so far this year.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/08/scuba-pumpkins-whey-vodka-acorn-bumper-crop-news-around-states/40281267/", "title": "Scuba pumpkins, whey vodka: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAthens: The state’s cattle farmers are feeling the pinch from the worsening drought. Limestone County farmer Donna Jo Curtis tells the Athens News-Courier she already has started feeding hay to her livestock because fields are so dry. Farm ponds also are drying up, making water a concern as excessive heat stresses the animals. To help with the crunch, state agriculture officials have announced a plan to issue special free permits for trucks hauling hay. Forecasters are predicting cooler temperatures and increasing chances of rain that could help even more. The entire state is at least abnormally dry, and some areas are in an extreme drought. The Alabama Cattlemen’s Association describes cattle production as a $2.5 billion industry in the state.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A Tlingit clan hat was welcomed back to southeast Alaska with ceremony and dance after spending more than a century away. A ceremony Sept. 25 included both an original sculpin hat, which was taken in 1884 from Sitka and became part of the Smithsonian Institution’s collection, and a replacement hat, which was given to the Kiks.adi clan. “It’s like seeing an old friend come around the corner when you thought you’d never see them again,” clan leader Ray Wilson told the Juneau Empire. The team-up and technology that led to the new hat and ceremony are unprecedented as far as the Smithsonian is aware. The replacement hat was made through careful study of the original, 3D imaging and consultation with the clan, said Eric Hollinger, tribal liaison for the repatriation office of the Smithsonian National History Museum.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A court-appointed expert in a lawsuit over the quality of health care in the state’s prisons says understaffing, inadequate funding and privatization of health care services are significant barriers in improving inmate care. The report released Friday comes as the state has been accused of persistently dragging its feet in recent years in following through on its promises in a 2014 settlement to improve health care for inmates. Expert Marc Stern says the state’s decision to privatize health care services for inmates is costing more than if the state ran those services itself. He recommended that the Legislature’s push for privatization of inmate care be rescinded or overridden by the judge so that the state can run those services again.\n\nArkansas\n\nHot Springs: Bacteria that can cause Legionnaire’s disease have been found in the showers of a Hot Springs spa. The Arkansas Department of Health says Legionella bacteria were found within Quapaw Baths & Spa, and the shower where water taken from a spring was cooled before use has been closed for cleaning. Legionnaire’s disease is a type of potentially fatal pneumonia but is treatable with antibiotics. The health department said it began investigating after three people with the disease reported staying at the spa. The department says thermal spring water at public fountains is safe while further testing continues. The spa said in a statement that it is cooperating with the department and asked for an investigation to determine the source of the contamination.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: At the end of the month, travelers will not be able to catch a rideshare or taxi outside terminals at Los Angeles International Airport. LAX announced Friday that passengers will instead have to take shuttles or walk to a special location outside the central terminal area where they can be picked up. The move is aimed at relieving congestion on the central road as construction picks up during a $14 billion improvement program. Ride-hailing vehicles and taxis will still be able to drop off passengers at terminals, but all pickups will be in the new location. Officials say that should remove about 15% of vehicle traffic from the central terminal area. The new system will remain in effect until a new automated people-mover goes into service in 2023.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Enrollment at Colorado State University this fall sets a record. University officials say total enrollment tops 34,000 students, up by about 2,000 compared to four years ago. The Loveland Reporter-Herald reports undergraduate enrollment is up from about 24,500 in 2015 to 26,500 now. At the Fort Collins campus, over 64% of new first-year students are Colorado residents, 57% are women, and 24% of the new class are first in their family to attend college. Total enrollment at CSU-Fort Collins, CSU Global and CSU-Pueblo tops 57,000 students.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State officials are launching a new health care cost-estimator tool. The Connecticut Office of Health Strategy has planned an event for Tuesday. The new cost estimator will be on the Healthscore CT website, which the office developed to give people free resources to make informed health care choices and policy decisions. The tool was designed to help residents compare what different health care providers charge for the same procedure. It’s part of the health strategy office’s effort to make cost and health care quality information more transparent and encourage providers to improve quality. Democratic Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and state lawmakers plan to attend Tuesday’s event at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Delawareans love novels, especially those filled with mystery and intrigue. The most popular book in the past six months was mystery novel “Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens, according to data from the Delaware Division of Libraries. Not only is “Crawdads” the most checked-out book, at 2,169 checkouts, but it’s also at the top of waitlists, with 1,111 Delawareans waiting to get their hands on the New York Times bestselling book. Brandywine Hundred Library manager Jean Kaufman says the book was checked out 206 times in the past six months at her library, with 201 people in line for a copy. “Where the Crawdads Sing” has been on the top of the New York Times bestsellers list for more than 20 nonconsecutive weeks.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. lawmakers are considering emergency legislation to prohibit district agencies from cooperating with federal immigration agencies unless provided a judicial warrant or order. WTOP-FM reports D.C. Council member Charles Allen proposed the legislation, saying a 2012 district act restricting cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement isn’t enough anymore. Allen says the agency has adapted its practices to now request notification of release dates, in addition to or instead of requesting detainment. The council is set to review the proposed bill Tuesday. Prohibited assistance would include sharing information, complying with detainment requests and allowing federal immigration authorities to enter facilities owned by the district, which Mayor Muriel Bowser has declared a sanctuary city.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey Largo: A group of scuba divers submerged 30 feet beneath the surface to sculpt jack-o-lanterns during the annual Underwater Pumpkin Carving Contest in the Florida Keys. Detroit’s Josephine Walker and Stephanie McClary crafted moray eels embracing a heart to win the competition at the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Other carvings included stingrays, an octopus, jellyfish, a “Protect Our Coral” message and traditional toothy grins. Participants used knives and fine carving tools to transform their orange gourds into sea creatures. They had to keep the naturally buoyant pumpkins from floating away while they carved.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: The University of Georgia has been seeking research proposals about the school’s history regarding slavery. University administrators say they’re committing $100,000 for the effort. The institution wants research from 1785, the year it was founded, to 1865, when the Civil War ended, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Some students, faculty, alumni and community leaders say the university should commit more money for the work. Some also think the time period of research should be extended beyond the Civil War. Colleges benefited from slavery after the Civil War through housing, zoning and educational policies that continued to discriminate against African Americans, said Kirt von Daacke, co-chair of the University of Virginia’s commission on slavery.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Maui will prohibit commercial activity in parks on Sundays and official holidays. The island’s Parks and Recreation Department said the changes to commercial permits will take place in about a month and reduce damage to parks, The Maui News reports. Commercial permits cover surfing, kayaking, scuba diving, windsurfing and kiteboarding lessons, as well as snorkeling tours. “The demand on county parks has grown in recent years, as has the resident and visitor numbers,” permits officer Lisa Almeida said during a public hearing last week. The changes and public hearing followed televised comments Mayor Michael Victorino made in August announcing his intention to limit commercial activity in parks on Sundays and holidays.\n\nIdaho\n\nTwin Falls: A jail built to hold 194 is currently housing about 279 inmates – some crowded into an old trailer, others forced to sleep in plastic, boat-shaped containers lining the walls. The Times-News reports officials in Twin Falls County will ask voters in November to approve a $25 million bond to add modular units with 316 new beds to the jail. Capt. Doug Hughes says the overcrowding makes the jail dangerous for inmates and workers and makes it increasingly difficult to provide services to help inmates succeed once they are released. The county currently houses about 40 inmates in jails in other counties, which costs a little more than $1 million a year. Twin Falls County has not asked voters for a bond since the current jail facility was built in 1988.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: City officials are holding public meetings for residents to weigh in on the sale of recreational marijuana. A new state law will allow recreational marijuana to be sold to people 21 and older starting Jan. 1. Mayor Lori Lightfoot says her office wants to hear from residents, business owners and others about where businesses that sell marijuana should be allowed to operate. Lightfoot introduced an ordinance last month to create Chicago’s first zoning regulations for marijuana sales. She’s proposing the city establish seven zones across Chicago and cap the number of dispensaries in each zone. The plan would ban sales in most of Chicago’s downtown and within 500 feet of a school. The meetings are planned for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State and federal data shows thousands of women are traveling out of state to terminate their pregnancies as abortion clinics close around Indiana and new laws restrict use of the procedure. While the number of abortions performed in the state declined by 14% between 2009 and 2017, the number of out-of-state abortions doubled. The data shows that more than 18,000 women crossed state lines during those years to get an abortion, predominantly to Illinois. That state has more abortion providers than Indiana, it does not ban abortions after 20 weeks, and the procedure is covered under Medicaid there. Abortion-rights advocates say women from Indiana are influenced by these factors to travel outside their communities to seek an abortion.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Republicans have chosen Rep. Pat Grassley to head their leadership teams as speaker-select of the Iowa House. The grandson of U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley was chosen by the GOP House caucus Monday. He takes over as speaker after a vote of the full House in January. Current Speaker Linda Upmeyer announced last week that she would step down as speaker but serve the remainder of her current House term through the end of 2020. Grassley, a 36-year-old farmer from New Hartford, was first elected to the House in 2006. He operates a family farm with his father and grandfather, who also served in the Iowa House from 1959 to 1975. Rep. Matt Windschitl was chosen majority leader and Rep. John Wills speaker pro tem.\n\nKansas\n\nGarden City: The federal Drug Enforcement Administration plans to reopen an office that closed two years ago in Garden City. The Kansas News Service reports the office is reopening at a time when methamphetamine seizures are increasing in Finney County, and some drug-related shootings have been reported in the area. Finney County is one of about a dozen Kansas counties that the DEA classifies as a high-intensity drug trafficking area. It isn’t clear when the office will open. William Callahan, special agent in charge of the DEA’s St. Louis Division, says a team of six agents, who have started working, will also monitor opioids. He says the amount of meth seized through August by the county’s drug task force more than doubled the amount for all of 2018.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A local Catholic church will declare itself a sanctuary in what its leaders say is a “public rejection of the brutal and racist policies” of President Donald Trump’s administration. Members of St. William Catholic Church will issue a statement on its sanctuary status Tuesday, describing the “deep faith traditions of providing sanctuary for those seeking assistance as well as what this will look like in our current political climate,” according to the church’s news release. St. William, founded in 1901 to serve Irish immigrants working in nearby railroad yards, has “long been committed to a social mission,” the release says. “But in 2017, as we witnessed the present administration’s increasingly racist rhetoric, tolerance for white supremacist terrorism, and encouragement of extreme enforcement by ICE and Border Patrol agents, it became clear to us that more was required.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: The United Daughters of the Confederacy says a monument that’s been ordered removed from in front of a courthouse is considered very fragile and could cost $1 million to be taken down safely. The UDC told KTSB-TV it hired an expert witness who says the 116-year-old statue outside Shreveport’s Caddo Parish Courthouse could fall apart if it isn’t moved carefully. They say the Mississippi Stone Guild found it would take nearly $1 million to properly move it. On Sept. 30, a planning committee recommended setting aside half of that in city funds if the group doesn’t move the monument itself by mid-November. The Shreveport Times reports UDC spokeswoman Jackie Nichols told the commission Thursday that the amount proposed isn’t enough and contends the group never said it would pay for the removal.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: A scientist from the University of Maine will lead a new consortium that focuses on the sustainability of highly migratory fish species such as tuna and sharks. The Pelagic Ecosystem Research Consortium will be headed by UMaine’s Walt Golet. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is providing $1.6 million to support the effort. The University of Maine says the consortium will focus on subjects such as reducing accidental catch of highly migratory fish and increasing the understanding of their life histories. Golet says study of the fish, which include economically valuable species such as swordfish, can help improve their conservation.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: City officials and the owners of the historic racetrack that hosts the Preakness Stakes have reached an agreement to keep the Triple Crown series’ middle jewel in the city. The agreement, which is subject to approval of the General Assembly during its next session, ends a bitter dispute between owner The Stronach Group and the city over the future of Pimlico Race Course. Located in northwest Baltimore, the second-oldest track in America has been home to the famed annual race since 1909, but it is in need of a major overhaul, which has previously been estimated at nearly half a billion dollars. Under the plan, The Stronach Group would donate the site to the city for community development in and around the track and an area hospital. The company would also build a new clubhouse. The dilapidated grandstand would be demolished.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Experts say trees in the region are producing a lot of acorns this year. The Boston Globe reports experts say the region appears to be experiencing a “mast year.” Certain conditions, including the weather, cause the trees to produce more acorns every few years. Marjorie Rines, a naturalist with Mass Audubon, says there are “tons more around,” and they’ve been “coming down pretty hard and fast.” In Boston, some residents have contacted the city’s Constituent Service Center recently to ask that street sweepers clear acorns in their neighborhoods. Mark Ashton, a professor of forest ecology at Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, says it is a mast year, but not a big one.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Ground is being broken for a park commemorating a half-century turnaround for a river that runs through the city’s industrial southwest side. Democratic U.S. Reps. Debbie Dingell and Rashida Tlaib are among the dignitaries expected to attend Wednesday’s groundbreaking of the Fort Street Bridge Interpretive Park. The date, Oct. 9, also marks the 50th anniversary of a 1969 fire on the Rouge River. Sparks from an acetylene torch ignited oil and wooden debris in the river, sending flames high into the air. Organizers say the fire was among the catalysts for the Clean Water Act of 1972 and major watershed restoration efforts in the years since. Plans for the park include a sculpture, kayak launch, boardwalk, rain garden and walking path.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The local police union is selling “Cops for Trump” T-shirts after the police department banned officers from wearing their uniforms in support of candidates at political events or in ads. The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis has accused police administrators of instituting the new policy just days before President Donald Trump’s visit to Minneapolis. Union chief Bob Kroll says a lot of officers want to go to Thursday’s rally wearing their uniforms because Trump is a “very pro-law enforcement president.” The Star Tribune reports the police department denies the new policy has anything to do with politics and says it’s been under consideration since early this year. Kroll says the T-shirts are on sale for $20.\n\nMississippi\n\nStarkville: An animal rights group wants Mississippi State to retire its live bulldog mascot named Jak after he was crashed into by an Auburn University player making a mad dash through the end zone. News outlets report People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has sent a letter to the Mississippi college, saying it was sheer luck that Jak wasn’t severely injured or killed in the clash with tailback JaTarvious Whitlow. Whitlow scored the first touchdown of the game, entering the end zone with a momentum that carried him past the goal line and out of bounds, where he crashed into Jak, who then briefly left the sidelines. Jak’s official Twitter account says his chin and right hind leg were bruised, and he’ll return to mascot duties this week.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State officials say welfare recipients with medical marijuana cards will continue to get financial aid. Social Services Department spokeswoman Rebecca Woelfel says the agency won’t cut off help to those who test positive for pot as long as they have medical marijuana cards. The policy comes after Missouri voters in 2018 said patients with cancer, epilepsy and other illnesses may use cannabis if they get doctor approval. That put those patients at odds with a state law that requires Temporary Assistance for Needy Families applicants to be screened for drug use. If participants are asked to take a drug test and either fail or don’t show up, they risk losing welfare benefits for three years. Missouri now exempts recipients with medical marijuana cards.\n\nMontana\n\nChoteau: Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Montana GOP Rep. Greg Gianforte fielded calls for better management of grizzly bears during a weekend visit to the state’s Rocky Mountain Front. The Independent Record reports ranchers, farmers and residents urged the pair on Saturday to consider allowing hunting because of grizzly attacks on livestock and occasionally people. All said they supported removing grizzlies from protected status under the Endangered Species Act. Gianforte, too, urged Bernhardt to delist the bear and allow the state to manage the species. Last year, a federal judge in Montana restored threatened species status for about 700 bears in the three-state Yellowstone region. Opponents of delisting cite a need for allowing populations in that region and the north to converge.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The official state insect, the honeybee, is feeling the sting of agricultural chemicals, unfavorable weather, flooding and mites, according to beekeepers big and small. Keeping bees here has been so challenging lately that U.S. commercial beekeeping giant Adee Honey Farms recently gave up on Nebraska as a place to put hives during the summer. The company, which has almost 82,000 hives and trucks hives across the country to pollinate fruit and vegetables, had kept 12,000 hives in Nebraska – almost 500 million bees. At one time, Nebraska was the company’s top honey-producing state, according to the Omaha World-Herald. With its open ranges and river bottoms, Nebraska offered prime locations for bees to rest, recuperate and make honey. This year, the company put no hives here. Its bee losses in the state were 82% last year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating a $10,000 cash drop from a helicopter over a soccer match last month. The Skyline Helicopter Tours chopper descended from the night sky Sept. 7 and hovered above 200 people gathered on the Cashman Field. The crowd looked up, and within seconds, streams of cold, hard cash shot from the helicopter’s belly and sent the people below scrambling to get their take. The cash drop that unfolded during halftime of the Las Vegas Lights soccer team’s home loss to the El Paso Locomotive is now the center of an FAA investigation to determine whether the pilot endangered people. Representatives from Skyline Helicopter Tours – known for its Strip and Hoover Dam flights – did not respond to requests for comment, but Las Vegas Lights owner Brett Lashbrook said he fully supports the promotion and how it worked.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nEffingham: A building founded as a school by the Masons has been named to the National Register of Historic Places. Built in Effingham in 1858, the two-and-a-half-story New England Masonic Charitable Institute has Italianate details. The building’s three-stage tower has a Masonic seal on the front and clock faces on the two adjacent sides. Its octagonal open belfry protects the 1863 bell, which was used during World War II for air-raid warnings. The New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources says the institute is the only school in the United States known to have been run by the Masons. It opened as a school in 1861 and ceased school operations in the early 1880s. The town library now occupies the first floor.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBergenfield: The state’s public schools will have to test their water for lead twice as often as they do now and share the results on a yet-to-be-created state database under guidelines announced Monday by officials. The announcement continues a series of measures catalyzed by the recent water crisis in Newark, where residents in 14,000 homes with lead pipes have been given bottled water since mid-August after limited tests showed some filters weren’t adequately reducing lead levels. Lead in drinking water has been linked to developmental delays in children and can damage the brain, red blood cells and kidneys. The Legislature is holding hearings, and the state Department of Environmental Protection is stepping up its inventory of lead pipes in water systems around the state, a process that started earlier in the year.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A state high school sports governing board says unruly fans creating problems in football, cheerleading and basketball are threatening the future of soccer. The Albuquerque Journal reports New Mexico Activities Association recently announced that soccer games are being canceled and the sport is losing officials due to parental behavior. New Mexico Activities Association Executive Director Sally Marquez described the situation as a “crisis” in a letter to coaches and athletic directors. She says the cussing, screaming and threats have to stop. The governing board said in April it was considering canceling next year’s cheerleading State Spirit Competition following death threats and inflammatory social media posts.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: An upcoming exhibit at the New York Public Library will offer a look into the very private life of J.D. Salinger. From Oct. 18 to Jan. 20, 2020, the library will show materials ranging from family photographs to letters to the original typescript for his classic “The Catcher in the Rye.” The exhibit is called “J.D. Salinger” and was organized by the library in partnership with the author’s widow, Colleen Salinger, and son, Matt Salinger. Matt Salinger said that while he plans to release his father’s unpublished writings at some point, the library will not be showing any unpublished material. J.D. Salinger, who died in 2010, published no books after the 1960s but continued to write during the following decades. Fans have long obsessed over what he had been working on. The exhibit will help mark the 100th anniversary of Salinger’s birth.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOcracoke: Class is finally back in session on an island that was severely damaged by Hurricane Dorian. WITN reports classes for students on Ocracoke Island were being held Monday in three different and temporary locations as repairs continue. Start and end times are staggered to help families who may need to go to multiple school locations. Last week, Hyde County School Superintendent Stephen Basnight, who oversees Ocracoke School, told the board the community remains “devastated.” Ocracoke School was flooded with more than 3 feet of water. Basnight said the gym is still a pond, and expensive equipment in other rooms remains damaged. Students have been taking classes online with iPads from the state for the past month.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: University of North Dakota officials have broken ground on a new, $80 million Memorial Union. Groundbreaking was held outside UND’s School of Law during homecoming Friday. UND interim President Joshua Wynne says the new Memorial Union will be “the gateway” to the entire university in Grand Forks. Students voted last November in favor of replacing the school’s aging student union by raising student fees to support construction and upkeep of a new building. The new Memorial Union is scheduled for completion in 2021. The three-story building will feature 158,000 square feet of meeting and engagement spaces and include up-to-date technology, student services, and expanded dining and retail options.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A City Council member wants to prohibit discrimination against natural hair and hairstyles associated with race. City Councilman Chris Seelbach has proposed that natural hair be added to Cincinnati’s discrimination policy. Seelbach says people of color have been forced to regard popular natural hairstyles such as cornrows or dreadlocks as liabilities in the workplace, housing and elsewhere. He says black women are especially penalized. The proposed law would call for the city to investigate complaints of discrimination and allow fines of up to $1,000. A public discussion on the issue with the Cincinnati City Council’s Arts, Youth & Inclusion committee is scheduled for Tuesday. The full council is expected to vote Wednesday.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: Zac Hanson of the pop music band Hanson is recovering following a motorcycle crash in the state last week. The 33-year-old Hanson said in posts on Twitter, Facebook and the Tulsa-based band’s website that he is recovering after suffering a broken collarbone, three broken ribs and a cracked scapula. Hanson said he was able to walk away from the Tulsa crash thanks to “good quality protective gear.” Details of the crash were not revealed, but Hanson said he was preparing for a cross-country ride. Hanson said he will be replaced as drummer during an upcoming tour but will sing. Hanson is the youngest of three brothers who formed the band in the early 1990s. The band is best known for the song “MMMBop.”\n\nOregon\n\nCanby: An area creamery is working with a distiller to turn whey into vodka. KOIN-TV reports TMK Creamery, near Canby, is working with Jason Greenwood of Divine Distillers of Salem on the venture. Greenwood says whey-based vodka is not common. He says they have been working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Oregon State University to “perfect” the process. According to the university, most milk that goes into a cheese-making facility comes out as whey, which it says can be expensive to dispose of in landfills. The university says turning whey into protein powders or related products requires equipment that can be too expensive for small creameries. TMK Creamery’s Todd Koch says the hope is to be selling bottles of the vodka by month’s end.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDanville: A hospital says it is transferring some infants following a bacterial infection in its neonatal intensive care unit that affected eight newborns, three of whom have died. Geisinger Medical Center in Danville said Monday that four of the babies have recovered, and one is still being treated with antibiotics. The hospital said all of the babies had been born prematurely, and the three deaths “may have been a result of the infection complicating their already vulnerable state due to extreme prematurity.” Officials say they are working with state and federal health authorities to make sure the pseudomonas waterborne bacterial infection has been eradicated. As a precaution, the hospital is transferring babies born at less than 32 weeks to other hospitals and diverting other expected premature deliveries.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNarragansett: The American Civil Liberties Union says the town shouldn’t prohibit attendees at town meetings from interrupting, making slanderous remarks and behaving boisterously. The Narragansett Town Council is considering asking the town solicitor to draft a “decorum ordinance,” similar to new rules approved in Exeter last month. The Rhode Island ACLU chapter said Monday that considering such a proposal sends the wrong message and would have a “chilling effect” on Narragansett residents and their willingness to speak their minds at open forum sessions of council meetings. The ACLU says other municipalities shouldn’t follow Exeter’s “questionable lead.” The Narragansett council president’s recommendation for drafting the ordinance states it would ensure that First Amendment rights are protected while keeping town meetings civil.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A large amount of land along the Savannah River is being protected from development. Jonathan Winthrop told The Post and Courier of Charleston that his family put the 13,868 acres near Allendale into a conservation easement because they love the wilderness and didn’t want to see it compromised. Nature Conservancy Coastal and Midlands Conservation Director David Bishop says the latest gift means 60 continuous miles along the Savannah River are protected. The value of the donated land was not disclosed. The land was part of a plantation before the Revolutionary War, and the Winthrop family has owned it since 1906. It’s been used to harvest timber, as a vacation retreat and for quail hunting.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The estimated number of violent crimes is down in the state. U.S. Attorney Ron Parsons said Friday that the newly released FBI crime report shows the number of violent crimes in South Dakota in 2018 dropped for the first time in five years, declining about 5% compared to the year before. The report shows the estimated rate of violent crime in the state was about 405 offenses per 100,000 residents. The most dramatic drop was in the number of murders and non-negligent homicides, which dropped 56% from 2017 to 2018. Nationally, the estimated number of violent crimes as a whole decreased 3.3% in 2018 from the prior year.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Nashville Film Festival turns 50 this year with a new director who is expanding its footprint. WPLN-FM reports the festival directed by Jason Padgitt now includes city events every night as well as a new festival hub away from the multiplex where the movies are shown. Events range from house parties for VIP badge holders to big public celebrations, like one for a Chuck Berry documentary’s world premiere. New film programming manager Lauren Ponto says she maintained the festival’s eclectic mix of foreign titles and independent American films. She’s also showcasing more local talent, including K.D. Amond, director of “Five Women in the End.” It’s an apocalyptic thriller about a girls’ night gone wrong making its world premiere in the Tennessee First Competition. The festival runs through Saturday.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. is requesting an independent investigation into the fatal shooting of a key witness in a police officer’s murder trial days after the officer’s conviction. In a statement Sunday, the LDF called the killing Friday of Joshua Brown “deeply alarming and highly suspicious.” Sherrilyn Ifill, the group’s president, said Brown’s death under such circumstances “cries out for answers.” Meanwhile, Mayor Eric Johnson is urging people to avoid speculation about Brown’s death. He says he believes the police will conduct a thorough investigation. Amber Guyger was convicted last week of murder in the death of her upstairs neighbor, Botham Jean, whose apartment she said she mistook for her own. Brown testified that on the night of the killing, he heard what sounded like “two people meeting by surprise” and then two gunshots.\n\nUtah\n\nCottonwood Heights: More than a year after she set her mind to do more to help the environment, a Utah fourth grader has convinced her elementary school to switch from foam trays to biodegradable ones. The Deseret News reports Aggy Deagle successfully lobbied the Canyons School Board and inspired other schools to consider making the change. Deagle says she hated watching the trays go in the trash. Other students joined Deagle’s effort and helped her collect signatures from about 85% of the school’s students on a petition urging the change. The school district has also switched from plastic utensils to reusable metal ones. These changes have increased the nutritional services budget by about $200,000. Butler Elementary School Principal Jeff Nalwalker calls the change a “pretty big deal.”\n\nVermont\n\nNorth Hero: The state Department of Fish and Wildlife is looking for help from the public in preparing some Lake Champlain beaches for nesting turtles. The year’s spiny softshell turtle beach cleanup day is Saturday, Oct. 26. Volunteers will pull up vegetation to prepare beach nesting sites for next year. The volunteers may also find a few hatchlings that remain in underground nests late in the year. In addition to threatened spiny softshell turtles, these nest sites are also used by map turtles, painted turtles and snapping turtles. Fish and Wildlife biologist Toni Mikula will have hatchling spiny softshell and other turtles on hand and will talk about the long-term turtle recovery efforts.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria: A row house that once housed one of the nation’s largest slave-trading businesses is up for sale. The Northern Virginia Urban League owns the home in Old Town Alexandria and operates it as a museum called Freedom House. News outlets report the league put the building up for sale to shed the financial burden of operating a lightly attended museum in an old building with high maintenance costs. City officials say they’d prefer the building not be sold to a private entity, but Alexandria is not in position to take over the museum’s operation. Slave traders used the building as a holding pen for several decades in the 19th century to keep slaves arriving through the city’s port until they were sold into the Deep South.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: Hop, apple and wine growers in the state have announced they are expecting to at least meet production levels from last year’s fall harvests. The Yakima Herald-Republic reports crop experts have prepared to meet hop and wine grape numbers from 2018 while surpassing apple production levels. Growers say apple harvest numbers will be available this week, and it is likely the harvest could bring in close to 137 million boxes, an 18% increase. Washington Tree Fruit Association says the expected number does not include apples processed into juice or other products. Experts say hop numbers could be close to the 107 million pounds harvested last year. Experts say grape numbers are also expected to be similar to 2018 with more than 260,000 tons harvested.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWilliamson: Officials say state and local workers and volunteers have removed thousands of tires from a stretch of the Tug Fork River. Employees of the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, with volunteers and employees from the city of Williamson and the Mingo County Commission removed 2,340 tires from a 100-yard stretch of the river over four days. An agency statement says eight volunteers logged 192 hours during the cleanup from Sept. 26 to Oct. 2. The department says tires were rolled into the river for decades, and they accumulated behind a school, possibly as a result of flooding some 40 years ago. An estimated 10,000 tires still await removal, and plans are underway for another cleanup next year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin’s regents are preparing to take another step toward implementing punishments for students who interfere with campus speeches. The regents in 2017 adopted a policy declaring that students who twice disrupt others’ free speech would be suspended for at least one semester. A third offense would mean expulsion. The policy hasn’t taken effect, however, because the UW System’s administrative rules haven’t been amended to include it. The Board of Regents plans to vote during a meeting Friday at UW-Superior to approve a scope statement outlining such an amendment. Approval would authorize UW officials to begin drafting the language incorporating the policy changes into rule.\n\nWyoming\n\nChugwater: A former Peacekeeper missile alert facility has been dedicated as Wyoming’s newest state historical site. The Wyoming Tribune-Eagle reports officials dedicated the site, 30 miles north of Cheyenne, on Saturday. F.E. Warren Air Force Base personnel operated the MX intercontinental ballistic missile facility from 1986 to 2005. Visitors can tour on-site living quarters and take an elevator 60 feet underground to see its guidance systems. Officials worked with Wyoming State Parks and the State Historic Preservation Office to prepare the public display.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/18/puppy-sleepovers-paisley-patterned-botanic-garden-news-around-states/40846961/", "title": "Puppy sleepovers, paisley-patterned botanic garden: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Researchers from the University of South Alabama are working on a study to learn more about deadly West Nile virus. Genetic material from infected mosquitoes will be sent to Yale University, according to a statement from South Alabama. Workers at Yale’s public health school will sequence DNA to help understand how the virus and spread over the past two decades in the United States. “They are looking at how the virus has evolved over time by sequencing genomes,” says Jonathan Rayner, who works in infectious diseases at the South Alabama medical school, which says it is the first school in the state to join in the project. West Nile virus killed nearly 170 people nationwide last year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 2,647 cases of West Nile virus were reported last year, 550 more cases than in 2017.\n\nAlaska\n\nSoldotna: Project Homeless Connect 2020 has just about everything it needs to be a success, but it’s missing volunteers. The annual event provides a one-stop shop for those experiencing or at risk of homelessness. During the event, community members can come in for a free meal, blankets, clothes, diapers, shower and laundry vouchers, haircuts and a number of other services all provided at no cost. Similar events occur in other parts of Alaska, including Anchorage and Juneau, and this year events will be taking place in Homer and Seward to cover the entire peninsula. Project Homeless Connect will take place Jan. 29 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Soldotna Regional Sports Complex. Those who wish to volunteer can contact Stuart at 907-283-3125.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A lawmaker has proposed ending the state’s practice of hiring private companies to provide health care for its 34,000 prison inmates and instead turning that duty back to the state. Democratic Rep. Diego Rodriguez of Phoenix says his bill to end privatized health services at Arizona’s 10 state-run prisons was inspired by numerous accounts about inmates with minor ailments later facing serious health problems because the privatized system responded slowly or inadequately. “It’s broken, and people are dying because of this,” says Rodriguez, who disputes the claim that privatization has saved the state money. But Rep. John Kavanagh, a Republican from Fountain Hills who opposes the bill, says ending privatization would lead to high costs for the state, including higher pension costs. “It’s a lot cheaper having a private company do that,” Kavanagh says.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Holiday Island, a lakeside community, has received enough signatures from voters to try once again to become an incorporated city after a failed effort in 2017. State laws regarding incorporation were changed this year, making it easier for Holiday Island to incorporate this time around, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The changes include exemptions in population limits, allowing Holiday Island to incorporate should voters approve a ballot initiative. As an incorporated city, Holiday Island will be able to enforce its own codes and receive state money from taxes to maintain streets and roads. A spokesman for Holiday Island Citizens for Incorporation, Dan Kees, says the petition drive to get the incorporation on the 2020 general election ballot received 557 signatures from voters; only 498 were needed.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The commercial Dungeness crab fishing season in the San Francisco Bay Area has begun after a monthlong delay, allowing fishermen to start hauling in the wiggly crustaceans in time for the holiday season. Fishing boats began returning through the Golden Gate Bridge on Sunday with bins packed with crabs and headed to wholesalers at Pier 45, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife pushed back the season to lower the risk of whales getting entangled in fishing lines. The recreational crab season began Nov. 2 as scheduled. Boat captains said they saw no whales and faced rough waters on the first day of crab fishing. The commercial Dungeness crab industry in California takes in $40 million to $95 million a year. In recent years, the season has also been cut by elevated levels of the neurotoxin domoic acid found in some crabs.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has downgraded the air quality rating of the state’s biggest population center. The EPA finalized the move Monday, lowering the ozone status of Denver and eight other northern Colorado counties from “moderate” to “serious.” That will force the state to work harder to reduce harmful pollution but also bring tougher and costly regulations for businesses. Gov. Jared Polis took the unusual step of inviting the EPA to downgrade the rating, saying in March that Colorado would no longer ask for an exemption from standards by claiming some of the pollution was drifting into the state from elsewhere. He said in August that it was time to stop “sugar-coating” Colorado’s air problems. The reclassification requires the state to revise its plan to reduce ozone-forming emissions, which can aggravate asthma and contribute to early deaths from respiratory disease.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new base is being raised in a key battleground of the state’s opioid epidemic: the bustling Park Street corridor where drug deaths in Hartford are most concentrated. The harm reduction center opens in January in a former law office on Grand Street, its ammunition a combination of director Mark Jenkins’ straight talk and belly laugh and his large stocks of clean syringes and heroin cookers, fentanyl test strips, condoms and candy, the Hartford Courant reports. Jenkins supplies them to drug-dependent people and sex workers to alleviate the dangers they face and ultimately draw them in to recovery. His organization, the 5-year-old Greater Hartford Harm Reduction Coalition, has operated a drop-in resource center on Albany Avenue since last summer, but it’s essentially an outpost in the epidemic, serving a population with far lower rates of fatal overdoses than the neighborhoods around Park Street.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A bright-eyed puppy just might be what you need to get in the holiday spirit. Families can host a shelter pet from the Brandywine Valley SPCA for a short stay over the holiday season, as part of the organization’s holiday sleepovers program. BVSPCA says the program gives pets a “much needed” break from life in the shelter while giving families a fun guest during the holidays. “Sleepovers have been shown to reduce stress for shelter animals, and we also learn more about the pet’s personality in a more natural environment,” Walt Fenstermacher of BVSPCA said in a statement. There are two sleepover options: the “Santa Sleepover,” for pickup Dec. 20-23 and return Dec. 26-30, and “Winter Break,” with pickup Dec. 20-23 and return Jan. 2-5. This is BVSPCA’s second year offering holiday sleepovers. Last year, more than 30 pets spent the holidays with a family.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Public safety advocates say the Metro put riders of a crippled Red Line train in danger, possibly breaking a federal guideline and its own policy, by sending a train full of people toward tracks that were seen sparking moments earlier, WUSA-TV reports. “There was a moment of panic,” says Joe Twinem, who took video of the incident in a tunnel near Tenleytown Metro. It was the first of three such arcing track insulator incidents that snarled morning and evening rushes last week. Twinem says a smoky haze filled his train car. Firefighter Dave Statter, a former WUSA9 reporter, calls the incident similar to the 2015 tunnel fire that killed a woman. The National Transportation Safety Board subsequently told Metro to stop using trains carrying passengers to investigate track problems. Metro is investigating the incident.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Universal Parks and Resorts on Monday pledged 20 acres of land for affordable housing in the state, a day before the company asked county officials for millions of dollars for road construction that will allow it to build a third theme park, Epic Universe. The theme park company said the land for affordable housing will accommodate 1,000 mixed-use housing units in Orlando. The metro area is in the middle of an affordable housing crisis for its hospitality-driven workforce. Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings has made affordable housing a top priority and had recommended working with corporate partners to come up with solutions to the metro area’s housing needs. Universal also said it would make another 3 acres available for mass transit.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The mayor ordered city courts Monday to soon begin restricting public access to records involving people cited for minor marijuana offenses. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms issued an administrative order that Atlanta’s Municipal Court by Feb. 1 must make court records for possession of less than an ounce of marijuana accessible only to law enforcement. Bottoms said in a statement that racial disparities in criminal cases involving small amounts of pot justified the change. “The fact remains that communities of color are disproportionately affected by the lingering stigma of victimless, minor offenses – even long after the accused have paid their debts,” Bottoms said. “This outmoded practice deprives our communities and workforce of brilliant and promising minds, all because of an unfair justice system that can and will be course-corrected.” The American Civil Liberties Union applauded the move.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Hawaii County has proceeded with efforts to restore access to public roads inundated by lava following the opening of a Big Island highway last month. About 13 miles of public roads were covered by lava from the 2018 Kilauea volcanic eruption affecting portions of Highway 137, Highway 132, Pohoiki Road and others, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Temporary access was established to Highway 137 a year ago, and Highway 132 was restored last month, officials said. However, multiple other affected roads have remained closed throughout southeast Hawaii Island. Highway 132 was fully covered by the Federal Highways Administration, but reimbursement for other affected roads would need to come through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, officials said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A portion of a lawsuit brought by an Idaho family against the U.S. government after a boy and his dog tripped a cyanide-spraying, predator-killing trap near their home has been dismissed. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill dismissed all personal injury claims Friday related to cyanide exposure to Mark and Theresa Mansfield and their son. Canyon Mansfield was playing with his dog in March 2017 near his home when the then-14-year-old triggered the trap that the U.S. Department of Agriculture placed to kill coyotes. The dog named Casey died. Winmill agreed with U.S. Department of Justice attorney Michele Greif that the Mansfields didn’t prove they experienced ill effects from cyanide exposure or will experience them in the future. The devices, called M-44s, are embedded in the ground and look like lawn sprinklers.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: City agencies are telling people to stop feeding the raccoons that populate the city’s northern lakefront. People are hand-feeding kitchen scraps to the dozens of raccoons living in the area, which the agencies say is dangerous, WBBM-TV reports. “We ask that visitors not feed wildlife in parks or along the lakefront for their own safety and the health and wellness of the animals,” Chicago Park District spokeswoman Irene Tostado said in a statement. Chicago Animal Care and Control said it has not received any raccoon-related service requests from the area. Raccoons are rabies carriers and can transfer other diseases and pests such as roundworm, the Humane Society advises.\n\nIndiana\n\nVincennes: A preservation group that saved an ornate church from demolition has found a buyer who plans to turn it into a rural retreat. Indiana Landmarks spent seven years trying to find a buyer for the former Palmyra Cumberland Presbyterian Church, located just outside Vincennes in southwestern Indiana. That perseverance recently paid off when the nonprofit found a private, out-of-state buyer for the Gothic-Revival church, which dates back to 1892. The new owner plans to restore the building and use it as a rural retreat. The church, designed by local architect J.W. Gaddis, retains many of its original, ornate features, including limestone accents and decorative metal finials. The steeple even houses the church’s original bell. Tommy Kleckner, director of Indiana Landmarks’ Western Regional Landmarks Office, says the group took a loss on the sale – at less than $30,000 – because staff felt the building was well worth saving.\n\nIowa\n\nCenterville: A Nativity scene removed from a county courthouse lawn in southern Iowa won’t be returning. The scene was erected Nov. 18 outside the Appanoose County Courthouse in Centerville, but some residents complained that a religious display should not be placed on government property. City Administrator Jason Fraser had approved the display’s location but told organizers it needed to be moved before Thanksgiving. It took until Dec. 9 before enough volunteers could be gathered to move the display off the lawn and to a new spot about two blocks south. The county owns the building and the land underneath; the city owns the lawn. The Daily Iowegian reports that at Monday’s City Council meeting, several speakers sharply criticized the scene’s removal and asked that it be moved back.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A 13-year-old girl who was arrested for making her fingers into the shape of a gun and pointing at classmates has been placed on a juvenile diversion program. The Overland Park girl, who was originally charged with felony threatening, was set to go before a judge Tuesday, but the Johnson County Juvenile Court hearing was canceled. A spokeswoman for the Johnson County district attorney confirmed she is on diversion but provided no details, The Kansas City Star reports. Under diversion, a charge can be dismissed if a juvenile successfully meets certain conditions set by authorities. The girl’s mother told The Star previously that a boy asked her daughter who she would kill if she could kill five classmates. The girl reportedly made the shape of a gun with her fingers and pointed at four students, then herself.\n\nKentucky\n\nHodgenville: The Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park is offering a new book club, and the first book selection will be about the former president’s wife. The first Parks and Pages Book Club discussion will be held Jan. 24 on the book “Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Keckly: The Remarkable Story of the Friendship Between a First Lady and a Former Slave,” according to a statement from the National Park Service. People can attend at the Kentucky park or join a virtual discussion on the park’s Facebook page using the “Facebook Live” feature. The park service says all books during the club’s first year will be on the same theme: presidential first ladies. The book for January can be purchased in the park’s bookstore, and a couple of copies are available in the park’s library. More book titles will be announced throughout 2020.\n\nLouisiana\n\nDenham Springs: The city has created a housing board that will address the issue of properties that are still dilapidated three years after a flood destroyed most of the area. The 2016 flood devastated much of the Livingston Parish area. Officials in Denham Springs said they’ve been lenient and patient with residents whose homes were damaged by the flood. However, Mayor Gerard Landry told The Advocate that now is the time to focus on the community and neighbors who are living near potentially hazardous homes. “We’ve kind of had a hands-off approach for the last few years out of compassion, but at some point in time I have to have more compassion for the people next door,” Landry said. The Housing Appeals Board, made up of city officials, will meet monthly to discuss the 70 homes in the city that are vacant and deteriorating.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Someone spray-painted graffiti about the treatment of the homeless on the sidewalk outside City Hall, police said Monday. The graffiti states, “No one deserves to be out in the cold,” and “No cap on the new shelter.” Advocates for the homeless have been lobbying city officials to make sure everyone who needs shelter is afforded it at a new facility 5 miles from the old one. The city said in a statement that it “respects all opinions regarding policy matters, but we do not tolerate criminal acts, and defacing city property is not the right way to share your message.” Officials said the city plans to press charges if the person or people who made the graffiti are located. Meanwhile, the graffiti is being removed from the plaza outside City Hall.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city is renaming a courthouse after the late Congressman Elijah Cummings. The Baltimore Sun reports the City Council voted to make the change Monday. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young had asked the council to push the legislation forward. He intends to sign the bill and formally unveil the new name for Courthouse East in the near future. Cummings was chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. He was also a powerful advocate for Baltimore and civil rights. He died in October. Young said in a statement that the courthouse will “stand in perpetuity as a monument to Cummings’ service to the common man, the rule of law in our society, and his commitment to economic justice for all.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city’s Museum of Fine Arts is hosting a holiday celebration with music and free tours of its collection of Jewish art. Wednesday afternoon’s event will mark the sixth year the museum has hosted a Hanukkah observance. It’s being presented in partnership with the Jewish Arts Collaborative and the Combined Jewish Philanthropies organization. Participants will hear traditional songs performed in Yiddish and Hebrew, and events for children include dancing, storytelling and arts and crafts. Organizers say it’s the largest community Hanukkah gathering in Boston. A centerpiece of the celebration is “Brighter Beyond,” a collaborative, interactive blacklight experience that invites visitors to add their light to a glowing installation led by artist Tova Speter. The museum will offer tours of its Judaica collection and four 15-minute talks. It will also offer Hannukah treats such as latkes.\n\nMichigan\n\nMarquette: A snowstorm that swept across parts of the Midwest and dumped as much as 2 feet of snow in the state last month formed ideal conditions for skiing and snowmobile riding in the Upper Peninsula, but crews are still busy clearing fallen trees blocking trails. Though many trails remain open, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources cautioned that some may be impassable and said riders must be extra alert for logs, rocks or stumps that could be obscured by the snow. “The number of downed trees and limbs is astonishing,” said Rob Katona, central Upper Peninsula trails specialist with the DNR’s Parks and Recreation Division. “We haven’t seen conditions like this in recent history.” The heavy snow weighed down young birches, oaks and other small trees, leaving them arched to the ground across trails, sometimes entirely buried under the snow, the Iron Mountain Daily News reports.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state’s Board of Pardons has approved a request that could lead to a posthumous pardon for a man convicted of sexually assaulting a Duluth woman in 1920. Max Mason was among a group of black circus workers accused in the assault. Three were lynched from a light pole by an angry mob of local residents. Two others went to trial, and Mason was the only one convicted. His supporters believe he was falsely accused and say a pardon would restore justice in a “horrific and shameful episode in Minnesota history.” The board’s vote could open the door for another review of Mason’s original pardon request, which was denied in 1924. Mason was convicted on what some thought was weak evidence. Supporters noted a lack of evidence corroborating the woman’s allegation and a physician’s exam that appeared to contradict her claim, according to the Minnesota Historical Society.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s Small Business Administration is now offering low-interest loans to homeowners, businesses and nonprofit organizations who suffered losses when torrential rain caused widespread flooding last spring. The National Weather Service estimates some south Mississippi areas received up to 15 inches of rain in a span of days in May 2019, washing out train tracks, flooding rivers and prompting water rescues, news outlets report. To help in the recovery, Gov. Phil Bryant wrote to the administration last month requesting assistance for eight heavily affected counties, The Biloxi Sun-Herald reports. The Small Business Administration approved business disaster loans, economic injury loans for nonprofits and home disaster loans for citizens last week.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Elected officials in Jackson County are adding plaques to statues of the Kansas City area county’s namesake noting that the nation’s seventh president was a slave owner and forced thousands of Native Americans off their lands. The plaques that will be added to statues of Andrew Jackson outside courthouses in downtown Kansas City and in nearby Independence will note: “Almost two centuries later, we hold a broader, more inclusive view of our nation,” KMBC-TV reports. Jackson began his term as president in 1829, almost three years after the Missouri State Legislature named the county after him because he was a hero of the War of 1812. “This statue of Jackson reminds us we are on a path that, in the immortal words of Martin Luther King Jr., bends toward justice. In turn, we must acknowledge the past injustices to help us create a greater nation built upon humane policies to light our way and the way of humanity everywhere,” the plaques will read.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: One of Glacier National Park’s most infamous thoroughfares is scheduled for a much-needed face lift next year. Many Glacier Road, which provides access to the popular Many Glacier Hotel and some of the park’s most well trafficked hikes, will be closed to vehicles from April 1 to May 17 and again from Sept. 21 to Dec. 16. During the intervening months, construction projects on the road are anticipated to cause delays of at least 40 minutes and as long as three hours each way from the nearby town of Babb to the Many Glacier Hotel. The construction project is expected to continue in 2021, the Flathead Beacon reports. For years, travel on Many Glacier Road has been an unpleasant adventure for park visitors. The road runs along the Sherburne Reservoir, and the waters of the artificial reservoir have contributed to instability underneath the roadway, causing massive potholes and dramatic undulations.\n\nNebraska\n\nScottsbluff: The City Council has reduced its funding commitment to the local zoo, a commitment that includes a contingency clause for further cuts if city sales tax revenue were to drop. The agreement approved Monday night runs for five years at $300,000 a year, a drop of $50,000 yearly from the 10-year commitment that ends in September next year. The $350,000 a year was becoming unsustainable because of lower sales tax revenue and city spending increases, city officials have said. Riverside director Anthony Mason said fundraisers and private donations could make up the funding difference. Any further reduction of funding would have to be approved by a three-fourths vote of the City Council. Scottsbluff City Manager Nathan Johnson says the hope is that by investing in the zoo, the returning tourism dollars will stimulate city’s sales tax revenue.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: With costs falling for hepatitis C treatment, state prisons are launching a program to test all inmates for the blood-borne virus. The Department of Corrections has budgeted about $6.8 million and plans to hire contract staff to screen all inmates in coming months, including those just entering the system, Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Nevada has about 13,000 men and women at seven correctional centers, nine conservation camps and two transitional housing facilities, corrections department spokesman Scott Kelley said. In a report Friday to the Legislature’s Interim Finance Committee, deputy prisons chief John Borrowman called curing chronic hepatitis C before releasing inmates “an invaluable step toward (virus) elimination and successful community reintegration.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nFranconia: A shelter located inside a 19th-century barn is planned to undergo an ambitious reconstruction. The Bancroft House has planned demolition and reconstruction of its Franconia property after decades of struggling financially, the Caledonian Record reports. The barn currently offers free room and board to residents, allowing them to save up the rent and deposits required for securing housing when they leave. “Currently the barn’s floor has collapsed, and critters have easy access to the interior, preventing us from accepting linens, towels, and anything with fabric or stuffing, which rodents will quickly use as nesting material,” says Kevin Johnson, a member of the shelter’s board of directors. The organization has spent the past few years trying to improve the nonprofit’s financial health, and demolition has proven to be the most cost-effective way to address the deteriorating structure.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Wildlife officials are extending the second phase of the state’s black bear hunt because the harvest objectives for the year have not been met. The six-day hunt had concluded Saturday. But it will now resume Wednesday and continue through Saturday. Officials say 265 bears were harvested during the first phase of the hunt in October. Another 37 were culled last week, meaning 302 bruins were killed overall. New Jersey’s bear management policy mandates that the hunting season be extended by four days if less than 20% of tagged bears are killed. The harvest rate for this season stands at 14.7%. That harvest rate is deemed necessary to provide better ecological balance to the bear population and reduce the potential for bear-human encounters.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: New Mexico State University has been awarded a grant that will go toward building the only botanic garden within 100 miles of the southern New Mexico campus. The garden will be used to grow and study plants native to New Mexico and the Chihuahuan Desert that might attract bees and other pollinators. In addition to the research side, officials are aiming to create a garden that will be welcoming for visitors. The plan incorporates paths throughout the garden and a large gazebo for shade and outdoor events. Rather than straight rows of plants, it will be designed using a paisley pattern made up of four repetitions with the same plants in each plot. Officials say it will likely take several years for the garden to be completed.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed new legislation Tuesday that would close a loophole in state law that often prevents prosecutors from bringing rape charges when victims become drunk of their own volition. The governor wants to amend the state’s definition of who cannot legally consent to sexual activity. That currently does not include someone who remains conscious – but is too drunk to consent – after becoming voluntarily intoxicated. “While New York has some of the most aggressive laws in the nation when it comes to combating this insidious disease, a loophole in current law allows rapists to walk free and vacate their heinous crimes based on a legal technicality,” Cuomo said in a statement. “Our laws must protect the people of this state – not condone rape as a punishment for consuming alcohol.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMonroe: An item found in the state in 1973 may be thousands of years old, according to the state’s office of archaeology. The 7-inch carved artifact found by a Monroe landowner is suspected to be a grooved adz, a tool used for smoothing or trimming wood, The Charlotte Observer reports. It could have been used to carve bowls, dugout canoes or other objects, according to a North Carolina Office of State Archaeology statement. The item’s age is unclear, but it may have been made about the time when many grooved axes were being made and used, according to the office’s 3D model and description of the item. That means it likely dates to the Late Archaic period between 3,000 and 1,000 B.C. Indigenous groups in the area over the years include the Catawba Nation and the Lumbee Tribe, according to the Observer.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A group seeking to legalize recreational marijuana in the state can begin circulating petitions to try to bring the issue to voters. Secretary of State Al Jaeger approved the format of the petition Monday. LegalizeND would need to gather and submit nearly 13,500 signatures by July 6 to get a proposed measure on November ballot. The proposed measure would allow any person over the age of 21 to use, possess and transport up to 2 ounces of prepared marijuana, but it would ban home growing of the plant. The group gathered enough signatures to put a legalization measure on the ballot in 2018, but that effort failed 41% to 59%.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state unveiled its new Ohio School Safety Center on Tuesday as a panel that will advise that office begins its work. The new office under Ohio Homeland Security is intended to help educators and police prevent and address violence involving schools and students. It began its work months ago with a staff that included intelligence analysts scanning social media and websites for threats. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine has said the center also will review school safety plans, help train school threat-assessment teams and share best practices. It will get input from a new working group whose 40-plus members were announced Monday. Among them are representatives of schools and school employees who work with students in crisis, as well as emergency responders, other state offices and organizations that promote children’s wellness.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt said Tuesday that he’s taking over gambling negotiations with Native American tribes from the attorney general and plans to hire his own out-of-state legal team. Stitt also announced at a news conference that he intends to offer tribes an extension that would allow casino gambling to continue after Jan. 1, when Stitt maintains the current compacts expire. “The language in this extension will allow each side who signs on to the extension to retain their legal positions,” Stitt said. “I want business to continue as usual while we resolve this dispute.” Attorney General Mike Hunter took over several months ago as the state’s lead negotiator with the tribes, but Stitt said Tuesday that he felt it was best to have “one unified voice.” He said his office is working on finalizing a contract with an out-of-state law firm to assist his office in negotiating with the tribes.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Members of a homeless encampment are planning to stage a protest at the Capitol, possibly this week, after a citywide camping ban went into effect Monday. The plan was announced as city officials prepared to give the homeless 24 hours’ notice Tuesday to depart the camp at The ARCHES Project, a downtown social services provider. Those who refuse to leave could face civil citations. “We have nowhere to go now,” said Anthony Stevens, the camp’s unofficial spokesman. “We can’t go back to the parks, we can’t go to where we can hide, because they’re just going to come in, mow everything over and send us on our way.” The ban, passed at the start of December with a two-week delay, was aimed at clearing city sidewalks and other public property of homeless camps. City councilors OK’d the ban but aborted a proposal to prohibit sitting and lying on sidewalks.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Policymakers announced a task force Monday that will take a broad look at the state’s juvenile justice system in hopes of improving the results it produces. Legislative leaders and Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf announced formation of the group at a Capitol news conference, giving it nearly a year to issue recommendations about how to make people safer, improve accountability and save tax dollars. Its members will be appointed by Wolf, the court system and the Legislature. House Majority Leader Bryan Cutler, R-Lancaster, said the concept is to use data and research to reconfigure the juvenile justice system to improve results. “I’d like to say there is no such thing as a bad kid,” said Sen. Mike Regan, R-York. “However, we all know kids do bad things.” Wolf said the project will build on clean slate legislation, reductions in the state prison inmate population, an end to automatic driver’s license suspensions and other adult justice reform changes in recent years.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Critics of a state campaign finance law say it violates the First Amendment. The law requires the disclosure of the top five donors behind any campaign communication during state election cycles. In addition, it requires groups producing the communications to file public reports of any donor who gave more than $1,000. The law is the subject of a federal lawsuit filed by conservative advocacy groups, though it also has critics on the left, The Boston Globe reports. Critics of the bill have argued that identifying donors encourages them not to participate in the democratic process. Supporters of the bill have argued that it will enlighten voters as to who is trying to influence their decision at the ballot.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A prosecutor said he will decide by January how to handle convicted and sentenced to a year in prison for using his power and office to push a personal assistant to have sex with him. The other charges against ex-Greenville County Sheriff Will Lewis cover a range of additional misconduct including lying about conducting a background check on a deputy, giving someone a badge who was not qualified and intimidating his employees to try to keep them from cooperating with investigators. The evidence, including recorded phone calls, made the affair case the strongest to get a conviction, so prosecutors decided to try Lewis on two counts of misconduct in office first, Solicitor Kevin Brackett says.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A little boy who always dreamed of getting a train for Christmas finds himself on a magical adventure – with a distinctly Black Hills twist – in a new book starring the 1880 Train. “Marlon McDoogle’s Magical Night” introduces readers to 12-year-old Marlon, who’s waiting for a Christmas surprise his grandfather promised him. However, Marlon could never predict what would happen when his grandfather arrives on Christmas Eve and tells the boy, “We have lots of work to do!” The pair drives off in Grandpa McDoogle’s old truck for an unforgettable encounter with visitors from the North Pole and a wild ride aboard the 1880 Train. The book is the latest project from Sean Covel of Deadwood, the producer of films including “Napoleon Dynamite” and the author of “Porter the Hoarder” books that were recently distributed in elementary schools throughout South Dakota, the Rapid City Journal reports.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A nonprofit group has handed over statues of Confederate leaders Nathan Bedford Forrest and Jefferson Davis to the Sons of Confederate Veterans, two years after they were removed from public parks in the city, officials said Tuesday. City of Memphis legal officer Bruce McMullen said the statues of Forrest and Davis have been given to Forrest’s descendants and the Sons of Confederate Veterans “to display them as they wish.” The statues’ location was not disclosed, but they could be re-erected at some point. Memphis and the Confederate veterans’ group have battled in court over the statues’ removal from two city parks. Forrest’s equestrian statue, which stood over the grave of the Confederate general and his wife, and the monument of Davis, the Confederate president, were removed from the parks under the cover of night Dec. 20, 2017.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A 19-year-old man has been arrested after mercury was found spilled in the city, leading dozens of people to be decontaminated as a precaution, FBI said Monday. The agency’s Houston office said on Twitter that Christopher Lee Melder has been charged with burglary and unlawful disposal of hazardous material. He is also charged on an outstanding felony drug possession warrant. It wasn’t immediately known whether he had a lawyer, and authorities didn’t immediately say if the spills were intentional. City officials said, according to the FBI, that he broke into a lab at an undisclosed location and took the mercury. Someone called 911 about 11:15 a.m. Sunday to report a white liquid on the ground, Houston Fire Chief Sam Pena has said. Officials later determined less than a pint of mercury was spilled outside a Walmart, a Sonic Drive-In and gas station.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints defended Tuesday how it uses and invests member donations after a former church employee charged in a complaint to the Internal Revenue Service that the faith had improperly built a $100 billion investment portfolio using member donations that are supposed to go to charitable causes. The vast majority of member donations are used to fund church operations, temples, missions, education and humanitarian needs, while another portion is “methodically safeguarded through wise financial management and the building of a prudent reserve for the future,” church spokesman Eric Hawkins said in a statement. The IRS complaint from a former church investment manager alleges the Utah-based faith sets aside about $1 billion a year from the $7 billion it receives annually in member donations, the Washington Post reports.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Voters in the city will have a say in March 2020 on whether legal noncitizens can vote in city elections. The City Council passed a resolution Monday to go to voters. The charter change would have to approved by the Legislature, WCAX-TV reports. Independent Burlington City Councilor Adam Roof had pushed the proposal, saying that all Burlington residents are affected by decisions made by the local government, regardless of their citizenship status, so they should be allowed to vote. A similar charter change in Montpelier stalled in the Senate during the last legislative session, after it was approved in the House.\n\nVirginia\n\nArlington: A redevelopment plan for Amazon’s second headquarters has been unanimously approved by a county board, clearing the way for the company to transform 6.2 acres into twin 22-story buildings. The Arlington County Board voted 5-0 on Saturday to give Amazon final approval to began building the headquarters known as HQ2, news outlets report. HQ2 will be an approximately 2 million-square-foot mixed-use set of buildings that will house a day care facility for employees and other residents, ground-level retail shops, an underground parking garage and an indoor event space for county-sanctioned events. Amazon promised the county a $20 million commitment for affordable housing because the site was once zoned for residential use and because the company is adding 590,000 square feet of density to the area.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The Spokane Tribe of Indians will finally be compensated after some of their ancestral homelands were flooded by the giant Grand Coulee Dam seven decades ago. The U.S. House on Monday approved and sent to President Donald Trump a bill that sets up yearly payments to the tribe based on a similar system for the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, who also lost land when the dam and its reservoir were created. The Spokesman-Review reports the Spokane Tribe will receive $6 million a year for 10 years and $8 million a year after that. The money will come from revenues of the Bonneville Power Administration, which sells electricity generated by Grand Coulee and other federal dams in the Northwest. Trump is expected to sign the bill, the newspaper reports.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPoint Pleasant: The site of a bridge that collapsed 52 years ago and killed dozens of people has been recognized as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. The American Society of Civil Engineers’ recognition for Silver Bridge was announced Sunday during a ceremony where the suspension bridge once stood, news outlets report. The bridge named for the color of its aluminum paint crossed the Ohio River, connecting Point Pleasant, West Virginia, and Gallipolis, Ohio, and first opened to traffic in 1928. It collapsed Dec. 15, 1967. Eyewitnesses reported it took seconds for the bridge to fold like a deck of cards, sending dozens of cars and people into the water below. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined the collapse was caused by an eyebar that fractured due to stress corrosion and corrosion fatigue.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The new leader of the state’s jobs agency is pledging to refuse to award state tax credits to technology manufacturing giant Foxconn for employees who don’t work in Wisconsin – but a new state audit shows the agency’s procedures leave the door open. For the second time in as many years, the nonpartisan Legislature Audit Bureau is warning the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. to change its procedures to ensure taxpayers don’t end up paying for work that doesn’t benefit the state economy. Foxconn struck a deal in 2017 with state lawmakers to build a $10 billion LCD panel manufacturing facility in southeastern Wisconsin in exchange for $3 billion in state incentives. The project – once hailed by President Donald Trump as the “eighth wonder of world” – has since been scaled back, but the state’s contract with the company hasn’t changed.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state Republican Party has passed a resolution opposing the addition of another vaccine to the requirements for children in school. The Department of Health is considering changes to vaccine rules that will be sent to Republican Gov. Mark Gordon for approval, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. The department added meningococcal vaccine to the required list of school inoculations. The disease can cause meningitis, a life-threatening illness that attacks the central nervous system. The GOP resolution said the party opposes adding the meningococcal vaccine to the required list due to statements from U.S. Supreme Court justices about a vaccine “regulatory void.” The resolution also referred to money paid by a national program to compensate those injured by vaccines and a Johns Hopkins University study saying medical or hospital error is a leading cause of U.S. deaths.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/18"}]}

Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.\n\nCNN —\n\nFriendships aren’t just about those you sit with on the school bus or play alongside on your childhood baseball team — they are a core component of the human experience, experts say.\n\nBut making and retaining deep, meaningful friendships as an adult is hard, especially for men, according to research.\n\nLess than half of men report being satisfied with their friendships, and only about 1 in 5 said they had received emotional support from a friend in the last week, compared with 4 in 10 women, according to a 2021 survey from the Survey Center on American Life.\n\nThe falling off of friendships between men begins around middle and late adolescence and grows starker in adulthood, said Judy Yi-Chung Chu, who teaches a class on boys’ psychological development at Stanford University. And those who do maintain friendships with other men say they tend to have lower levels of emotional intimacy than women report.\n\n“Boys don’t start emotionally disconnected; they become emotionally disconnected,” said Dr. Niobe Way, a researcher and a professor of applied psychology at New York University.\n\nAll humans have the innate capacity and desire for close, emotionally intimate connections with others. We need these relationships for survival as babies and then to thrive as we get older, Chu said.\n\nResearch has shown close friendships protect our mental and physical health, she added. And men who prioritize those relationships are fighting off one of the most harmful things to human health — loneliness, said Dr. Frank Sileo, a psychologist based in Ridgewood, New Jersey.\n\n“What (men) are at risk of losing is this sense of not being alone in the world or not being alone in their experience,” Sileo said. Research has shown “disclosure of emotional distress improved (men’s) emotional well-being, increased feelings of being understood and resulted in less reported loneliness,” he added.\n\nJust as many men strive to eat right, exercise, succeed in their careers and raise children, men should prioritize developing friendships as adults, he said.\n\nWhy it’s so hard for men to make close friends\n\nWhen Sileo first began conducting research on male friendships in 1995, many participants assumed his survey was about homosexuality, he said. Such stereotypes that male bonding would be, or become, sexual in nature are inaccurate but revealed some of what may be holding some men back from deep friendships, he added.\n\nAssumptions nearly 30 years later might be different, but social pressures remain that make it difficult for men to express the vulnerability and intimacy needed for close friendships, Sileo said.\n\nWe are all born with two sides of ourselves: the hard side that is stoic and independent and the soft one that is vulnerable and interdependent, said Way, author of “Deep Secrets: Boys’ Friendships and the Crisis of Connection.”\n\nThe hard side has been characterized as masculine and inherently preferable, and the soft side has been seen as feminine and lesser than, Way said.\n\nBoys receive messages that growing up and “manning up” mean shedding that soft side — a mindset that neuroscience, social science and developmental psychology all show is harmful to them, Way said.\n\n“We gender relationships as feminine,” Chu said. “If that’s a feminine thing, it becomes a weakness or a liability if (men) admit to needing friendships.”\n\nCharacterizing the gender of these experiences has a clear impact, Sileo said. Men who were more emotionally restricted, focused on power and who scored high on surveys measuring homophobia are less likely to have intimate and close friendships, he said.\n\nAnd the drive to toughen up and never show vulnerability that restricts men from friendships can lead them to loneliness, violence and anger, Way said.\n\n“We live in a culture that clashes with our nature,” she said. “If we raise children to go against their nature, we shouldn’t be surprised if some of those children grow up to struggle.”\n\nWhy your partner isn’t enough\n\nHeterosexual men seeking closeness might turn to those they see as better at building relationships and feel comfortable exploring their vulnerability with: the women in their lives and their romantic partners, Way said.\n\nIt may seem like a good solution, but it works neither for the men nor the women they look to, Sileo said.\n\nPutting everything on a romantic partner can strain a relationship, he said, whether it is going to a female partner exclusively for emotional support or depending on her to cultivate friendships and get-togethers for holidays and weekends.\n\nIt is crucial to have multiple people to go to for support for different perspectives, Chu added.\n\n“(Men) need to know it’s not just a woman thing,” she said. “They need to know that men can do it, too.”\n\nCommunity is important, and keeping struggles, questions and concerns with one person or one relationship doesn’t always provide the best help to see them through, Way said.\n\n“A male partner thinks it’s betrayal to talk to another person,” Way said, “but the female partner is saying, ‘Please do it, please get other perspectives.’”\n\nHow to build male friendships\n\nIf you are wishing you had close friendships or that the ones you have went deeper, experts say it’s OK to start small.\n\nYou don’t even have to disclose your own vulnerabilities at first, Chu said.\n\n“A very powerful place to start is listening and asking real questions,” she said. “All people love when they can trust that this situation is safe and that someone is genuinely interested in them.”\n\nThe key is to move beyond banter and general niceties and ask questions you find meaningful, such as what friends like about their jobs or what happens to their feelings after breakups, Way said. Don’t worry. It’s not rude to do so. Most people report wanting to be asked these questions, she said.\n\nEach relationship has its own rules and protocol, and it’s good to work within these, Sileo said. You might start asking something of a friend and find that person is hesitant to talk about it, Chu said. If this is the case, you can jump in and offer your own vulnerability by talking about how that topic might be bothering you or how you’ve been thinking about it.\n\nSometimes the rules of the relationship might mean avoiding the vulnerability of sitting face-to-face, Sileo said.\n\nIn those cases, find an activity such as the gym, work or a community project where you can connect side by side through a shared purpose, Sileo added.\n\nAnd if you need to build friendships from scratch, follow the lead of the women in your life and ask someone to grab coffee or a bite to eat, Way said.\n\nPutting in time, effort and intention is the key, Sileo said. Showing up and spending time is crucial to building those important friendships.\n\n“Quality counts here,” he said. “If you can have a handful of friends that are quality, that’s better than having a slew of friends.”", "authors": ["Madeline Holcombe"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2023/02/03/male-friendship-lonely-close-friends-men/11162423002/", "title": "'Close' movie director talks male friendship, 'epidemic of loneliness'", "text": "Are men OK? In all likelihood, they'll never tell you.\n\nOnly 21% of men say they received emotional support from a friend within the past week, compared to 41% of women, according to a 2021 survey by the Survey Center on American Life. Similarly, just 25% of men say they've said \"I love you\" to a friend recently, as opposed to 49% of women.\n\nIt's part of an \"epidemic of loneliness\" that director Lukas Dhont says he wanted to explore in his new drama \"Close\" (now in theaters nationwide), which is Oscar-nominated for best foreign language film and follows two inseparable teen boys.\n\n\"We live in this society that tells young men that there are things we validate more than tenderness and vulnerability,\" Dhont says. \"We teach young men to stop caring for authentic connections and (be) more distant with emotions. It's an incredibly brutal thing.\"\n\nWhat is 'Close' about?\n\n\"Close\" begins with Léo (Eden Dambrine) and Rémi (Gustav De Waele) during summer vacation: running, biking and napping together in the idyllic Belgian countryside. They think nothing of their close connection – sharing beds at sleepovers or resting their heads on each other's shoulders – until they return to middle school, where they are teased and called homophobic slurs by their classmates. Self-conscious, Léo starts avoiding Rémi and joins a hockey team. Rémi, meanwhile, becomes deeply depressed.\n\nDhont was inspired to make the movie after reading psychologist Niobe Way's 2013 nonfiction book \"Deep Secrets: Boys' Friendship and the Crisis of Connection.\"\n\n\"When Niobe (interviewed) all these 13-year-old boys, she realized how lovingly they talked about one another,\" Dhont says. \"I really connected to that. I was also a young boy who felt the power of friendship but then started to fear intimacy as I went through puberty. It was something I had always thought as very linked to me being queer. I realized after (Way's) research that it was not about me being queer, but about me being a man.\"\n\nHow we think boys should behave\n\nSociety's general discomfort with close male friendship is rooted in antiquated ideas of gender and masculinity.\n\n\"From an early age, women are socialized to be more nurturing and relationship-oriented than men, who are often taught to perceive intimacy as effeminate or weak,\" says Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life. \"There's all sorts of societal norms that lead men and women in very different directions when it comes friendship, what function it serves, and what to expect from a friend.\"\n\nPart of the problem is that young men are encouraged to build \"shoulder-to-shoulder friendships\" in team sports or group activities, rather than one-on-one relationships.\n\n\"Girls and women tend to feel more comfortable in face-to-face interactions,\" says Dr. Geoffrey Greif, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Social Work. \"Some parents might say if they're watching their (boys) play a lot of sports and competing with another guy, that may be more typical. Whereas if they're seeing them have long, private discussions, that would tend to go against gender expectations.\"\n\nHomophobia creates 'deep stigma' around male friendship\n\nAlthough the parents in \"Close\" don't blink at Léo and Rémi's friendship, other students mock them for hugging and sitting together.\n\n\"We are conditioned to look at that closeness as something sexual,\" Dhont says. \"We're so unused to seeing that intimacy in a platonic way that we immediately sexualize it.\"\n\nNick Fager, a mental health counselor and co-founder of Expansive Therapy, attributes such fears of male intimacy to pervasive, often unconscious homophobia.\n\n\"Loving friendship between boys is usually allowed up until a certain age in our culture, but homophobia takes hold and creates a deep stigma around boys who love each other,\" Fager says. \"Boys then have to make a choice between staying in the tribe and surviving, or keeping their hearts open to their friends and being cast out.\"\n\nYoung men need to see vulnerability is OK\n\nAccording to the Survey Center on American Life, the number of people who say they have no close friends has quadrupled since 1990. Young men, in particular, are 12% more likely than women to rely on their parents for personal support, instead of reaching out to a friend.\n\nBut close friendships are paramount to our mental and physical health: A study published by Psychological Science journal in 2018 found that boys who spent more time with their friends as children had lower obesity and blood pressure as adults.\n\n\"Research says people with good social networks live longer, happier, healthier lives,\" Greif says. \"If you feel you can't ask for support from a friend, you're going to experience greater social isolation.\"\n\nAs a father himself, Cox says he tries to model meaningful friendships to his two sons, showing them that \"it doesn't have to all be superficial: You can talk about deep and important things, and not worry about being made fun of.\"\n\nHollywood \"bromantic\" comedies also tend to make light of male friendship, rather than give it the weight it deserves. But films like \"Close\" can help show young men – queer and straight – positive examples of male intimacy.\n\n\"They need to have role models and actually see men being vulnerable with each other,\" Fager says. \"If there are no examples around them of male love and vulnerability, and they are just told that intimate friendship with men is healthy and normal, the message won’t stick and the wound will get perpetuated.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/05/03/gen-z-loneliest-generation-social-media-personal-interactions-column/574701002/", "title": "Gen Z is the loneliest generation, and it's not just because of social ...", "text": "Katrina Trinko\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nAt a time when we’re supposedly more connected than ever, there are an awful lot of lonely people.\n\n“Nearly half of Americans report sometimes or always feeling alone or left out,” according to a new survey from health company Cigna. One out of five Americans has no person they can talk to.\n\nAnd the loneliest generation? That would be Generation Z, defined in this survey as those 18 to 22. Their average loneliness score is nearly 10 points higher than the least lonely generation — the Greatest Generation, those 72 and older.\n\nWhile it’s tempting to blame Gen Z’s reliance on smartphones and social media, the data don’t bear that out: The survey didn’t find a significant difference in loneliness levels between those who used social media often or infrequently.\n\nMore:Aziz Ansari lesson: Women should feel free to hurt the guy's feelings\n\nMore:Why Ruth Bader Ginsburg is right that Millennials are key to #MeToo\n\nGiven the worrying consequences, the loneliness of Gen Z — and other generations — should be taken seriously. In fact, Cigna, citing a 2010 Brigham Young University study, says “loneliness has the same impact on mortality as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, making it even more dangerous than obesity.”\n\nOne initiative to encourage Gen Z should be #WalkUpNotOut, a movement that urged high school students to reach out to students perceived as socially isolated after the tragic high school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Regardless of your position on gun control, it can only help to have students focus on being kind and welcoming to each other, particularly when the pervasiveness of social media has made it increasingly easy to bully both on and off campuses.\n\nPlus, this encourages face-to-face interaction — and the Cigna survey found a huge difference in average loneliness scores between those who had daily meaningful in-person encounters and those who didn’t. (Astonishingly, one of five Americans surveyed reported having such encounters less frequently than once a week.)\n\nIt’s also important for Gen Z — and other Americans — to take “social capital” seriously. Thanks to the erosion of neighborhood communities, the fracturing of many families and the decline in church attendance, there are fewer and fewer opportunities for finding new friends or developing meaningful relationships. And that puts even more pressure on students. Imagine being unhappy at school and having no other community to turn to.\n\nAccording to a 2017 report prepared for Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, several factors show the decline in our interaction with each other:\n\n► Monthly church attendance fell from the early 1970s to the present, with 50% to 57% attending in the past compared with 42% to 44% now.\n\n► In 1974, a third of Americans spent time socially with their neighbors several times a week. Now, only 19% do.\n\n► We’re also spending less time schmoozing with our co-workers, going from an average of 2.5 hours a week in the mid 1970s to just under an hour in 2012.\n\n► Families are also becoming smaller, and the percentage of children raised by a single parent or no parent has doubled, from 15% to 31%.\n\nMore:Liberals need to close the Millennials funding gap\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nGiven these declining numbers, it makes sense that more Americans are falling through the cracks, losing ways to get to know other people.\n\nAnd if Gen Z is using phones instead of in-person interactions, that could be contributing to these young adults’ loneliness. In an Atlantic article last year, psychology professor Jean Twenge highlighted how teens were less interested in driving and getting out of the house than past generations.\n\nDescribing one unnamed 13-year-old, Twenge wrote: “She spent much of her summer keeping up with friends, but nearly all of it was over text or Snapchat. ‘I’ve been on my phone more than I’ve been with actual people,’ she said. ‘My bed has, like, an imprint of my body.’ ”\n\nThat’s not healthy — and if these are the habits Gen Z is developing in these crucial years, it doesn’t bode well for this generation becoming less lonely in the future.\n\nThe American writer Flannery O’Connor, a Catholic, was fond of a prayer that included these lines, “Raphael, lead us toward those we are waiting for, those who are waiting for us: Raphael, Angel of happy meeting, lead us by the hand toward those we are looking for.”\n\nYou don’t need to be religious to realize that we both need — and are needed by — others, and that our own lives grow in meaning through many of our interactions with others.\n\nIt’s easy to toss out opinions on Facebook or on bumper stickers, but at the end of the day, one of the most powerful things many of us may do to change the world could be our “hello\" to someone, our reaching out to that person who seems in danger of being on the fringe, making eye contact and sharing a smile with a homeless person even if we don’t have change. Let’s look up from our phones a little more often — and start acknowledging the people right in front of us.\n\nKatrina Trinko, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is managing editor for The Daily Signal.

Together, they repeated word-for-word in Arabic the Shahada, the profession of faith required to convert to Islam.\n\n“There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah,\" they declared at the mosque, located in a columned brick building that once housed a Cuban community center.\n\nFor Lopez, the conversion and embrace by the congregation four months ago brought a feeling of peace and a recognition of how far he’d come from a life that nearly ended 22 years ago in gang violence.\n\n“They told me, ‘Come to the mosque, you’re going to feel welcomed,’” said Lopez, 41, a truck driver and former professional boxer from North Bergen.\n\nWith their religious journey, Lopez and his 21-year-old son joined a growing segment of the Latino population who are leaving Christianity for Islam. About 8% of all Muslim Americans adults are Latino, according to a 2017 report from the Pew Research Center, increasing by about a third from 2011.\n\nIn interviews, Latino converts said they are drawn to Islam because of the intense devotion to God, a simplicity in faith and focus on community that they failed to find in their former faith. But their conversion often is not easy, as they break ties with family and their Christian upbringing.\n\nThey are also choosing the faith at a time when Latinos and Muslims alike feel targeted by President Donald Trump's rhetoric and his increasingly restrictive immigration policies for both groups. Reports of hate crimes are on the rise, while Muslims bristle against their depiction in the media. Yet for some, the shared experience of living as a minority in the U.S. is a powerful attraction.\n\n'No reason to fear’\n\nLopez, who moved to the U.S. from Puerto Rico as a child, sparred alongside Muslims while boxing who became close friends. Two events prompted him to change his life: a gang-related stabbing in 1997 and the birth of his son a year later.\n\nAt his friends' urging, he visited a mosque and started reading about the faith. But it was his son’s desire to convert years later that prompted him to finally make the leap.\n\nLopez's son, a college student also named Luis, was baptized and confirmed in the Catholic Church. While he and family members drifted away from their faith, he still felt a pull toward spiritual life. Islam appealed to him because it focused on prayers to God alone and not God and Jesus or saints, he said.\n\nAbout 94% of Latino Muslims cited the desire for a more direct, personal experience of God as a reason for converting, in a survey of 560 converts reported in \"Latino Muslims in the United States,\" a 2017 report in the Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and Religion.\n\n“From that first day, when people stayed to see us become Muslims, that was it. They find joy in it. They are genuinely happy for people who converted,” the younger Lopez said.\n\nThey are choosing Islam at a time when bias, discrimination and hate crimes are a concern. Both father and son said they didn't believe stereotypes that painted Muslims broadly as extremists or terrorists.\n\n\"They can say what they want. There is no reason to fear because you are doing the right thing,\" Lopez, 21, said.\n\nA break with tradition\n\nBut for other converts, the embrace of Islam created rifts.\n\nKhadijah Noor Tanju, who came to the U.S. from Colombia when she was 9, clashed with family who felt she was rejecting her culture and Catholic faith. A former choir singer, Tanju, whose birth name is Carol, sang in a church choir and performed the Catholic sacrament of confirmation.\n\nTensions surfaced when she married a Turkish-American man and relatives made comments about Muslims as terrorists, she said.\n\nSensing her struggles, her husband told her he would never hurt her. He was not very religious when they first met, and it dawned on her, she said, that she knew little about his faith. Privately, she began researching Islam and watching a series on YouTube about the faith.\n\nOne night, while listening to a sermon at home, she felt inspired and vowed to change her life for God. In 2015, she converted. At first, her family didn’t say much, but that changed when she began wearing the hijab, or Islamic head covering.\n\n“My family didn’t know the implications (of my conversion), that it was a lifestyle. It was more when I started to practice Islam that they were like ‘Whoa, qué pasa aquí?’” she said, using Spanish for “what's happening here.”\n\nTanju had her own struggles adjusting to the faith. She started wearing the hijab because she wanted to live an authentic and pious Muslim life, she said. But publicly, she felt as if people were watching and judging her. Privately, she worried the hijab made her look unattractive.\n\n“'Just take it off. You look ugly, disgusting, you don’t look attractive' – I kept hearing these things in my head.,” said Tanju, a teacher's aide .\n\nShe didn't know who to talk to about her worries. Later, she began attending events for new converts and volunteered at WhyIslam, a nonprofit that teaches about the faith and has a division in Spanish.\n\nAbout a year ago, she started going to weekly classes at the North Hudson Islamic Education Center in Union City where Latinos make up roughly 10% of the congregation.\n\n“I feel really happy,” she said. “I don’t feel lonely in my spiritual path.\"\n\nOutreach to Latinos\n\nLatino Muslim communities have found a home in mostly urban areas like New York City, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\n\nTheir backgrounds are diverse. About 56% converted from Catholicism and the rest from Protestant faiths or secular or atheist lives, according to the \"Latino Muslims in the United States\" report.\n\nThey differ, too, in the way they live their lives as Muslim converts. Some women wear the hijab, while others do not. Some still enjoy Christmas as a secular celebration with family, while others choose to abstain.\n\nThey are part of a religious shift for Latino Americans. Just under half – 47% – describe themselves as Catholic, down from 57% a decade ago, according to a Pew survey released last month. The share of Latino Protestants has remained steady at about a quarter of the total.\n\nFewer than 1% are Muslim, according to the survey. But that demographic has drawn attention partly because of the perception that Islam is foreign or at odds with the Latino culture typically associated with Catholicism.\n\nBut Latino Muslim groups say Islam is, in fact, part of their heritage. They say they are returning to their roots because of the nearly 800-year Moorish rule of Spain that left an Islamic influence on Hispanic language and culture.\n\nThose ties are often cited by Muslim outreach groups, said Harold Morales, associate professor of philosophy and religious studies at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nThe message is that \"we're not choosing to abandon Latinx culture or embrace marginalization. We're choosing to embrace something that's already there,\" said Morales, who wrote the 2018 book, \"Latino and Muslim in America: Race, Religion, and the Making of a New Minority.\"\n\nMorales said the 2016 election cycle, marked by a rise in hate speech and bias crimes against Latinos and Muslims, led to even closer ties as the groups mobilized around issues like immigration and discrimination.\n\nSpreading the word\n\nAt the North Hudson Islamic Educational Center, where Lopez and Tanju pray, the number of Latino converts has increased steadily since the mosque opened in 1992, said Mohammad Alhayek, the imam, or spiritual leader, of the mosque.\n\nAt the mosque, it's not unusual to spot a Spanish-language Quran or see empanadas served alongside foods from the Middle East at potluck dinners.\n\n\"Our vision is to share the true teachings of Islam, the guidance of Islam, with as many people (as we can) in the North Jersey Hudson area,\" Alhayek said. \"That is our first priority and then beyond (to reach) as many people as we can.\"\n\nFollow Hannan Adely on Twitter: @adelyreporter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/05/15/college-student-gap-between-black-white-americans-worse/70195689007/", "title": "College-going gap between Black and white Americans is getting ...", "text": "Jon Marcus\n\nThe Hechinger Report\n\nFrom the time Patrick Ben III decided he would go to college, there seemed to be an obstacle at every turn.\n\nThe high school he attended on Chicago’s South Side offered few of the advantages wealthier kids got. There were no Advanced Placement courses, and little help was available with college and financial aid applications.\n\n“I understood that a lot of the things I did to prepare for college I would have to do myself,” said Ben, who is Black.\n\nWhen he finally made it to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the shortcomings of his high school were laid bare. Other students from more affluent places “were sitting there in class talking about how they’ve already done this stuff, where I’m thinking, all of this is new to me.”\n\nAffirmative action:Supreme Court signals skepticism of race-conscious college admissions\n\nThese things “just reminded me of what I already knew about the politics of education and the lack of resources in low-income communities when it comes to schools,” said Ben, now 22 and about to graduate and go back to Chicago to teach while pursuing a master’s degree.\n\n“I can’t be mad that the opportunities are different,” he said, “because it’s out of my control. It’s just the way society is.”\n\nAs states push back against diversity programs at public universities and the Supreme Court considers whether to eliminate affirmative action in admissions, a central question remains: whether the playing field has finally been leveled, especially between white and Black Americans who aspire to college educations and the higher quality of life they bring.\n\nThe answer? Not only has this divide failed to narrow − it’s getting worse.\n\n“In a way, we’re in the worst of all possible worlds for civil rights, because people think a lot of problems have been solved,” said Gary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nIn fact, Orfield said, “we’re not making progress. The gaps are huge, and there’s no prospect of them closing in the foreseeable future. We’re going backwards.”\n\nHow does Black college enrollment compare?\n\nBlack college and university enrollment has been dropping steadily. Already down by 22% between 2010 and 2020, or more than 650,000 students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, it has fallen by another 7% since then, more recent figures from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center show.\n\nLook again:Affirmative action critics paint Asian Americans as the ‘model minority.’\n\nEven though the number of white students has also declined since 2010, the difference between the proportions of white students and Black students graduating with degrees has gotten bigger, data from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center show.\n\nThirty-four percent of Black adults have associate degrees or higher, compared with 50% of white adults, according to the Lumina Foundation. (Lumina is among the funders of The Hechinger Report, which produced this story.)\n\n“There’s a facade that’s trying to be presented that everything is OK. But we never were OK, even before the pandemic,” said Wisdom Cole, national director of the NAACP youth and college division.\n\nMany factors account for the disparity. The biggest is cost.\n\nWe’re not making progress. The gaps are huge, and there’s no prospect of them closing in the foreseeable future. We’re going backwards. Gary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project, University of California, Los Angeles\n\nThe average Black household earns about half as much as the average white household, and white families have eight times the median wealth of Black families − $188,200, compared with $24,100 − a gap that also has been widening, the Federal Reserve reports.\n\nDEI came to colleges with a bang.Now, these red states are on a mission to snuff it out.\n\n“The equalizer to close these gaps was supposed to be education. If you’re able to go to college, you’re able to find a job and support yourself and your family. But the outcomes aren’t showing that,” said Justin Nalley, senior policy analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Black think tank.\n\nThis economic disparity means that going to college, for Black Americans, is far more likely to require going into debt − and larger amounts of it. Eighty-six percent have to borrow toward a bachelor’s degree. Black students who make it to graduation end up owing nearly 50% more than white graduates, according to the Brookings Institution.\n\nThey also go on to earn less than white graduates, which makes that obligation harder to repay.\n\nUniversity degree or not, “you’re facing discrimination in the workplace when it comes to hiring and when it comes to salaries,” Cole said.\n\nDisparities continue once Black college grads enter the workforce\n\nBlack college and university graduates earn an average 15% less than their white classmates and are more likely to be underemployed, the NAACP finds. Almost 40% default on their college loans within 12 years, compared with 12% of white graduates, The Institute for College Access and Success says.\n\nBut the other reasons Black enrollment has been declining begin much earlier than college, with the quality of the education Black students receive in kindergarten through grade 12.\n\nForty-five percent of Black children go to high-poverty primary and secondary schools, compared with 8% of white students.\n\nWhy did wealthier peers get more aid?Many colleges raised tuition for low-income students.\n\nBlack students are more likely than white students to be held back, disciplined or diverted into special education and less likely to have access to Advanced Placement courses, researchers at the Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University have found.\n\nBlack high school students who didn’t go to college or dropped out are more likely to say they want to go, or go back, than similar white students – 50% to 42%, respectively – according to focus groups convened by Edge Research and HCM Strategists for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nYet while 67% of white high school graduates went directly to college in 2020, the most recent year for which the figure is available, 54% of Black high school graduates did, the National Center for Education Statistics reports. That’s down from 66% in 2010.\n\nResults like these owe more to the wealth divide than to academic ability, a long-term federal study suggests.\n\nThe study followed 23,000 students beginning in 2009, when they were in the ninth grade. An analysis of the resulting data by the Center for American Progress found that even the highest-achieving low-income students went to college at lower rates than their more affluent counterparts. The wealthiest students with mediocre academic backgrounds were just as likely to enroll as the lowest-income students with the highest grades and test scores.\n\n“It’s tempting to think that America has largely solved its problems surrounding access to postsecondary education,” the Center for American Progress report said. In fact, it said, the data show “that the United States still fails miserably” at this.\n\nFinancial aid can help, but eligibility rules for some of the nearly $15 billion in state-level financial aid for college often make it harder for Black students to get that aid, research by the Urban Institute has found. That’s because these programs are often based on high school academic performance, which can be affected by the varying quality of schools, and require students to attend college full time and immediately after graduating from high school, which Black students are less likely than white students to do.\n\nMissing: A sense of belonging\n\nThose Black students who do manage to enroll in college are less likely to finish. About 40% go to lower-priced but poorly funded public community colleges, which have very low completion rates. Nearly half of all public community college students drop out, within a year, of the school where they started, and only slightly more than 40% finish within six years.\n\nBlack students also disproportionately attend part time. Fifteen percent are caregivers for family members, 11% are parents or guardians, and 20% work full time − all about double the proportions of other students.\n\nFifty-six percent of Black students at four-year universities and colleges go part time at some point versus 42% of white students, which makes it far less likely they will graduate within six years, according to the advocacy group Complete College America.\n\nWhen they are on campus, more than a fifth of Black university and college students report frequently or occasionally feeling discriminated against; of these, 61% have considered dropping out, a Gallup poll commissioned by Lumina and released in February found.\n\n“Having a sense of belonging is critical, and part of what has happened in the last few years is this sort of heightening of these culture wars that create even more questioning of, ‘Do I really belong on campus?’” said Steve Colón, CEO of Bottom Line, which provides counseling to help Black and other marginalized students get to and through college.\n\nEven the highest-achieving low-income students went to college at lower rates than their more affluent counterparts. The wealthiest students with mediocre academic backgrounds were just as likely to enroll as the lowest-income students with the highest grades and test scores. Center for American Progress study\n\nEven dorms are increasingly racially segregated, a researcher at the University of Kansas has found, with higher-quality buildings that, because of their cost, are often predominantly white.\n\n“If the education they’re receiving is not equitable, if they’re seeing discrimination happen on campus, segregation happening on campus − it’s not enough to just attract students to that campus, but are you retaining those students?” Cole said.\n\nHere, too, the answer is no. Only 40% of Black students graduate from four-year universities and colleges within even six years, compared with 64% of white students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics; the rest are still struggling through or have dropped out, most of them with debt but no degree.\n\nThis leads to the reality that although only about a third of Black Americans have college and university degrees, more than half of 25- to 40-year-old Black parents heading households owe student loan debt, according to the progressive think tank Demos.\n\nNineteen percent of Black adults, or nearly 6.4 million, have some college credit but no degree compared with 16% of white adults, the Census Bureau reports.\n\nThis creates a vicious cycle, said Keith Curry, president of Compton College, a community college in California, and part of a group of college administrators, consultants and policymakers alarmed by and trying to reverse the decline in Black enrollment.\n\nStudent debt relief blocked,potentially hurting Black and Latino families the most\n\n“If a student doesn’t have a good experience, they will tell somebody else in their neighborhood,” he said. “A younger relative who hears that story isn’t going to enroll.”\n\nFor this and other reasons, experts and research suggest these declines may speed up.\n\nIf the Supreme Court strikes down affirmative action in admissions in a decision expected by the end of June, selective colleges and universities are likely to become even less racially diverse, the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce has concluded.\n\n“We’re actually looking at projections that show we’re not going to be really closing this gap for a very long time, if ever,” said Orfield, author of “The Walls Around Opportunity: The Failure of Colorblind Policy for Higher Education.”\n\nWhen California passed Proposition 209 in 1996, prohibiting public universities from considering race in admission, Black students ended up being pushed from more selective to less selective institutions, research at the University of California, Berkeley found.\n\nIt’s a demoralizing time, Curry said. “But also look at it this way: You’ve seen marginalized groups that have experienced racism for decades, even centuries. We’re trying to change systems and structures that have been around for decades.”\n\nBez Burks, a junior at Illinois State University, sees visceral symbols of the equity divide when he visits a classmate who lives in a luxury apartment building near the campus.\n\nElite colleges accused of price-fixing:Experts say they have a different wealth problem.\n\nHis friend, who also has a car, enjoys a pool, a fitness center and a 2,700-square-foot suite with granite countertops, flat-screen TVs and queen-sized beds. Some of the units include hot tubs, steam showers, balconies and bistro kitchens.\n\nBurks, who is Black and − like Ben − from Chicago’s South Side, took three buses each way, every day, to go to a charter high school away from his neighborhood. In college, he works more than 20 hours a week at Walmart to help pay for his tuition and rent for a much more modest room. His single mother, a nurse, picks up extra shifts to help, and he has taken out loans and applied for grants from nonprofit organizations to cover the rest.\n\nSometimes, this reminder of the comparative obstacles he faces “really grinds my gears,” said Burks, a marketing major who hopes to one day start his own marketing firm. But “I try not to think about it too much. If I have to work twice as hard, that’s what I will do.”\n\nThis story about the college equity gap was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

So has the cost of college loans and child care. Meanwhile, older generations are living and working longer, limiting younger workers’ chances to advance their careers and boost their salaries.\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans believe younger people face hardships today that earlier generations didn’t, and 65% of Gen Zers and 74% of millennials say they believe they are starting further behind financially than earlier generations at their age, according to an online survey of more than 2,000 U.S. adults done exclusively for USA TODAY by The Harris Poll on Aug. 25-27.\n\nAll the while, younger Americans are coming up against unprecedented challenges such as climate change and unseen levels of political divisiveness.\n\n“They're telling us they can't buy into that American dream the way that their parents and grandparents thought about it ‒ because it's not attainable,” said The Harris Poll CEO John Gerzema, who believes there’s “an entire generation that feels like they're coming of age in sort of this fractured, divisive world” where traditional systems no longer work for them.\n\nLearn more: Best current CD rates\n\nThe anxiety around money is intense right now. Nearly 70% of Americans say the economy is getting worse, according to an exclusive poll from the Suffolk University Sawyer Business School and USA TODAY Sept. 6-11. They described the economy with words like “chaotic,” “disastrous,” and “dismal.”\n\nTo adapt to these new challenges, young Americans are redefining what it means to be financially successful. For many, their hopes and dreams no longer mean owning a single-family home with a white picket fence.\n\nUSA TODAY spoke to nine young Americans – Gen Zers and millennials ages 23 to 39 – about their finances and the future.\n\nHere’s what they said.\n\nMatt Marino\n\nRising cost of living. High inflation. Even higher mortgage rates. No more pensions.\n\nThese are a few of the ways New York City-based Matt Marino, a 27-year-old teacher, believes his generation faces “exponentially greater” financial hardships than previous ones.\n\n“I think maybe for (older generations), they focused more on … having a job where you can have good money, support yourself, support your family, and even have more leftover or plan ahead for the future for retirement,” he said. He thinks its “a little different now for, for me and my generation.”\n\nMarino said his generation views homeownership as “impossible.” His age group would rather have “more freedom,” such as having a job they really enjoy or a remote job, over one that just pays the bills, he said.\n\nHis goal is to support himself in New York City, where he was born and raised, and have leftover money to spend on fun, recreational things.\n\nHis views reflect a larger feeling among young people. Three in 4 younger Americans said their financial goals are different now from those of past generations, according to USA TODAY’s Harris Poll survey.\n\nBrandon Davila\n\nBrandon Davila, 26, of Texas, graduated college in 2021 with a business marketing degree but has struggled to get a job in that field.\n\n“It's been hard trying to find work without getting ghosted,” he said.\n\nThough he’s happy to have two retail jobs, he also feels like he’s “not making enough to get by.” One of his jobs pays $10 an hour; the other $25 an hour but with fewer available shifts.\n\nFor now, he’s living with his parents until he can save enough money for a place of his own.\n\nAfter going to school in the global pandemic, struggling to find work and seeing rent prices in the Dallas-Fort Worth area spike 21% since 2019 (according to data from CoStar), he feels as if older generations have had it “a lot easier.”\n\nHe pointed out wage stagnation specifically, which has dented his purchasing power as inflation drives up prices. (While the gap between wage growth and inflation is narrowing, it isn't expected to fully close until the fourth quarter of next year, according to a Bankrate analysis.)\n\nWith “baby boomers, I hear how they just worked a simple job for the summer and they saved up money to go to college, to essentially get their lives started: Like get married, have kids, buy a house,\" Davila said. \"Something a lot of people in my generation, myself included, find so impossible now.”\n\nAudrey Alessi\n\nHonolulu-based Audrey Alessi, 31, feels good that she doesn’t have to deny herself little purchases or skip meals out.\n\nBut homeownership is a different story.\n\nShe and her generation are “in the same boat, where the only home I could afford would be a small condo … and it does just make more sense to rent at this point,” she said. “It sucks because I’m a Realtor and I’m pushing homeownership, but I can’t do it.”\n\nUrban Honolulu is a notoriously unaffordable market where the median sale price for a single-family home reached $1.1 million in 2022. That’s a nearly 600% increase from 1985, according to the Honolulu Board of Realtors.\n\nAlessi sees many of her first-time homebuyers get help from their parents, like an early inheritance for the down payment. A 2022 Realtor.com survey found that 85% of newlywed couples would rather have cash gifts to go toward a down payment than the standard registry gifts.\n\nDespite that, Alessi doesn’t think the economy should stop young people from adapting and striving for their financial goals. She hopes to someday have a passive income source, like a rental property, to help supplement her real estate income, which can be unpredictable.\n\n“People who have a better outlook on the economy do better in the economy,” she said. “I feel bad dumbing it down to a mindset thing, but I see it often. … It is what it is, and you can’t let it ruin your day and not buy a house. (If you give up), then you’re going to be one step behind.”\n\nAshley Parker\n\nAshley Parker feels stuck.\n\nAfter high school, the now-23-year-old got an associate's degree in baking. She found a job as a pastry cook, and shortly after she started, she got a raise to $16 an hour, well above the $7.25 minimum wage in North Carolina, where she lives. She’s conservative with money, she said, and saves most of what she doesn’t spend on essentials like gas and groceries.\n\nIt’s still not enough.\n\nParker still lives with her parents in Raleigh because she can't afford a lease in the city, where the median rental price has reached more than $1,800 a month, according to Zillow data. She doesn’t consider herself financially successful because she doesn't earn enough to do what many other people her age do: live on their own.\n\n“(It makes me feel) like I don't have a choice. Like I'm not going to have the experience that most young adults do because everything is just too expensive,” she told USA TODAY.\n\nThough she’s concerned about her generation, noting that Gen Z “has it bad,” she also worries about the generations that will follow.\n\n“I don't think it's going to get any better,\" she said. \"It would be amazing if it did. I just think that a lot of things are going on in this country, especially the economy. It just feels in the garbage. There’s so much unknown.\"\n\nEli Jolly\n\nThough some grew up thinking that making it in America means homeownership, The Harris Poll survey shows younger Americans are starting to disagree.\n\nEli Jolly, 24, who works in software development in Virginia, said things like a house with a yard and 2.5 kids aren’t the goal for everyone their age. Partially because of shifting lifestyle trends, but also because of new economic circumstances.\n\nThis tracks with findings in USA TODAY’s survey, which found younger Americans were less likely to say financial success means owning a home (52% of Gen Zers agreed with this compared with 64% of Boomers) and having children that do better than you (38% among Gen Z versus 43% of millennials and 48% of baby boomers.)\n\nThough baby boomers also dealt with high housing costs − one report from Realtor.com noted that the typical buyer in 1981 spent more than half their household income on their mortgage payments compared with nearly 33% in 2023 − they weren’t straddled with the student loan debt and child care costs younger Americans face today.\n\n“I think for a lot of people, your parents already have to be living that American dream to achieve the American dream, which isn't the way that it should be,” Jolly said.\n\nThey said they believe people reach financial success when budgeting is a choice instead of a necessity.\n\n“You are fairly successful if you don't have to budget. When you're walking to the grocery store, you don't have to look at the prices as much,” they said, noting that they consider themselves to be doing “fairly good.\"\n\n“I don't have any college student loans, so I'm pretty good in that aspect because I went to the cheapest university I could go to and got a partial scholarship and worked while in university.\"\n\nChloe Duncan\n\nThough Chloe Duncan believes the economy is “a bit of a mess” at the moment with high inflation and interest rates, she has faith that the U.S. will get through this rough patch.\n\nThe 39-year-old watercolor artist from Saint George, Utah, knows just how detrimental higher interest rates can be, having just purchased a house at a 6% mortgage rate – about double the average mortgage rate in 2021.\n\nEven so, she said the purchase was worth it for her and her boyfriend.\n\n“Every generation thinks they have it kind of really bad,” Duncan said, adding that she believes while the pandemic has “definitely” changed the economic circumstances young people face today, “some things have gotten easier and some things are more difficult.”\n\nAccording to The Harris Poll findings, about 62% of Gen Z and millennials feel good about affording homeownership, but just 39% say homeownership is “even a major goal in their life.”\n\nDuncan also noted that saving for the future – whether through a savings account or 401(k) – has become more difficult amid inflation.\n\n“I think it's really important to not only have money for today, but you have to have money set aside for the future. And I think that's more difficult for the younger generation,” Duncan said. “Being self-employed, I don't really have a company 401(k), so it's definitely on me to try and save for the future.”\n\nAlexandra Chipkin\n\nAlexandra Chipkin, 31, of New York City, said that up until last year she had to make certain choices to keep within her means. With Manhattan cocktails easily surpassing $15, she said, she couldn't afford to say \"yes\" to every outing.\n\n“If I wanted to go out for drinks with friends, I had to choose which group of friends (I was) going to hang out with because I couldn’t afford both,” she said.\n\nShe recently got a job in market research that has given her some more breathing room to spend money freely, she said, but she’s still frustrated by some of the challenges millennials and Gen Zers face, like the shrinking middle class.\n\n“I don't think that it's good for anyone to have a society where a few people are doing really well, the winners, and then you have a lot of people who are really struggling,” she said. “It’s not sustainable to keep having these things out of reach for so many people.”\n\nMegan Lee\n\nAlthough Megan Lee feels pretty financially secure at the moment, the 28-year-old from Hawaii still feels anxious about the future.\n\nAccording to USA TODAY’s survey, Gen Z and millennial women “are less likely to feel good about their long-term finances” versus men.\n\nShe said she won’t feel financially successful until she can live without any support from her parents – and can support them instead.\n\n“It would be better for my financial portfolio if I was a bit more strict,” said Lee, a director of advancement for a private school, where she oversees all aspects of fundraising, such as donor gifts.\n\nIronically, her financial stress keeps her from budgeting. “I don't want to face the fact that maybe I might never be able to afford my own house,” she said, pointing to the high cost of living in Honolulu.\n\nHawaii is considered the most expensive area to live in, especially when it comes to housing, according to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center.\n\n“So it's a lot of anxiety to get a paycheck and split it in half and not use (it) for anything recreational that you want to do and just use it on rent and food,” she said.\n\nAurelia Casey\n\nFor as long as she can remember, Aurelia Casey, 30, has had at least two jobs.\n\nThe New Yorker juggles a full-time time job managing environmental programming for young people at a nonprofit while babysitting part-time. To improve her credit score, she lives at home with family rent-free.\n\n“I needed to open credit cards to be able to do things like, literally, get a (public transit pass) to get around my own city, to just get to work,” she says.\n\nShe and her brother also help out their mother financially.\n\n“Race does take a part in it in terms that there’s no generational wealth in our family,” said Casey, who is Black. “I feel, compared to peers of different races, I am behind. Everything I currently own, I worked for it myself.”\n\nShe doesn’t want to leave New York City, but she’s not sure if she can ever afford to raise children there.\n\nHer own family has been in the city for four generations, and her partner’s parents live there too. “Financial success to me would be making enough money to survive in my hometown,” she said.\n\nCasey feels stressed that even though she and her brother have bachelor’s and master’s degrees – the first generation in their family to earn them – she isn’t confident she’ll ever reach her financial goals: a salary of at least $85,000 and a credit score of at least 700.\n\n“The way that greed and capitalistic greed strives in this country, I’m not sure when us millennials will see that financial freedom,” Casey said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/04/09/oregon-people-more-likely-consider-suicide-average-american/3410732002/", "title": "Survey: Oregonians more likely to consider suicide, more willing to ...", "text": "Zane Sparling\n\nPamplin Media Group\n\nOregonians are more likely to consider suicide than the average American — with nearly one-third across the state reporting that they’ve considered taking their own lives, according to a new poll.\n\nA DHM Research survey found that 31 percent of Oregonians report having had suicidal thoughts, compared to 21 percent of all Americans.\n\nThe grim results accord with Oregon’s higher-than-average suicide rate. Last year, about 18 per 100,000 Oregonians killed themselves. Nationwide, it was 13 per 100,000 people.\n\n“It’s a more common experience in Oregon. They are more likely to know somebody, more likely to talk to somebody,” said John Horvick, a vice president for the polling firm. “That ripples out into their relationships with other people.”\n\nBut the concerning rate of self-harm doesn’t mean cries for help go unanswered. In fact, 67 percent of Oregonians said nothing could stop them from trying to prevent a self-inflicted death, compared to 39 percent nationally.\n\nMany respondents in a nationwide survey said they might hesitate for fear of doing or saying the wrong thing, or out of fear that nothing they did would make a difference.\n\n'Reach out for help, because help works'\n\nIntervention works. Counselors at Lines For Life — which operates a 24-7 crisis center in Southwest Portland as part of the National Suicide Prevention Hotline (800-273-8255) — have been found to de-escalate more than 95 percent of all incoming calls without needing to contact first responders.\n\nLines For Life chief executive Dwight Holton says it’s crucial that Oregonians keep talking, as honest talk can shatter the barriers that prevent people from seeking help. “Human connection is what matters,” he said. “It’s OK to not feel great, but what we know is: reach out for help, because help works.”\n\nOregon’s high rate of suicides may be helping to break down the stigma as well. Fifty-four percent of the survey respondents say they’ve talked openly about suicide, in contrast to 42 percent nationwide.\n\nHere are the other key takeaways from the poll:\n\n70 percent of Oregonians have spent time worrying about a friend or family member’s mental state. The national average is 33 percent.\n\nAbout 34 percent of Oregonians know someone who has survived a suicide attempt, as opposed to 22 percent nationally.\n\nOnly 9 percent of state residents report no familiarity with suicidal thoughts or actions in their lives, compared to 28 percent of all Americans.\n\nIn follow-up interviews with the Pamplin Media Group, several poll respondents said they were not surprised to learn Oregonians are comfortable talking about suicide.\n\n“I don’t consider it to be a dark topic,” said one participant, a Beaverton resident named Danny.\n\n“Someone who [attempts] suicide is someone who has been pushed to their limit,” he continued. “They couldn’t think of any other way, and if they didn’t seek out others to help them, then that’s the course they chose.”\n\nAnother respondent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, highlighted the burden for those battling mental health issues in the LGBTQ community, especially for those in their teenage years.\n\n“It’s pretty lonely,” said the Portland resident, who described feeling ostracized by friends after coming out as transgender. “There’s this vast difference in outcomes, depending on whether a transgender person has a team of emotional support.”\n\nHolton said his organization receives many calls from people who have been “other-ized” due to their sexual or gender identity, with calls flowing particularly to the YouthLine (877-969-8491). That said, Holton notes that the people most likely to kill themselves are older white men.\n\n“This challenge knows no racial, gender or other traditional boundaries. Suicide comes home to everybody,” he said. “The most important thing we can do is make sure people know it’s OK to reach out for help.”\n\nEditor's note: This month newsrooms across Oregon are highlighting the public health crisis of death by suicide. Our goal of “Breaking the Silence” is to not only put a spotlight on a problem that claimed the lives of more than 800 Oregonians last year, but also examine research into how prevention can and does work and offer our readers, listeners and viewers resources to help if they — or those they know — are in crisis.\n\nMost of our work will be published and broadcast April 7-14. Participating media outlets are using a common set of data and have loosely coordinated their coverage in an effort to avoid duplication and better amplify all of our work. When possible, we will promote each other’s stories, but all of them can be found at breakingthesilenceor.com.\n\nThe DHM online poll surveyed 309 Oregonians between Feb. 13 and Feb. 22. The margin of error is 5.6 percent.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/health/sperm-counts-decline-debate/index.html", "title": "Sperm counts may be declining globally, review finds, adding to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOver the past 50 years, human sperm counts appear to have fallen by more than 50% around the globe, according to an updated review of medical literature.\n\nIf the findings are confirmed and the decline continues, it could have important implications for human reproduction. Researchers say it would also be a harbinger of declining health in men in general, since semen quality can be an important marker of overall health.\n\nThe review, and its conclusions, have sparked a debate among experts in male fertility. Some say the findings are real and urgent, but others say they are not convinced by the data because the methods of counting sperm have changed so much over time that it’s not possible to compare historical and modern numbers.\n\nNearly all experts agree that the issue needs more study.\n\n“I think one of the fundamental functions of any species is reproduction. So I think if there is a signal that reproduction is in decline, I think that’s a very important finding,” said Dr. Michael Eisenberg, a urologist with Stanford Medicine who was not involved in the review.\n\n“There is a strong link between a man’s reproductive health and his overall health. So it could also speak to that too, that maybe we’re not as healthy as we once were,” he said.\n\nOthers say that while the review was well-done, they are skeptical about its conclusions.\n\n“The way that semen analysis is done has changed over the decades. It has improved. It has become more standardized, but not perfectly,” said Dr. Alexander Pastuczak, a surgeon and assistant professor the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City. He was not involved in the review.\n\n“Even if you were to take the same semen sample and run it and do a semen analysis on it in the 1960s and ’70s versus today, you’d get two different answers,” he said.\n\nPastuczak says that in more contemporary studies of semen analysis, ones that rely on samples analyzed by a different method, “you don’t see these trends.” In fact, some studies in Northern European regions show sperm counts going up over time, not down, he said.\n\nThe new analysis updates a review published in 2017 and for the first time includes new data from Central and South America, Asia and Africa. It was published in the journal Human Reproduction Update.\n\nAn international team of researchers combed through nearly 3,000 studies that recorded men’s sperm counts and were published between 2014 and 2020, years that had not been included in their previous analysis.\n\nThe researchers excluded studies that featured only men who were being evaluated for infertility, those that selected only men who had normal sperm counts and those whose study participants were selected based on genital abnormalities or diseases. They included only studies published in English, those with 10 or more men and those with participants whose sperm was collected in the typical way and counted using a device called a hemocytometer.\n\nIn the end, just 38 studies met their criteria. They added these to studies included in their previous review and extracted their data, which was fed into models.\n\nOverall, the researchers determined that sperm counts fell by sightly more than 1% per year between 1973 and 2018. The study concluded that globally, the average sperm count had fallen 52% by 2018.\n\nWhen the study researchers restricted their analysis to certain years, they found that the decline in sperm counts seemed to be accelerating, from an average of 1.16% per year after 1973 to 2.64% per year after 2020.\n\n“It’s really remarkable that actually the decline is increasing,” said study author Dr. Hagai Levine, an epidemiologist and public health researcher at the Braun School of Public Health and Community Medicine.\n\nOn a population level, the average sperm count dropped from 104 million to 49 million per milliliter from 1973 through 2019. Normal sperm counts are considered to be over 40 million per milliliter.\n\nCauses of the decline are unknown\n\nThe study authors say they didn’t have enough data from different regions to be able to tell whether some countries had lower average sperm counts than others or whether sperm counts were declining faster in certain areas. Data from 53 countries was included in the review.\n\nThe authors also didn’t look at what might be causing the decline. “It should be studied,” Levine said.\n\nIn other research, Levine says, he and others have teased out some factors that are associated with lower sperm counts.\n\nDamage to reproductive health may begin in the womb.\n\n“We know that stress of the mother, maternal smoking and especially exposure to manmade chemicals that are in plastic, such as phthalates, disrupt the development of the male reproductive system,” Levine said.\n\nLifestyle may also play an important role. Obesity, a lack of physical activity and diets high in ultraprocessed food may all be culprits, he said.\n\n“The same factors that harm health in general usually are also harmful to semen quality,” he said.\n\nOne expert said that, ultimately, trying to do this kind of study is fraught with problems that complicate the findings.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“The paper is very scientifically or statistically robust and does a good job of summarizing the data that is available in our field. But it’s important to recognize that that data is still very limited in how it was collected and how it was reported,” said Dr. Scott Lundy, a urologist at the Cleveland Clinic who was not involved in the research.\n\nStandards and methods for counting sperm have changed greatly over time, Lundy says, making it difficult to compare modern counts to historical data.\n\nStill, he said, that historical data is all that’s available to the field.\n\n“While it’s not a cause for panic, because the counts are by and large still normal, on average, there is a risk that they could become abnormal in the future, and we have to recognize that and study that further,” Lundy said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/02/11/stress-teens-psychological/5266739/", "title": "Teens feeling stressed, and many not managing it well", "text": "Sharon Jayson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nTeen stress level is higher than adult level much of the year\n\nStress survey finds teen girls report higher stress and more symptoms than boys\n\nAnnual psychological survey focuses on teens for the first time\n\nTeens across the USA are feeling high levels of stress that they say negatively affect every aspect of their lives, a new national survey suggests.\n\nMore than a quarter (27%) say they experience \"extreme stress\" during the school year, vs. 13% in the summer. And 34% expect stress to increase in the coming year.\n\nStressors range from school to friends, work and family. And teens aren't always using healthy methods to cope, finds the latest Stress in America survey from the Washington, D.C.-based American Psychological Association.\n\nFindings on more than 1,000 teens and almost 2,000 adults suggest that unhealthy behaviors associated with stress may start early and continue through adulthood. With 21% of adults reporting \"extreme\" stress levels, the survey says that with teens \"mirroring adults' high-stress lives\" they are \"potentially setting themselves up for a future of chronic stress and chronic illness.\"\n\nThe report warns that teens are at risk of a variety of physical and emotional ills and potentially shorter lifespans than their elders if they don't act to \"reverse their current trajectory of chronic illness, poor health and shorter lifespans.\"\n\n\"Our study this year gives us a window in looking at how early these patterns might begin,\" says clinical psychologist Norman Anderson, the association's CEO. \"The patterns of stress we see in adults seem to be occurring as early as the adolescent years — stress-related behaviors such as lack of sleep, lack of exercise, poor eating habits in response to stress.\"\n\nTeens' average stress level was 5.8 out of 10 during the school year and 4.6 in the past month — the survey was taken in August. Adults reported average levels of 5.1 in the past month.\n\nAs a result of stress, 40% of teens report feeling irritable or angry; 36% nervous or anxious. A third say stress makes them feel overwhelmed, depressed or sad. Teen girls are more stressed than boys, just as women nationally are more stressed than men.\n\nThe report says stress appears to be affecting teens' performance in all aspects of life:\n\n• 59% report that managing their time to balance all activities is a somewhat or very significant stressor;\n\n• 40% say they neglected responsibilities at home because of stress; 21% say they neglected work or school because of stress;\n\n• 32% say they experience headaches because of stress; 26% report changes in sleeping habits;\n\n• 26% report snapping at or being short with classmates or teammates when under stress.\n\nHannah Sturgill, 18, of Portsmouth, Ohio, was among those surveyed last summer when she was 17 and heading into her senior year in high school.\n\n\"The last two years in high school have been the most stressful for me and my friends,\" she says. \"We have to do everything and be perfect for colleges and we have a big workload.

Only about 37% of teens surveyed exercise or walk to manage stress; 28% play sports. Many more choose what experts say are less healthy activities, including playing video games (46%) and spending time online (43%).\n\nThis is the first time the group has focused on teen stress. Other research has studied teen depression and other mental health concerns, but officials say this may be the most comprehensive national look at stress in teens to date. Despite anecdotal reports of high stress, researchers say stress itself in adolescents hasn't been studied broadly; global comparisons have focused on adult stress rather than teens.\n\nDespite teens' own perceptions, some experts question whether stress is merely a convenient excuse for teen behaviors.\n\n\"It's hard to know\" if all the negative effects teens report are \"really based on stress,\" says clinical psychologist Jonathan Abramowitz, of Chapel Hill, N.C. \"It's hard enough for anyone to really explain why they do certain things, like procrastinating. Give a kid any excuse — it may or may not have anything to do with stress.\"\n\nMichael Bradley, a psychologist in Feasterville, Pa., who specializes in teens, agrees.\n\n\"I'm not sure it would be the clinical definition of stress. I think they get stressed because somebody puts a demand on them and they don't want to do it,\" he says. \"However, on their behalf, I will fall back on the fact that hard numbers tell us kids are more anxious and depressed than they've ever been.\"\n\nA literature review of mental health among U.S. adolescents by the non-profit Child Trends released last year, for example, found that one in four high school students have shown mild symptoms of depression. The report noted symptoms include persistent irritability, anger, withdrawn behavior and deviations from normal appetite or sleep patterns. The report also said 29% of high school students in grades 9-12 reported feeling sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or longer during the past year.\n\nIn addition, a study about depression published in 2012 in the journal Clinical Psychological Science, found that rates of suicide attempts were significantly higher in adolescents ages 13-17 than in emerging adults (ages 18-23) or adults (24-30).\n\nKristen Race, of Steamboat Springs, Colo., author of the book Mindful Parenting, out in January, says teens are generally honest about responding to confidential surveys.\n\n\"They're more honest in that situation than telling their parents how stressed they are,\" she says. \"When teens report their own level of stress, it is typically much higher than parents would report of their teen's level of stress.\"\n\nAnderson says the survey did find enough subtlety to satisfy skeptics.\n\n\"While one might argue it's very easy to say everything is affected by stress, what's interesting is they're not doing that,\" he says. \"They're differentiating between the things they believe are negatively impacted by stress vs. others. Only 10% believe lower grades are due to stress. They seem to be very nuanced in their attributions of what stress does.\"\n\nRace says the fact that stress levels dip in the summer suggests how important summer is to kids' mental health.\n\n\"If you look at teen suicide statistics, stress is one of the things that leads to suicide attempts,\" she says. \"It's incredibly important to have the downtime, and it makes sense to have a dramatic shift in the summer. They sleep more in the summer, and that's going to enormously increase their ability to think positively. \"\n\nBradley says teens need help from parents — to a point.\n\n\"Some parents set out on a mission to get rid of stress in their kids, but the fact is, some degree of stress is very therapeutic and an appropriate amount of stress is what helps us become strong. The hard part is what's appropriate,\" Bradley says. \"We do know the more we try to mitigate all stress in our children's life the less resilient that child becomes and they feel hopeless about their own future.\"\n\nAmong survey findings on U.S. adults:\n\n• 37% report exercising less than once a week or not at all;\n\n• 27% say they eat to manage stress;\n\n• 43% exercise or walk and 9% play sports to manage stress;\n\n• 62% manage stress with screen time: 42% go online; 42% watch two or more hours of TV or movies a day; 21% play video games.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/02/11"}]}

Overnight someone trampled the sculpture, leaving only a vague outline of the carefully crafted layers amid a mound of sand.\n\n\"I don't get it,\" Schaffer said.\n\nSchaffer described the situation as \"brutal.\" But then, rallying together, his group of \"Sand Bears\" pulled off the \"unthinkable.\"\n\nThey rebuilt the sculpture in almost half the time.

The Lewes Polar Bear Plunge, in its 29th year, raised a record $1,018,000.\n\nThe Sand Bears provided a sculpture at the back of the beach for the fourth consecutive year. Each year the display and the number of workers who dedicate their weekend to its creation have grown.\n\nSome of the Sand Bears compete in regional sand sculpting contests through the spring and summer. They know their creations are temporary, but they prefer them to fold naturally from the tide or wind especially given how long they take to come together.\n\nThe process starts with a large mound of loose sand. For the polar bear display, a tractor pushed together (literally) tons of sand Thursday, four days out from show time.\n\nSomeone then shapes a centerpiece, in this case a giant bear head. From there sometimes there isn't a set plan, as was the case with the polar bear sculpture.\n\nREHOBOTH BEACH: Could beach town soon ban certain plastic products?\n\nEveryone spreads out around the mound and begins experimenting. Ideas form as the sand is shifted and molded.\n\nFor that reason, it was impossible for Schaffer and the crew to precisely re-create the first version of the sculpture.

Belt.\n\nDENIM, LEATHER OR TWEED? “Tweed. I wish I could pull off tweed.”\n\nWHY FASHION IS IMPORTANT: “Anything that makes the world feel a little smaller, a little closer together, makes the world more magical.

And they've sweetened the deal by offering bonuses like park passes and stays at the new cabins as a way to build interest in the entrepreneurial effort.\n\nBut for Delaware Parks, the campaign is also about building awareness about Cape Henlopen and other state parks and encouraging people to visit. Kickstarter uses crowdfunding to help entrepreneurs take an idea and turn it into reality.\n\n\"It helps us raise buzz,\" said Raymond E. Bivens, Delaware State Parks director.\n\nState parks are 65 to 70 percent self-funded, using proceeds from fees to improve facilities, he said.\n\nThis is the second time park officials used crowdfunding to raise money for a project. In 2014 they generated $20,000 to install Mobi Mats at parks through the National Recreation and Park Association's \"Fund Your Park\" initiative. The mats help people with disabilities navigate over the soft sand.\n\nThis time, they are seeking a minimum of $4,000 for their Cape Henlopen Cabin campaign.\n\nBivens said they set the bar low because with Kickstarter, if you don't reach your goal, you don't get anything.\n\nThe folks who help the state reach that base goal get freebies in exchange for their donations.\n\nBrrrrr ... Polar Bears take plunge in Rehoboth Beach\n\nCape May-Lewes Ferry receives $6 million grant\n\nFor $1,500, for instance, you get a week-long stay in one of the Cape Henlopen cabins you helped to fund. Three $500 donors get a stay over the Memorial Day weekend. The cost of each cabin is $85 per night or $595 per week during the pre-summer season.\n\nState parks have become more business focused and entrepreneurial in recent years and state lawmakers already agreed to allow parks to do sponsorships and offer give-a-ways as a way to grow revenues, Bivens said.\n\nThe cabin projects -- there are six already at the Cape Henlopen State Park -- is already funded through park revenues.\n\nThe two-room cabins sleep six and include a king-sized bed and two bunk beds. There is electricity, a small refrigerator and heat and air conditioning. In addition, there is a screened front porch and an outdoor grill. Visitors bring bed linens and other camp supplies, said Pat Cooper, regional administrator for Delaware's coastal parks.\n\nThe cabins are the latest upgrade to the Cape Henlopen campground. A new bathhouse was added last year. The additional cabins are expected to be ready for the Memorial Day weekend.\n\nIn September, the campground will close while new electric and waterlines are installed, Cooper said. In addition, an old bathhouse will be repurposed into a camp store where visitors can buy basics like bread, milk and firewood, he said.\n\n\"Once we get everything done, this will be a year-round operation,\" Cooper said.\n\nGreen Diamond Builders of Felton is constructing the cabins, which cost $137,131, Bivens said. Half the cost is paid for by a federal Land and Water Conservation Fund Grant, he said. Each is 476 square feet and has a screened porch.\n\n“I am always happy to hear visitors tell me they look forward to bringing their family to our parks each year, spending camping trips with us as their annual family vacation,” Bivens said. “We are proud of this Kickstarter campaign as it will increase the opportunity for more families to share in an enjoyable, educational, relaxing and most of all, affordable vacation.”\n\nThe park started with six cabins for the start of the 2015 season and had a 97 percent occupancy rate.\n\n“According to last year’s numbers and the projected numbers for 2016, these cabins will allow us to host around 2,000 people throughout the peak season,” said Cape Henlopen State Park Manager Paul Faircloth.\n\nContributions can be made to the campaign until Wednesday.\n\nReach Molly Murray at (302) 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.

All of this is in the name of supporting the Special Olympics Delaware through the fundraiser event. The Lewes Polar Plunge, now in its 32nd year, attracts people from far beyond Delaware.\n\nParticipants who can’t make it in person can still donate and do a virtual plunge (which can be done anywhere, any time).

There are rides for kids, food trucks and live music. Last May, the new James Malick Stage debuted, featuring a lineup curated by Gable Music Ventures.\n\nOver the years, the Flower Market has attracted a few acts from Firefly Music Festival.

But this isn’t your average bull since it's powered by four human legs.\n\nThe Running of the Bull turns 26 this year and the event attracts thousands to The Starboard and Dewey Beach area with its festival atmosphere.

That’s because the State Fair is held over 10 days compared to Firefly’s four days.\n\nNonetheless, the fair will be extra important this year since Firefly is gone. But organizers already have wasted no time in bringing big-name acts to the M&T Bank Grandstand this summer.\n\nConfirmed acts so far include the rapper Nelly, along with country acts Tyler Hubbard of Florida Georgia Line, plus Riley Green.

The African-American Affinity Club led an interactive workshop called \"What's Race have to do with it?\" using activities from this year's National Association of Independent Schools Student Diversity Leadership Conference. The Equality Now Club introduced and led a discussion following a \"salon screening\" of the PBS film based on the book by the same name, \"Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide.\" The \"Before I Die\" Mural Committee's program focused on both the meaning and significance of community art and the idea of bucket lists and setting goals for the common good. A faculty group led a session, with live performances, on the evolution of music that addresses themes of social justice. Editors of the student newspaper led a discussion on the role of journalism in fostering social change. The Peace and Ecology Club hosted University of Delaware professor Chrysanthi Leon, who talked about lobbying and specifically the work and mission of the Friends Committee on National Legislation. The Gay Straight Alliance workshop involved a simulation of the process of \"coming out\" for those who have not had the experience, including the responses that are more and less likely from different groups. Amnesty International developed a board game to simulate the real-life struggle of Syrian refugees. Students who have been on recent trips to Haiti and Africa related their experiences to King's mission.

The ones that remained looked like a giant front-end loader came through and scooped off the face, leaving a jagged series of cliffs.\n\nSand fencing lay crumpled like the tracks from a derelict roller coaster. And in Rehoboth, the boardwalk buckled in places from the force of waves pounding the boards from the bottom up. A frosting of sand an inch thick covered the popular attraction at the end of Rehoboth Avenue.\n\nThe shoreline destruction was coastwide and included extensive bayshore flooding.\n\nIt makes \"us very, very vulnerable,\" said Anthony Pratt, the state shoreline and waterway administrator.\n\nThe tally is bad: Gone is the entire dune at the north end of Rehoboth's Boardwalk. The dune was also flattened at the south ends of Bethany Beach and nearby South Bethany. Along the remaining ocean coast, Pratt said, about 20 miles' worth of dunes have been badly damaged. Delaware's ocean coast spans 24 miles total.\n\nHow bad the damage is further north along Delaware Bay north of Lewes is still a question. Extreme flooding of roadways to many of the Delaware Bay beaches kept state assessment crews out even after the weather cleared on Sunday morning.\n\n\"We haven't been able to get through to the bay beaches,\" said David Small, secretary of the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.\n\nSmall, who flew the coast Sunday afternoon with Gov. Jack Markell, and worked for many years as a reporter and editor covering coastal storms, said \"the flight over was amazing\" because the marshes on the back side of Delaware Bay communities were so full of water.\n\nWithout the marshes, he said, \"I can't imagine where all that water would be.\"\n\nSmall said as soon as the water levels drop and roads become passable, assessment crews will begin looking at bayshore damage.\n\nThe state and federal government have invested more than $100 million over the last 15 years to pump sand onto the state's ocean beaches and build manmade dunes. The most recent beach repairs along the ocean coast were paid with Hurricane Sandy Relief dollars. The federal government footed the entire bill for restoring beaches and rebuilding dunes along the public ocean beaches following the Oct. 29, 2012, storm.\n\nMultimillion-dollar federal projects at Broadkill Beach and Fowler Beach are underway. Both are designed to build storm-resilience. There was no word Sunday on how those projects held up.\n\nThe big questions Sunday weren't just the loss of dunes and sand and how to pay to repair the damage. The other big if was how developed cities like Rehoboth and Bethany beaches would have fared without the robust beaches and dunes.\n\n\"This boardwalk would have been gone,\" Pratt said as he stood at Bethany Beach. \"I think it's been a good investment even though it has been expensive.\"\n\nPratt need only think back to another significant winter storm in January 1992. It was a fast-moving nor'easter that ripped away sections of boardwalks both in Rehoboth and Bethany Beach.\n\nNeither community had a robust dune. Worse yet was the damage in South Bethany, where dozens of oceanfront homes lost decks and steps and the street behind them was a mass of rubble. Water and sewer lines snapped from the power of the waves.\n\nThere was so much shoreline erosion from that storm that state officials launched an in-house, large-scale renourishment program to bolster the beach and dunes. Later, the state partnered with the Army Corps of Engineers to do more widescale repairs and restoration. The state pays 35 percent of the cost. The federal government pays the balance on those projects with a 50-year commitment for federal aid.\n\nPratt wasn't the only one Sunday who saw the value in the investment of sand.\n\n\"I would think the whole north end of the boardwalk would be destroyed without the beach renourishment,\" said Rehoboth Beach Mayor Sam Cooper.\n\nIt was the dune that protected much of the boardwalk from significant damage, he said.\n\nWhen it was swept away – in many places the sand ended up on top of the structure – waves rushed under and pounded the boards from the bottom up.\n\nAfter the January 1992 storm, the boardwalk was redesigned so that if the dunes were gone, waves would wash underneath and pop the boards up rather than pound over the top, crushing the structure. The damage is easier to repair and it minimizes property losses at adjacent businesses and homes.\n\nRehoboth and Dewey are on schedule to receive routine beach repairs as part of the state-federal partnership later this year. But Bethany and South Bethany aren't set for a repair until 2017.\n\nPratt said because the entire shoreline is so vulnerable, state crews will push sand up the beach to begin forming a new dune as soon as sand moves back to the shore. Typically during major storms, sand from the beach forms a bar just offshore. That bar helps to dampen the waves before they hit the beach and do more damage. In calmer weather, some of the sand is transported back onto the beach by waves.\n\nMarkell said he and his staff are assessing all of the damage from this storm to determine if a request for federal disaster assistance is in order.\n\nBut the reality is that for Sussex County, the dune and shoreline damage alone may not be significant enough to qualify, Pratt said. Typically, there is also damage to public infrastructure such as roads, bridges and power lines necessary. Those types of damages didn't seem to be an issue in this storm, he said.\n\nStill, all along the Delaware coast there was significant dune damage and areas where the ocean washed through to Del. 1, pushing a field of crumpled, tangled sand fencing and other debris.\n\nDel. 1 from Dewey Beach south was still closed much of the day on Sunday while state transportation department crews worked to remove debris and sand. Water levels from Rehoboth Bay receded throughout the day. In Bethany Beach, Lewes and along the Delaware Inland Bays, many streets were still flooded and impassable.\n\nThe same was true of communities along Delaware Bay. The worst of the three high tides was Saturday morning, when, based on preliminary data, it came close to reaching a record 9.2 feet set in March 1962. Preliminary data recorded a high tide of 9.15 feet at Lewes Breakwater Harbor at 1 p.m. Saturday.\n\nPreston Lee, who lives on Delmar Avenue on the beach side of Lewes, evacuated Saturday. There was 30 inches of water in the lower garage area of his home, he said.\n\nHe returned Sunday morning and said \"there's still about 6 inches in our lower level.\"\n\nRecord flooding, blizzard conditions batter Delaware\n\nDelaware digs out from blizzard mess\n\nDuring Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the water rose to 22 inches in the garage area, he said.\n\n\"This flooding is worse than Sandy,\" he said.\n\nIn Rehoboth, dozens of people walked the boardwalk and surveyed the damage Sunday.\n\nDave and Connie Tredinnick, who have a part-time home in Rehoboth, were among them.\n\n\"It's sad,\" Connie Tredinnick said, adding that at the north end of the boardwalk, \"there's no dune at all.\"\n\n\"That's the big devastation,\" she said.\n\nConnie Tredinnick said she does the annual Polar Bear plunge for Special Olympics, set for Feb. 7, and she worried Sunday whether it would even be possible.\n\nThere was so much debris in the water and so little beach to plunge from, she said.\n\nDon Burdick of Millsboro drove over to Rehoboth to see the damage.\n\n\"I think it's absolutely astounding, just the destruction of the dunes,\" he said.\n\nA friend with Burdick kicked the surface of the boardwalk to reveal a thick layer of sand.\n\n\"There's the beach,\" he said.\n\nAngela Wilson lives at Long Neck now but she grew up in Rehoboth and has witnessed many storms.\n\n\"I've seen lots of hurricanes and nor'easters, and I've never seen the beach this beat up,\" she said.\n\nTo the south, in Bethany, the damage was no less dramatic.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tom Carper, who with Markell and U.S. Rep. John Carney, visited the town Sunday afternoon said the loss of so much sand is \"very dispiriting\" but, he said it is all about the property protection that sand provided during this storm.\n\n\"It's not just beach renourishment,\" Carney said. \"It's property protection.\"\n\nCathy and Bud Davis, who live in Bethany West, surveyed the damage Sunday, too.\n\nCathy Davis said she admits she was one of the people who complained about the height of the dune in Bethany Beach when it was being constructed.\n\nNot this weekend.\n\n\"I was shocked when I came down Saturday, she said. \"Thank God we've got 'em,\" she said of the dunes.\n\nSeveral state lawmakers, Rep. Ron Gray, R-Millville, and Speaker of the House Pete Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth Beach, and Sen. Gerald Hocker, R-Ocean View, are former Bethany Beach lifeguards.\n\nEach agreed that the dunes made a huge difference during this storm.\n\n\"Those dunes saved us,\" Hocker said.\n\nReach Molly Murray at (302) 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.

That begins with Dover Motorsports, which will still bring in revenue from two racing weekends, even though the races are in different locations.\n\nIt also includes NASCAR, which expands into a market in Nashville that has grown both in population and popularity over the past decade or so.\n\nLET'S PLAY TWO?:Dover International Speedway could host a NASCAR Cup Series doubleheader in August\n\nBut McGlynn said that also includes Dover and the state of Delaware, even though it loses a big revenue-producing event.\n\nMcGlynn, however, said the loss of revenue could be mitigated somewhat by being able to focus on one event instead of two. McGlynn also said that the Dover race next year is expected to be held in late May, a much better date than the past few years, when the spring race was held the first weekend of May.\n\nNASCAR hasn't announced a schedule for 2021 yet.\n\nThe other race weekend for this year is scheduled for the weekend of Aug. 21-23. This is the first year the second Dover race is not one of NASCAR's playoff weeks, and that could potentially hurt attendance as well.\n\n\"There will be an impact felt in Dover, but it's not nearly the same as if it would have happened when we were getting 135,000 fans into the grandstands twice a year,\" McGlynn said about the track's heyday in the early 2000s.\n\n\"The effect now is that one race could be bigger than the amount of fans we'd get for each of the two races, so that might make up some of the deficit.\"\n\nEAGLES OWNER BREAKS SILENCE:Jeffrey Lurie on George Floyd killing: 'I am heartbroken and repulsed'\n\nStill, it's a significant change, both in Delaware and in NASCAR.\n\nDover International Speedway began hosting races in 1969. A second race weekend was added in 1971, and two races were held at the track every year since. Dover International Speedway, along with NASCAR, continued to grow through the 1990s and into the early 2000s.\n\nEventually, seating capacity at the speedway, which began at 22,000 in 1969, was increased to 135,000 in 2001. But like race tracks around the country, attendance started to decline beginning with the recession in 2008.\n\nSince that time, Dover has periodically taken out part of its stands. The seating capacity was reduced by nearly 30,000 over the winter, bringing the total down to 54,000.\n\nTOUCHING TRIBUTE:Parents of fallen Howard football player receive son's championship ring\n\nThe seating capacity at the track in Nashville is 25,000, but McGlynn said that can increase in time for the race next year.\n\nMcGlynn said the change was made because NASCAR officials are determined to \"put some juice\" into the schedule beginning in 2021, going into new and vibrant markets.\n\nHe said Nashville was at the top of NASCAR's wish list for hosting a race.\n\nBut McGlynn insisted that NASCAR wasn't mandating that Dover give up a race beginning in 2021.\n\n\"We weren't in danger of losing a race,\" McGlynn said. \"We certainly could have kept going (with two races per year).\"\n\nIt's just that once McGlynn heard that NASCAR wanted to move into Nashville, he felt it was a no-brainer to move one of its Dover races to a track that Dover Motorsports already owns.\n\nMcGlynn said that if it was a different location, he wouldn't have suggested moving one of Dover's races.\n\n\"It just made so much sense, and it came together rather quickly,\" McGlynn said.\n\nAdded NASCAR president Steve Phelps in a statement: “The Nashville market is a vital one for our sport, and (moving the Cup Series there) will be an integral building block in helping us further deliver on our promise in creating a dynamic schedule for 2021.”\n\nDover Motorsports built the track in Nashville about 20 years ago, and began hosting NASCAR lower-tier races and IndyCar events beginning in 2001, with the hopes of eventually hosting Cup Series races.\n\nBut the recession of 2008 eventually put those plans on hold, and NASCAR stopped coming to the track after the 2011 season.\n\nNashville's growth in recent years changed that. And NASCAR was convinced that it would be a desired destination last December when the sport's awards banquet was held there.\n\nDover still hosts the Firefly Music Festival each June, which drew around 90,000 fans back in 2015. Firefly was canceled this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMcGlynn said he's hoping a strong Firefly crowd next year, coupled with greater attendance at the lone race weekend will make up for much of the loss from losing a second race weekend.\n\nThen again, the capacity at the Dover races will be smaller than it has been in decades.\n\n\"It's simple supply and demand,\" McGlynn said. \"(Everything) is consolidated into one race weekend, so (the attendance) could be something bigger than what we've been having.\"\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

The governor’s office says grants totaling $4.1 million will help fund installing of chargers at fueling stations near interstates and other major highways. The money will provide as much as 80% of the cost of installing stations at existing sites in Jefferson, Tuscaloosa, Calhoun, Cullman, DeKalb, Greene and St. Clair counties. Many of the chargers will be along Interstate 20 from the Georgia line to Tuscaloosa. The money is from a settlement involving Volkswagen and the Environmental Protection Agency over the automaker’s violation of the federal Clean Air Act. In a statement, Gov.

Auto plants located in the state already have started the transition toward vehicles powered by electricity, she said. “This program will have a range of positive impacts in Alabama from creating cleaner air to helping to sell more vehicles manufactured right here in Alabama,” said Kenneth Boswell, director of the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, which will administer the grants.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state House late Tuesday passed a state budget that would result in a $525 dividend to residents this year and leave in doubt funding for a number of programs and infrastructure projects after it failed to garner sufficient support on a key vote.

That limit would be reached Friday. “We’re gonna look for a resolution that we can all live with and be happy with, and the people of Alaska will be very grateful to us,” said House Speaker Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak. “My hope is that the talks don’t stop,” House Minority Leader Cathy Tilton told reporters after the floor session, adding later: “I would hope that we would come together and have serious conversations, where all voices are being heard.” Dividends typically have been paid using earnings from the state’s oil-wealth fund. But the budget agreement that advanced from a six-member conference committee Sunday cobbled together money for dividends of about $1,100 from various sources, including the constitutional budget reserve fund that requires three-fourths support in each the House and Senate to tap. That vote failed Tuesday night in the House. The last time the check was in the $500 range was in 1986.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey on Tuesday blocked a new Arizona State University policy that would have required unvaccinated students to submit to twice-weekly coronavirus testing and wear a mask, calling the decision “bad policy.” The Republican governor issued an executive order saying students at the state’s public universities and community colleges can’t be required to get a COVID-19 vaccine, submit vaccination documents, or be tested or forced to wear masks. ASU and the Board of Regents said they would comply with Ducey’s order. An ASU statement noted that it never issued a vaccine mandate but was following guidelines for universities from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by ensuring unvaccinated people continue to follow protocols like masking. Ducey’s order came after he criticized the policy in a series of tweets Monday night. He said that the rules for students attending class in person this fall have “no basis in public health” and that even the Biden administration has been more reasonable. But the governor also included a screenshot of a quote from the CDC’s director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, that appeared to contradict his own position. “It is the people who are not fully vaccinated in those settings, who might not be wearing a mask, who are not protected,” Walensky is quoted as saying.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The American Civil Liberties Union on Tuesday asked a federal judge to prevent the state from enforcing its ban on gender-confirming treatments for transgender youth while a lawsuit challenging the prohibition proceeds. The ACLU requested a preliminary injunction against the new law, which is set to take effect July 28. It will prohibit doctors from providing gender-confirming hormone treatment, puberty blockers or surgery to anyone under 18 years old or from referring them to other providers for the treatment. The ACLU filed a lawsuit challenging the ban last month on behalf of four transgender youth and their families, as well as two doctors who provide the treatments. The ban is forcing some families of transgender youth to move out of state to continue their children’s treatments, if they can afford to do so, the filing contends. “The threat of harm to plaintiffs is concrete, imminent, and devastating, and far outweighs any conceivable cost to the state of maintaining the status quo while this case proceeds,” the filing says. Republican lawmakers enacted the ban in April, overriding a veto by GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson following pleas from pediatricians, social workers and the parents of transgender youth who said the measure would harm a community already at risk for depression and suicide.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Thousands of Central California farmers were warned Tuesday that they could face water cutoffs this summer as the state deals with a drought that already has curtailed federal and state irrigation supplies. The State Water Resources Control Board notified about 6,600 farmers in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed who have rights to use water from the Central Valley estuary of “impending water unavailability” that may continue until winter rains come. “This is how dry things are,” water board Chairman Joaquin Esquivel told the Sacramento Bee. “The hydrology that we’re seeing is not there. … There will not be enough natural flow.” The state also must provide enough flow in the rivers to maintain populations of protected fish species in rivers while keeping “cities and communities from running out of water,” Esquivel said. It’s unclear when the allocations will be cut or whom it will affect. Some farmers have first crack at supplies under a complicated distribution system involving rights-holders. Many farmers already have been told they will get little or nothing from two large allocation systems, the federal Central Valley Project and the State Water Project. “The 2021 water year for the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Basin is currently the driest since 1977,” the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has warned.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis said he will begin phasing out the executive authority he has been granted during the coronavirus pandemic after creating, amending and extending about 400 orders since March 2020. The Democrat told The Denver Post that he’s now ready to let go of his unprecedented authority. “The pandemic still exists,” he said, but “our hospital capacity is no longer threatened. We have 60% of the population vaccinated. So at this point, we would go to kind of regular order, which means the Legislature passes laws, I can sign laws, and you can see the phaseout of those executive powers over time.” Polis has continued to exert his executive authority through multiple emergency mandates, enacting 17 orders in March, 13 in April, 10 in May and six so far this month. “In general, the time for these emergency actions is over, or near over. I believe in a republic, and I believe in three branches of government,” Polis said. “It’s not the role of the governor to do that long-term. It’s the role of the governor to react in an emergency.” Polis’ promise to phase out his powers was well-received news among Republican state officials who have worked for months to remove his additional authority. Republican state Sen. Paul Lundeen said he will believe it when he sees it.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state Senate on Tuesday passed legislation for the second time in about a week that legalizes the recreational use of cannabis for adults. But Gov. Ned Lamont is threatening to veto the retooled bill, arguing it opens the industry up to tens of thousands of people previously ineligible to get priority for licenses. Shortly before the bill cleared the Senate on a 19-12 vote, Paul Mounds, the Democratic governor’s chief of staff, issued a statement promising Lamont would nix the bill in its current form. The House was scheduled to take up the same legislation Wednesday, but it was unclear what would happen given the veto threat. The legislation “simply put, does not meet the goals laid out during negotiations when it comes to equity and ensuring the wrongs of the past are righted,” Mounds said in a statement. “To the contrary, this proposal opens the floodgates for tens of thousands of previously ineligible applicants to enter the adult-use cannabis industry.” He said the bill, which was amended twice Tuesday, allows “just about anyone with a history of cannabis crimes” or a member of their family, regardless of their financial means, who was once arrested for possession of drugs to be considered an “equity applicant,” given the same weight as someone from a neighborhood hit hard by the war on drugs.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill that would bar police from releasing juvenile mug shots for minor crimes. House Bill 243 by Rep. Franklin Cooke, D-New Castle, would apply to booking photos of children 17 or younger. According to the bill, mug shots could still be published if the juvenile is charged with a violent felony and if the mug shot is necessary to protect the public’s safety. The Delaware Police Chiefs Council, which represents all police departments in the state, supports the bill, according to its chair, Patrick Ogden. Jamie Leonard, president of the Delaware Fraternal Order of Police, the officers’ union, said his organization has yet to take a stance on the bill. In a Statehouse where several lawmakers in both parties – including sponsor Cooke – are retired officers or affiliated with police, proposed changes to policing laws historically need support from the police themselves. Cooke has argued that, because information such as mug shots lives forever on the internet, teenage mistakes come back to haunt people in adulthood. “I think everyone can agree that in the vast majority of circumstances, there’s no benefit to publishing juvenile mug shots – only damage to young people,” Cooke said. “I’m committed to getting this bill passed this year and ending this practice.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With all capacity limits and restrictions lifted in the district, plans for Fourth of July celebrations are back in full swing. President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that he will host essential workers and military families on the South Lawn to celebrate the nation’s birthday, WUSA-TV reports. “D.C. is open and ready to welcome back visitors to celebrate the way we came together as a city and as a nation this year,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said. “We have shown once again that when we come together, there is nothing we can’t do.” With the nation inching closer to Biden’s vaccination goal, the country is gearing up for an Independence Day celebration like no other. “We thank President Biden and his team for acting with urgency to get the vaccine to the American people so that we could save lives, get our country open and celebrate together once again,” Bowser said. The district will support the White House and host the annual Fourth of July fireworks celebration on the National Mall. The 17-minute display will be held Sunday, July 4, starting at 9:09 p.m. and will be launched from both sides of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. The city also plans to celebrate the return of the Barracks Row and Palisades 4th of July Parades.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Sunsets across the state in the coming days could become even more spectacular, as clouds of dust from the Sahara desert sweep in across the Atlantic coast. The plume is expected to dampen storm activity but worsen air pollution, causing trouble for some people with allergies and other respiratory problems. Some health experts say symptoms could mimic those from COVID-19. NASA is monitoring the dust, which was swept off Africa by strong winds swirling across the deserts of Mali and Mauritania. Trade winds are carrying the plume across the ocean, with the leading edge expected to arrive in Florida in the coming days. “It’s going to be a major dust outbreak,” Joseph Prospero, professor emeritus at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. Prospero pioneered research into African dust clouds. Dry winds carrying the particles could help smother storm systems by drying out the humid tropical air that feeds turbulent weather across a well-traveled route for hurricanes, experts said. “It’s been moving across the Atlantic for the past several days, and it’s expected to be in the area around Friday or Saturday,” Sammy Hadi, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Miami, told the paper.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTrenton: A nursing home director in northwestern Georgia was charged with cruelty after a sheriff said authorities discovered the facility didn’t have working air conditioning and had only one staff member looking after residents. Dade County deputies arrested Kent Allen Womack on Monday night, news outlets report. The 55-year-old was in custody at the county jail, and Sheriff Ray Cross said more charges were pending. Authorities reported to Woodhaven Senior Living in Trenton after receiving a call from a family member about the residents, from 61 to 97 years old, being evicted and having an hour to pack their belongings. Deputies who went to the nursing home learned one staff member – who wasn’t a trained nurse – had been watching the residents for 32 hours straight, according to news outlets. Every other employee quit because of the conditions. It was also discovered that the air conditioning in the building only worked near Womack’s office. “We checked the temperature in one of the air units in there, and it registered over 100 degrees,” Cross said Tuesday. The sheriff said Womack smelled of alcohol when he arrived at the facility. Cross asked if he had been drinking, and the nursing home owner responded: “I didn’t drive here.” Authorities found two small bottles of alcohol in Womack’s pocket, Cross said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Eleven inmates at a state jail have asked a judge to release them early for public health reasons amid a COVID-19 outbreak. Hilo Circuit Judge Peter Kubota granted five of the motions but denied or postponed the rest, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Most of the cases he denied were for offenders who had repeatedly violated probation in the past. As of Friday, nearly 200 inmates at the Hawaii Community Correctional Center had tested positive for the coronavirus since May 24. There were seven active cases among staff. The outbreak occurred as the jail struggled with overcrowding. The jail population exceeds operational capacity by more than 100 inmates. Deputy Public Defender Patrick Munoz, who represents some of the people asking to be released early, said the increasingly intolerable conditions at the jail represent an undue hardship for inmates. “Not only are individuals being exposed to the effects of this potentially life-threatening and long-lasting virus, but there’s also the effects on people being in an overcrowded prison afraid for their lives,” he said. “It’s like they’re on a sinking ship. Fear is overcoming them;people are beginning to panic.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Unemployed residents could get kicked out of a state benefits program if they don’t follow new job-seeking requirements that went into effect this month. People receiving unemployment benefits now have two business days to apply for a job opening after receiving a referral from the Idaho Department of Labor, the Idaho Statesman reports. If they don’t, they could lose their unemployment benefits. “Once a job is referred, the claimant must apply for the job or act on that referral,” Idaho Department of Labor director Jani Revier said. “In the past, when referrals were made, there were no consequences if they didn’t follow up.” State workforce consultants will check with the potential employer to verify that the person applied for the referred job. Previously, the labor department didn’t track whether people followed up on referrals. In March, there were 1.4 available jobs for every unemployed Idaho resident, Revier said. Property values and housing costs have climbed dramatically across much of the state in recent years, particularly during the pandemic. Idaho’s minimum wage of $7.25, meanwhile, hasn’t increased since 2009. A full-time minimum-wage worker would earn about $1,250 a month before taxes. Online rental agency ApartmentList.com says median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Boise is just over $900.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A nonprofit formed to highlight the lack of leaders of color within the city’s arts and cultural systems is asking artists of color to imagine what the nation’s third-largest city could look like without stubborn inequities in art, theater and other institutions. The first phase of Enrich Chicago’s new program, called Imagine Just, begins this month. The series of brainstorming sessions will ask artists, performers and other Chicagoans to imagine what an equitable arts and cultural scene could look like. Nina Sanchez, co-director of Enrich Chicago, sees the project as an expansion of the organization’s focus on anti-racism training and education within Chicago’s arts and cultural community. The organization was founded in 2014 by former leaders of the influential Joyce Foundation and the Auditorium Theatre. It now counts more than 50 arts and cultural organizations as partners. But the coronavirus pandemic and widespread activism during the past year in response to George Floyd’s death highlighted stubborn inequities in all aspects of life, prompting conversations about what else the organization could do to force change in Chicago’s arts and culture community, Sanchez said. Imagine Just is the result, attempting to amplify the voices of artists of color and reach leaders of local institutions that can feel out of reach, she said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Several teachers unions are seeking to block a new state law, set to take effect next month, that they say unfairly targets teachers and makes it harder for unions to collect dues. The unions representing Anderson, Avon and Martinsville school districts and the teachers that lead them filed a lawsuit Tuesday in Indiana’s federal Southern District court challenging Senate Enrolled Act 251. The law, which will go into effect July 1, sets out a new process for the collection of teachers union dues, requiring teachers to annually complete a three-step process to have union dues deducted from their paychecks. Jeff Macey, the attorney representing the teachers and their unions, said no other union or organization that allows for wage deductions is required to follow the same process. The law violates the constitutional rights of teachers, he said. “Why are teachers being singled out for these onerous restrictions?” Macey said. “No other union, no other charity, no other organization in the state has to do this to assign a portion of your wages to (them).” The lawsuit names Attorney General Todd Rokita, Secretary of Education Katie Jenner and Tammy Meyer, chair of the Indiana Education Employment Relations Board, as defendants.\n\nIowa\n\nLake City: A fire destroyed an internationally renowned western Iowa business that makes pipe organs for churches, schools and other customers around the world. The fire at Dobson Pipe Organ Builders in Lake City was reported about 4 p.m. Tuesday, officials said. Firefighters who arrived on the scene found the building engulfed in flames, which caused the building’s exterior walls to collapse. One employee of the company was burned when he discovered the fire and tried to put out the flames, according to authorities. The State Fire Marshal’s Office said it believes the fire was started by a malfunctioning fan that caused sawdust to ignite. Dobson Pipe Organ Builders was founded in 1974 by Lynn Dobson, a Carroll native who attended Wayne State College in Nebraska, according to the business’ website. During his years at the college, he built his first 12-top mechanical action organ in a shed on his family’s farm that he sold to Our Savior’s Lutheran Church in Sioux City, where it is still played. Dobson opened the Lake City factory in a former farm implement dealership on the town’s square in 1974. The company installed its 98th organ this year at St. Christopher’s Church in Chatham, Massachusetts, according to its website, and planned its 99th for Saint James Church in Sydney, Australia.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Kansas Statehouse, often dubbed the people’s house, was missing one thing for the past year: the people. Lobbyists and staff joined elected legislators in the building for the January session, but pandemic-related limits on visitors meant no school groups, curious tourists or children standing in front of John Steuart Curry’s epic painting “Tragic Prelude,” a history book textbook brought to life before their very eyes. That changed Monday, when the Statehouse once again resumed tours, bringing a sense of normalcy back to downtown Topeka as a trickle of visitors to the seat of state government turned into a waterfall. Only one person showed up for a 9 a.m. tour, leaving staff wondering how many onlookers would show throughout the day. But almost two dozen visitors came for a tour two hours later – numbers that would have been above average even before COVID-19. Not everything is fully back to normal, though. Tours to the top of the Statehouse dome have yet to resume, with staff hoping to have them back up and running later this summer. And the four-times-a-day tours require juggling for workers, with many part-time guides still laid off.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A 25-foot-tall nest is being pieced together on a massive scale at Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest, already home to a family of giant wooden trolls. Artist Jayson Fann is constructing his “Spirit Nest” creation as part of a new “Playcosystem,” a new 10-acre natural playground that stresses the importance of free play and connecting children with nature. The enormous nest’s spiraling branches resemble a prehistoric bird’s nest or a massive clock face to be ogled, climbed on and enjoyed. Fann is working on 12 Spirit Nests this year, with the pandemic slowing his output in 2020. An amphitheater made from salvaged forest wood will encompass the Bernheim nest, providing a place to educate and entertain visitors in the forest. A large drum made from the hollowed stump of a fallen maple tree will sit in the center of the nest. A percussionist himself, Fann’s goal is for the project to be a link to the Indigenous people and African Americans who have a history with the land at Bernheim. It is a nest for all people. “That’s what the nests are. They are storytelling spaces, to bring people together, in the spirit of community. Imagine a full moon and kids are here; maybe there is a campfire, and you’ve got people from different cultures sharing their life story, connecting and healing. That’s a space I want to hang out in,” he said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state has created a framework for self-driving delivery robots to drop off packages and navigate streets, under a bill backed by lawmakers and Gov. John Bel Edwards. The new personal delivery device law sponsored by state Sen. Rick Ward, R-Port Allen, took effect immediately after the Democratic governor signed the legislation. Grocery stores, pizza delivery restaurants and Amazon have started working on delivering items with self-driving robots. Ward told his colleagues he envisioned pharmacies, restaurants or other stores near local neighborhoods possibly using the devices to make short-distance deliveries. “Your constituents would be able to place an order for any number of things, and that personal delivery device would be able to pick that up from a store location and go throughout the neighborhood and deliver it along the way,” Ward told the House transportation committee when it debated and approved the measure. Under the new law, self-driving delivery robots must run at low speeds – up to 12 miles per hour in pedestrian areas and up to 20 mph in others. They must yield to pedestrians and can’t obstruct traffic or transport hazardous materials. Companies using the delivery vehicles must have lights on the front and rear of each device and maintain at least $100,000 of insurance on each one.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A proposed constitutional amendment to require popular elections for Maine’s attorney general, secretary of state and treasurer has fallen short in the state House. A two-thirds majority is required in both chambers to send the proposed amendment to the voters for approval. The bill won 27-7 support on Monday in the Senate, which approved an amendment to ensure the use of ranked-choice voting. But the House, which previously narrowly approved the measure, rejected the amended version by an 81-62 vote Tuesday, the Bangor Daily News reports. Maine is among a handful of states that do not hold statewide general elections for so-called constitutional officers. The positions are chosen by the Legislature and typically are filled by the party in power. Former Republican Gov. Paul LePage called for a similar change in 2015, when he was involved in a political dispute with then-Attorney General Janet Mills. But Republican support eroded with the ranked-choice voting provision. Republicans have decried the voting system since GOP U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin lost his reelection to Democrat Jared Golden despite winning the plurality of first-place votes. Golden was declared the majority winner after an additional voting round in the three-way race.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Videos showing police officers kneeing one Black teen and using a Taser on another on the beach community’s Boardwalk in separate confrontations that began over vaping are stirring criticism of the department’s use of force in such cases. On June 6, officers tried to stop a teen because he was vaping, police said in a statement. When he pulled away from an officer grabbing him in a “bear hug” and began threatening to kill them, an officer used a Taser, according to charging documents. Video of the encounter shows the teen with his hands up, but as one hand drops toward his backpack, an officer fires a Taser, and he falls to the ground. Other videos show the teen being carried away by officers with his hands and feet tied. Court documents state that the 18-year-old from Perryville teen is Black. A video of another Boardwalk confrontation Saturday shows another Black teen being held by several officers while another knees him repeatedly as a dozen officers and public safety aides hold back an angry crowd. One teen is taken into custody after lifting one of several police bicycles encircling the officers, and another is Tased as he struggles with officers. That confrontation began after officers approached a large group of people vaping to tell them it was prohibited, then returning when they saw one begin to vape again, police said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A company that authorities say failed to deliver on a contract to supply 1 million N95 face masks to the state and then made false statements in connection with its obligation to refund the state has agreed to pay nearly $3.5 million to settle the allegations, the state attorney general’s office said Wednesday. The company, Salem-based Bedrock Group LLC, signed a $3.6 million contract with the state in April 2020 in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic to supply the masks, essential for health care workers, according to a statement from authorities. The state made the purchase after it was contacted by the company’s president with an offer to supply the masks, which the president said would come from a reputable manufacturer in China. The masks were supposed to be shipped to the state in mid-April 2020, but the order was terminated in June after fewer than 100,000 of the masks were delivered. Bedrock repeatedly acknowledged its obligation to refund the state but failed to do so, according to the attorney general’s office. “This company tried to take advantage of the state by holding onto millions of taxpayer dollars it owed for masks that it never delivered,” Attorney General Maura Healey said. In addition to repaying the money, Bedrock is not allowed to seek another state contract for five years.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A school district that never returned to classrooms in the 2020-21 academic year will embrace online education again in the fall and open it to more students. Lansing said it will keep online classes as an option and invite families from other mid-Michigan districts to participate. The district also plans to open schools in a traditional way as the COVID-19 pandemic eases. “We had a number of students who were doing very well” online, said Superintendent Sam Sinicropi. “So we decided to explore what it would look like to offer a virtual option.” The district expects to enroll up to 600 students and hire 15 new teachers, who will teach solely online. Students will be allowed to participate in sports and other activities at Lansing schools. “There are some families that prefer this, and hopefully this will be the answer for them,” Sinicropi said. The capital city’s district has more than 10,000 students.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A bankruptcy trustee’s search to recover assets linked to one of the largest financial crimes in state history has netted $722 million. Doug Kelley said his work to collect assets from Tom Petters’ $1.9 billion Ponzi scheme is nearly done 13 years after the search began. A motion filed in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis last week shows the amount recovered and returned to victims and creditors, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. “We can see the light at the end of the tunnel here,” Kelley said. “It has been a long and arduous process that was at times bumpy, but I am quite pleased with the collective return of $722 million.” Petters, now 63, was indicted in 2008 on multiple counts of mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy for operating the scheme that spanned 26 countries, including the the Cayman Islands, Germany and Switzerland. A federal jury found him guilty on all counts, and he was sentenced to 50 years in prison. He is currently an inmate at the federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas. Kelley said just four or five cases remain, including one filed against the Bank of Montreal in Canada.\n\nMississippi\n\nBooneville: Friends, family and former colleagues gathered in the city Monday to remember former Mississippi House Speaker Billy McCoy and unveil a sign that names a segment of a highway in his honor. McCoy was 77 when he died in 2019. The farmer from Rienzi was a self-described Franklin D. Roosevelt New Deal Democrat who was first elected to the state House in 1979. McCoy was speaker during his final two terms, ending in 2012. McCoy – known for down-home turns of phrase and the occasional flash of temper – was instrumental in passing the 1987 Highway Program that led to construction of hundreds of miles of four-lane roads across Mississippi, including in rural areas struggling for economic development. Legislators in 2020 passed a bill naming segments of highways, including the stretch of U.S. 45 in Prentiss and Alcorn counties, in honor of McCoy. Both counties were in his House district. Democrat Steve Holland of Plantersville, who served in the House from 1984 to 2020, said McCoy would pick him up in an old blue Oldsmobile, and they’d ride the backroads of Mississippi together, stopping at country stores to see what was on people’s minds. “I don’t need a sign to remember him,” Holland said. “But, my goodness, what a wonderful way because the guy loved the roads. He loved riding them, and he loved seeing people.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Two of the area’s largest employers have announced they will require employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by fall. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports BJC HealthCare and Washington University both announced the requirements Tuesday. The decision comes at a time when demand for vaccines is waning in Missouri, a state that already lags the national average with its COVID-19 immunization rate. The St. Louis region’s three other major health systems – SSM Health, Mercy and St. Luke’s Hospital – have not issued vaccine requirements but said they were discussing the issue. Missouri Hospital Association President and CEO Herb Kuhn said hospitals across the state have “seen COVID-19’s devastation in lives and health lost,” and many are evaluating vaccine requirements. Washington University will require all faculty, staff and trainees to be vaccinated by Aug. 30. BJC will require employees to be fully vaccinated by Sept. 15.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state Department of Corrections will pay $250,000 to settle claims from a guard who claimed he was retaliated against after reporting rape allegations at Montana Women’s Prison. Daniel Root claimed he was passed over twice for a promotion after reporting in 2017 allegations of his supervisor’s sexual misconduct with inmates. The results of an investigation into the claims have not been released, but the lieutenant accused of having sex with an inmate resigned in 2019, the Montana State News Bureau reports. Root said in court filings that he was told filing lawsuits and talking to the press about issues of public concern reflected negatively on his chances for promotion. He resigned under the terms of the agreement. His attorney told the Montana State News Bureau that Root wanted to put the case behind him. Attorney Kevin Brown said he hopes the case will spur other corrections employees to step forward and report violations of rape reporting requirements. The Department of Corrections settled a separate retaliation claim from an agency employee earlier this year, also for $250,000. In that case, a former corrections employee said he faced discrimination and retaliation in 2016 for his post-traumatic stress disorder while working at the men’s state prison near Deer Lodge.\n\nNebraska\n\nSouth Sioux City: The City Council has approved a payment of $500,000 to settle its part in 16 lawsuits filed against the city and a now-defunct biogas plant by homeowners who accused the plant of sending rancid fumes through the city sewer system and ruining their homes. The settlement calls for the city, Big Ox Energy, three insurance companies and two other companies to pay a combined $1.75 million, which will be divided among the homeowners. The City Council approved South Sioux City’s portion Monday, the Sioux City Journal reports. Big Ox began operations in September 2016, separating solids from industry wastewater to create methane. The plant sold the methane and injected it into a nearby natural gas pipeline. Big Ox was subject to odor complaints soon after it began operations and was cited for numerous environmental violations until it shut down in 2019. Neither South Sioux City nor Big Ox, which have both denied the homeowners’ claims, admit liability in the settlement. After the complaints and lawsuit, Big Ox in turn sued two other companies. The first was former soybean processor CHS Inc., which it said illegally released acidic wastewater into the sewer system. The second was Olsson Inc., an engineering firm Big Ox said recommended wastewater from its plant be routed through a sewer main.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A battery recycling company founded by a former executive at Tesla Inc. broke ground on 100 acres of land at an industrial park near the city as part of its expansion plan. Redwood Materials, founded in Nevada in 2017, is expecting its operations to continue growing with a boost in used battery packs from older electric vehicles. As a result, the company plans to expand its facilities and increase its workforce from just over 100 employees to more than 600 in the next couple of years. In addition to the acquisition at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, the company is also undertaking a major project in Carson City to expand its 150,000-square-foot facility to 550,000 square feet within the next two years. “We’ve been on the quiet side because we prefer to make progress and get things done,” Redwood Materials CEO JB Straubel said. “We felt it was time to connect a bit more with the local community and help raise awareness for hiring and make sure people realize this is a worthy and unique opportunity here as well.” Straubel is known for helping launch Tesla, the electric vehicle manufacturer that has been operating out of the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center for nearly seven years. Tesla works with Panasonic to create battery packs from various components. Redwood Materials, Straubel’s new venture, does the reverse.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Budget negotiators in the state House on Tuesday went along with the Senate version of a provision that would prohibit teaching schoolchildren or public employees that one race is superior to another or that one inherently discriminates against another. The House had included language in its budget defining numerous “divisive concepts” that would be banned from being taught in schools or by public employers during diversity and inclusion training. The Senate overhauled the language in the face of opposition from Gov. Chris Sununu, framing it as an anti-discrimination measure that would not prohibit discussions about history or current events. But opponents have argued it still would limit First Amendment rights by banning discussions about important topics including racism and sexism. Rep. Lynne Ober, R-Hudson, who is leading the committee hashing out a compromise on the budget, said Tuesday that the House acceded to the Senate’s language. There was no debate. Work continued on the larger bill Wednesday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: State lawmakers are considering a bill that would fast-track offshore wind energy projects by removing the ability of local governments to control power lines and other onshore components. The bill, introduced last week and advanced Tuesday, would give wind energy projects approved by the state Board of Public Utilities authority to locate, build, use and maintain wires and associated land-based infrastructure as long as they run underground on public property including streets, though the BPU could determine that some above-ground wires are necessary. It appears to be an effort to head off any local objections to at least one wind power project envisioned to come ashore at two former power plants and run cables under two of the state’s most popular beaches. At a virtual public hearing in April on the Ocean Wind project planned by Orsted, the Danish wind energy developer, and PSEG, a New Jersey utility company, officials revealed that the project would connect to the electric grid at decommissioned power plants in Ocean and Cape May Counties. The northern connection would be at the former Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in Lacey Township; the southern connection would be at the former B.L. England plant in Upper Township.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democrat-backed efforts to expand voter access in the state are coming to fruition, with the rollout of same-day voter registration this month. The first trial run took place in a low-turnout special congressional election June 1, allowing voters to register at early voting centers in the final weeks of balloting and Election Day. In all, 2,012 residents took advantage of the opportunity to register during the final four weeks of the election, according to the New Mexico secretary of state’s office. Late-registering voters flocked primarily to the Democratic Party, accounting for about 53% of those registrations – and 50% of those on Election Day itself. About 32% of the later registrations aligned with the Republican Party. U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury, a Democrat, won the June 1 election with 60% of the vote to fill the 1st Congressional District seat held previously by Deb Haaland. Same-day registration is likely to be an option in future New Mexico elections, but it requires approval every two years by a panel of voting systems regulators. Approval is pending for the November local election to pick mayors in cities including Albuquerque and Santa Fe.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A former Shake Shack manager has filed a lawsuit against the Detectives’ Endowment Association, the Police Benevolent Association, and about 20 unnamed New York Police Department officers accusing them of false arrest and defamation. Marcus Gilliam and other employees were accused by officers of serving them poisoned milkshakes last June. In a lawsuit filed Monday, Gilliam said the subsequent interrogation caused him “emotional and psychological damages and damage to his reputation.” Three officers complained that their shakes made them sick and had a bitter and unusual taste. Two hours later, 20 officers approached the establishment and began to treat the store as a crime scene, The New York Times reports. As the investigation unfolded, police unions announced on Twitter that officers were intentionally attacked. “Tonight, three of our fellow officers were intentionally poisoned by one or more workers at the Shake Shack,” the detectives’ union tweeted. The Police Benevolent Association made a similar post later alleging that the drinks were intentionally spiked with “a toxic substance, believed to be bleach or a similar cleaning agent.” Rodney Harrison, the NYPD’s chief of detectives at the time and now chief of the department, eventually tweeted that the investigation found “no criminality” by the employees.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s ban on most abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy must remain unenforceable, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday, rejecting arguments that the law should be left intact because prosecutors aren’t going after doctors who violate it. A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, upheld a 2019 lower-court decision striking down the prohibition, which has been on the books since 1973. The Republican-dominated Legislature in 2015 narrowed the scope of medical emergencies under which a woman would be exempt from the 20-week limit. That meant more abortions involving unviable fetuses could be considered criminal, raising the fear for abortion providers that they could face prosecution. A U.S. District Court judge in 2019 agreed and blocked the law’s enforcement in situations where the fetus would be considered not viable. State government lawyers representing some district attorneys and state health officials who were sued have argued the abortion providers lack legal standing to challenge the law. Their arguments for the law’s reinstatement are based on the fact that North Carolina has not charged any abortion providers under a pair of laws being challenged and that prosecutors currently have no plans to do so.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The number of wildfires this year in the state has increased significantly, officials say, citing extremely dry conditions. Data collected by the North Dakota Forest Service and the state Department of Emergency Services shows nearly 1,400 fires have consumed about 156 square miles since the beginning of the year. Last year, about 921 fires burned approximately 18 square miles. North Dakota has experienced some of the driest winter and spring months this year. The U.S. Drought Monitor shows more than two-thirds of the state is in extreme or exceptional drought. State Forester Tom Claeys said limited moisture along with warm temperatures have increased the intensity and size of wildfires this year. “This year, it’s imperative that we all know how to mitigate against wildfires, especially as we make plans to enjoy the summer months by recreating outside with friends and family,” Claeys said. “With Independence Day right around the corner, we need to raise awareness now to reduce wildfire risk. We all can do our part to practice fire safety and protect property and lives.” Tribal, state and federal agencies responded to two large wildfires April 30 through May 2. The Roosevelt Creek Fire in the Little Missouri National Grassland and one on the Fort Berthold Reservation have each burned about 15 square miles or more.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican former Speaker Larry Householder was expelled from the state House in a vote Wednesday following his indictment in an alleged $60 million federal bribery probe – only the second time the Legislature has pushed out a member and the first time in 150 years. The Republican-led House voted 75-21 to remove Householder, of Perry County, approving a resolution that said he was not suited for office because of the indictment. The full House voted after lawmakers forced the measure to the floor instead of waiting for the expulsion resolution to work through the committee process. Reps. Brian Stewart and Mark Frazier, both Republicans representing districts that border Householder’s, encouraged their colleagues to “do the right thing” and vote to expel. “This has been a distraction. This has been a stain on the institution, and it is time for us to come together as one body,” Frazier said, adding that “this institution is greater than any one man.” Householder and four associates were arrested in July in an investigation connected to legislation containing a ratepayer-funded bailout of two Ohio nuclear power plants. The $1 billion rescue would have added a new fee to every electricity bill in the state and directed over $150 million a year through 2026 to the plants near Cleveland and Toledo.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A 24-member joint committee of state House and Senate members has been selected to consider proposals for Oklahoma’s share of funds from the latest federal coronavirus relief legislation. House Speaker Charles McCall and Senate President Pro Tem Greg Treat, both Republicans, announced the committee Wednesday. “This is an opportunity to address needs exposed by the pandemic and support economic recovery without growing state government’s financial obligations,” McCall said. Treat said the one-time funds provide “the opportunity to further strengthen Oklahoma’s position through targeted investments in projects across the state.” Gov. Kevin Stitt said the money can be used to improve the state’s infrastructure and workforce, as well as the health of residents. The state is to receive about $1.9 billion of the total $1.9 trillion in federal funds approved by Congress in March. The bill, among President Joe Biden’s top priorities in addressing the coronavirus pandemic and economic crises, was unanimously opposed by Republicans in Congress. The Oklahoma committee will be co-chaired by Sen. Roger Thompson and Rep. Kevin Wallace, both Republicans.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Gov. Kate Brown has signed a bill passed by the Legislature legalizing human composting. The measure signed Tuesday will legalize what’s also known as natural organic reduction, KOIN-TV reports. It also clarifies rules surrounding alkaline hydrolysis, known as aqua cremation. The law goes into effect July 1, 2022. Rep. Pam Marsh, from in Southern Jackson County, who co-sponsored the bill with Rep. Brian Clem, said she decided to sponsor the bill because her constituents are interested in alternative after-death options. “My colleagues could see as well that in addition to providing families with a choice, it also is a business opportunity,” she said. Elizabeth Fournier, owner of Cornerstone Funeral Services in Boring, Oregon, and author of a green burial guidebook, provides “green” and eco-friendly after-death services and has given clients the option of natural organic reduction since it was legalized in Washington state in 2020. Fournier takes bodies to Herland Forest in Wahkiacus, Washington. It’s a natural burial cemetery about 100 miles east of Portland. In 2020, Fournier witnessed her first natural organic reduction and said seeing the process for herself made her more comfortable in talking to her clients about that option.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A western Pennsylvania judge will mediate a dispute over a statue of explorer Christopher Columbus in a city park. Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge John McVay declared an impasse in the dispute between the city of Pittsburgh and the Italian Sons and Daughters of America over the Columbus statue in Schenley Park, the Tribune-Review reports. McVay issued an order last week instructing the parties to identify who will participate from each side during the mediation. City crews last fall covered the 13-foot statue, which was erected in 1955, in advance of Columbus Day. The Pittsburgh Art Commission voted unanimously to remove the statue, and Mayor Bill Peduto agreed, but the Italian Sons and Daughters of America filed a lawsuit. McVay granted an injunction halting the removal but urged the parties to try to reach consensus, saying that “historical figures are people and necessarily come with heroic qualities along with character flaws” but also saying that “racism, slavery and prejudice must always be condemned and rejected by our city.” The group then asked the judge to remove himself, saying the court had adopted “its own beliefs” on settlement discussions that “are based on demonstrably false and biased recitations of history that are swiftly disproven by the primary sources of Columbus’s time.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A doctor has been cited by federal labor officials for failing to take steps to protect his medical office staff from exposure to COVID-19 even after he and other employees contracted the coronavirus. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration said Tuesday that Dr. Anthony Farina Jr. “willfully exposed” his workers to the virus when he decided to continue working. The agency said he also failed to fully implement safeguards such as cleaning and disinfecting regimens, screening all employees for symptoms, or mandating contact tracing or quarantining after exposure. Labor officials said they’d seek a $136,532 fine against Farina, who runs four medical practices: North Providence Urgent Care Inc., North Providence Primary Care Associates Inc., Center of New England Urgent Care Inc. and Center of New England Primary Care Inc. Farina’s lawyer, Michael Lepizzera, said his client will contest OSHA’s findings and proposed penalty, which he said is “legally excessive.” State officials in January suspended Farina’s license under emergency order, saying he posed a danger to the community, though they restored it the following month. Farina also faces federal allegations that he violated fair labor laws by failing to pay overtime to more than 100 employees.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: As the state nears its first execution in a decade, death penalty opponents are renewing calls for South Carolina to toss out its capital punishment statute. A group of faith leaders, academics, organizers and others delivered a letter Wednesday to Gov. Henry McMaster and the General Assembly calling for a halt to two upcoming executions and the repeal of the state’s death penalty law. Group members acknowledge it’s unlikely that the politicians who ushered in a new law aimed at restarting executions after an involuntary 10-year pause will now turn around and repeal that law. Their group, South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, was formed in light of two upcoming executions this month. “We don’t expect that we’re going to stop an execution,” said Abraham Bonowitz, director of Death Penalty Action, a national anti-death penalty group that helps local organizations oppose capital punishment. “What we do expect is that we’re going to create the organization that’s going to abolish the death penalty in this state. It might take two years, it might take 10 years, but that’s what this organization is designed to do.” State prisons officials are planning Friday to electrocute Brad Sigmon, 63, who has spent nearly two decades on death row after he was convicted in 2002 of killing his ex-girlfriend’s parents with a baseball bat.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem indicated Tuesday that she will try again to hold a fireworks display over Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day on the heels of President Joe Biden’s announcement that the White House will be hosting its own “independence from the virus” bash. The National Parks Service in March denied the state’s application to hold the pyrotechnic display, reasoning that fireworks caused safety concerns at the monument, that local Native American tribes objected to the celebration being held on land they hold as sacred and that a mass gathering could still defy coronavirus precautions. In an effort to overturn that decision, the Republican governor has written a letter to the president, bashed Biden in the media and sued the U.S. Department of the Interior. All of those efforts have failed. But after Biden announced Tuesday that he would be encouraging nationwide celebrations to mark the country’s effective return to normalcy, Noem said on Twitter that she would resubmit a request to hold fireworks at the monument on Saturday, July 3. However, even if the federal government reversed its decision, the state would struggle to pull the event together with July Fourth weekend just weeks away. Noem’s administration previously said in court that the state would have to know by June 2 to have ample planning time.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Amazon on Wednesday announced a commitment of $75million for developers to create affordable homes in the city near WeGo Public Transit high-capacity corridors. The company reported 800 homes will be built on private land, and the investment is part of Amazon’s more than $2 billion Housing Equity Fund to preserve and create over 20,000 affordable homes through below-market loans to housing partners, traditional and nontraditional public agencies, and minority-led organizations. The Music City is one of three cities hosting the company’s new headquarters, where Amazon hopes to infuse communities with cash and support over the next five years. Transportation and housing costs account for a significant portion of the average person’s expenses, said Jay Carney, Amazon’s senior vice president of Global Corporate Affairs. “We hope this will pave a path for more inclusive communities,” Carney said. WeGo, the primary regional transit agency operating bus and paratransit service across Nashville, serves close to 30,000 riders daily. Amazon will focus on affordable properties within a half-mile of transit stops and “prioritize opportunities to invest in minority-led organizations and racially and economically diverse communities,” the company reported.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The developer of a long-planned – and controversial – high-speed rail line that would get passengers from Dallas to Houston in 90 minutes announced Tuesday that it signed a $16 billion contract with an Italian company to build the project, in what could be a step toward realization. Webuild, based in Milan, will oversee heavy construction of the planned 236-mile project for developer Texas Central, the companies said in a news release. Webuild will operate through U.S. subsidiary Lane Construction Corporation, based in Cheshire, Connecticut. Nearly half the distance the bullet train will cover – at speeds up to 200 mph – will be elevated to reduce the impact on property owners, the companies said. Residents have fought the high-speed train, which has been discussed for decades and would rely on acquiring land through eminent domain to construct the rail line. Trey Duhon, who heads a group called Texans Against High-Speed Rail, criticized Tuesday’s announcement, saying it was just the developer continuing to try to drum up support for an unpopular project. “Texas Central takes every opportunity to generate what sounds like progress to keep interest and investments alive,” said Duhon, who also is the highest-ranking elected official in Waller County, outside Houston.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s ski resorts set a record for visitors this past winter despite coronavirus-related restrictions and a below-average snowfall, according to industry data released Tuesday. A news release from Ski Utah shows the 5.3 million skier days marked a major rebound from the previous winter, when the state registered 4.3 million after the season was cut short by the pandemic. The industry association said this winter’s figure also surpasses the previous record of 5.13 million skier days set during the 2018-19 ski season. Utah resorts were forced to implement COVID-19 safety protocols, including capacity limitations and mask mandates, but the industry association said those didn’t stop skiers and snowboarders from visiting. “Throughout the season it became clear that skiing provided a respite from the day to day realities of the pandemic and allowed an option for guests to safely socialize outside,” Nathan Rafferty, president of Ski Utah, said in a statement. Utah’s big year mirrors a banner season for ski resorts around the country. The National Ski Areas Association’s said the 59 million skier visits nationally are the fifth-most overall.\n\nVermont\n\nBrattleboro: A refugee resettlement nonprofit has plans to start a new program in the state to relocate refugees in smaller, more rural communities across the United States. The Ethiopian Development Community Council, a nonprofit agency that partners with the State Department to resettle refugees in the U.S., wants to launch its program in Brattleboro because of the city’s support. The first families should arrive in the city before the end of the year if the program is approved by the federal government, Vermont Public Radio reports. The nonprofit has also chosen Wausau to test out the program, pending federal approval. The nonprofit is preparing for an influx of refugees because the Biden administration has promised to increase the number of refugees allowed in the country and reopen the refugee resettlement program on which the Trump administration imposed restrictions, the radio station reports. “If we want to create integration of refugees, having them only in big cities where they would be congregating among themselves, only, is not going to help long-term integration,” said Tsehaye Tefera, founder of the Ethiopian Development Community Council. Brattleboro town manager Peter Elwell said he knows there could be opposition to the program, but the plan is in line with the town’s priority to improve equity in one of the nation’s whitest states.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Riders on the city’s transit system won’t have to dig into their pockets for another year. The board of directors of Greater Richmond Transit Company announced Tuesday that the system will remain fare-free through June 30, 2022. The system said in a news release that it has used state and federal COVID-19 relief funds since March 2020 in response to public health measures. GRTC also has sponsored the fare-free rides in the interest of economically distressed communities who rely on public transit to reach jobs, food and other resources. Free fares include rides on local buses, the Pulse, Express Bus, and CARE/Paratransit vans, the news release said. A spokesperson said workers who collected fares were offered other jobs within the company.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Scientists have found a dead Asian giant hornet in Marysville, north of Seattle – the first so-called murder hornet discovered in the country this year, federal and state investigators said Wednesday. Entomologists from the state and U.S. agriculture departments said it’s the first confirmed report from Snohomish County and appears to be unrelated to the 2019 and 2020 findings of the hornets in Canada and Whatcom County, along the Canadian border, that gained widespread attention. The 2-inch-long invasive insects, first found near the U.S.-Canada border in December 2019, are native to Asia and pose a threat to honeybees and native hornet species. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their stings are extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill. The world’s largest hornet is much more of a threat to honeybees that are relied on to pollinate crops. They attack hives, destroying them in mere hours and decapitating bees in what scientists call their “slaughter phase.” How they got here from Asia is unclear, although it is suspected they travel on cargo ships. “Hitchhikers are a side effect of all the commerce we do globally,” said Sven Spichiger, an entomologist with the state Agriculture Department who is leading the fight to eradicate the hornets.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice’s nomination of a Republican Party operative to a public broadcasting oversight board has prompted concern about the appointee’s credentials and whether the GOP governor will use his political muscle to fill multiple expired seats. Members of the state Senate Confirmations Committee received notice Friday of the pending appointment of Greg Thomas to the state Educational Broadcasting Authority, which is the governing body of West Virginia Public Broadcasting, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. Senate Minority Leader Stephen Baldwin, D-Greenbrier County, said Monday that Thomas’ background doesn’t make him a good fit for the authority. The pending appointment “stood out like a sore thumb,” Baldwin said. “You’ve got an outwardly partisan political operative being nominated to a position that doesn’t call for that at all.” Thomas has worked for several GOP politicians, including the campaign of convicted former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship’s failed U.S. Senate run in 2018. He also works for the nonprofit group West Virginia Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state is on track to scrap a requirement that has been a singular rite of passage for generations: the behind-the-wheel road test for teenagers. The Legislature’s Republican-controlled joint finance committee last week approved the state Department of Transportation’s proposal to continue its program of waiving road tests for 16- and 17-year-olds who have completed all driver’s education requirements. If approved as part of the budget by Gov. Tony Evers, the current pilot program would become a permanent part of how the Department of Motor Vehicles allocates licenses beginning July 1. DOT first began to pilot the waivers in mid-May of last year, citing its desire to reduce interactions between its employees and members of the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic. Department officials also said they hoped the waivers would allow DMV offices to focus on the backlog of adult driver’s tests that had accumulated amid the pandemic. Under state law, those over the age of 18 only require a passing multiple-choice knowledge test before taking the road test. The DMV has said these people cannot waive their road test because they are not required to complete a driver’s education course and behind-the-wheel training with an instructor.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Lawmakers are pursuing two possible hate crimes bills for next year’s legislative session. One bill to be drafted would require law enforcement to report hate crimes. The other would extend protections to more groups. “I want a starting point to move forward,” state Rep. Mike Yin, D-Jackson, told other members of the Joint Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. At least 47 states have adopted hate crimes legislation since the murder of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard in 1998, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. National groups such as the Brennan Center for Justice do not classify Wyoming as having a hate crime law, though the American Civil Liberties Union does. The statute makes it a misdemeanor to deny anyone “life, liberty, pursuit of happiness or the necessities of life” due to their “race, color, sex, creed or national origin.” The statute does not require police to report hate crimes and does not protect all vulnerable populations, according to testimony at Tuesday’s hearing. Wyoming has recorded 13 hate crimes since 2015, but the number is believed to be underreported.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/23/sea-dragons-human-compost-lego-dinosaurs-news-around-states/39507035/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nCullman: Country music star Hank Williams Jr. is offering a $6,000 reward for his grandfather’s missing shotgun. The singer known for hits including “Family Tradition” has posted a letter online saying he spent time growing up in south Alabama with his grandfather. The letter says he can’t locate the man’s old Remington Model 11-48 shotgun, which he wants to pass on. An attorney for Williams, Steve Smith, says the gun is believed to be lost, not stolen. The reward is being offered with no questions asked. Smith says the 16-gauge shotgun was likely last seen at a lake cabin or house near Cullman. He says the reward offer has generated a few tips. Williams sang about the man who owned the shotgun in his 1973 song “Grandpa Shepherd.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s fledgling commercial seaweed industry is growing, with producers excited about this year’s harvest. The Anchorage Daily News reports there were no commercial seaweed farmers in Alaska five years ago. An official with the Commercial Fisheries Division of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game says 16 aquatic farming operations now are permitted to culture species of seaweed. According to the World Aquaculture Society, seaweed worldwide is a $6 billion business. Most is harvested in Korea, Japan and China; dried; and used for seasoning. Blue Evolution, a California-based company, has worked with researchers at the University of Alaska Southeast on ways to commercially farm kelp rather than harvest wild kelp beds. The company sells seed stock to some Alaska kelp farmers and buys back mature kelp.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state has banned prisoners from reading a book that discusses the impact of the criminal justice system on black men. The American Civil Liberties Union is calling on the Arizona Department of Corrections to rescind a ban on “Chokehold: Policing Black Men.” The book by former federal prosecutor Paul Butler examines the treatment of African American men by law enforcement and in mass incarceration. Butler says his publisher was notified of the ban in March. But it didn’t specify what led to the decision. The Georgetown University criminal law professor says he explicitly disavows violence in the book. Corrections spokesman Andrew Wilder said the department hadn’t yet received the ACLU’s letter asking for the ban to be reversed. ACLU attorney Emerson Sykes says it’s not uncommon for states to ban certain books.\n\nArkansas\n\nBella Vista: A property owner’s association is warning residents about the unhealthy air near an underground fire that’s been burning for 10 months at a former unlicensed dump in northwest Arkansas. Crews began fighting the fire Saturday at the Trafalgar Road site in Bella Vista, about 170 miles northwest of Little Rock. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that Bella Vista Property Owners Association’s chief operating officer Tom Judson says the goal is to quench the fire within 30 days. The fire that’s burning at least 70 feet underground was first reported in July. Some residents say smoke from the fire has caused respiratory and other health problems. The Legislature passed a bill in March appropriating $20 million to help clean up the fire.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLa Jolla: A Southern California aquarium has built what is believed to be one of the world’s largest habitats for sea dragons, the lesser-known cousin of the seahorse. The Birch Aquarium at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego hopes the exhibit will lead to the leafy sea dragon being bred for the first time in captivity. The sea dragons’ native populations off Australia are threatened by pollution, warming oceans, and the illegal pet and alternative medicine trades. Few aquariums have sea dragons. There are only two types of sea dragons, the leafy and the weedy, and each represents its own genus. Both kinds are found only in a small area of temperate waters off the southern and western coasts of Australia. The California exhibit opened this month.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The City Council narrowly voted Tuesday against asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review its ban on women going topless in public, which lower courts have banned it from enforcing. The 4-3 vote still gives the city the option to seek the high court’s intervention if settlement agreements with Free the Nipple-Fort Collins break down. But the council majority hoped to drop the matter. “There’s some fatigue,” council member Kristin Stephens said. “We pursued this legal recourse, and it didn’t work out for us.” The city has been grappling with its ban on women knowingly exposing their breasts in public since 2015, when activist Brit Hoagland started protesting it. It led the council to update the public indecency ordinance, though it left in place the ban on women going topless in public, with certain exemptions. Hoagland and fellow activist Samantha Six sued the city in 2016.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Restaurants and caterers in the state would no longer be able to provide customers with single-use expanded polystyrene food containers under legislation that has cleared the House of Representatives. The proposed ban, which passed Tuesday on a 121-23 vote, would take effect July 1, 2021. It now awaits Senate action. Proponents say the legislation is needed to discourage the use of the containers and reduce litter, noting expanded polystyrene containers can take 200 years to break down in a landfill. Some noted that many restaurants, such as Dunkin’ Donuts, have already begun to swap out these products with greener options. The bill was narrowed to caterers and restaurants in permanent buildings following some concern it was too broad. There are exceptions for pre-packaged food, raw meat and seafood. Violators would face fines.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state has two of the best cities in the country for summer job opportunities, according to a new study from WalletHub. Dover ranked fourth and Wilmington ranked fifth on the list, which focused on 16- to 24-year-olds searching for part-time work or internship opportunities between school years. To create the ranking, WalletHub developed 21 criteria – ranging from availability of summer jobs and internships to its own lifestyle metrics – and divided them into two main categories, youth job market and social environment and affordability. Each criterion was given its own subjective weight and score on a scale of 0-100. The cumulative score after each criterion was weighted, determined the ranking. Dover and Wilmington rank near the top in both availability of internships and growth in summer employment.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Board of Elections has approved a petition to recall a city councilman who used his position to solicit business from area lobbyists. The Washington Post reports the board unanimously voted Monday to approve the recall effort of Ward 2 Councilman Jack Evans. Volunteers now have roughly three months to collect about 5,200 Ward 2 signatures to unseat Evans, who is under federal investigation over his relationships with private legal and consulting clients. Email records show he pitched himself to lobbyists, arguing they should employ him because of his influence as the city’s longest-serving lawmaker and area transit board chair. The council formally reprimanded Evans in March and voted to remove him from several oversight positions. The transit agency has launched an internal investigation.\n\nFlorida\n\nWesley Chapel: Authorities say a teen has been charged with threatening a school shooting in a postcard to Santa and signing a classmate’s name last fall. The Tampa Bay Times reports that the 15-year-old boy was arrested Monday and charged with making written threats to kill or do bodily harm. The Pasco County Sheriff’s Office says the holiday postcard was dropped off in November at a Wesley Chapel Macy’s. The note threatened at shooting at nearby Wiregrass Ranch High School. Detectives interviewed a female student whose name was signed to the postcard but ruled her out as a suspect. Authorities say fingerprints on the postcard led to the teen boy, who had a previous misdemeanor arrest.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A lawsuit challenging outdated voting machines and seeking statewide use of hand-marked paper ballots can move forward, a federal judge ruled Tuesday. The lawsuit argues that the paperless touchscreen voting machines Georgia has used since 2002 are unsecure, vulnerable to hacking and unable to be audited. The state’s voting system drew national scrutiny during last year’s midterm election in which Brian Kemp, a Republican who was the state’s chief election officer at the time, narrowly defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams to become Georgia’s governor. State lawyers had asked U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg to dismiss the lawsuit. Totenberg wrote in her order rejecting that request that the state’s arguments “completely ignore the reality faced by election officials across the country underscored by Plaintiffs’ allegations that electronic voting systems are under unceasing attack.”\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Honolulu County has closed a bay to prevent disruption of coral spawning that scientists predicted would occur over two days. West Hawaii Today reported Tuesday that county officials closed Kahaluu Bay to allow the spawning event that was expected Monday through Tuesday on the Big Island. Officials from the Kahaluu Bay Education Center’s ReefTeach program set up a tent at the bay entrance to inform visitors of the temporary closure. An official says the spawning is “critical” for the coral to reproduce and survive. A mass bleaching event in 2015 killed 95% of the cauliflower coral on West Hawaii reefs. Kahaluu Bay is the only park Honolulu County has closed to facilitate a spawning event. The area was also off limits for two half-days in 2018.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal administrative law judge has rejected a plan for public land grazing allotments in south-central Idaho that would have destroyed re-emerging sagebrush in favor of non-native plants to increase forage for cattle and sheep. The ruling last week directs the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to set aside its final grazing decisions for about 80 square miles of allotments in Twin Falls County. The administrative law judge in the Interior Department’s Office of Hearings and Appeals concluded that destroying sagebrush and rabbitbrush to increase livestock forage on public lands couldn’t be justified. Wildlands Defense and Prairie Falcon Audubon in 2017 appealed the Bureau of Land Management’s decision involving 18 permittees on 21 allotments that would have destroyed native plants.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Lincoln Park Zoo says an eastern black rhinoceros named Kapuki has given birth to a calf. The zoo says Kapuki was pregnant for 15 months before the calf was born Sunday night. Zoo staff members monitored her labor and are watching the rhino and her calf remotely using cameras to give them privacy but are nearby. The zoo hasn’t named the calf or announced its sex, but officials say details will be announced once available. The animals won’t be visible to the public until further notice, but people can follow along on the zoo’s Instagram, Twitter and Facebook and at #RhinoWatch on Twitter. Zoo officials say the calf stood up at just 53 minutes of age.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: A restored World War II naval vessel will move to a more prominent location along the Ohio River in the city in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of D-Day. The LST 325 troop landing ship will be docked at the former site of the Tropicana Evansville casino boat June 6-9. Free tours of the ship will be offered. The ship took part in the 1944 D-Day landings in France and was brought back to the U.S. from Greece in 2001 to be restored. City officials had hoped to have the ship permanently moved there by the D-Day anniversary, but a number of delays have postponed that from happening until the end of the year. The ship has been docked a few miles upriver since 2005.\n\nIowa\n\nYale: It was built in 1932 as the state’s first roundhouse of rebounds. Today, it’s one of Iowa’s most treasured historic buildings. The Yale High School Gymnasium, with its distinctive round architectural design, is now listed on the the National Register of Historic Places. In its heyday, it was home to the Yale Bulldogs boys and girls basketball teams and hosted band concerts, commencements, plays and banquets – even the Harlem Globetrotters – until 1961. The gymnasium’s historic significance is tied to its use for team sports (1932-1961) and its association with Halver R. Straight, who received a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois in 1907 and spent his career in the ceramics industry. An inventor as well as an engineer, he held 87 patents for tools and instruments used in clay manufacturing.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has signed into law a bill that would allow profoundly ill people who have been unable to find relief with pharmaceutical medications to avoid prosecution for possessing certain blends of oil extracted from cannabis plants. The cannabidiol oils, also known as CBD, shielded by the Kansas bill could contain no more than 5% THC, the compound that gives marijuana its high. Known as “Claire and Lola’s Law,” it was pushed by Gwen and Scott Hartley, whose 12-year-old daughter, Lola, suffers from microcephaly, a medical condition in which a child’s brain doesn’t fully develop. The condition has already claimed the life of Lola’s older sister, Claire, who died in December 2018 at the age of 17. The law goes into effect July 1.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: With temperatures climbing and a holiday weekend coming up, many swimming pools and beaches at state parks are opening. The Parks Department says while lodge pools are reserved for lodge and cottage guests, community pools at several parks are open to the public for a fee – Greenbo Lake, Carter Caves, Levi Jackson, Blue Licks Battlefield, Cumberland Falls, E.P. “Tom” Sawyer, Kincaid Lake, Natural Bridge and Fort Boonesborough. Also, the park system’s 10 beaches are free and open to the public – Pennyrile Forest, Lake Barkley, Kentucky Dam Village, Barren River Lake, Buckhorn Lake, Rough River Dam, Lake Malone, Nolin Lake, Carr Creek and Green River Lake. Pool openings at Barren River Lake, E.P. “Tom” Sawyer, Levi Jackson and Lake Barkley will be delayed.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state is on track to create a new program that would certify veteran-owned businesses and create a database for consumers to search for them. The House-backed bill easily sped through the Senate commerce committee Wednesday, with Gov. John Bel Edwards, a former Army Ranger, testifying in support of the legislation. The governor says census data indicates Louisiana has 42,000 veteran-owned businesses. The proposal creates the Veterans First Business Initiative in the state’s economic development agency. The department will certify veteran-owned businesses, create an insignia for them to use and display a searchable database on its website for customers who want to find veteran vendors. The measure by Baton Rouge Republican Rep. Franklin Foil moves to the full Senate for debate, one step from final passage.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A legislative committee has voted against a bill to tax water bottler Poland Spring. The Portland Press Herald reports the House and Senate will now consider the legislation. The Legislature’s Taxation Committee voted Tuesday to reject a Democrat’s bill that would have charged Poland Spring 12 cents for every gallon of water extracted for bottling. The legislation is part of years-old unsuccessful efforts to tax the hundreds of millions of gallons that Poland Spring bottles in Maine. The bill targets Poland Spring, which would have paid roughly $115 million under the proposal based on the 960 million gallons extracted last year. Revenues from the tax would fund college tuition grants and Maine’s broadband internet network. Opponents include several Democrats and Republicans who say Poland Spring employs over 800 people in Maine.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Scientists say the health of America’s largest estuary declined last year due to the effects of record-breaking precipitation. Researchers at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science gave the Chesapeake Bay an overall grade of 46% for 2018, down from 54% in 2017. All of the indicators factored into the bay’s health index declined or stayed flat last year. Its letter grade of “C” is unchanged. Last year’s heavy downpours increased runoff sediments, and more pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorous washed into the water. The Baltimore area was deluged with 72 inches of rain, roughly 175% above normal rates. Still, the annual report card released Tuesday stresses that overall trends show the Chesapeake improving significantly over years. Scientists say the bay’s long-term health trajectory remains positive.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A local nonprofit is voicing concern about the continued spread of HIV among residents struggling with opioid addiction. The Whittier Street Health Center said Tuesday that its outreach team identified two new cases of HIV in the notorious illegal drug market around Boston Medical Center in the city’s South End. Dr. Cyril Ubiem, director of infectious disease at the center, says he’s concerned the spread of HIV among Boston’s homeless and addicted population is getting worse, rather than better. The state Department of Public Health says it’s reviewing the center’s reported cases. In January, the agency urged Boston health providers to boost efforts to test patients for HIV after six people were newly diagnosed with the virus, which can lead to AIDS. Massachusetts reported 105 new HIV cases in 2017, up from 30 in 2014.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A new exhibit at the Detroit Historical Museum takes visitors through 150 years of life in the city’s Corktown neighborhood. Called “The Journey to Now,” the exhibit opened this month and is scheduled to run through July 7. The exhibit is hosted by the nonprofit organization Corktown Experience in conjunction with Wayne State University’s Anthropology Museum. It tells the story of the people who lived in the Workers’ Row House in Corktown and of the workers who helped build Detroit into an industrial and automotive powerhouse. This exhibit kicks off an effort by Corktown Experience to turn the Workers’ Row House and the surrounding property into a community hub and cultural center.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A major package of protections for the state’s elderly has cleared the Legislature and awaits Gov. Tim Walz’s signature. The House and Senate passed the final version of the bill late Sunday night. The most important component is a framework for licensing assisted living facilities that contains expanded enforcement powers. Minnesota is the last remaining state that doesn’t require licensing them. The bill also has other safeguards to protect older and vulnerable adults, including the right for assisted-living residents and their families to install hidden monitoring cameras for two weeks before being required to notify the facilities, a provision dubbed “granny cams.” It also includes a bill of rights for assisted-living residents and other stronger consumer protections, such as protections against retaliation for residents of care facilities.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: About 1 in 4 third graders in the state failed a toughened reading test on the first try this spring, leaving it unclear if they will advance to fourth grade. The Mississippi Department of Education released results Wednesday. Mississippi is one of 16 states that demand third grade students pass a reading score threshold or flunk. Mississippi raised its threshold this year, mandating students reach the middle of five scoring levels. Students had a second chance last week, although those results aren’t yet available. Students get a third chance later this summer. Officials predicted passing rates would drop from last year’s 93.8%, when students had to reach the second level. The Chickasaw County school district has the top share of passing third graders at 94%. Yazoo City was lowest at 32%.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Washington University will host a summit next year aimed at addressing growing concerns about climate change. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was in St. Louis last week to announce creation of the Midwest Collegiate Climate Summit. It will include representatives from universities, local governments, businesses and nonprofits. The summit will focus on several issues, including promoting solar energy and reducing harmful emissions. Bloomberg’s charitable organization, Bloomberg Philanthropies, donated $2.5 million to St. Louis in October to help fund a carbon pollution-tracking program. The city has set a goal of generating 100% of its electricity from wind, solar and other renewable resources by 2035.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Montana Attorney General Tim Fox has announced his timeline for implementing legislation meant to improve communication and collaboration among the law enforcement agencies as they investigate missing persons cases. Fox said Tuesday that the state Department of Justice has posted the job description for a missing persons specialist. That person will coordinate with local, state, federal and tribal law enforcement agencies to improve reporting and searching for missing people. He hopes to have that person on board by July 1. Fox has also asked the state’s eight tribes for nominations for a new Missing Indigenous Persons Task Force, which is set to meet June 11. The group will be tasked with identifying and overcoming communication barriers to reporting and investigating cases of missing Native Americans.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials say they’re expanding a pilot program that stationed a mental health therapist in a city police precinct. The Omaha World-Herald reports that officials plan to place a therapist in each precinct within the next few years. The primary goal is to decrease the instances of officers taking into custody people struggling with mental health issues. Officials also hope to connect people to the services they require and reduce the number of times officers must respond to people and their mental health crises. The therapists, also known as co-responders, will head to incidents that may involve people suffering from mental illnesses. Once officers deem the situations safe, the co-responders can talk to the people and determine what help they need.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Nevada is now on the cusp of joining the nationwide push to elect the president purely by popular vote. The state Senate on Tuesday passed Assembly Bill 186, which would see the Silver State join a compact with 15 others that have agreed to award their presidential votes to the winner of the national popular vote. The divisive bill now heads to Gov. Steve Sisolak, who did not immediately return requests for comment on the measure. If adopted by enough states, the national popular vote compact would effectively neuter the electoral college, a constitutional creation that awards states one presidential vote for each of its congressional delegates. The roughly 200-year-old system has the effect of giving smaller states greater power to pick the president.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Edward Hopper’s final painting is on view at the Currier Museum of Art. “Two Comedians,” showing the artist and his wife taking a bow onstage, once belonged to singer Frank Sinatra. Hopper painted the work in 1966 at age 83, when he and his wife were seriously ill. He died the following year. Museum curator Kurt Sundstrom said it is a somber reflection of two people alone on a dark stage. “They have a presence, but it’s a presence of people who will soon disappear,” he said. “Two Comedians” will be on display at the Currier Museum until January 2020. It is accompanied by other works by Hopper and his contemporaries, on the theme of theater and life in the American city.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPoint Pleasant Beach: A mild winter and previously completed replenishment projects have left the state’s beloved beaches in great shape for the start of the summer tourism season. Coastal experts say most beaches are nice and wide as a result of years of replenishment by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that kicked into high gear after Superstorm Sandy devastated the coast in 2012. Places like Point Pleasant Beach and Ortley Beach have wider beaches than they’ve had in years. The replenishment projects pump sand ashore to widen beaches to provide space for recreation and help protect property. Jon Miller, a coastal expert with Stevens Institute of Technology, says even in spots where beaches have eroded somewhat, the sand that forms sand bars offshore helps blunt the force of incoming waves.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The New Mexico Military Museum has temporarily closed its indoor space to prepare for new exhibits commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War and women serving in World War I. The museum plans to reopen in July. Until then, the outdoor World War I exhibit, the vehicle and equipment park, and meditation gardens will remain open to the public. Officials say the closure also will allow for renovations. The New Mexico National Guard and the museum recently procured a traveling replica of the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, D.C. It will be part of the new exhibit along with hundreds of photos from veterans’ private collections. The materials for the exhibit honoring women who served during World War I come from the American Medical Women’s Association.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state’s Department of Environmental Conservation is launching its annual birdwatching challenge, with versions for beginners and experts alike. The “I Bird NY” beginner’s challenge is open to anyone 16 years old or younger. Participants must identify 10 common bird species listed on the challenge form available online. In the experienced birder challenge, participants must identify at least 10 of 50 species and enter sighting information on the challenge form. All will get a certificate, a bracelet and a chance to win birding accessories. The challenge is open through Sept. 16. Details are posted on DEC’s website.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A repeat effort to regulate popular fantasy sports games in North Carolina has advanced through a House panel two years after a similar effort failed. The House Commerce Committee voted Wednesday for the measure, which would require companies that operate fantasy sports to register with the state and abide by some rules. A 2017 bill failed to get enough support after social conservatives complained it would further legitimize gambling in the state. This year’s measure also contains the creation of a new state Gaming Commission that would consolidate oversight of the lottery, bingo and boxing in addition to the fantasy games. The fantasy sports industry has been seeking the state’s regulation, saying it would improve consumer protections. The bill must clear three more committees before reaching the House floor.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Police Department has launched a new program that aims to better connect officers with the community. The Bismarck Tribune reports that the department announced the Bismarck Community Oriented Policing Program on Monday. The program will divide the city into six community policing districts where officers will improve services and organize local meetings and events. It’ll also revive the Neighborhood Crime Watch and Business Watch programs to help neighbors look out for one another and bring attention to suspicious activity. Officers will conduct outreach through neighborhood canvassing, presentations, and home and business security surveys. Sgt. John Brocker says the program “is about reconnecting with the public” and “finding out what you have to say.” He says he felt there was a need for the department to be more transparent.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: A strike in its third week at a hospital is putting a spotlight on concerns about forcing nurses to repeatedly work mandatory overtime. The strike also comes at a time when state lawmakers are debating legislation that would allow nurses to refuse mandatory overtime. About 2,200 workers, including nurses, paramedics and custodians, have been on strike since May 6 at Mercy Health St. Vincent Medical Center in Toledo. Many nurses there say staffing shortages are forcing them to routinely work extra hours and be on-call day after day. Hospital officials have said the way they handle staffing is reasonable and common within the health care industry. They also say it ensures proper patient care. Nurses say forcing them to work long hours isn’t safe for them or their patients.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Legislature has approved a budget that for the first time includes millions of dollars in funding for anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers. The Senate on Tuesday approved the $8.1 billion general appropriations bill for the fiscal year beginning July 1. The budget proposal now heads to Gov. Kevin Stitt, who is expected to sign it. The Oklahoman reports the $2 million for crisis pregnancy centers would be the state’s first anti-abortion funding since lawmakers passed the 2017 Choosing Childbirth Act. Proponent Rep. Jon Echols says the centers help pregnant women purchase maternity clothes, prenatal care and more. Critics say the money being apportioned to dissuade women from abortions could be used for other health care initiatives.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Environmental advocates have criticized a state plan to kill more than 1,000 ravens to help save the greater sage grouse. The Oregonian/OregonLive reported Tuesday that the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife applied for permits in 2018 to kill up to 500 ravens per year over a three-year period to reduce the number preying upon greater sage grouse eggs. Environmentalists say the strategy of putting poisoned chicken eggs in bait boxes in northeastern Oregon is flawed. A director at the Portland Audubon Society says the plan is part of an “unfortunate pattern” of agencies scapegoating a species without addressing primary causes of decline. The plan is opposed by numerous environmental groups including Oregon Wild, The Humane Society and the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nJim Thorpe: Officials say one of the state’s most beloved and scenic hiking trails will remain closed to the public unless lawmakers pass Gov. Tom Wolf’s $4.5 billion infrastructure plan. The Democratic governor hiked to the base of the Glen Onoko Falls Trail on Tuesday to make the case for his plan to impose a severance tax on Marcellus Shale natural gas production to finance billions of dollars in projects. Wolf has called for a severance tax every year he’s been in office, but the GOP-controlled Legislature has so far rejected the idea. The Pennsylvania Game Commission closed the trail May 1, saying it had become too dangerous. The closure outraged hikers and nature lovers. State officials say they aren’t able to reopen it without an infusion of cash.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: An effort is underway to replace the state’s distinctive “wave” license plates and more than double the cost of the new ones. The state Senate on Tuesday approved a measure by a 27-8 margin to start replacing them later this year. The bill would change the price of a license plate from $6, set 20 years ago, to $15. Sen. Louis DiPalma, one of the bill’s supporters, says some plates still on the road are so old and worn that they are difficult to read. The Middletown Democrat also estimates about 25,000 vehicles are using invalid plates, probably because they are unregistered, uninsured or uninspected. Some senators opposed the price hike, saying many people could not afford it, especially if they have multiple vehicles. There is no new design yet.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Legislators are giving the Carolina Panthers up to $120 million in tax breaks to move their practice fields and team headquarters into the state from North Carolina. The Senate voted 23-16 on Monday to approve a compromise smoothing over small differences in the bill. A few hours later, the House passed the bill 88-18. Gov. Henry McMaster was expected to quickly sign it into law. The bill exempts the Panthers from paying state income taxes for players, coaches and other employees for 15 years as long as they use the money to build their new complex near Rock Hill. Opponents say the state shouldn’t help a billionaire NFL owner. The team would continue to play games in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The family of an angler whose catfish held a state record for nearly 70 years is upset that state wildlife officials voided the record. Roy Groves caught the 55-pound fish in 1949. The fish originally was identified as a channel catfish, but South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks voided the record Friday, saying Groves actually caught a blue catfish, not a channel catfish. Groves’ great-grandson, James Labesky, says he had never heard about the record being disputed. Labesky says in a Facebook post that South Dakota wildlife officials are taking away the record because they don’t think it’s a channel catfish by looking at a picture. He says in the post that his great-grandfather “would know the difference.” State Fisheries Program Administrator Geno Adams says fish identification experts agreed the photo was of a blue catfish.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Researchers at the Memphis Zoo have been studying the smooth-sided toad’s reproduction abilities and have found techniques that could aid in the breeding and conservation of endangered toads around the world. Research conducted by the zoo’s conservation department showed that the quality of toad sperm could be increased with hormones, that the sperm could be successfully harvested, and that it could be frozen and thawed and remain viable. The study, recently published in the journal Cryobiology, has real-world applications that will be put into action this fall when the research team travels to Colombia and Ecuador to help amphibian researchers there in their work to preserve the rare and “very charismatic” Colombian giant toad, says Steve Reichling, zoo director of conservation and research.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport plans to build a sixth terminal that would open by 2025 and provide up to 24 new gates for U.S. and international flights. DFW airport CEO Sean Donohue announced plans for Terminal F on Monday. The airport currently has 164 gates spread across five terminals. DFW has been growing, inching closer to busier airports such as Atlanta. Donohue says DFW has more than doubled its passenger-carrying capacity to international destinations since 2010. DFW is American Airlines’ largest hub airport. The airline announced early this month that it opened 15 new gates at DFW. American said the gates that opened May 3 in Terminal E will let it add more than 100 daily flights on its American Eagle affiliate.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah Jazz owner and philanthropist Gail Miller says she never expected to be in the company of celebrities such as singer Mariah Carey and actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. But Miller will join their ranks in June when she receives the same congressional award honoring her work with young people. She says being named for the Horizon Award was an incredible recognition of her giving nature and strong community relationships. The award recognizes humanitarian leaders in the private sector, from the Congressional Award National Board of Directors. Miller has owned the family’s car dealerships, movie theaters and the National Basketball Association’s Utah Jazz franchise since the 2009 death of her husband Larry H. Miller. Forbes magazine estimates her net worth to be $1.5 billion.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state’s Episcopal church has for the first time chosen an African American woman as its bishop. The Rev. Shannon MacVean-Brown was elected Saturday by representatives of Vermont’s 45 Episcopal congregations. MacVean-Brown will become the first black woman to hold the post in Vermont. She replaces Bishop Thomas Ely, who will be retiring after 18 years as Vermont’s Episcopal bishop. MacVean-Brown currently serves as the interim rector of St. Thomas Episcopal Church, of Franklin, Indiana. She is planning to move to Vermont with her family in August. Current plans call for her ordination as Vermont bishop on Sept. 28.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: A Virginia man who founded the defunct airline People Express has been indicted on fraud and tax evasion charges. The Daily Press reports Michael D. Morisi was arrested Tuesday. He’s accused of defrauding creditors of nearly $448,000, using most of the money to pay himself and other airline executives months after the airline folded. An indictment says the former executive director of Newport News-Williamsburg International Airport, Ken Spirito, arranged for public funds to guarantee that airline a $5 million credit line in July 2014. The airline folded that September and stopped paying the $4.5 million it owed TowneBank under the credit line. The airport was left to foot the bill, which it then paid with those public funds. Spirito was arrested Monday and charged with violating federal finance laws.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Gov. Jay Inslee signed legislation Tuesday making the state the first to approve composting as an alternative to burying or cremating human remains. It allows licensed facilities to offer “natural organic reduction,” which turns a body, mixed with substances such as wood chips and straw, into about two wheelbarrows’ worth of soil in a span of several weeks. Loved ones are allowed to keep the soil to spread, just as they might spread the ashes of someone who has been cremated – or even use it to plant vegetables or a tree. Supporters say the method is an environmentally friendly alternative to cremation, which releases carbon dioxide and particulates into the air, and conventional burial, in which people are drained of their blood, pumped full of formaldehyde and other chemicals that can pollute groundwater, and placed in a nearly indestructible coffin, taking up land.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: A bridge will now bear the name of longtime state lawmaker Frank Deem, who died in October at the age of 90. According to The Parkersburg News and Sentinel, about 100 people gathered Friday to see the dedication of the Juliana Street Bridge as the Senator J. Frank Deem Memorial Bridge. Deem served in the Navy before his election to the House in 1954. The retired businessman and oil and gas developer served on and off in the House and Senate over six decades, spending a total of 48 years as a lawmaker.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Lego dinosaurs are headed to the local zoo. This summer, the United Kingdom-based Brick Dinos exhibit is traveling to the United States for the first time and heading straight to the Milwaukee County Zoo. Guy Bagley, senior creative for Warren Elsmore Exhibitions, has made a career out of “playing with Legos” for the past 23 years. He traveled from Scotland to set up the exhibit in the special exhibits building at the zoo. That included shipping four life-size sculptures as well as 26 smaller scenes, then repairing any damage incurred during their voyage across the pond. While the exhibit is fun, it’s also educational. Bagley says his boss, Warren Elsmore, worked with a paleontologist to ensure the accuracy of everything from the color of the dinosaurs to the plants in their habitats.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state recorded the lowest number of births in 15 years in 2018. Wyoming’s population has been falling since the state’s energy industry went bust in 2015. That year, about 7,700 babies were born in Wyoming. The Wyoming Department of Health says last year’s tally was 6,551. Meanwhile, deaths of Wyoming residents are increasing as the state’s population ages. The Casper Star-Tribune reports Emma was the most popular name for baby girls in Wyoming last year, followed by Amelia, Elizabeth, Evelyn and Harper. Oliver topped the list for boys, followed by Jackson and Logan (which were tied), Wyatt and Theodore.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/23"}]}

Tickets are $44-$150. \"Those are some of my favorite records you just just mentioned. To mention our record in the same breath as those is pretty mind blowing.\"\n\nIt wasn't until the fall of 2008 that Rucker made the leap from pop to country, although the line between the two seems to be incontrovertibly blurred at this point.\n\nBefore he transformed into a surprise country star with four No. 1 albums in a row, Rucker performed at the Delaware State Fair within a year of his country debut, returning to the state again to play the Freeman Stage at Bayside near Selbyville in 2012.\n\nNow, Rucker is a household name in the country music world. And he's currently preparing his fifth studio country album with a pair of singles already on the radio ahead of its release later this year.\n\nWe spoke with the South Carolina native ahead of his Harrington return to get a sneak peek at his new album, reminisce about Hootie's success and help preview the fair, which kicks off tonight and runs through July 29.\n\nQ: After this show, you will have played Delaware three times over the past eight years. We're a small state. You must tour your tail off.\n\nA: Yeah, I've been playing shows. We're just trying to play places that we don't get to very often. It's going to be fun.\n\nQ: Is there a different vibe when you play places like Delaware -- places that are kind of off the beaten path, places that may not see acts of your caliber all the time?\n\nA: There's a lot of excitement, which I love. People are glad to be there and they're glad you're there. They are there to have a good time -- it always creates a great show.\n\nQ: It's all those shows that have probably helped you reel off four No. 1 country albums in a row. I was curious about how many doubters you had back when you made the leap.\n\nA: [Laughs.] I had a lot. I definitely had more doubters than champions. And that was OK. It just made me work harder. My label [Capitol Nashville] was so behind me. They were going to be with me. We had a bunch of naysayers, but I've let that go. It's been a fun ride. Like you said, four No. 1 albums. All the hard work was worth it.\n\nQ: Have you had the chance to rub your country success in the face of any of those naysayers or have you stayed humble?\n\nA: No, I'm not that kind of guy. No. [Laughs.] There are a lot of people I know who didn't mind telling me that it wasn't going to work, but, no, I'm not that kind of a guy. I'm just happy to be still making music that people are listening to.\n\nQ: Have you come up with a name or date for your new album?\n\nA: They are getting on me to name it, but I haven't named it yet. It could be out in the fall. We should have something soon.\n\nQ: There are two songs out now -- \"If I Told You\" and \"For the First Time\" -- so we've had a taste. What should fans expect from the rest of it?\n\nA: It'll be a little different than my other records just because I have a new producer, Ross Copperman (Keith Urban, Jake Owen, Dierks Bentley). It's a fun record -- a record that represents me where I am in my career right now, where I am in my life. You can expect great music. It has songs I hope people love because they are songs I love.\n\nQ: You've been playing shows with Hootie and the Blowfish here and there in recent years.\n\nA: Yeah, we still play. We have two shows coming up in August and we play three or four charity gigs every year. We just don't go and tour anymore.\n\nQ: What's it like when you drop in for a night with them at a charity gig? It must be like parachuting into your past.\n\nA: It does have a little different vibe just because we are such a band through and through. But it's just like riding a bike. We've been a band for like 31 years now. We all fall back into that same spot.\n\nQ: It's the summer of 1994 and \"Cracked Rear View\" is about to come out just as grunge is king in the rock world with Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots all having No. 1 albums in the months before your release. What were your expectations when it came out 23 years ago?\n\nA: I don't really know what our expectations were. We wanted to get a record out and play. We had been playing clubs on the East Coast [Hootie and the Blowfish played to a handful of fans The Stone Balloon in Newark prior to the release of \"Cracked Rear View\"] and were making a pretty good living doing that. We just made the record and started touring again. The next thing you know, \"Letterman\" happens and everything blows up. We expected success, but we weren't expecting it to do what it did.\n\nQ: You are unique in having pop success in the '90s several years before Napster helped upend the industry and then finding more success years later in country. What are some of the biggest industry changes you've seen from the inside over these past 20 years or so?\n\nA: When we were playing in the '90s, the only reason you toured was as an advertisement for the record. You went on tour so people would go out and buy your record. Now, the only reason you make a record is to tour. It's really changed that much. Touring is the way you make a living in this business these days, but I like being on the road, so it's OK.\n\nQ: Finally, I was curious if there was any industry or life advice that 51-year-old Darius Rucker would give a 28-year-old you as \"Cracked Rear View\" was taking off?\n\nA: [Laughs.] I would tell myself to wake up, pay attention and enjoy it. Being in the middle of the party, I never really looked at the success. It was about how much fun are we going to have tonight. Just stop and take a second to smell the roses every day.\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

And we've got them covered from top to bottom.\n\nIn addition to the many fall favorites we've already written about this year, here are 10 more fun events and festivals that should be on your radar come autumn.\n\nAmish Country Bike Tour, Dover\n\nRewarding yourself with pie during a cycling session is a long-time tradition in the First State.

The event turns 22 this fall and it'll take over the downtown area (from Walnut Street to Bicentennial Park) with a beer garden, patriotic pet parade, paddleboats, live music, over 100 vendors, fireworks and more fun.\n\nThe festival is near (205 NE Front St., Milford) at 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., Saturday, Sept. 16.

To register, visit whitehallde.com/events/vet-fest.\n\nApple Scrapple, Bridgeville\n\nDid you know throwing scrapple as far as you can is a sport in SoDel? It's a crazy contest that'll feature politicians as contestants at the 31st annual Apple Scrapple Festival in Bridgeville.\n\nThis celebration of apples and scrapple attracts about 20,000 guests yearly, according to the festival's website.\n\nThe two-day event includes the Little Miss Apple Scrapple Pageant, food and artisan vendors, live music and more. The day before the festival is the Rappa Scrapple Recipe Contest, and the Apple Baking Contest.\n\nThe festival is held multiple places in Bridgeville (including Union Street) starting at 4 p.m. Friday, Oct. 13; and at 9 a.m. Saturday, Oct. 14.

Visit leweschamber.com or (302) 645-8073.\n\nDelaware Renaissance Faire, Townsend\n\nSword fighting, belly dancing and lots of mead (plus more excitement) will be on tap at the Delaware Renaissance Faire, which is three-times longer this year.\n\nLast year's inaugural festival attracted about 3,000 guests in a sellout, and now organizers said they anticipate up to 12,000 people.

And sometimes nothing but a cheesesteak will do.\n\nAfter the Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl, we wanted to watch the televised parade at a neighborhood bar accompanied by a cold beer and the City of Brotherly Love's favorite sandwich.\n\nOne of the best in Delaware can be found at Kid Shelleen's. The food at Kid Shelleen's greatly improved when Harry's Savoy Grill owner Xavier Teixido took over operations in 2010.\n\nThe \"jumbo cheesesteak\" ($15.95) is a whopper of a sandwich. You could easily split it — well, unless, you have a Jason Kelce-size appetite. It's loaded with lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, fried onions and, of course, Cheez Whiz, or you can build your own.\n\nShellfish cobb at Columbus Inn\n\n2216 Pennsylvania Ave, Wilmington\n\nSalads can be boring. Really boring.\n\nThis one is not, especially if you're a shellfish lover.\n\nThe shellfish cobb ($26) is a healthy and filling meal. A bed of mixed greens is tossed with a light, but zippy horseradish-spiked thousand Island dressing.\n\nFanned out on top are pieces of cold shrimp, a half of lobster, including tail and claw meat, as well as lumps of crab. The rest of the salad, in true Cobb fashion, has egg, bacon, avocado, cucumber, tomato, radish, red onions and green beans. Enjoy.\n\nBanana pudding at Limestone BBQ and Bourbon\n\n2062 Limestone Road, Limestone Shopping Center, Milltown\n\nLimestone BBQ and Bourbon, which opened this past summer, is a new concept for High 5 Hospitality, the restaurant group that runs the state's Buffalo Wild Wings franchises and the Stone Balloon Ale House in Newark.\n\nCulinary director Robbie Jester has recreated a slightly altered version of his grandmother's famed banana pudding that he calls \"Grahammie's\" banana pudding ($5).\n\nJester makes it with love, and he does his \"grammy\" proud.\n\nImpossible burger at Grain Craft Bar & Kitchen\n\nLocations in Bear, Newark, and Kennett Square, Pennsylvania\n\nThere's no way a vegan burger can look, smell and taste like meat, right? Impossible, don't you think?\n\nWell, think again. Last January, Grain Craft Bar & Kitchen restaurants in Newark, Bear, and Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, added the \"Impossible Burger\" to their menus and we gave it a try.\n\nImpossible Burgers are not gluten- or soy-free. They're made with wheat and potato proteins and coconut oil, which is the fat in the burger.\n\nThe meat-like texture, aroma and flavor comes from heme, a molecule found in plants and red meat that makes blood red and gives beef its distinctive taste.\n\nThe patty has a similar mouth-feel to beef. We found the flavor pleasingly meaty with no initial off-putting after-taste, though it probably won't fool devoted carnivores. (If you want a beef burger, get a beef burger.)\n\nCurry chicken at Mayne Dish\n\n2202 Kirkwood Highway, Elsmere\n\nI needed sunshine on a dreary May day, so I checked out Mayne Dish, a Jamaican-American restaurant in Elsmere.\n\nYou order at the counter. There are tables downstairs and upstairs. But I took my curry chicken and D&G Jamaican Ginger Beer to go. While waiting for my $8 lunch and $2 drink, I was serenaded by Bob Marley tunes.\n\nA small order of chicken curry included a huge helping of chicken, potatoes and carrots with rice and beans and cabbage. I hit the wall after a few bites and still had more than half of it left.\n\nA few minor quibbles: You really had to watch out for the bones, especially a few small pieces of bone. Maybe they chopped the chicken pieces with a cleaver that might need to be sharpened? The flavor was very good. Next time, I'll check out the jerk chicken.\n\nDinner at Heirloom\n\n212 Savannah Road, Lewes\n\nOwner Meghan Lee's endearing 3-year-old Lewes restaurant in a renovated Victorian home doesn't just rank as one of the best restaurants in Sussex County, it's easily one of the best in the state. She and executive chef Matthew Kern collaborate to create the exciting and ambitious menus that change with the seasons.\n\nThis past spring, we loved the house-stretched burrata with its soft, creamy white cheese, swirls of green from torn basil and dots of red from Calabrian chili.\n\nPlump spring peas popped when you bit into them and crumbles of sourdough breadcrumbs and sprinkles of sea salt added toasty crispness.\n\nBut, really, I don't think you can go wrong with any dish here. Looking forward to more in 2019.\n\nBraised short rib pizza at Crust & Craft\n\nMidway Galleria, 18701 Coastal Highway (Del. 1), Rehoboth Beach\n\nWhen Crust & Craft chef/owner Brenton Wallace posted a photo of the short rib beef pizza ($18) made with caramelized onions, chanterelle mushrooms and creamy Robiola cheese on Instagram this summer, I made a beeline for his Rehoboth Beach gourmet pizzeria.\n\nThe eatery specializes in 12-inch Neapolitan-style pizzas baked in a red-tiled Marana Forni wood-fired oven that can reach 900 degrees. Definitely worth a visit.\n\nNew York strip and wedge salad at Houston-White Co.\n\n315 Rehoboth Ave., Rehoboth Beach\n\nThe new restaurant across from Dogfish Head Brewings & Eats, is aimed directly at beef eaters. This destination for steak lovers is owned by Megan Kee who also runs La Fable, a lovely, traditional French bistro on Baltimore Avenue.\n\nThe $45 New York strip (14-ounces) came beautifully seared just a notch above medium-rare, as requested, and was simply a beautiful, juicy, beefy, tender yet still slightly chewy, cut.\n\nThe wedge salad ($12) on a chilled plate with drizzles of blue cheese dressing, a generous amount of Stilton blue cheese, cherry tomatoes, a confetti of red onion and hearty chunks of bacon can be shared.\n\nCrab cakes at Courtyard by Marriott– Newark\n\nUniversity of Delaware, 400 David Hollowell Drive, Newark\n\nBack in June, we began a hunt for the best places in Delaware to get a crab cake. We saved the best for last because the crab cakes made by Chef Mark Chopko easily deserve the numerous awards they have received.\n\nThe $26 crab cake dinner (two cakes and two sides) is available at the hotel's bistro at the hotel off Del. 896. The bistro serves breakfast and dinner, no lunch. These gluten-free cakes, bigger than your palm, are made with all lump crab meat and a secret all natural binding ingredient.\n\nMy second favorite spot for crab cakes in Delaware is Woody's Dewey Beach Bar & Grill. The crab cakes served at Racing Legends restaurant at Delaware Park in Stanton are a close third.\n\nPappardelle with lamb bolognese at Bardea\n\nCorner of Seventh and North Market streets, Wilmington\n\nScott Stein and Antimo DiMeo's Bardea (pronounce it bar-DAY-ah) restaurant has been one of the buzziest, busiest new eateries to hit downtown Wilmington in some time. The 5,000 square-foot space, formerly Kennedy Fried Chicken, has been completely refurbished and tables fill up fast.\n\nDiMeo's housemade pappardelle with lamb bolognese ($17), featuring a plop of soft mint goat cheese, has become a favorite.\n\nYou don't get a whopping, supersize plate and you probably won't be taking home leftovers, but it is closer to the size of what you would find in restaurants in Italy.\n\nPork tacos at MezCali Taqueria\n\n1205 Coastal Highway (Del. 1), Dewey Beach\n\nMezCali, a California-inspired taquería and mezcal bar serving tacos, small plates, entrees and cocktails in a casual setting, took over the former Dewey Beach Club.\n\nThe tacos, wrapped with fresh, made-in-house corn tortillas, are so delectable, don't be surprised if you start planning what to order next while still working on your first plate.\n\nThe pork carnitas might be my favorite, though the sweet potato tacos (two for $8), made with twice-fried 'taters, jicama slaw, pico de gallo and Sriracha aioli, are a very close second.\n\nThe moist, slow-roasted pork in the tacos al pastor (two for $8), pairs perfectly with chunks of pineapple and onions and a confetti of cilantro. Other choices include baja fish, coconut shrimp and carne asada.\n\nPoke bowls at Poke Bros.\n\nMill Creek Shopping Center at Kirkwood Highway and Limestone Road\n\nI jumped started my healthy eating for 2018 with trips to Poke Bros., and haven't stopped all year. The fast-casual chain specializes in Hawaiian-style raw fish rice bowls. Three franchises have opened in Delaware.\n\nPoke, pronounced POH-KAY, originated in Hawaii and features cubed-cut raw fish mixed in a bowl with rice, vegetables and other toppings. It's sometimes called “sushi in a bowl.”\n\nMeals can be customized with various sauces and garnishes. Most bowls will cost under $13.\n\nI'm also a fan of the PoBu sushi burrito at PoBu Restaurant at 215 E. Main St. in Newark.\n\nTo make the burrito, the staff top a sheet of nori with sushi rice and then layer in ahi tuna, Scottish salmon, avocado and edamame.\n\nFor a bit of crunch, they add tempura. The roll gets some gentle heat from squeezes of wasabi basil and sriracha aioli.\n\nTropical acai bowl at Playa Bowls\n\n134 E. Main St., Newark\n\nIt might not be easy to pronounce, but acai was a hot food trend in Delaware in 2018.\n\nAçaí (ah-sah-EE) a tropical, South American purple berry found in rainforests, is often touted as a superfruit.\n\nAt Playa Bowls, I got hooked on the Tropical Bowl ($9), pure açaí topped with granola, bananas, pineapple, coconut flakes and honey.\n\nAnother favorite is Nutella ($11) which includes açaí , banana, strawberry, coconut flakes and Nutella drizzle.\n\nCoffee at Little Goat Coffee Roasting Co.\n\n16 Haines St., Newark\n\nInside an adorable Sears Roebuck kit house, dating back to the early 1940s, that once was the original home of the Newark Natural Foods Co-op and, later, a hairdresser and skate/snowboard shop, you'll find one of the best cups of coffee in the state.\n\nAt Little Goat Coffee Roasting Co., customers can watch the roasting process in action, snuggle on a floral couch near a (non-working) fireplace, or grab a seat in one of two plush red seats that once faced the stage at Wilmington's Grand Opera House.\n\nLittle Goat was founded by business partners Joe Lins and Olivia Brinton, who wanted to bring their own freshly roasted, organically grown and fairly traded coffee to Delaware.\n\nCrab and lobster tower at Eden\n\n23 Baltimore Ave., Rehoboth Beach\n\nWhile Labor Day weekend always, sadly, spells the unofficial end of the season, one of my favorite dishes of the past summer, and in fact year, was the crab and Maine lobster tower at Eden.\n\nIt features layers of large chunks of cold lobster meat over creamy crab meat. The base of the molded tower is a fruity mango salsa and the plate is finished with a swipe of cool, avocado crema.\n\nEden, a romantic, fine-dining, dinner-only eatery has long offered this $19 appetizer, but it was a new-to-me experience.\n\nFocaccia robiola di Ciro at Touch of Italy\n\n530 Concord Pike, Brandywine Hundred\n\nWhen Touch of Italy owner Bob Ciprietti took over the former Bella Coast Italian Kitchen & Market on Concord Pike, the Sussex County restaurateur came with some secret weapons.\n\nHe brought in culinary consultant Ciro Verdi, a longtime New York City chef/restaurateur whose pizza has been praised by celebrity chef Bobby Flay and featured often on the Food Network.\n\nVerdi is overseeing all dishes on the menu. On a recent visit, Touch of Italy seemed to still be working out kinks, but I'd go back for focaccia robiola di Ciro, a signature dish that Verdi first introduced in 1989.\n\nThe thin, baked focaccia ($17) is smeared with creamy, robiola cheese and drizzled with white truffle oil. Verdi's focaccia robiola di Ciro deluxe ($21) is the same style pie, but it also includes prosciutto, arugula and oven-dried tomatoes.\n\nThe Hydrator at Raw Essential Juice Bar\n\nShops of Limestone Hills, 5335 Limestone Road, Pike Creek\n\nA family member turned me on to this delicious, cold, $8.50 green drink and now I can't get enough.\n\nThe Hydrator is a 20-ounce, 170-calorie smoothie featuring a blend of cucumber, spinach, pineapple, mango and cucumber water. It's refreshing, but not overly sweet. Give it a try.\n\nPastries at The Station on Kings\n\n720 Kings Highway, Lewes\n\nThis snazzy cafe and market that opened last year comes from Leisa Berlin, who runs the town's super cute and classic candy store, Edie Bees Confection Shop on Second Street.\n\nThe delectable pastries are not to be missed. I like the croissants, especially the chocolate-banana and the savory ham and cheese.\n\nYou can order lunch at the counter and eat it in a separate greenhouse-like dining area. The menu goes well beyond run-of-the-mill sandwiches and salads.\n\nCream of crab soup at Meding's Seafood\n\n3697 Bay Road, Milford\n\nRecently, we stopped into this Kent County seafood market/restaurant off Del. 1 to get the low-down on the giant gold 47,000-pound, 20-foot ship's propeller that's in the parking lot.\n\nThe propeller, purchased as an eye-catching landmark for the eatery, was one of four that once helped thrust the USS Shangri-La. That aircraft carrier commissioned in 1944 earned two battle stars in World War II, and three stars in the Vietnam War. Famed astronauts Jim Lovell and the late Gene Cernan were once deployed on the Shangri-La.\n\nDuring our visit on a cold November morning, we tried Meding's signature homemade cream of crab soup. It's a winner. The cream of crab soup, a family recipe, is made with fresh crabmeat and a dash of seasoning on top. You can eat in or get it to go in 12- or 32-ounce containers.\n\nAvocado-blood orange salad at Prime 225\n\n225 Bohemia Ave., Chesapeake City, Maryland\n\nPrime 225 restaurant in Chesapeake City, Maryland, is worth a drive and for so much more than this salad. But I've included it because it's was so hard to stop eating it.\n\nA dining companion, who has visited Prime 225 several times in the past, didn't even have to look at the menu. He knew he wanted this salad. Again.\n\nChef Brandon Gentry tosses baby arugula leaves with small bites of blood oranges, sweet onion, grape tomatoes and toasted pine nuts in a tart-sweet white balsamic-tarragon vinaigrette. He then fans buttery slices of ripe avocado on top for some crunchy and followed by little creaminess.\n\nThe menu now has a different version of the salad which includes roasted baby beets, oven dried tomatoes, avocado, sweet onion, candied pine nuts, red wine poppy seed vinaigrette and local honey.\n\nIt's still a very good beginning to a meal, especially if you get a bone-in ribeye or the Maryland rockfish.\n\nMORE DELAWARE FOOD:\n\n20 (and more) classic Delaware eateries you shouldn't miss\n\n10 great Delaware places to satisfy a sweet tooth\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/26"}]}

They said Wilmington should utilize nearby training facilities, conduct exercises with county companies and \"evaluate their in-service training program to ensure that it is adequately preparing fire fighters to respond to various incidents,\" the report said.\n\n\"There were people going every which way,\" then-fire union president Mike McNulty told The News Journal in 1999. \"We were lucky we didn't lose anyone.\"\n\nNearly two decades later, the department wasn't so lucky. A blaze on Sept. 24, 2016, in Canby Park took the lives of three Wilmington firefighters: Christopher Leach, Jerry Fickes and Ardythe Hope.\n\nA lack of training for firefighters and officers was cited among the factors that turned the fire fatal, federal investigators said in a November report.\n\nThe Wilmington Fire Department increased the quality and frequency of training after the Canby Park fire, firefighters said. But the two federal reports raise questions about why the changes didn’t happen sooner.\n\nEven after a near catastrophe in 1997 and federal recommendations in 1999, the Wilmington Fire Department did not embark on a consistent effort to properly train its personnel until three firefighters died.\n\n\"How do you defend that?\" asked Bill Kirlin Jr., a retired Wilmington firefighter who was among the first responders at the Delaware Trust Building.\n\n\"Here we are with a paid, professional fire department with a 19-year spread from two different kinds of fires — but two major fires — and all the same issues are still present with the two fires. It’s negligence. There’s no way around it.\"\n\nMost of Wilmington Fire Department's training before and after the Delaware Trust fire was \"company level\" training, in which firefighters learn from their officers, Kirlin said.\n\nThe officers may or may not have nationally certified credentials because outside continuing education is not required.\n\nThe most recent federal report states that \"instructor\" and \"officer\" classes should be offered \"on a rotating basis\" but Wilmington has offered them rarely, if ever, said Joe Leonetti, the fire union president.\n\nLive burn training is supposed to occur at least once a year, according to the federal report on the 2016 fire, but Leonetti estimated Wilmington has done them only three times in five or six years.\n\nThere's a significant difference between learning from an uncertified company officer and one certified by the Pro Board, the professional organization that trains instructors in national standards, according to Kirlin.\n\n\"It would be like a Cadillac compared to a Chevy,\" he said.\n\nFirefighters must pass a written exam and physical agility test to graduate from the academy. One year later, Leonetti said they have to pass the physical test again. After that, Leonetti said training has been informal and/or optional.\n\n\"Once you get your Firefighter II certification, you have it,\" Leonetti said. \"So we have guys with 35 years who got Firefighter II 35 years ago, and that’s the last thing they did.\"\n\nFor firefighters who want to further their education beyond what the city offers, Leonetti said employees often have to go on their own time with their own money.\n\n\"It’s tough seeing other departments really proactive with their training,\" he said. \"We need to get better at it. I just want my people to be able to go home at the end of the day.\"\n\nWilmington officials declined to be interviewed, citing a pending lawsuit involving the Canby Park fire. John Rago, Mayor Mike Purzycki's spokesman, said in a statement that the fire department pays for training that is \"required\" or \"approved\" by the department.\n\n\"If a firefighter requests training that is not required by the Department, and the Department approves the request, the Department will pay for the course but the firefighter must attend on his/her own time,\" Rago said.\n\nRago provided a list of training Wilmington firefighters do, including structural live burns, mayday training and how to fight below-grade fires such as basement fires.\n\nSince Fire Chief Michael Donohue took the helm months after the Canby Park fire, firefighters said there are more quality training opportunities.\n\nThe fire department said firefighters interested in receiving Pro Board training and certification were given the opportunity this past year. Fifty-five were certified in 2018 in the areas of rope rescue, confined space rescue and vehicle and advanced vehicle rescue.\n\nWhy didn’t Wilmington invest in more training?\n\nThe 1999 report should have dictated \"major changes\" within the fire department, but it did not, Kirlin said.\n\n\"Structure fire-wise, it was all company driven,\" Kirlin said. \"There was not a lot of Pro Board certified instruction given.\"\n\nThe main reason for that is money, according to Al Huelsenbeck, a former deputy chief who retired in 2013.\n\n“We were trying to keep our head above water,” said Huelsenbeck, who starting working for the Wilmington Fire Department in 1972. “The fire department costs money, and at that time in that administration, there wasn’t a lot.\"\n\nHuelsenbeck said that national training sessions aren’t a silver bullet. National training materials tend to be written for larger departments with optimal resources, he said.\n\nThere is no standard firefighting training policy in Delaware, according to the state's Volunteer Firefighters Association.\n\nWarren Jones, executive manager of the volunteer association, said most, if not all, volunteer companies send their people to the Delaware Fire School, where they are trained in various forms of firefighting.\n\nAll require the basic class, like structural fire fighting and vehicle rescue, Jones said. After they complete those classes, they do periodic training in the individual fire companies.\n\n“That is based on their own criteria and own issues at the time,” he said. “But they are always reviewing standard operating procedures and standard training procedure.”\n\nGreenville, South Carolina Fire Chief Stephen Kovalcik, who leads a department in a city with 3,000 fewer residents than Wilmington, said it's essential that firefighters stay sharp. His firefighters get annual refresher training.\n\n\"In the sports world, you play as you practice,\" he said. \"If you don't practice, and it’s time for the game, how do you expect to maintain your skill set?\"\n\nContinuing education is especially important because firefighting evolves as building materials change and fires burn faster, Kovalcik said. But firefighting as a profession can be slow to adapt.\n\n\"There is a saying in the fire service. It’s 200 years of tradition unimpeded by progress,\" he said.\n\nEven in departments that have strong training programs and protocols, tragedies can happen, Kovalcik said. There is no such thing as a perfect fire response.\n\n\"It doesn’t happen,\" he said. \"It’s dang near impossible.\"\n\nHow is fire training improving now?\n\nSince Chief Michael Donohue took over in January 2017, Leonetti said the department holds mandatory training sessions on a new topic every month. The department under Donohue is also offering opportunities for members to obtain national certifications which were not offered previously and is planning to offer training for officers.\n\nLeonetti believes those changes are a direct reaction to the Canby Park tragedy.\n\n\"We're getting more training now than we ever got,\" Leonetti said, but added more needs to be done.\n\nLeonetti said the union is working with the city to establish physical standards for firefighters. Currently, annual medical exams, which include a cardiac stress test, are optional. He said all firefighters aren't necessarily in great shape.\n\n\"We had a guy that would come in, get on the treadmill and as soon as they went to kick it up, he’d be like, ‘No, this ride’s over,’\" Leonetti said. \"He died of a heart attack.\"\n\nPurzycki recently secured funding for exercise equipment for the fire department, Leonetti said. If the physicals become required, the union doesn't want the system to be punitive.\n\n\"I don’t want to see anyone get in trouble because they got out of shape,\" he said. \"We could make it something for new guys that you have to keep up with this. But the guys that have 30 years aren't going to be on board if you get in trouble.\"\n\nLongtime City Councilwoman Loretta Walsh, who chairs the council's Public Safety Committee, declined to comment for this story.\n\nThe city declined to make Donohue available for an interview citing pending litigation, but a statement was issued on his behalf:\n\n\"The Wilmington Fire Department has continued to evolve its training protocols in order to ensure that all WFD firefighters are responsibly trained on an annual basis. Throughout the year, the WFD offers multiple training events for its firefighters at the company and platoon levels, as well as department wide.\n\n\"In addition to annual mandatory training for all WFD firefighters in areas such as fire ground operations and fire behavior, the WFD also regularly offers company level training and officer level training in a wide variety of areas and disciplines.\"\n\nThe pending litigation is a lawsuit filed by attorneys representing the estates of Leach, Fickes, Hope and three firefighters injured in the Canby Park fire.\n\nFiled in August, the suit argues that a Wilmington cost-saving policy led to conditions that resulted in the deadly blaze.\n\nThe policy, which places a fire truck out of service to save on overtime expenses, was in place the morning of the Canby Park fire, which prevented more than 1,700 gallons of water from being doused on the house before the first floor collapsed, trapping firefighters, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe rolling bypasses practice started under former Wilmington Mayor James Baker and was continued by his successor, former Mayor Dennis P. Williams.\n\nIt is still in use today.\n\nThomas S. Neuberger, whose law firm and that of Jacobs & Crumpler represent the firefighters, said the federal report has shown the Wilmington Fire Department did not have a standard operating procedure when it came to attacking fires in basements, which are common in many city homes.\n\n\"The city has failed to keep its firefighting skills up to date and this has cost it the lives of firefighters and others,\" Neuberger said.\n\nMany Wilmington firefighters remain angry that Purzycki cut 16 firefighting positions from his budget during his first year in office. Besides concerns about slower response times and reduced manpower, Huelsenbeck said the loss of the positions makes it harder to train the people remaining.\n\n\"Having the luxury of being able to put companies out of service to have viable training, that’s a big issue throughout the fire service,\" he said.\n\n\"Do I wish that I had better training? Yeah, I do. Do I wish my guys could’ve had better training? Sure. Was it always a reality or possibility? No. In my 40 years there, that fire department was cut by one third. The night I started there were 58 people on duty. Tonight, there are 34.\"\n\nSometimes it's as low as 30, according to Leonetti.\n\nKirlin said the department should continue to bolster training for all personnel despite the cost.\n\n\"You could say it’s going to cost three times the amount of money, but most firefighters are going to tell you we’re probably better off doing that,\" he said. \"The firefighters are going to be safer. The citizens are going to be safer.\"\n\nContact Christina Jedra at cjedra@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2837 or on Twitter @ChristinaJedra.\n\nMORE ON THE WILMINGTON FIRE DEPARTMENT\n\nFormer Wilmington fire chief pleads guilty to theft\n\nLawsuit over fatal fire claims Wilmington to blame in firefighters' deaths at Canby Park\n\nWilmington mayor calls fire lawsuit 'attempt to get even more money from the city'\n\n'Water Witch' fire station in Wilmington to be turned into apartments", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/05/13/how-wilmingtons-former-fire-chief-able-steal-years/1158550001/", "title": "How Wilmington's former fire chief was able to steal for years", "text": "Wilmington’s Former Fire Chief Anthony Goode was able to steal from his fellow firefighters for nearly a decade by taking total control of a nonprofit and using the power of his office to intimidate those who might speak out.\n\nCourt documents and interviews with firefighters and one prosecutor reveal a racket in which he used firefighters' money to pay for clothes, shopping, city utility bills and traffic tickets.

The theater's Facebook page stated it was due to \"circumstances outside of our control.\" Coronavirus was not mentioned.\n\nEarlier Friday, Live Nation marketing manager Alexandra Evans told Delaware Online/The News Journal that \"Micro-Wrestling All-Stars Live Presents: The Road To Full Size Tour\" would proceed as planned at 8 p.m.\n\nA few hours later, the cancellation notice was posted.\n\nGOVERNOR'S ORDERS:Carney declares state of emergency following coronavirus cases\n\nThe announcement came a day after Gov.

But there's ...", "text": "We are providing this content free as a public service to readers during the coronavirus outbreak. Please support the work we're doing by subscribing to Delaware Online.\n\nIt's an extraordinary time in Delaware.\n\nIn the last week, the state has gone from having no confirmed cases of coronavirus to having 26 as of 5 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nSchools are closed. Restaurants and bars are restricted to takeout or delivery service. There's been a run on toilet paper despite no evidence production has slowed — or that coronavirus leads to increased bathroom use.\n\nFor many, life right now is unprecedented. It's scary for some. Yet Delawareans are adapting to this odd — and hopefully temporary — new world, and many are remaining resilient as each day brings added uncertainty.\n\n\"I believe (the warnings). I believe everything we're getting from the media,\" 62-year-old Randy Harp said Tuesday as he bought his weekly cases of beer from Total Wine on Route 7 in Milltown.\n\nLIQUOR STORES:Coronavirus closes liquor stores in PA, sparking spike in Delaware sales\n\n\"But I've been through so many of these national emergencies that I know we'll pull together and get through it. That's just the way we are.\"\n\nHis quiet optimism underscored another day of rapid changes and announcements Wednesday. The Delaware General Assembly legislative session was postponed indefinitely. Gov. John Carney announced that Delaware restaurants and pubs with liquor licenses can sell alcohol with takeout, but he closed venues such as movie theaters. The state Department of Labor expanded unemployment rules for tipped and part-time workers.\n\nA drive-through Food Bank of Delaware food give-away at the Wilmington Riverfront was swamped by more than 1,000 cars and police were asked to send some home.A student at Cab Calloway School of the Arts was identified as one of the Delawareans who has tested positive.\n\nCities quiet, but not quite ghost towns\n\nAlong downtown Wilmington’s deserted Market Street on Tuesday morning, businesses posted signs on their doors alerting customers to limited hours, closures and restaurant changes.\n\nThe Market Street BrewHaHa café, usually bustling with downtown office workers on a weekday morning, was empty, limited to to-go orders. Not too far away, Trolley Square's BrewHaHa, usually packed, had its chairs stacked inside with just two or three baristas serving customers.\n\nAlong Shipley Street, a group of homeless gathered at the locked door to the Creative Vision Factory, an arts nonprofit that is one of the few welcoming places in downtown Wilmington for the homeless to spend the day.\n\n“Where are we to go?” said Cheryl Austin, a 63-year-old resident of the Sunday Breakfast Mission shelter. She knocked on the nonprofit’s doors, hoping to get a cup of coffee and a place to store her belongings for the day.\n\nHOMELESSNESS:Wilmington's homeless shut out of libraries, cafes, day centers in coronavirus crisis\n\nTuesday morning's eerie lull was reminiscent of a Sunday afternoon in Wilmington. But by noon, the city's downtown had picked up to a slightly muted version of normal.\n\nThe Market Street lunch crowd was lighter than usual, as businessmen and women picked up takeout to bring back to their offices. Downtown restaurants are adapting to Gov. John Carney's emergency declaration banning dine-in service.\n\nInside DiMeo's Pizza, a busy lunch spot, the line was shorter than most days, and a sign on the register said: \"To go orders only!\" Employees remained busy, and customers smiled and laughed as they waited for their lunch.\n\n\"This is the first time I've ever experienced anything like this,\" said 62-year-old Dennis Marinelli, a local resident. \"It seems so overblown, and I've been through 9/11. I know (coronavirus) is serious, but the reaction to it is ridiculous.\"\n\nBAD NEWS:Delaware restaurants say takeout, delivery won't help them survive coronavirus shutdown\n\nIn Newark, downtown streets and the University of Delaware campus were nearly vacant, save for construction crews working along Main Street.\n\n“It’s not the Newark we know,” said Don Berry, who’s lived near the city for 40 years.\n\nBerry, who walks around the city every day, said he usually runs into crowds of students milling about this time of year. But on Tuesday, it was different.\n\nLIFE DURING A PANDEMIC:A week unlike any in a century: Coronavirus grinds life in Delaware to a crawl\n\n“It’s virtually deserted right now,” he said. “I’ve seen maybe two people today.”\n\nBerry said the new normal has made it difficult to see his mother, who moved into an assisted living facility a few months ago.\n\n“I’m not allowed to see her,” he said. “I dropped some groceries off outside her building yesterday.”\n\nFurther down on Main Street, UD senior Ellie Jogani sat with a friend outside Gore Hall drinking coffee and reminiscing about their time at UD.\n\n“There’s really not much to do,” Jogani said. “I guess I’m being a little nostalgic with it being my last semester.”\n\nWhile the Newark resident knew her time at the university was coming to an end, she didn’t think it would be like this. The finance major is scheduled to graduate in May, but she's not sure if there will be any ceremonies.\n\nSTORY:University of Delaware to close all residence halls amid coronavirus concerns\n\nThese uncertain times concern Jogani.\n\n“Nobody knows what’s going to happen. Nobody can predict it. So it’s just a scary feeling,\" she said.\n\n“I feel like I’m either overreacting, underreacting. I just don’t really know how to react to it.”\n\nPeople flocking to Delaware parks, beaches\n\nThough Delaware's northern cities were relatively deserted, not all citizens have suddenly become shut-ins.\n\n\"If you drove through the town of Bethany Beach this weekend, there weren't any available parking spots,\" said Lauren Weaver, executive director at the Bethany-Fenwick Area Chamber of Commerce. \"(People) are here.\"\n\nREAD:Coronavirus brings boom to Delaware beaches over weekend. But are visitors here to stay?\n\nFurther north, at a Milford dog park on Tuesday, about a dozen locals and even more dogs enjoyed the warm weather and camaraderie.\n\n“They have to get out,” said Susan Berwick, speaking more of the dogs’ need than the humans. She said the dog park is like “a community within a community,” something that offers a “favorable feeling” for Milford.\n\nIn New Castle County parks, the pandemic didn’t stop people from walking, jogging, and playing tennis and basketball.\n\nMarinelli, who felt the reaction was overblown, has noticed more people than usual out enjoying the weather at Delcastle Recreational Park this week.\n\nOther residents also pointed to more outdoor activity in local parks.\n\nThat shouldn't be surprising, considering local and state officials are encouraging people to utilize the state's recreation areas.\n\nOn Friday, New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer said exercise \"increases your immunity\" and recommended healthy residents visit the parks. On Tuesday, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control announced it is suspending entry fees for all parks and wildlife areas until April 30.\n\nRELATED:Coronavirus means Delaware state park events canceled, but so are the entry fees\n\n“Times are challenging,\" said Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Shawn Garvin. \"This is an opportunity for Delawareans ... to embrace nature while we maintain social distance from each other.”\n\nThat's exactly what 32-year-old Jayson Herrera and his son, 13-year-old Aiden Howard, did at Glasgow Park Tuesday afternoon.\n\nSweaty and shirtless from shooting hoops, Herrera said he usually goes to a local gym on weekdays. Because of the pandemic, he wanted to avoid crowded spaces.\n\nAiden, who is usually in school, said he joined his dad so he wouldn't be cooped up at home.\n\n\"I'm just being cautious and trying to have fun at the same time,\" he said.\n\nStaff reporters Marina Affo, Natalia Alamdari, Brandon Holveck, Jeanne Kuang, Maddy Lauria, Esteban Parra and Ira Porter contributed to this story.\n\nSend story tips or ideas to Isabel Hughes at ihughes@delawareonline.com or 302-324-2785.

While much of the flooring had been replaced about 20 years ago when Steve \"Monty\" Montgomery and his group bought the party place, parts of had not been touched in nearly five decades.\n\n\"I can't wait for that first beer to spill or the first piece of gum to stick,\" says a brave Montgomery, who will be working his 31st opening this weekend -- a party that stretches from Thursday to Sunday with St. Patrick's Day in the middle.\n\nThe new floors aren't the only attention-getting improvements in the land of Orange Crushes and Bull Sharks.\n\nSince The Starboard is the kind of place that can somehow lure you in for brunch and spit you out after dinner, all those hours of fun usually also mean plenty of phone time texting friends and posting on social media. So Montgomery added $20,000 worth of lockable phone-charging stations.\n\nJust how comfortable can The Starboard get? How about some cots next year?\n\n\"No. No beds and no hourly hotel rooms, either,\" cracks Montgomery, whose bar snagged a recent shout-out on ESPN during an interview between a pair of regular customers, host Scott Van Pelt and Notre Dame basketball coach Mike Brey.\n\nJust like they have for the past decade or so, a large heated white tent is covering the entire Starboard parking lot this weekend, allowing the party to spill off the deck and into every inch of usable space.\n\nAnd it will be needed. The annual opening party draws a mixture of locals, hardcore weekend warriors and St. Patrick's Day amateurs.\n\nDewey Beach's hotels are booked, favorites like Mama Celeste's Pizzeria are cutting slices and even bigger bars such as The Rusty Rudder will be open. (The Rudder's two-day no-cover St. Patrick's Day party runs Friday night with Blue Label and Saturday with Love Seed Mama Jump and The Rockets.)\n\nThe Starboard will be leaning on plenty of familiar faces to keep the party rolling this weekend with LauraLea & Tripp Fabulous on Thursday night, Kristen & Johnny on Saturday night and Bryen O'Boyle of Mr. Greengenes on for a Suicide Sunday set starting at 2 p.m.\n\nIf you're not quite ready to cannonball into a Starboard party -- yes, we understand there's still snow on the ground in some parts of the state -- then perhaps it's time to start planning the end of hibernation.\n\nHere are a few events coming this spring that just might be worth your time.\n\nApril 7 -- Theatre N launches its new \"AFI's 100 Greatest American Movies\" series. Wilmington's independent movie theater is about to try something that they've wanted to do for a while: screen all 100 of the American Film Institute's 100 greatest American-made movies. The countdown begins April 7 with No. 100 \"Ben-Hur,\" followed by No. 99 \"Toy Story\" on April 14, No. 98 \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" on April 21 and No. 97 \"Blade Runner\" on April 28. Tickets are $6 for each film.\n\nMarch 24 -- Downtown Newark Wine & Dine takes over Main Street. While University of Delaware students are on spring break, the townspeople will party! Instead of college kegs \"Animal House\"-style, Wine & Dine is more Dean Wormer than \"Bluto\" Blutarsky with its $2 2-ounce pours of wine and small plates. Thirteen downtown Newark restaurants are listed as participants with nine local musical acts performing outside in the sun. All parking is free, both in city lots and at meters.\n\nApril 21-22 -- Four words: Dewey Beach Bacon Fest. Sure, you've been bar-hopping in Dewey and Rehoboth beaches. But have you ever been bacon-hopping? A string of fun-loving restaurants in Rehoboth and Dewey beaches will be offering bacon-centric food and drinks for this year's annual grease-filled festival. (Dewey is Saturday, complete with a beach bonfire at night. Rehoboth is Sunday.) Everyone from Nicola Pizza and Grotto Pizza to The Starboard and Fins Fish House & Raw Bar will get in the act. Single-day passes are $20-$30 and two-day passes cost $28-$43.\n\nApril 21 -- Record Store Day brings us rare Dogfish-filled Flaming Lips vinyl. Oh, to be a Delaware Flaming Lips fan on Record Store Day. The far-out rockers will not only release a collaborative beer with Dogfish Head -- Dragons & YumYums -- but also a beer-filled 7-inch piece of vinyl featuring a pair of songs inspired by the beer. (Mind officially blown!) There are only 100 copies filled with the beer, so happy hunting. The beer -- a pink-hued 6.5% ABV tart pale ale -- hits shelves Friday, March 23.\n\nMay -- Wilmington Brew Works opens. One down, one to go. With the opening of Stitch House Brewery last weekend on Market Street -- the crowds were so large and steady they ran out of food -- attention now turns to the other city brewery preparing to open. Wilmington Brew Works at 3201 Miller Road should be open sometime in May, making it the first production brewery within the city limits in more than six decades. Details on what eateries are headed to the location should be coming soon. In the meantime, curious craft fans will watch as the concrete is poured and the restored brownfield finally comes back to life.\n\nMay 29 -- Wilmo A Go-Go revs up the Riverfront. It has become a Wilmington tradition on Memorial Day weekend. Vintage cars, live rockabilly (The Open Road, Coffin Fly), pin-up girls and a beard contest take over the parking lots at the Riverfront for the eighth year. Admission is free, but all the fun stuff from the vendors isn't. This year's food trucks will be Delaware Provision Company, Mojo Loco, Cajun-Sno, Outlandish, Kapow and Sweet Josephines.\n\nJune 14-17 -- Firefly Music Festival turns 7 in Dover. Sure there are nearly 100 acts at this year's Firefly Music Festival. And, yes, one of them is Eminem. But he's not the one everyone MUST see. This year's must-see is a hip-hop act, but it's actually Kendrick Lamar. He swept the rap categories at January's Grammy Awards, his brand of socially-conscious rap fits the times and Firefly fans want to see how his live show has grown since his sun-drenched set at Firefly five years ago. When he appears on stage, you might be able to hear it all the way from Wilmington.\n\nAll spring -- The Queen's bookings are heating up in Wilmington. Don't look now, but The Queen just might be getting its groove back. Live Nation racked up a string of diverse sell-outs in recent weeks (Blues Traveler, The Marshall Tucker Band, Shine a Light) and has an equally diverse calendar headed our way with more possible sell-outs coming. Keep an eye out for Drive-By Truckers (March 28), Christopher Cross (April 9), Hatebreed (May 3), Ani DiFranco (May 8), St. Vincent (May 25) and Manchester Orchestra (June 6) coming to town this spring.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWhat: The Starboard's opening weekend\n\nWhen: Thursday through Sunday\n\nWhere: The Starboard, 2009 Del. 1, Dewey Beach\n\nCost: No cover\n\nInformation: thestarboard.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/15"}]}

Stephen Ballard, the state trooper gunned down in a Wawa parking lot in Bear on Wednesday, will forever remember his smile – and the way it made them feel.\n\nHis former neighbors in Milford, where he lived before moving to New Castle County a year and a half ago, felt safe as he'd smile and wave while parking his police cruiser in front of his condominium. His patrol unit commander felt confident that Ballard's smile and personality could lead him to success. And the Delaware State University students he mentored felt at ease when he'd smile while helping them prepare for job interviews.\n\n\"You couldn't walk into a room without his big smile lighting the place up,\" said Kylie Parrotta, a Delaware State University professor who met Ballard through the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. \"Honestly, with the current state of policing, he is the kind of officer that we need to bridge the gap.\"\n\nCapt. J. Sapp, the Troop 2 commander for Ballard's patrol unit, agreed that Ballard was someone everyone wanted to be around. He was devoted to not only his work but his new wife and 5-year-old stepdaughter.\n\n\"In fact, I was with his wife at the hospital last night, when I heard her tell the governor he wanted to be the governor some day,\" Sapp said. \"And, he had the type of personality and the drive that he could have accomplished that goal.\"\n\nSTORY: Officials: Man killed by police had shot at officer\n\nSTORY: Girl, 16, fatally shot in Wilmington is identified\n\nThe death of Ballard sent waves through the many communities and organizations he devoted himself to.\n\n\"It's just devastating. We lost a friend, we lost a mentor, and we lost a trooper,\" Parrotta said.\n\nThe 32-year-old trooper was on duty Wednesday when he approached a suspicious Dodge Charger in the Wawa parking lot on Pulaski Highway. The passenger of the car shot at Ballard after the trooper asked the man to get out of the car, police said.\n\nBallard, an 8½-year state police veteran, attempted to run for cover behind a parked vehicle, but the suspect, 26-year-old Burgon Sealy Jr., fired multiple rounds from a close range, police said.\n\nSealy fled the scene and called his family to tell them he had shot a trooper at the Wawa, police said. He then was holed up by himself in his family's home in the Brick Mill Farm development until police shot him to death outside around 9:15 a.m. Thursday.\n\nMac McCormick, who lived across from Ballard in the Hearthstone Manor condo complex in Milford a year and a half ago, said he and his wife, Natalie, wondered early Wednesday whether the trooper shot was Ballard because they knew he had moved north for his state police job.\n\nThen, when they heard his name on the late night news, they were shocked.\n\n\"He was our next-door neighbor and a fine police officer,\" McCormick said. \"He was very dedicated.\"\n\n\"I must say it was great having a police officer in the neighborhood because if anything did, in fact, go wrong, he would be on it immediately,\" he added.\n\nMcCormick's wife recalled inviting Ballard to their annual Christmas party. He always graciously accepted the invitation but would warn that he might not make it because of his job.\n\n\"He was always working,\" McCormick said. \"He worked any overtime he could because he was saving. He wanted to buy a house.\"\n\nBallard's dream of owning a home came true when he and his wife, Louise, bought a home in Wellington Hills in Hockessin in June 2016, according to property records.\n\nThat home – a brick four-bedroom with a manicured front lawn – had Delaware State Police troopers stationed outside of it on Thursday afternoon.\n\nFor some neighbors, seeing the police vans was their first realization that a community member may have been the one fatally shot. They pinned blue ribbons on mailboxes and poles throughout the development in honor of the fallen officer.\n\nWhile residents were tight-lipped out of respect for Ballard's grieving family, others who knew him shared their fondest memories.\n\nBallard was originally from Bowie, Maryland. He graduated from Delaware State University with a degree in criminal justice and sociology in 2007.\n\nHe then graduated in 2009 from the 80th Delaware State Police graduating class. The ceremony was held at his alma mater, Delaware State University.\n\nBallard initially worked for Delaware State Police at a station in Sussex County but was transferred to Troop 2 in Glasgow about a year and a half ago. He was assigned to the uniformed patrol unit.\n\nSapp, his commander, said about two weeks ago he and Ballard discussed putting him on some special projects.\n\nLt. Thomas Brackin, president of the Delaware State Troopers Association, said Ballard knew how to bring calm and control to the chaotic situations troopers face.\n\n“He was very involved and engaged with the community,\" Brackin said.\n\nBallard's shift mate, Chris Martin, said that while work was important to Ballard, his family always came first. He would text his wife, Louise, every day to make sure she got to work and was always talking about his stepdaughter, Abigail.\n\n\"That was first and foremost, his family,\" Martin said.\n\nLouise and Ballard married in November 2015 at the DuPont Country Club near Wilmington and honeymooned in Grenada, according to their wedding website.\n\nA memorial fund to help his family has been established at the Delaware State Police Federal Credit Union. Checks can be made out to the DSTA-Stephen Ballard Memorial Fund, P.O. Box 168, Cheswold, DE 19936.\n\nOn top of being devoted to his family, Ballard was devoted to mentoring DSU students who belonged to the only collegiate chapter of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, or NOBLE.\n\nParrotta, faculty adviser to the collegiate chapter, said dozens of students and members of Delaware's parent chapter held a memorial in which they signed a banner and shared their stories of Ballard on Thursday morning. They plan to give the banner to Ballard's family.\n\nBallard had recently taken on mentoring approximately eight students in the collegiate chapter. He would go out of his way to pay for a student who needed their dress suit dry cleaned before an interview or help a student write a cover letter and résumé.\n\n\"He was an amazing mentor to my students,\" Parrotta said. \"He gave back in every possible way he could.\"\n\nBallard also helped run a crab bake fundraiser to help pay for DSU students to attend the NOBLE annual conference. The conference was a life-changing networking opportunity for many of her students.\n\n\"When he was there with them, he helped them mingle,\" Parrotta said. \"It is impossible to not feel comfortable talking to him.\"\n\nParrotta said Ballard was a strong role model for young African-Americans starting careers in law enforcement.\n\n\"Something that comes up in class a lot is that students struggle to be young black men who want to go into policing when maybe their families are not thrilled with that career path,\" Parrotta said. \"It is important we have people like Cpl. Ballard that show the students who want to go down this career path that they can do it despite what barriers are there or what their past experience with police is like.\"\n\nMcCormick agreed. He said the fatal shooting hit especially close to his family since his son-in-law is a homicide detective in a Pennsylvania police department.\n\n\"They never know when they go out the door,\" he said. \"They do everything to protect us, and what do they get out of it.\"\n\nStaff reporters Brittany Horn and Alonzo Small contributed to this report.\n\nContact Jessica Masulli Reyes at (302) 324-2777, jmreyes@delawareonline.com or Twitter @Jessicamasulli.\n\nRELATED:Standoff ends in Middletown; suspect in Delaware trooper death killed\n\nRELATED: A harrowing night in Middletown-area neighborhood", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/05/03/fallen-delaware-troopers-honored/101243360/", "title": "Fallen Delaware heroes embody 'essence' of policing", "text": "Brittany Horn\n\nThe News Journal\n\nDelaware State Police Cpl. Stephen J.

Outside Delaware State Police headquarters in Dover on Wednesday morning, under a bright sky, the community honored his sacrifice at its annual memorial service.\n\n\"The stories of our heroes will remain the very essence of our organization's soul,\" said Delaware State Police Col. Nathaniel McQueen.\n\nFULL COVERAGE: The death of Cpl. Stephen Ballard\n\nSTORY: Wawa ceremony honors fallen Cpl. Stephen Ballard.\n\nSTORY: Slain trooper's wife: He gave his life to his job.\n\nLouise Ballard placed a single red rose on the memorial along North Du Pont Highway before hugging each one of Ballard's shiftmates. All raised their hands to their temples, with fellow friend and Trooper Chris Martin tearfully delivering the slow, final salute.\n\nThe tragedy struck hard last week both in Delaware and across the country after 26-year-old Burgon Sealy Jr. killed Ballard and then retreated to his family's Middletown home, where he continued to rain gunfire on officers attempting to arrest him. He barricaded himself inside the single-family home for nearly 21 hours until he emerged armed with a weapon last Thursday morning and was killed by police.\n\n\"What kind of person is it that can stand over another human being and fire bullets?\" asked Eleanor Allione, president of the Delaware chapter of Concerns of Police Survivors, which supports the families of fallen law enforcement.\n\nPolice have not released a motive for the killing.\n\nFor families of killed police officers, the pain remains long after a death passes.\n\nAs bagpipes played the opening notes of \"Amazing Grace\" to a windy, sunny sky Wednesday morning, many families looked upward. The annual memorial services were scheduled long before Ballard was killed last week, with many hoping and praying no more names would be added to the already long list of police officers killed in the line of duty.\n\nThese outdoor services quickly became tributes to both Ballard and Lt. Steven Floyd, a correctional officer killed at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center on Feb. 1. Officials and friends remembered the two men for their service and their dedication to protecting Delaware communities. Many questioned how, after years of no law enforcement deaths, so many names would be added to the Dover memorial in one year.\n\n\"I never thought I'd be standing here putting four names on the list,\" said Fred Calhoun, president of the state Fraternal Order of Police at the statewide memorial service outside Legislative Hall in Dover.\n\nVIDEO: Watch the memorial service\n\nWHAT TO DO: How to support fallen trooper, Delaware police\n\nIn addition to Ballard and Floyd, two members of the Dover Police Department – 23-year-old Patrolman Robert E. DaFonte and 22-year-old Cadet James D. Watts – were killed in an off-duty crash.\n\nAfter weeks and months like these, Calhoun said he often finds himself wondering what makes young people want to be a police officer anymore. The low pay, bad hours and missed holidays don't always equate to a highly sought-after job, Calhoun said.\n\nBut he pointed to the law enforcement family – the group of people pulling together to protect those hurting right now – that makes this job matter. It's the families that officers return home to every night who remind Calhoun what makes policing worth it, he stressed, and the parents that instilled in their children that being a police officer is and always will be important work.\n\n\"They're the ones that taught you pride, integrity, dignity, honor – what it takes to do this job,\" Calhoun said.\n\nThough the state may have lost four law enforcement officers this year, the traits they embodied and exemplified have come to the forefront.\n\nLt. Thomas Brackin, president of the Delaware State Troopers Association, saw it firsthand in the troopers who responded to the Wawa last week.\n\nDespite seeing the devastating condition of their fellow trooper, police secured the crime scene and sought witnesses who saw the attack, he said. They put aside their emotions, Brackin said, despite the sinking feeling all had at the thought of losing a friend and colleague.\n\nThat dedication made Brackin's eyes fill with tears Wednesday morning, as he remembered thinking \"oh no, not again,\" when the call for \"trooper down\" came through his police radio.\n\n\"They were doing all the things we expect all troopers to do at any scene,\" Brackin said. \"They get it. The troopers that are here that I represent are the best of the best.\"\n\nState leaders like Attorney General Matt Denn agreed, noting that Ballard – a mentor to Delaware State University students and a proactive police officer – \"personified the qualities that define the Delaware State Police at its very best.\"\n\nEven though Ballard's family was going through what will likely be the worst week of their lives, his wife publicly recounted stories about his persistence and willingness to help others, Denn said.\n\n\"At a time when the Delaware community wanted to comfort the Ballard family, the Ballard family has comforted us,\" he said.\n\nBallard's funeral is scheduled for Friday morning at the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. Public visitation will last from 8:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. before uniformed officers will be invited to pay their respects. The service will begin at 11 a.m.\n\nIt won't be an easy next few days, weeks or months for the law enforcement community, but Peter Schwartzkopf, speaker of the Delaware House of Representatives, remains steadfast that police will persevere. The hundreds of officers standing at attention around the white tent set up for Wednesday's memorial service on The Green in Dover were proof of it, he said.\n\nLaw enforcement is family, Schwartzkopf said, \"and we don't forget family.\"\n\nContact Brittany Horn at bhorn@delawareonline or follow her on Twitter @brittanyhorn.\n\nHOW TO SUPPORT THE BALLARD FAMILY\n\nThose wishing to donate should make checks out to the DSTA-Stephen Ballard Memorial Fund, P.O.

Nathaniel McQueen Jr.\n\nA yellow sheet lay over Sealy's body on the manicured lawn, littered with shards of siding. Behind him, the white single-family home with green shutters sat in tatters – pink insulation clinging to wallboard and windows blasted out by explosive devices police used in hopes of convincing Sealy to surrender.\n\nHundreds of officers armed with assault rifles and bullet-proof vests remained at the scene Thursday, with police vehicles lining nearly every roadway leading to the home. Officers from the FBI, New Castle County and Wilmington police joined Delaware state troopers at the barricade. Helicopters took off and landed from a large green circular park in the middle of the development, picking up officers and dropping others off.\n\nThe case drew national attention Wednesday and Thursday after Cpl. Stephen J. Ballard, an 8½-year veteran with Delaware State Police, was gunned down in a Bear-area Wawa parking lot 15 miles from the barricaded home.\n\nMcQueen tearfully explained how Sealy got out of an acquaintance's vehicle in the parking lot and began shooting Ballard during a \"suspicious vehicle\" check just after noon Wednesday along Pulaski Highway.\n\nBallard turned to run for cover, but Sealy continued to shoot him, McQueen said. When the trooper fell to the ground, Sealy repeatedly shot him at close range.\n\nBallard, who was on duty and in full uniform, later died from his injuries at Christiana Hospital, McQueen said.\n\n\"The acts of Stephen yesterday exemplified the dedication that he brought to the citizens of Delaware on a daily basis,\" McQueen said, his voice thick with emotion.\n\nMcQueen declined to comment on whether 32-year-old Ballard was targeted. He would not speak to Sealy's motive, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\nMcQueen said Sealy contacted family members after the shooting Wednesday and told them he had shot a trooper at the Wawa. His family then contacted police.\n\nA second man, in the driver's seat of the vehicle when Sealy began shooting at the Wawa, was taken into custody at the convenience store, McQueen said. He has been released and is not considered a suspect in the investigation.\n\nSealy jumped into his own vehicle at the Wawa and streaked to the family home near Middletown. Sealy was \"well-armed and heavily equipped,\" McQueen said, though he would not comment on the type of weapons the man had in the home.\n\nThe Brick Mill Farm development was evacuated Wednesday when Sealy sought refuge there. The neighborhood was slowly opened up beginning at 11 a.m. Thursday. Investigators remained at the home, where four armored vehicles sat on the lawn and on the street.\n\nAn armored front-end loader called \"the Rook,\" or a Critical Incident Vehicle belonging to the Pennsylvania State Police, was used to end the standoff. It absorbed a half dozen rounds in the bullet-proof glass protecting officers operating the black, 6-ton unit that runs on tracks.\n\nDelaware State Police were not taking chances with Sealy.\n\n\"This is one of those situations where you had someone who made the conscious decision to shoot an officer, to assassinate an officer,\" said Lt. Thomas Brackin, president of the Delaware State Troopers Association. \"He had the mindset he was going to kill that officer.\"\n\nThe last state trooper killed in the line of duty was Cpl. Christopher Michael Shea, who was killed when a drunken driver hit him in 2004.\n\nBelow is the house where the suspect was killed:\n\nIn 2013, Sealy was charged northeast of Orlando, Florida, for possession of a small amount of marijuana and possession of a concealed weapon, according to the Volusia County Corrections. He presented a Delaware driver's license when stopped.\n\nSome who knew Sealy described him as mild-mannered, a stark contrast to the profile that emerged Wednesday, when he fled the shooting scene and barricaded himself in his Middletown home.\n\nBaltimore resident Scott Adkins said he went to school with Sealy, and lived down the street. Growing up, he said Sealy was an “average Middletown, Delaware kid,” who would ride dirt bikes and play paintball.\n\nThough the two were not close, Adkins did recall that his former schoolmate had a strong interest in guns, and would often speak about them on the bus to school.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it is the nature of the way he was bought up. He has always been around guns and always had guns,\" he said.\n\nPolice would not comment on Sealy's prior criminal history, but said it remains under investigation as part of the fatal shooting. McQueen would not elaborate on why Sealy was at the Wawa other than to say Ballard deemed the vehicle suspicious and made contact with the two men inside the parked car.\n\nThe \"suspicious vehicle\" stop wasn't uncommon for Ballard, described by fellow troopers as an exemplary police officer dedicated to making the community better. Capt. J. Sapp, who oversaw Ballard in his role as a patrolman out of Troop 2 in Glasgow, noted that two weeks ago Ballard was lauded for his work with DUI enforcement, and was slated to work on special policing projects.\n\nHis tactful approach toward policing made him a good trooper – and an even better person to work alongside, Sapp said.\n\n\"You know, you hear about that person with the proverbial smile that just lights up the room,\" Sapp said. \"That was Steve.\"\n\nBallard was also a family man who dearly loved his wife and 5-year-old stepdaughter, Abigail, according to Trooper Chris Martin, Ballard's shiftmate for the past one and a half years.\n\n\"His family was first and foremost,\" Martin said. \"And he took care of them. Now, they're ours to take care of.\"\n\nMORE: Delaware trooper killed at Bear Wawa\n\nMORE: Fear spreads through Middletown-area neighborhood\n\nThat's a responsibility state and fellow troopers don't take lightly. On Thursday, state police established a memorial fund at the Delaware State Police Federal Credit Union in the name of Cpl. Ballard. All proceeds will be given to his family. Checks can be made out to the DSTA-Stephen Ballard Memorial Fund, P.O. Box 168, Cheswold, DE 19936.\n\n\"We owe Cpl. Ballard and all these officers who serve on our behalf an enormous debt of gratitude,\" Gov. John Carney said at a press conference Thursday afternoon. \"Right now, as we're gathered here, law enforcement officers are working across this state, putting themselves at risk to protect the rest of us as they do every single day. We should always be mindful and appreciative of their presence.\"\n\nTheir presence was felt by the neighbors and residents of Brick Mill Farm, who early Wednesday afternoon received pounding knocks and saw flashing police lights as signs to evacuate their community. Many were forced to spend Wednesday night in local hotels or with friends.\n\nAfter hearing gunfire all night, those returning home shortly after 11 a.m. were eager to free their pets and check the conditions of their own homes.\n\n\"It was absolutely terrifying,\" said Linda Pavina, who lives on Ingram Court in the Brick Mill Farm community.\n\nShe was home Wednesday when police officers arrived on her doorstep and told her to leave immediately.\n\nPavina left her dog inside the house, along with her medication, in a rush to get to her sister's home in Middletown, where she stayed the night.\n\n\"I don't think anyone expects this anywhere, no matter what kind of neighborhood you live in,\" she said.\n\nKatie Satta and her friends had a different experience, spending the night trapped inside their home during the barricade.\n\n\"I thought it was construction,\" Satta said at hearing rounds of shots Wednesday afternoon. \"It's a really quiet neighborhood. Nothing ever happens.\"\n\nSatta said she, her friends and family stood by windows to see what was going on. From her home's top floor windows, she could see the barricaded house.\n\nFamily and friends spent the night in her house after Satta's father decided no one was going to leave. Satta's mother ended up stuck in a nearby parking lot, unable to enter the neighborhood.\n\n\"We were scared,\" she said. \"I was just concerned about my mom because I know she had been at work all day.\"\n\nHer mother wasn't alone in the parking lot of the Dove Run Shopping Center, though, as dozens of homeowners waited for news. Brick Mill Road remained closed until daybreak when Brick Mill Elementary resumed classes and buses needed to get through.\n\nPolice regularly circled through the parking lot, picking up boxes of coffee provided to them by Rishen Patel, owner of Manhattan Bagel. Patel, who was in the Dove Run parking lot early Thursday, said he was happy to help the officers.\n\n\"Police take care of us a lot so when something like this happens, I think we should all take care of them, too,\" he said, adding that he also provided the officers with bagels.\n\nIt's these small gestures that troopers and other law enforcement will cling to in the coming days and weeks, said Brackin, as news of Ballard's death continues to ripple through Delaware and America. In Legislative Hall on Thursday, lawmakers proposed a bill that would include law enforcement, firefighters and emergency personnel as protected classes under hate crimes.\n\nFor the second day in a row, the state House and Senate paused in a moment of silence for the slain officer.\n\n\"This is such a horrendous day and a horrendous time in our state,\" Senate Majority Leader Margaret Rose Henry, D-Wilmington East, said from the Senate floor.\n\nBrackin is hopeful that the community will rally behind the officers protecting them on a daily basis – despite the negative rhetoric surrounding policing.\n\nCommunity support is needed now more than ever, he said.\n\n\"This really brings it home,\" Brackin said. \"This is what we dread, but it's also the job we deal with day in and day out. ... And it's done by human beings.\"\n\nReporters Alonzo Small and Karl Baker contributed to this report.\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.

Stephen J.

Ballard fell after being hit, and the shooter continued to fire rounds into the trooper before fleeing to his family's Middletown-area home.\n\nThe shooter was identified as 26-year-old Burgon Sealy Jr., who was shot dead by police 21 hours after emerging from the barricaded home that was largely destroyed by explosive charges used to break down windows and doors. Sealy appeared armed with a weapon after an armored vehicle ripped siding off the structure.\n\nA Celebration of Life service is slated for 11 a.m. Friday at the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. Those wishing to pay respects to his family are invited to do so from 8:30 a.m. until 10 a.m. Immediately following, uniformed emergency services personnel will be invited to pay their respects.\n\nFriends, colleagues and family members described the 32-year-old Ballard as having a big smile and a positive nature. His wife said his willingness to help people is what attracted her to him in the first place.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED: Standoff ends in Middletown; suspect in Delaware trooper death killed\n\nWHO HE WAS: Trooper's friends say Delaware lost a bright light\n\nThe two met through mutual friends at the Delaware State Police, where Ballard began working 8½ years ago after graduating from Delaware State University. He was recruited by troopers to join the force right out of college, Louise Ballard said, and he graduated the academy in April 2009.\n\nThe two were married on Nov. 15, 2015, at the DuPont Country Club near Wilmington. The family had recently moved to Hockessin, and Ballard was working as a patrolman based out of Troop 2 in Glasgow.\n\nHe didn't always intend to be a state trooper, Louise said. Ballard originally started DSU in the school's aviation program with dreams of being a pilot, after serving as a Civil Air Patrol cadet in the wing’s Andrews Composite Squadron from 1998-2006.\n\nLt. Col. James Brogan, now chief of staff for the Nebraska Wing, previously served in the same squadron with Ballard and remembered him as a man with quiet demeanor, steadfast determination and unquestionable integrity.\n\n“A man whose actions were consistent with his word, Stephen set an example to all around him and inspires us to be and do more in our communities,\" Brogan said in a release from the Civil Air Patrol National Capital Wing. \"His legacy can be seen in the love shared across this nation and among those of us who had the privilege to know him. It's more than accurate to say that I learned more from Stephen than I could have ever imparted to him.”\n\nBallard changed his major to criminal justice after realizing he wanted to engage more with the community as a police officer rather than a pilot, his wife said. He continued to work with the university through the only collegiate chapter of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, or NOBLE, where he mentored about eight students.\n\nHe was also highly involved in NOBLE career fairs, fundraising events and recruiting, said Delaware Chapter President Director Joseph Bryant Jr., adding that Ballard touched many lives within the organization.\n\n\"He had an infectious smile and caring spirit with a kind and giving heart,\" Bryant said in a statement. \"While we know we have lost a member of the law enforcement community, we have truly lost a member of our family.\"\n\nIn lieu of flowers at the funeral, Ballard's family has requested donations be made in his memory to NOBLE.\n\nThe outpouring of love and support for the Delaware State Police and Ballard's family in the days after his death would have made him even prouder to be a trooper, Louise Ballard said. This camaraderie and willingness to serve and support each other was the reason he wore the uniform, she said.\n\n\"He wanted to help people in the best way,\" Louise Ballard said. \"Out of the kindness of his heart, if he wanted to help someone, he would do that. Personally, that was his nature; it's who he was.\"\n\nBallard's love for people spilled over into his personal life, where he helped his wife raise their 5-year-old daughter, Abigail. Many who knew him immediately described him as a family man who put his wife and daughter first.\n\nRELATED: A harrowing night in Middletown-area neighborhood\n\nRELATED: Wilmington 5K run honors fallen police officers\n\nState police created a memorial fund to help his family at the Delaware State Police Federal Credit Union.

A small memorial service will be held at 10 a.m. Monday at the Pulaski Highway location, which has been closed since Ballard was killed there.\n\nBut underneath the badge and uniform, Ballard was human, too, Louise said.\n\nHe loved to travel, even if it was only up to Philadelphia to catch dinner and a show. Every year, she said, they tried to take a new trip together and see another part of the world.\n\nHe was also a fan of gardening, she admitted with a laugh.\n\n\"He actually really enjoyed cutting the grass,\" Louise Ballard said. \"He was very proud of his lawn.\"\n\nAnd he never passed up the opportunity to make better the world he lived in, she said. He would often cover costs of dry cleaning or car repairs for friends who needed help.\n\nOnce he stopped to counsel a young woman driving erratically when he was off duty in his trooper SUV, Louise recalled. He was on his way to the gym when he pulled her over, she said, but he wanted her to be safer and make others on the road safer, too.\n\n\"He cared about Delaware,\" she said. \"This is the only job he's had and he's known, and he really took it seriously. He respected the job. ... He had a lot of good friends on the force. And I know he's going to be terribly missed.\"\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

J. Sapp, and the First State's response to the death of Cpl. Stephen J. Ballard is proof of that.\n\nHundreds of community members and law enforcement, as well as Ballard's family, filled the Wawa parking lot Monday morning where 32-year-old Ballard was gunned down last week.\n\nThe death of the 8½-year veteran rippled through the state after Burgon Sealy Jr., 26, shot Ballard repeatedly in the parking lot before driving to his parent's home in Middletown and barricading himself inside for nearly 21 hours.\n\nSealy fired repeatedly at police during the standoff, according to authorities, and finally emerged armed with a weapon. His behavior prompted police to shoot him, killing him on his front lawn, police said.\n\n\"There is a loud minority in this country which for whatever their reasons, distrusts, dislikes and at times vilifies police officers and what we represent, despite the inherent nobility at the core of this profession,\" said Sapp, who oversees Troop 2 in Glasgow.\n\nThis loud minority, however, has been challenged by what Sapp called the \"quiet majority\" — seen in the contingent of community members who have flooded Troop 2 with flowers and cards; adorned the outside of the Bear Wawa with balloons and stuffed animals; and those who filled the parking lot Monday morning to stand in solidarity with Delaware State Police.\n\nThough that group can often be drowned out by those opposed to the police, Sapp remains hopeful.\n\n\"After the last few days, I know that your voice is growing louder,\" he said, \"and your numbers are more massive than I could have ever thought possible.\"\n\nWHO HE WAS: Slain trooper's wife: He gave his life to his job\n\nRELATED: Wawa where DSP Cpl.

His family attended the outdoor memorial service, wiping tears from their eyes at the show of support from so many people who lauded the fallen trooper.\n\nJohn Sharpless, director of store operations in Delaware, tearfully recalled Ballard walking through the doors Easter morning to pick up candy. Ballard regularly stopped in at the convenience store about 2½ miles from Troop 2, where he was stationed.\n\n\"We knew him, well,\" he said. \"That's who the officers are to us.

Despite the \"false narrative\" often portrayed in cell phone videos and quick clips, Brackin stressed that most law enforcement – especially those in Delaware – are out to do the right thing.\n\nAnd when there is misconduct, police want justice, too, he said.\n\n\"Nobody takes a harsher stance on that than law enforcement themselves,\" Brackin said. \"Our job is to bring calm and control to chaotic situations.\"\n\nFred Calhoun, president of the state Fraternal Order of Police, said law enforcement have largely felt backed by the Delaware community through the years, but moments like these still rattle their community – especially when the deaths come in such a violent manner.\n\nThough police have not discussed the motive behind Ballard's killing, authorities have described a deadly scene that played out in a very public manner last Wednesday.\n\n\"It's the old adage – you don't think it's going to happen to you,\" Calhoun said. \"You don't think it's going to happen in the state of Delaware. ... It has put a lot of officers on edge and will put them on edge for the next few months, maybe even a year.\"\n\nFor citizens like Sharonda Hall, who used to regularly come to the Wawa at U.S. 40 and Salem Church Road, the shooting was a \"senseless act.\"\n\nShe came to the memorial Monday morning to pay her respects to a trooper she said did all that was asked of him.\n\n\"This is insane,\" she said, looking at the balloons grouped outside the convenience store. \"And the way it was done... it hurts.\"\n\nA Celebration of Life service is slated for 11 a.m. Friday at the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. Those wishing to pay respects to his family are invited to do so from 8:30 a.m. until 10 a.m. Uniformed emergency services personnel are invited to pay their respects from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED: Standoff ends in Middletown; suspect in Delaware trooper death killed\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONDS: Trooper's friends say Delaware lost a bright light\n\nOrganizations and businesses across the state have already begun paying tribute to the fallen trooper through fundraisers and other gestures. Students at Keene Elementary School, next to Troop 2, walked over from their classrooms Friday to deliver flowers and cards to Ballard's police cruiser parked out front.\n\n\"As 650 students from Keene Elementary School processed, flowers in hand, past Stephen's patrol vehicle, giving our uniformed personnel, high fives along the way, I thought to myself 'Wow, wow Stephen.' He's got to be smiling from ear to ear right now.\"\n\nSapp paused for a moment, glancing down at the lectern.\n\n\"Those 650 precious little souls represent 650 individual reasons why we do what we do, even when we're hurting.\"\n\nFor those unable to come to Friday's service or make a donation, Sapp said there is a much simpler way to let law enforcement know they are supported.\n\nSlowly, Sapp twisted his fingers to form the \"OK\" sign and held it above his head. Ballard was born in Oklahoma, he said, and this symbol could be flashed at first responders to let them know the community not only remembered Ballard, but appreciated the work they do.\n\nIt is a small gesture, he said, but one that will be appreciated no matter the circumstance.\n\n\"Moving forward, any time you see a first responder, whether it be in Rodney Square, on the boardwalk at Rehoboth or at the State Fair this summer, take a fleeting moment to shoot them an 'OK,' \" Sapp said. \"You may or may not get one back, depending on what they're in the midst of, but at least they'll know you have their back, and that just as importantly, that you remember Stephen's sacrifice.\"\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

The fifth annual quest began before 6 a.m. Monday and ended after 8 p.m. due to lightning – and an oil train.\n\nStill, 294 miles driven and 14 stops across all three counties produced some memories, unexpected twists and maybe even a little knowledge that may help with predicting which teams will rise to the top this fall.\n\nHere’s the recap of a long, eventful day.\n\n5:56 a.m. – I pick up News Journal video wizard Daniel Sato in the parking lot at the office in New Castle, and we’re off and running.\n\n7:03 – The bleachers from the football stadium at Lake Forest are blanketing the practice field in a cool shade. The water bottles and coolers are filled, and coach Freddie Johnson can be heard motivating his team through an open door in the locker room. At 7:24, the Spartans take the field amid cries of “Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!” from Johnson.\n\n8:04 – The Milford Buccaneers crank it up in the full sunshine at Briggs Stadium, with coach Shaun Strickland not satisfied by the jump from 1-9 to 6-4 in his first season at the helm last year. “We’ve got to push ourselves, understand the fact that the past is in the past and it’s a new season,” Strickland said. “We can’t settle for just being 6-4. We’ve got to want more from ourselves.” The return of QB William Kimmel and tall receivers Brion Murray and Marcus Correa makes another advance possible.\n\n8:38 – The Milford Wawa has everything we need for a Triple Crown pit stop – gasoline, restrooms and Gatorade.\n\n9:16 – Sussex Tech coach Mark Quillin delivers the line of the day while the Ravens are working on handoffs. “You’re not throwing a watermelon against the road,” he says. “You’re sliding it in there nice and easy.” Minutes later, as the quarterbacks are sharpening their throwing motions with short tosses, I move in to shoot video a foot behind a receiver. He promptly misses the first pass and it knocks the iPhone out of my hand, but no reporters or electronic devices are harmed.\n\n9:57 – Here’s an unofficial downstate crop report: There’s a lot of corn between Sussex Tech and Caesar Rodney, and it looks pretty good to me this year.\n\n10:43 – The Caesar Rodney Riders have more than 100 players split into seven groups. An assistant coach is barking out, “Red 88! Red 88!” to put backs in motion. Quarterbacks and receivers are working on timing routes. Defenders are working on angles while running through seven sets of stacked tires. The treads get knocked over a couple of times, but that’s what happens on the first day of practice.\n\n11:19 – We’re running a little behind schedule, and Dover’s practice is finished when we arrive. It’s a missed opportunity to talk with new Senators coach Rudy Simonetti, but we’ll catch up later.\n\n11:51 – The defending DIAA Division I champion Smyrna Eagles are already running offensive plays at a million miles per hour. These guys are so serious, practice ends with a test blast from the nearby tornado siren at exactly noon. Then coach Mike Judy graciously hangs around to provide good answers to my not-so-good questions during a Facebook Live post.\n\n12:34 p.m. – On our way back to the office, a guy driving a dump truck on Del. 1 must have thought I was falling asleep. Why else would he get right behind me and lay on the horn for nine seconds?\n\n1:09 – I drop off the talented Mr. Sato at The News Journal and go next door for a quick hoagie and Gatorade at – you guessed it – Wawa, the unofficial food and beverage supplier of the Gridiron Tour.\n\n1:23 – Here’s an update on the Del. 141 construction project: 24 years down, 71 years to go.\n\n1:42 – The practice field at Howard is only about 70 yards long, more suitable for an Arena Football League team. But that little patch of ground in downtown Wilmington produced the DIAA Division II champions last season, and it could happen again if the Wildcats can find a new quarterback and running back to perform behind a solid, experienced line. “There’s a lot of excitement around the program,” coach Dan Ritter said. “The kids are excited to be out here, even though it’s really hot. They’re working hard, and the goal has been set. You want to win as many games as possible, and then hopefully take the [Blue Hen Flight B] conference, and then go back into that tourney and maybe get another one.”\n\n2:29 – Concord coach Greg Mitchell points out several linemen who look big and imposing. I nod, then ask the important questions. Is senior linebacker Avery Roberts, who has committed to Nebraska, back and healthy? Mitchell says yes. Is Avery’s “little” brother, junior running back Grahm “Bam” Roberts, back and healthy and ready to possibly join his brother as a Division I recruit? Mitchell says yes. That’s two really good signs for the Raiders.\n\n3:15 – The players are walking to their cars as I arrive at A.I. du Pont. It’s another swing and a miss, but there’s no crying in football. We’ll try to catch up with coach Zeb Blum’s squad later, but for now there’s more touring to do.\n\n3:32 – Here’s a Division II upset alert: Tatnall could have its best team in years. The Hornets have been building slowly, from 3-7 in 2013 to 4-6 the next season to 6-4 last year. And now they have all but one starter returning and 14 seniors – a huge class of football players for a small school. Left tackle Karl Holler (6-5, 250) is a five-year starter (yep, he was starting in the eighth grade) and a possible Division I recruit.\n\n4:21 – You have to drive right past Conrad to reach Delaware Military Academy, so I consider making an unscheduled stop. I’m just about to make the turn off Boxwood Road when I see coach Bob Wolford addressing his team at the end of practice. Missed it by a couple of minutes.\n\n4:22 – But that’s OK, because DMA is working out right across Del. 4 at Richardson Park Elementary. The Seahawks finished 9-2 last season, but ended the year with a 12-7, first-round loss to Woodbridge as the No. 2 seed in the Division II playoffs. They’re still mad about it, and DMA’s roster has jumped from about 60 last year to 80 this season. “I love it,” coach Mike Ryan said. “I’m not sure if I have 80 football players yet, but I have 80 kids and we’re going to turn them into a football team, that’s for sure. It’s exciting to see so many kids want to be a part of this.”\n\n5:09 – At every stop, every coach has been preaching hydration. They’ve said it so often, even a broken down old sportswriter gets it. So I stop at an Exxon station at the corner of Del. 141 and Del. 4 for more Gatorade.\n\n5:21 – William Penn is working on special teams when I arrive. That means potential punters and kickers are sending balls in every direction, and my conversation with coach Marvin Dooley is interrupted by screams of “Heads up!” about 79 times. But we dodge the errant projectiles long enough for Dooley to tell me about some changes planned for the offense with the explosive Zach Burton moving from receiver to quarterback for his senior season. If the Colonials can sort out the lines, they may have something for Middletown, Concord and Mount Pleasant in Flight A.\n\n6:55 – It’s all about fundamentals at St. Mark’s. Quarterbacks are being schooled on their footwork, offensive linemen are learning the proper stance, and the whole team is going through a refresher course in stretching. The Spartans lost three of their best players to injury in the first two weeks last year, and went on to lose four games by five points or less in a 4-6 season. But if they can stay healthy, a Division II playoff berth wouldn’t shock anybody.\n\n7:59 – I’m only on the field for about three minutes at Caravel before lightning halts the practice. But even that is enough to see the Buccaneers should be much better than last year’s 3-6. Caravel lost only three starters from that team, and four transfers could make them even more formidable. Many see the Bucs as a Division II title contender, but a schedule loaded with four D-I opponents (Concord, Elkton, Salesianum and Cape Henlopen) could challenge the depth of a roster that usually only carries 35-40 players.\n\n8:19 – After 14½ hours of driving and reporting, the end of the tour is delayed by an oil train staggering across Del. 71. So here’s an update on oil trains: They’re still slower than my 40 time.\n\nContact Brad Myers at bmyers@delawareonline.com.

Without any industry connections, he began to make his own.\n\nSTORY: The Districts return to rattle The Queen\n\nSTORY: Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, Arctic Monkeys & The Killers lead Firefly '18\n\nSTORY: Remember when Tonya Harding boxed a mailman in Delaware?\n\nHe worked as an assistant for years, helping everyone from producers and directors with an eye on being a writer himself. It's something he was first encouraged to do by Brandywine High teachers who first saw his talent.\n\nAnd even as year by year went by with little to show for it -- both in terms of his resume and in terms of a paycheck -- he stuck with it as he struggled to pay rent at times.\n\nHe knew a dude from Delaware could make it in Hollywood. All he had to do was look at his roommate Will Fetters, also a screenwriter.\n\nWhile roommates, Fetters, a Brandywine Hundred native, wrote the 2010 film Robert Pattinson-led drama \"Remember Me.\" He has since rattled off a string of films: 2012's \"The Lucky One,\" 2014's \"The Best of Me\" and this year's heavily-anticipated remake of \"A Star Is Born,\" co-starring Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga.\n\nHayward saw Fetters' work ethic firsthand when he would leave at night to go out to have fun, leaving Fetters at the apartment writing \"Remember Me.\" As Fetters' career took off, Hayward began to buckle down and focus more on his own work.\n\n\"His story was really inspirational,\" says Hayward, 37, who needed a shot of inspiration at times. \"I would tell people I have to make this work because I'm not qualified to do anything else. I think that mentality got me through some pretty rough times.\"\n\nThese days, Hayward is as busy as Fetters.\n\nThe second season of the satirical \"Dear White People,\" which follows a group of black students facing social injustice at a predominantly white school, will surface on Netflix this spring. This time, Hayward will have a new title: executive story editor. (He penned three of the episodes in the first season.)\n\nIn addition, Friday marks the release of his first major film with a budget to match: the Charles Stone III-directed \"Step Sisters.\" (Stone, whose 2002 debut film \"Drumline\" was a hit, has Delaware connections himself, by the way. His late father Chuck Stone, a Tuskeegee Airman and the first president of the National Association of Black Journalists, taught at the University of Delaware for seven years.)\n\n\"Step Sisters\" -- think \"Bring It On\" with stepping instead of cheerleading -- tracks the black captain of a sorority step dance team (Megalyn Echikunwoke) who has to teach her inept white classmates how to step ahead of a competition. It's a broader comedy than the more socially pointed \"Dear White People.\"\n\nIt seems all of Hayward's time and effort over the past decade is finally paying off after working smaller writing jobs on programs such as NBC's \"One Big Happy\" and Nickelodeon's \"Wendell and Vinnie.\"\n\n\"I come in battle-tested already with a strong network of people I know now. When I'm in these meetings, we have different points of connection that make them a lot more receptive to me,\" he says. \"They always say it's all about who you know, but I think people misinterpret that to think it's about your parents' connections, how much money you have or what background you come from.\n\n\"But a lot of it was just through people I met and relationships that I fostered. And a lot of that came from how I was raised in Delaware.\"\n\nHayward grew up near Harlan Elementary School with his older sister Onya, raised by his father Charles, the retired former director of Delaware's Division of Child Support Enforcement, and his mother Saundra, a speech pathologist.\n\nSince he was never good at sports, he was class president for all four years at Brandywine as an extracurricular activity. And while he did try acting, performing in school plays such as Woody Allen's \"Don't Drink the Water,\" he found the experience terrifying.\n\n\"I generally retreat from the public and I was much more comfortable writing than on stage,\" he says.\n\nInstead, he leaned toward work he was doing in English class, focusing on writing, reading and language -- all while being encouraged by a team of teachers who saw something in him.\n\n\"They really appreciated that I liked learning about language and literature,\" Hayward says. \"I was lucky in a lot of regards because everyone at Brandywine looked out for me. I still keep in contact with some of them to this day.\"\n\nWhile in Hollywood, Fetters isn't the only Delawarean he's spotted. He bumped into actress and Wilmington native Aubrey Plaza in a restaurant once and lost it a little: \"I think I scared her a little bit, I was so excited.\"\n\nBut it's that shared Delaware upbringing that Hayward repeatedly points to as secret for his years-in-the-waiting success.\n\n\"We were raised to treat everyone with respect and kindness and that goes a really long way in a town where most people don't behave that way,\" he says, recalling his visit home to Delaware for the holidays. \"I went into Wawa and a 7-year-old held the door for me. Oh my God -- that would never happen in Los Angeles. It made me smile and think, 'That's what has helped me be successful.'\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

For this to have happened to her is not right,\" Henry said. \"I'm going to miss her.\"\n\nWhile authorities will not release an official cause of death, a determination that will be made by the division of the forensic examiner, Henry said the 49-year-old was diabetic and living out of her car during the coldest days of the year.\n\nState police don't suspect foul play and did not confirm the woman's name, as per their policy on deaths which are not violent or suspicious. Other authorities have confirmed Stribling was the one found in the SUV.\n\nMore:For Delaware's homeless, New Year brings extreme cold, threat of hypothermia\n\nThe Explorer had been Stribling's home since June, the month she returned to Delaware from Arizona, Henry said. Stribling had lost her job as a DART bus driver and left the state, but Henry said those plans didn't last so she came back.\n\nStribling stayed with friends when she could, Henry said, and when she couldn't, lived in gas station parking lots while she searched for work and a permanent place to stay.\n\nFor the week before Christmas, Stribling stayed with Henry and her husband.\n\n\"All she talked about was getting back on her feet. She said, 'Ms. Victoria, all I want to do is get back on my feet and get my daughter back and get back where I was, just live like I was living before,'\" Henry said.\n\nThere are at least 1,015 people without homes in Delaware, according to a January count by the Delaware Continuum of Care which tracks homelessness.

The average length of time those people experience homelessness is about three months, according to the report.\n\n\"The longer someone is homeless the more likely they are to have deteriorating mental and/or physical health, aggravated substance abuse problems, or the loss of familial or other community supports,\" the report showed.\n\nStribling had picked up seasonal work with UPS but had to give up the job because of a medical condition, Henry said. Living without income was what kept her from settling into a home like she had before losing her DART job.\n\nAfter Stribling left Henry's house, the women stayed in touch mostly through text messages. Henry invited her friend to Christmas dinner, but her Explorer never appeared in the driveway. Henry assumed she'd found a place to stay.\n\n\"I would text her, and she would say, 'It's cold.

News Journal\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. — Delaware State Police Cpl. Stephen J. Ballard tried to run from a gunman who had already shot him Wednesday when he fell to the ground in a convenience store parking lot in Bear, Del.\n\nThe man followed him and shot him repeatedly at close range, said state police Col. Nathaniel McQueen Jr. at a press conference Thursday afternoon.\n\nBallard, who approached the suspicious vehicle while on duty and in full uniform, later died from his injuries at Christiana Hospital, McQueen said.\n\n\"The acts of Stephen yesterday exemplified the dedication that he brought to the citizens of Delaware on a daily basis,\" McQueen said.\n\nMcQueen declined to comment on whether 32-year-old Ballard was targeted or on a suspected motive in the shooting, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\nPolice confirmed that the man who killed Ballard was 26-year-old Burgon Sealy Jr., who lived in the Middletown-area home where he barricaded himself for nearly 21 hours after the shooting. McQueen said Sealy contacted family members after the shooting Wednesday and told them he had shot a trooper at the Wawa. They then contacted police.\n\nRelated:\n\nTrooper killed at gas station; suspect barricaded in home\n\nAriz. man who saved trooper says reaction was 'visceral'\n\nA second man who was in the driver's seat of the vehicle when Sealy began shooting also was taken into custody at the gas station, McQueen said. He was released and not considered a suspect in the investigation.\n\nSealy then took off from Wawa in his own vehicle Wednesday and drove to the family's home in the Brick Mill Farm development north of Middletown, about 16 miles from Bear, where he continued to fire at police through the night. Sealy was \"well-armed and heavily equipped,\" McQueen said, though he would not comment on the type of weapons the man had in the home.\n\nEarlier, officers heard gunshots inside and lost contact with him, McQueen said. When he came out of the home armed with a weapon around 9 a.m. ET Thursday, he was shot by law enforcement and died outside his home.\n\nThe Brick Mill Farm development was evacuated Wednesday when Sealy sought refuge in his home and police kept it closed to the public until about 11 a.m. Thursday. Investigators remained at the home where Sealy holed up long after the fatal shooting, with four armored vehicles parked both on the lawn of the home and on the street.\n\nSiding torn from the house remained on the grass outside, and a section of a second-story back room was missing. The garage door also appeared to have been torn open.\n\nState police used explosive devices throughout the standoff to open the front door and windows. A large armored front-end loader called \"The Rook,\" or a Critical Incident Vehicle, also was driven into the neighborhood Thursday morning, courtesy of the Pennsylvania State Police, to help approach the home. Glass panels showed damage where bullets had struck the vehicle.\n\n\"This is one of those situations where you had someone who made the conscious decision to shoot an officer, to assassinate an officer,\" said Lt. Thomas Brackin, president of the Delaware State Troopers Association. \"He had the mindset he was going to kill that officer.\"\n\nThe last state trooper killed in the line of duty was Cpl. Michael Shea, who was killed when a drunken driver hit him in 2004.\n\nHundreds of police officers remained at the scene of the shooting north of Middletown, with police vehicles lining nearly every roadway leading to the home. Helicopters took off and landed from a large green circular park in the middle of the development, picking up officers and dropping others off.\n\nNumerous agencies, including the FBI, county and Wilmington police, were among those responding to the barricade.\n\nIn 2013, Sealy was charged northeast of Orlando for possession of a small amount of marijuana and possession of a concealed weapon, according to Volusia County (Fla.) Corrections. He presented a Delaware driver's license when stopped.\n\nPolice would not comment on Sealy's criminal history but said it remains under investigation as part of the fatal shooting. McQueen would not elaborate on why Sealy was at the Wawa other than to say Ballard deemed the vehicle suspicious and made contact with the two men inside the parked car.\n\nThe \"suspicious vehicle\" stop wasn't uncommon for Ballard, an eight-year veteran on the force whom fellow troopers described as an exemplary police officer dedicated to making the community better. Capt. J. Sapp, who oversaw Ballard in his role as a patrolman out of Troop 2 in Glasgow, said just two weeks ago Ballard was lauded for his work with DUI enforcement and set to become even more involved in other special policing projects.\n\nHis active tact toward policing made him a good state trooper and an even better person to work alongside, he said.\n\n\"You know, you hear about that person with the proverbial smile that just lights up the room,\" Sapp said. \"That was Steve.\"\n\nBallard was also a family man who dearly loved his wife and 5-year-old stepdaughter, Abigail, according to Trooper Chris Martin, Ballard's shiftmate for the past year and a half.\n\n\"His family was first and foremost,\" Martin said. \"And he took care of them. Now, they're ours to take care of.\"\n\nIt's a role the state and fellow troopers don't take lightly. On Thursday, state police established a memorial fund at the Delaware State Police Federal Credit Union in the name of Cpl. Ballard. All proceeds will be given to his family. Checks can be made out to the DSTA-Stephen Ballard Memorial Fund, P.O. Box 168, Cheswold, DE 19936.\n\n\"We owe Cpl. Ballard and all these officers who serve on our behalf an enormous debt of gratitude,\" Carney said at a press conference. \"Right now, as we're gathered here, law enforcement officers are working across this state, putting themselves at risk to protect the rest of us as they do every single day. We should always be mindful and appreciative of their presence.\"\n\nTheir presence was felt even more by the neighbors and residents of Brick Mill Farm, who received pounding knocks and flashing police lights as signs to evacuate their community. Many were forced to spend Wednesday night in local hotels or with friends because of the barricade.\n\nThose returning home shortly after 11 a.m. Thursday were met with scores of police still on the scene. Many grabbed their dogs and headed to the park where hours before, police landed helicopters.\n\n\"It was absolutely terrifying,\" said Linda Pavina, who lives on Ingram Court in the Brick Mill Farm community.\n\nShe was home Wednesday when police officers arrived on her doorstep and told her to leave immediately.\n\nPavina left her dog inside the house, along with her medication, in a rush to get out and go to her sister's home in Middletown where she stayed the night.\n\n\"I don't think anyone expects this anywhere, no matter what kind of neighborhood you live in,\" she said.\n\nKatie Satta and her friends had a different experience, spending the night trapped inside their home during the barricade.\n\n\"I thought it was construction,\" Satta said at hearing rounds of shots Wednesday afternoon. \"It's a really quiet neighborhood. Nothing ever happens.\"\n\nSatta said she, her friends and family stood by windows to see what was going on. From her home's top floor windows, she could see the barricaded house.\n\nThey all ended up spending the night in her house after Satta's father decided no one was going to leave the house. Satta's mother ended up stuck in a nearby parking lot unable to enter the neighborhood.\n\n\"We were scared,\" she said. \"I just concerned about my mom because I know she had been at work all day.\"\n\nShe wasn't alone in the parking lot of the Dove Run Shopping Center though, as dozens of people waited for news that they could return to their homes. Brick Mill Road remained closed until daybreak when Brick Mill Elementary resumed classes and buses needed to get through.\n\nPolice regularly circled through the parking lot, picking up boxes of coffee provided to them by Rishen Patel, owner of Manhattan Bagel. Patel, who was in the Dove Run parking lot early Thursday. The owner said he was happy to help officers.\n\n\"Police take care of us a lot so when something like this happens, I think we should all take care of them, too,\" he said, adding that he provided the officers with bagels, too.\n\nIt's these small gestures that troopers and other law enforcement will cling to in the coming days and weeks, said Brackin, as news of Ballard's death continues to ripple through the First State and the country. In Legislative Hall Thursday, lawmakers proposed a bill that would include law enforcement, firefighters and emergency personnel as protected classes under hate crimes.\n\nFor the second day in a row, the state House and Senate paused in a moment of silence for the slain officer.\n\n\"This is such a horrendous day and a horrendous time in our state,\" Senate Minority Leader Margaret Rose Henry, D-Wilmington East, said from the Senate floor.\n\nBrackin is hopeful that the community will rally behind the people protecting them on a daily basis despite the negative rhetoric surrounding policing.\n\nIt's needed now more than ever, he said.\n\n\"This really brings it home,\" Brackin said. \"This is what we dread, but it's also the job we deal with day in and day out. ... And it's done by human beings.\"\n\nContributing: Xerxes Wilson and Karl Baker, The (Wilmington, Del.) News Journal.

Ballard joined the Delaware State Police after graduating from the academy in April 2009.\n\nBallard was recognized in 2011 for his involvement with Troop 4's Explorer Post, which works with young men and women grades 9 and above who have an interest in law enforcement, according to state police.\n\nHe was also photographed at Law Enforcement Family and Friends Day in 2014 at Camp Barnes in Ocean View, according to the Cape Gazette.\n\nOther officers killed in the line of duty\n\nLt. Steven Floyd, a Delaware Department of Correction officer, was the most recent law enforcement officer to die in the line of duty. He was killed during the violent uprising at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna in February.\n\nSince 2000, four other law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty in Delaware, according to Officer Down Memorial Page Inc., a non-profit organization dedicated to honoring America's fallen law enforcement heroes:\n\n• Lt. Joseph Lawrence Szczerba, of the New Castle County Police, who died Sept. 16, 2011.\n\n• Patrolman Chad Ernest Spicer, of the Georgetown Police Department, who died Sept. 1, 2009.\n\n• Cpl. Christopher Michael Shea, of the Delaware State Police, who died July 18, 2004.\n\n• Cpl. Frances Marie Collender, of the Delaware State Police, who died Feb. 6, 2001.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/04/27/harrowing-night-middletown-neighborhood/100982506/", "title": "A harrowing night in Middletown-area neighborhood", "text": "Esteban Parra, and Brittany Horn\n\nThe News Journal\n\nAshley Pennypacker and Brie Utz were expecting to get their nails done Wednesday afternoon when they arrived at the Brick Mill Farm home of their friend Katie Satta.\n\nBut instead of readying for their upcoming St. Georges Technical High School prom, the 18-year-olds spent the night listening to gunfire, helicopters and bullhorns from police trying to coax Burgon Sealy Jr. out of his family's Middletown-area house on St. Michaels Drive where he barricaded himself for nearly 21 hours.\n\n\"We get to her house, and then all of a sudden we hear rounds of gunfire going off. We're like, 'This is serious,'\" Pennypacker said. \"Rounds, like pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.\"\n\nAt the urging of Satta's father, Pennypacker and her friends spent the night locked inside the home, occasionally sleeping, sometimes peering out the window but also scouring the news for any information they could on the overnight events going on about a half-mile from their safe haven.\n\nThe sounds they heard and questions they had were similar to that of others who spent the night locked in the upscale development's single-family homes as a showdown between Sealy and law enforcement played out until about 9:15 a.m. Thursday when the 26-year-old man walked out of his family's home and was shot dead after he \"engaged police.\"\n\nRELATED: Trooper's friends say Delaware lost a bright light\n\nPolice attempted to evacuate all residents from their Brick Mill Farm homes when Sealy returned to his family's two-story house early Wednesday afternoon – shortly after fatally shooting Delaware State Police Cpl. Stephen J. Ballard in a Bear Wawa parking lot. But some residents were trapped in the development, spending the night alone, separated from spouses, parents or children who were unable to return.\n\n\"My kids can't get in and my parents, who are visiting from out of state, can't get in,\" said Lisa Robinson, who looked after her next-door neighbor's daughter through the night. Robinson said their parents, who'd arrived from Massachusetts on Wednesday, picked up her children from school and they spent the night in a hotel.\n\n\"I was happy because I knew they were OK,\" she said of her children. \"But [my parents] have to leave tomorrow for a wedding in North Carolina.\"\n\nRobinson said she couldn't sleep and instead stayed in touch with her neighbor Susan Drejka via Facebook. Drejka, whose husband was not permitted to return home, spent the night alone with her 6-year-old Boston terrier, Tori. The dog has an anxiety problem and was shaking \"like a leaf\" every time they heard blasts coming from where Sealy was barricaded.\n\nAfter the initial round of shootings toward the start of the standoff, Drejka said there was somewhat of a lull. But then between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m., \"things went went wild,\" she said.\n\n\"I could hear them on the bullhorn, and then they would flash-bomb him or something,\" she said. \"They would do that about five at a time, then take a break and do two more.\n\n\"Then we would hear gunshots.\"\n\nRELATED: Standoff ends in Middletown; suspect in Delaware trooper death killed\n\nRELATED: Delaware trooper killed at Bear Wawa\n\nWhile nervous, Drejka said she wasn't scared because she was pretty sure police were not going to allow Sealy to squeeze out.\n\nSealy, who police said was well-armed, barricaded himself in the home and fired at police through the night.\n\n\"I don't want to see anybody die,\" Drejka said. \"I would never wish that upon anybody, but I think this is the best thing for him because he did a horrific thing. In my book, it's the worst thing that anybody can do.\"\n\nSeveral residents who were evacuated Wednesday spent the night in the parking lot of the nearby Dove Run Shopping Center – a little more than a mile from where Sealy was holed up. Many waited for news of when they could return home.\n\n\"No sleep,\" said Joe Cobb, who spent the night in his Chevrolet Tahoe, listening to the radio and reading news.\n\nCobb, whose SUV was filled with plants he purchased Wednesday at Lowe's, said his family spent the night in a Dover hotel – the nearest place he could find for them. But he couldn't sleep there because his Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine was at his home. So he decided to stay in the shopping center parking lot.\n\n\"The whole community is pretty quiet,\" he said about his development. \"Who would have thought this would have happened?\"\n\nJohn Lemen was walking his dog Thursday after being unable to return home the day before.\n\nLemen said he was returning home from his physical therapy job in Bear, just down the road from where the shooting of the trooper occurred. He said he passed police cars flying to the Wawa and unknowingly wondered what caused the alert.\n\nHe never thought the police cars down in his neighborhood were related until he saw the news, he said.\n\n\"I thought, death is following me,\" he said. \"I don't think anyone expects this.\"\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.
