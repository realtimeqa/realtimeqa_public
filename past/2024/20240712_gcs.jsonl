Instead, the region was won by the Republicans, after left-wing candidates withdrew from the race.\n\nThe last regional elections were held in 2015, a year before Macron founded LREM. But despite his high hopes when voters went to the polls yesterday, LREM also “obtained none of France’s 13 metropolitan councils, in a further sign of its failure to put down local roots”, says The Times.\n\nBy contrast, the Republicans and the Socialist Party “both received surprise boosts in polls that favoured the incumbents but drew a meagre turnout of under 35%”, the BBC reports.\n\nAccording to exit polls, Macron’s party polled at just 7% nationwide - a result that experts believe “could shift the balance between political heavyweights vying for a position in the 2022 presidential race”, Deutsche Welle (DW) reports.\n\nLe Pen’s party also got a relatively disappointing 20% of the vote, while the candidates of mainstream conservative parties retained their seats in all regions.\n\nThe “mainstream Right” won 38.1% of ballots nationally, “giving its candidates a boost before the presidential vote in April 2022”, says The Telegraph. Left-leaning and green parties also surpassed expectations, with 34.8% of the vote.\n\nLe Pen yesterday accused rival parties of forming “unnatural alliances” to block RN from power, telling her supporters that they “did all they could to keep us out and prevent us from showing the French our capacity to lead a regional administration”.\n\nMeanwhile, Stanislas Guerini, an MP in Macron’s governing LREM, said that while he “rejoiced” in Le Pen’s inability to win a foothold, the LREM also had “work to do” ahead of the presidential election.\n\nMarching on\n\nThe Hauts-de-France region, near Calais in the north, was also earmarked as a potential gain for Le Pen’s RN, but was won instead by incumbent conservative Xavier Bertrand. After polls closed, he told supporters: “The far-right has been stopped in its tracks and we have pushed it back sharply.”\n\nBertrand is now emerging “as the conservatives’ favourite in opinion polls to become the party's face in the presidential election”, DW reports.\n\nAs well as quashing Le Pen’s hopes of victory in Hauts-de-France, “Macron’s aides see Bertrand as a threat to the president’s centre-right voter base”, according to the broadcaster.\n\nThe results have also raised “questions over the accuracy of polls predicting that next year’s presidential election will be a repeat of 2017”, says The Time. Indeed, the outcome signals “a renaissance for regional politicians once dismissed by Macron as belonging to an ‘old world’ on the verge of extinction”.\n\nThe paper’s Paris correspondent Charles Bremner attributes the “thrashing” taken by the president’s party in Sunday’s vote to “the failure of La Republique en Marche to establish itself beyond its existence as a Macron vehicle”.\n\nBut “it is premature to see the emergence of Bertrand, a down-to-earth one-time insurance executive, as Macron’s main threat”, adds Bremner, who notes that the Republicans are still “squabbling over who should run” while the LREM boss has plenty of time to “recalibrate and broaden his appeal”.\n\nFor Le Pen, the key problem is that while she has “succeeded in pushing political debates to the right”, she has repeatedly “failed to deliver results at the polls”, says The Telegraph.\n\nPicking up one region would have been a “been a first and a boost for her presidential bid”, says BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield. But her “voters stayed away from the polls” in a “big disappointment for the hard-right”.\n\nOn the other hand, the low turnout across the board may further complicate the picture ahead of the presidential vote. Despite “appeals by politicians and the prime minister, Jean Castex, for voters to turn out”, almost two-thirds “shunned the polling stations”, The Guardian reports.\n\nPolitical analysts argue that the likely reason for “the lack of interest in the regional elections” is that the French electorate has “become focused on the presidential election”, says the paper.

Final results are expected later Monday, but it’s expected to take weeks for a new government to be formed.\n\nMeloni entered Italy’s crowded political scene in 2006 and co-founded the Brothers of Italy in 2012, a party whose agenda is rooted in Euroskepticism and anti-immigration policies.\n\nLeader of Brothers of Italy Giorgia Meloni casts her vote in Rome on Sunday, September 25, 2022. Yara Nardi/Reuters\n\nIn the last election in 2018, the party won just 4.5% of the vote, but its popularity has soared in recent years, underscoring Italy’s longstanding rejection of mainstream politics, seen most recently with the country’s support of anti-establishment parties such as the Five Star Movement and Salvini’s League.\n\nCelebrating the early results on Sunday evening, Salvini said on Twitter, “Center-right in clear advantage both in the House and in the Senate! It will be a long night, but already now I want to say THANK YOU.”\n\nMeloni differs from her coalition partner leaders on the issue of Ukraine. Whereas Berlusconi and Salvini have both said they would like to review sanctions against Russia because of their impact on the Italian economy, Meloni has been steadfast in her support for defending Ukraine.\n\nA 45-year-old mother from Rome, Meloni is deeply conservative, openly anti-LBGT, and has threatened to place same-sex unions, which were legalized in Italy in 2016, under review. She has also called abortion a “tragedy,” raising fears for the future of women’s rights in the country.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Ultra-conservative likely to become Italy's first female prime minister 02:57 - Source: CNN\n\n‘A sad evening’\n\nThe preliminary results showed the center-left coalition, led by the left-wing Democratic Party and centrist party +Europe had won around 22% of the vote, while former prime minister Giuseppe Conte’s bid to revive the Five Star Movement appeared to have been unsuccessful, with around 15%.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Conte promised to lead an “uncompromising opposition.”\n\n“We will be the outpost for the progressive agenda against inequalities, to protect families and businesses in difficulty, to defend the rights and values of our Constitution.”\n\nDebora Serracchiani of the Democratic Party also conceded defeat early Monday morning, calling the results a “sad evening for the country.”\n\n“Undoubtedly we cannot, in light of the data seen so far, not attribute the victory to the right dragged by Giorgia Meloni. It is a sad evening for the country,” Serracchiani told reporters.\n\nSunday’s snap national election was triggered by party infighting that saw the collapse of Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s government in July.\n\nVoters headed to the polls amid a number of new regulations, with voting hours also contained to one day rather than two.\n\nOther changes included a younger voting age for the Senate and a reduction in the number of seats to elect – down from 685 seats to 400 in the Senate and from 315 to 200 in the lower House of Parliament. That parliament is scheduled to meet on October 13, at which point the head of state will call on party leaders to decide on the shape of the new government.\n\nThe buildup to the election was dominated by hot-button issues including Italy’s cost-of-living crisis, a 209 billion euro ($200 billion) package from the European Covid-19 recovery fund and the country’s support for Ukraine.\n\nThe incoming prime minister – the sixth in just eight years – will be tasked with tackling a number of challenges, with soaring energy costs and economic uncertainty among the country’s most pressing.\n\nAnd while Meloni is slated to make history as Italy’s first female prime minister, her politics do not mean that she is necessarily interested in advancing women’s rights.\n\nEmiliana De Blasio, adviser for diversity and inclusion at LUISS University in Rome, told CNN Meloni is “not raising up at all questions on women’s rights and empowerment in general.”\n\nThe Italian results come as other far-right parties in other European countries have marked recent gains. That includes Sweden’s anti-immigration party, Sweden Democrats – a party with neo-Nazi roots – which is expected to play a major role in the new government after winning the second largest share of seats at a general election earlier this month.\n\nAnd in France, while far-right ideologue Marine Le Pen lost the French presidential election to Emmanuel Macron in April, her share of the popular vote shifted France’s political center dramatically to the right.\n\nAlthough Macron and Meloni ideologically diverge, the French president said Monday that France respects Italy’s decision to elect a government headed by Meloni.\n\nSince former German Chancellor Angela Merkel stepped down in December, Macron has increasingly emerged as the top EU leader – a position that would put him at odds with the Euroskepticism expressed by the Brothers of Italy.\n\n“The Italian people have made a democratic and sovereign choice. We respect it,” Macron said, according to the Elysee Palace.\n\n“As a neighbor and friend, we must continue to work together. It’s as Europeans that we will succeed in overcoming our joint challenges,” he added.\n\nIn a social media post early Monday, Meloni dedicated her projected win to “all the militants, managers, supporters and every single person who – in these years – has contributed to the realization of our dream, offering soul and heart spontaneously and selflessly.”\n\nShe added: “We won’t betray your trust. We are ready to lift Italy up.”", "authors": ["Kara Fox Barbie Latza Nadeau Antonia Mortensen Nicola Ruotolo Sharon Braithwaite Valentina Didonato", "Kara Fox", "Barbie Latza Nadeau", "Antonia Mortensen", "Nicola Ruotolo", "Sharon Braithwaite", "Valentina Didonato"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/04/23/marine-le-pen-vision-france-far-right-vision/7422392001/", "title": "Marine Le Pen's vision for France: Retooling with a far-right vision", "text": "Elaine Ganley\n\nAssociated Press\n\nPARIS — No more Muslim headscarves in public. All schoolchildren in uniforms. Laws proposed and passed by referendum. Generous social services unavailable to foreigners unless they've held a job for five years.\n\nThat's just a sampling of Marine Le Pen's vision for France if the far-right leader wins Sunday's presidential runoff election against incumbent Emmanuel Macron. In all things, France, and the French, would come first.\n\nPolls portray Macron as the front-runner in Sunday's vote, but a Le Pen win is possible — an outcome that could rock France’s system of governance, strike fear among its immigrants and Muslims, jolt the dynamics of the 27-nation European Union, and unnerve NATO allies.\n\nMacron, 44, a centrist who is ardently pro-EU, has relentlessly blasted his adversary as a danger and framed their election showdown as an ideological battle for the soul of the nation. Le Pen, 53, views Macron as a progressive technocrat for whom France is just a \"region\" of the EU.\n\nMore:Emmanuel Macron, Marine Le Pen fight for French presidency\n\nMore:French vote in first round of presidential election; Macron faces pressure from right\n\nShe says she would retool the country's political system and the French Constitution to accommodate her populist agenda, putting the EU into second place and making France truer to its bedrock principles.\n\n\"I intend to be the president who gives the people back their voices in their own country,\" Le Pen said.\n\nCritics fear a threat to democracy under Le Pen, a nationalist who is cozy with Hungary’s autocratic prime minister, Viktor Orban, and anti-immigrant far-right parties elsewhere in Europe. Le Pen met with Russian President Vladimir Putin before the 2017 French presidential vote that she lost to Macron in a landslide.\n\nThe United States has long considered France its oldest ally, but a Le Pen presidency could pose a problem for the Biden administration by undermining trans-Atlantic unity over sanctions against Russia and by bolstering autocratic populists elsewhere in Europe.\n\nThe National Rally leader also is wary of free-trade deals and would seek a more independent stance for France in the United Nations and other multilateral bodies.\n\nIn a column Thursday in several European newspapers, the center-left leaders of Germany, Spain and Portugal all backed Macron, raising a warning about \"populists and the extreme right\" who hold Putin \"as an ideological and political model, replicating his chauvinist ideas.\"\n\n\"They have echoed his attacks on minorities and diversity and his goal of nationalist uniformity,\" wrote German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa.\n\nLe Pen's meeting five years ago with Putin has haunted her campaign amid Russia's war in Ukraine, even though she has condemned the Russian invasion \"without ambiguity.\"\n\nBut if she were president, Le Pen said she would think twice about supplying Ukraine with weapons and would oppose energy sanctions against Moscow — for the sake of French pocketbooks and for the Russian people.\n\nShe also said she would pull France out of NATO's military command, weakening the Western military alliance's united front against Moscow, and that there should be a \"strategic rapprochement\" with Russia once the war is over, echoing the past position of Macron, who has tried his own outreach with Putin.\n\nStill, his government says it has sent more than $108 million in weapons to Ukraine since the war started, and France has been central to the West's ever-tougher sanctions against Russia.\n\nLe Pen has projected a nurturing image throughout her campaign, saying she would oversee France as \"the mother of the family.\" She has focused on the purchasing power of consumers while standing firm on emblematic issues that define the far right, such as immigration, security, national identity and sovereignty.\n\nTo soften the blow of rising prices, Le Pen wants to slash taxes on energy bills from 20% to 5.5%. She promises to put $162-$216 per month back in consumers' pockets.\n\nMacron, a former French economy minister and banker, considers such measures misdirected and economically unviable.\n\nLe Pen insists her agenda addresses the \"France of the forgotten\" that he has ignored. She has proposed a \"referendum revolution\" as the centerpiece of her plan to help heal the \"democratic fracture\" that she says accounts for low turnout in recent French elections and growing social discord.\n\nLaws could be passed by referendum — bypassing elected lawmakers - after supporters gather the signatures of 500,000 eligible voters, That was a demand of the sometimes violent \"yellow vest\" movement that challenged Macron’s presidency two years ago.\n\n\"During my mandate, I count on consulting the only expert that Emmanuel Macron never consulted — the people,\" Le Pen said this month.\n\nBut there's a hitch.\n\nThe French Constitution would need to be revised to give citizens such a direct voice in lawmaking. It would also need changing for another key Le Pen goal: giving a \"national preference\" for state housing and job benefits to French citizens before foreigners.\n\nMacron failed in his own bid to change the constitution, a complicated process requiring support from both houses of parliament. Le Pen wants to skirt that by using a special article in the constitution like Gen. Charles de Gaulle did in 1962 to allow for direct universal suffrage.\n\n\"She wants to dynamite liberal democracy by calling on the people,\" four constitutional law professors wrote in the newspaper Le Monde.\n\nLe Pen would use a referendum for other items in a controversial package to stop \"uncontrolled immigration.\" These include treating any asylum demands abroad, not in France, and \"systematically\" expelling migrants without residency papers, among others; and ending automatic citizenship for those born in France to foreign parents.\n\nShe would also reinstate uniforms in all schools, and fortify police powers.\n\nLe Pen has called Muslim headscarves \"Islamist uniforms\" and proposed a ban on wearing them in public. Macron said in a debate Wednesday night that such a ban could lead to \"civil war\" in the country that has Western Europe’s largest Muslim population.\n\nBut it was an elderly woman in a blue-and-white headscarf confronting Le Pen last week in the southern town of Pertuis who may have put a dent in her plan.\n\n\"What is the headscarf doing in politics?\" she asked Le Pen.\n\nAfter the pushback by the woman, Le Pen party officials moved into damage control, saying that banning headscarves in streets would be progressive and not target a \"grandmother of 70.\"\n\nLe Pen, nevertheless, said Friday on Europe 1 radio that \"their role of grandmother is to protect their little granddaughters, and I ask them to help me.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/23"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/961341/can-labour-win-over-scotland", "title": "Can Labour win over Scotland? | The Week", "text": "Keir Starmer will be buoyed by Labour's commanding lead in Scottish opinion polls as he launches his general election campaign in the country today.\n\nLabour was on 39% in the latest YouGov poll , a 5% increase since April and 10 points ahead of the Scottish National Party (SNP).\n\nIn an article in the Daily Record following Rishi Sunak's shock July election announcement , Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the vote was a \"chance to give Scotland a real voice\" in Westminster.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Analysis of the latest public opinion surveys suggests that Labour could expect to return about 30 MPs in Scotland, with the SNP reduced to fewer than 20.\n\nA poll for The Sunday Times last June forecast \"a seismic reversal of fortunes\" that would see Labour \"end a decade of electoral mediocrity north of the border\" at the next general election, the paper said. Should that play out, the SNP would “likely be cast into turmoil”, with Labour “cannibalising” most of its new votes from the nationalists.\n\nBut Labour supporters “would be wise to insert a degree of caution into their analysis”, said Euan McColm in The Spectator in response to that poll. Sarwar \"still faces the challenge of persuading Scottish voters that he is very much his own man and not merely a branch manager\".\n\nYet that was before \"turmoil\" consumed the SNP, said The Guardian . The party was left \"close to being broke\" by Humza Yousaf's \"botched firing of the Scottish Greens\", policy \"failures\", and the arrest of Nicola Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell, who was subsequently charged with embezzlement of party funds. By contrast, Scottish Labour is \"better funded than ever\".\n\nThe question that will now \"dominate\" the election campaign is whether First Minister John Swinney can \"save the SNP from being badly defeated\".\n\nWhat next?\n\nSarwar said last summer that his party was \"not complacent\", despite its lead in the polls. And things are \"a lot tighter\" when it comes to voting intention polls regarding the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood, said The National . Predictions from pollster Professor John Curtice put Labour on course to win 35% of constituency votes for the Scottish Parliament, with SNP close behind on 34%.\n\nThe election's timing is \"not ideal\" for the SNP, said Diffley, given Swinney has had such little time to \"set out his platform\". But there is \"some comfort\" for the party in his approval ratings. A poll in The Times this week found that 35% of voters gave Swinney \"the thumbs-up\". Although that is \"not a return to the heady days of ratings\" under Sturgeon and Alex Salmond, it put Swinney ahead of Sarwar, who was on 26%.\n\nStarmer has \"already taken aim\" at both the SNP and the Conservatives, said The National , describing Scotland as the \"beating heart\" of his ambitions for the UK. \"There is no change without Scotland, because there is no Labour without Scotland,\" he said at a campaign event in Glasgow today.\n\nClearly, a \"competitive election awaits\", said Diffley.

And let’s not forget players such as Erling Haaland, who failed to qualify for the tournament with Norway, but who promises to challenge Mbappé for accolades.\n\nBut, with this being Messi’s final World Cup, former France international and current Bordeaux coach Rio Mavuba says this tournament has seen the baton of greatness passed onto Mbappé.\n\n“In this World Cup, it’s been the transfer of power from Messi to Mbappé,” he told CNN, ahead of the pair’s showdown in the World Cup final on Sunday.\n\n“Messi is still one of the greatest, maybe the best player of all time, but, at this point, Mbappé can eat at the same table as Messi.\n\n“When he’s focused, he’s probably the best player in the world.”\n\nMessi and Mbappé both play for French club Paris-Saint Germain. GABRIEL BOUYS/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMavuba made 13 appearances for France and was included in Didier Deschamps’ squad for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\n\nHe’s watched from afar as a young Mbappé has matured quickly into France’s most important player and says the attacker’s pace and finishing prowess makes him “unstoppable” at times.\n\nMbappé was born and raised in Bondy, a suburb of Paris 11 kilometers from the city center and, aside from a two-year spell playing for Monaco, has lived in the French capital his entire life.\n\nHis spell at Monaco, where he won his first league title, caught the world’s attention and the teenage sensation moved to PSG in 2017, initially on loan for the first year.\n\nThe deal was reported to be worth $214 million but Mbappé seemed to take it all in his stride.\n\nDespite all the trophies he’s won and goals he’s scored, Mavuba says the forward is only now coming into his prime.\n\n“For sure, he’s got a lot of speed but I think the best skill is he can do a lot of things. He can run fast, he can dribble, he can score, this is why it’s very difficult to catch him,” he said.\n\n‘He’s been gifted’\n\nWhile Mbappé’s physical attributes are undeniable, it’s his ability to cope with such intense pressure that separates him from the others, according to former Paris Saint-Germain captain Didier Domi.\n\nDomi, who played over 100 games for PSG and who now works for the club’s academy in Qatar, says Mbappé holds the weight of a nation on his shoulders but it seems his value reaches beyond just his performances on the pitch, and into the political arena.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron intervened earlier this year to implore the young star to stay at PSG amid a transfer saga involving Spanish giant Real Madrid.\n\nBut despite all the pressure that comes both on and off the field, Mbappé continues to produce the goods.\n\n“His game is so unbelievable but the way he lifts the team, this is what has impressed me the most, mentally,” Domi told CNN.\n\n“We know his qualities with his feet but mentally he’s staying in that zone, as a leader, always being crucial for the team. It’s impressive.\n\n“He’s got a talent, of course, but he’s got a talent in his head as well. He controls his nerves and that’s part of the game.\n\n“It’s unbelievable, he doesn’t feel pressure. He’s been gifted.”\n\nMbappé has torn defenses apart with his pace at Qatar 2022. Francois Nel/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nWhile Mbappé has likely over a decade left to play at the top level, Qatar 2022 also marks the end of arguably the greatest rivalry in football history – with it being the last time we see Ronaldo and Messi play at a World Cup.\n\nBut as that chapter closes, Mbappé has the chance to take center stage.\n\n“He [Mbappé] will be the legacy of Messi and Ronaldo, maybe he’s already the best player in the world,” Domi added.\n\n“He doesn’t have the vision of Messi but, at his best, Mbappé is the best player in the world. He can make a difference at every moment.”\n\nBetter than Zidane?\n\nMbappé has scored five goals in Qatar – level as top goalscorer with Messi – bringing his World Cup total to nine from just two tournaments.\n\nJust Fontaine is the only Frenchman to score more World Cup goals – netting all 13 of his efforts in 1958.\n\nMore importantly, Mbappé is on the verge of winning his second successive World Cup, something that would make him potentially the greatest French player in history, according to Mavuba.\n\n“If he won the second World Cup, he’d probably be the best French player,” Mavuba said.\n\n“I love [Zinedine] Zidane but imagine, 23 years old, two World Cups, he’d be the best.”\n\nLionel Messi holds up the World Cup trophy after Argentina defeated France in the tournament final on Sunday, December 18.

The “official Chadian version of events” is that the late president is a “martyr” who was “shot in the chest after shouting at his men to drive him to the front line to face down a column of terrorists”, The Telegraph reports.\n\nHowever, “conspiracy theories abound”, the paper adds.\n\nSources told The Times that Deby was killed by rebels from a political-military group known as the Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT), who were “trained in neighbouring Libya” by Wagner, a Russian mercenary organisation with ties to the Kremlin.\n\nAnd despite the alleged Russian link, the reported involvement of FACT rebels swings the spotlight first and foremost onto French foreign policy.\n\n‘French blunder’\n\nFACT was formed in 2016 by officers in the Chadian military who opposed Deby’s dictatorship and use of funds produced by the country’s oil industry. The rebels subsequently “fought for years as mercenaries in Libya’s Civil War under General Khalifa Haftar”, after seeking refuge in the south of the neighbouring country, says The Telegraph.\n\nIn recent years, France, along with Russia and the United Arab Emirates, has also “backed Haftar to the hilt, as they vie for influence” in oil-rich Libya, the paper continues.\n\nParis sent special forces into Benghazi in 2016 and has provided Haftar with aerial and diplomatic support. But that “power play may have backfired spectacularly”, after the FACT rebels “swept out of Libya some two weeks ago in about 400 to 450 vehicles” provided by Haftar.\n\nThe Chadian fighters’ plan to confront government forces “appeared to be a forlorn mission”, says The Times - but would result in Deby’s death.\n\nThat rebels equipped by Haftar killed Deby is a “monumental screw-up for France”, Nathaniel Powell, author of France’s Wars in Chad: Military Intervention and Decolonisation in Africa, told The Telegraph.\n\n“Paris put everything on Deby. They didn’t have a plan B. Then they backed a faction in the Libya Civil War, and it has blown back on them and taken out their main ally in Africa.”\n\nIndeed, the argument put forward by France for supporting Haftar “was that he could stabilise the region”, Wolfram Lacher, a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told The Telegraph. Yet the Libyan National Army commander’s support for the FACT rebels is a key reason France’s “main ally in the Sahel is dead”, Lacher said.\n\nAnalysts believe that Macron decided to attend Deby’s funeral despite the risks in order to minimise the potential damage to the relationship between Paris and N’djamena.\n\nMacron promised mourners that France would “be there to keep alive without waiting the promise of a peaceful Chad creating a place for all of its children and components”, adding that Deby was a “friend” and “courageous” soldier.\n\nFollowing his death, a military council has been formed led by Deby’s son, Mahamat Idriss, beside whom Macron was seated at the funeral ceremony. Paris has backed the arrangement under the condition that the military returns to civilian rule within 18 months.\n\nHaving lost a key ally, “Macron will be wanting to ensure he has an ally in Deby’s son and letting him know that France has his back”, Cameron Hudson, a former US State Department official and Chad specialist, told The Times.\n\nBut whether Macron’s overtures of friendship can make up for France’s perceived policy blunder remains to be seen.", "authors": ["Joe Evans", "Last Updated", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Harriet Marsden", "Rafi Schwartz"], "publish_date": "2021/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/16/ri-election-2022-campaign-politics-news-rhode-island-governor-2nd-congressional-providence-mayor/6797962001/", "title": "Election 2022 Update: GOP's Kalus rallies with 'Democrats for Ashley'", "text": "Here is the latest newsin the highest-profile 2022 races in Rhode Island, from governor to Congress to mayor of Providence and beyond.\n\nOCT. 26: GOP's Kalus rallies with \"Democrats for Ashley\"\n\nA group of Rhode Island Democrats crossed party lines and joined Republican candidate for governor Ashley Kalus Tuesday night at a rally in Pawtucket.\n\n“Republicans, Democrats, and Independents are rallying behind my campaign,\" Kalus said in a news release. \"Momentum is growing by the day, and we’re building broad coalitions of support in every corner of the state. I’m thrilled to have the backing of so many Democrats who recognize that it is time to put people over party.\"\n\nThe 10 people who identify as Democrats and publicly endorsed Kalus Tuesday were:\n\nFormer House Speaker Matthew Smith\n\nFormer North Providence Mayor Richard Fossa\n\nNorth Providence Councilman Ron Baccala\n\nNorth Providence Councilman Steve Loporchio\n\nFormer Providence state Rep. Joanne Giannini\n\nFormer Warwick Councilwoman Kathleen Egan Usler\n\nFormer Johnston Town Councilman Steve Macchioni\n\nFrank Demaio, former Providence Ward 7/15 City Committee member\n\nDottie McCaffrey, former president of the Mount Pleasant Neighborhood Association\n\nPeter Marinucci, former Providence Ward 7/15 City Committee member\n\nThe Kalus campaign paid Smith $500 in July for consultant and professional services, according to filings with the state Board of Elections.\n\nOCT. 19: Former RI Supreme Court Judge Flanders backs Kalus at press conference on McKee's emergency energy powers\n\nFormer Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Robert Flanders has sided with Republican candidate for governor Ashley Kalus' disputed contention that the governor has the power to roll back electricity and gas rate hikes.\n\nKalus has argued - and Flanders on Wednesday agreed - that Gov. Dan McKee has emergency powers granted under a 40-year-old law enacted after the gasoline shortages of the 1970s to roll back rate hikes of 47% in electricity and 15% in natural gas.\n\nDemocrat McKee contends the law - passed in the wake of severe gasoline shortages in the 1970's - applies to disruptions in energy supply only, not prices.\n\nStanding next to Kalus outside the State House on Wednesday, Flanders - a one-time GOP candidate for the U.S. Senate - disagreed with McKee's reading of the law, and Kalus accused McKee of rejecting the idea solely because she came up with it.\n\nHe told a press conference; the law applies \"whenever there is an abnormal energy related market disruption...[that threatens] the welfare ore economic well-being if R.I. citizens.\"\n\nAt such times, Flanders contended: \"the governor can issue an executive order declaring the existence of an energy crisis...[that threatens] the welfare ore economic well-being if R.I. citizens.\"\n\nHe said the Russian-Ukrainian war \"has caused large increases in market prices for gas and electricity\" that have created the kind of \"abnormal market conditions.\" that allow the governor rescind any orders handed down by the Public Utilities Commission, and defer the approved rates hikes until \"a later date when prices moderate or decrease which they are expected to do in the not to distant future.\"\n\nThat is not certain.\n\nOne of the reasons: The PUC requires Rhode Island Energy to buy supplies far in advance of when they’re needed to smooth out any price fluctuations in wholesale energy markets.\n\nThat means much of the supply for this winter was procured before the war in Ukraine, which has driven up prices of natural gas, a critical fuel for electricity generation in New England.\n\nBut Flanders - who was often on the dissenting side on Supreme Court decisions during his time on the high court - cited the emergency actions taken by McKee and his predecessor, former Gov. Gina Raimondo, during the \"public health emergency\" created by the pandemic as precedent.\n\nThe McKee administration stance: \"The Energy Crisis Management Act was passed in response to the energy crises and fuel shortage(s) of the 1970s and was intended to help manage the supply of energy, not energy prices.\"\n\n\"If the statute were improperly invoked to attempt to address energy prices, it would expose Rhode Island taxpayers to expensive and protracted litigation.\"\n\nAsked about the potential for lawsuits, Flanders said: \"You can't do anything these days without somebody potentially challenging you. So no one could give you a guarantee that somebody wouldn't challenge you...but I don't think they would be successful.\".\n\nOCT. 12: GOP Kalus' name change on campaign filings draws complaint to state elections board\n\nA 79-year-old Warwick man has asked the Rhode Island Board of Elections to sort out the name of the Republican candidate for governor: Ashley Weinzweig, as she called herself when she filed her initial paperwork as a candidate, or Ashley Kalus.\n\nFor the record: Kalus amended her initial February 7 \"notice of organization\" on March 14, to reflect the name change on her candidacy papers from her husband's last name, Weinzweig, to Kalus..\n\nRichard Langseth framed his complaint to the elections board as an \"objection to Ashley Weinzweig's amended notice of organization.\"\n\nHe said he did so after trying to trace Kalus' history in Rhode Island and finding her Newport home and her business filings were all under the name Weinzweig.\n\nThere has been no response yet from the Board of Elections to the filing, which touches on an issue familiar to professional women who chose to use their maiden names in some settings and their married names in others.\n\nOCT. 12: Magaziner pollster says Dem trails Fung by just 3 points\n\nAfter the latest public poll showed Republican Allan Fung leading Democrat Seth Magaziner by 8 points, a polling memo released by Magaziner's pollster Wednesday showed the gap a more manageable 3 points.\n\nThe polling memo from the Mellman Group, firm founded by Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said the campaign's polling showed Fung with 43% of the vote, Magaziner 40%. Moderate Party Candidate William Gilbert with 5% and 12% undecided.\n\nThat would put Magaziner well within the 4.9% margin or error.\n\n\"With a month to go, undecideds are disproportionately likely to break for Magaziner, as there are four times as many undecided Democrats (54%) as Republicans (13%,) with a third (33%) independents,\" the memo said. \"With double digit undecideds four weeks out, this is a wide-open race.\"\n\nOCT. 7: State employees union endorses Democrats, except in treasurers race\n\nThe largest union for Rhode Island state workers, Council 94, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, endorsed Democrats on Friday for every statewide and federal office this year -- except general treasurer.\n\nThe union endorsed Republican James Lathrop, the finance director in North Kingstown, over Democrat James Diossa, the former mayor of Central Falls.\n\n\"Our decision was based on the fact that [Lathrop] is a CPA instead of a politician and wanted to just be treasurer, not use it as a stepping stone,\" Council 94 President J. Michael Downey said Friday. \"That was refreshing to us.\"\n\nDowney added that the union also had some reservations about Diossa's level of \"transparency\" around managing the Central Falls pension when he was mayor, and the temporary transfer of $500,000 out of the fund into municipal coffers. The transfer was raised as an issue by Diossa's opponent in the Democratic primary.\n\nAside from Lathrop, Council 94 endorsed almost entirely Democrats in the Nov. 8 election, including Dan McKee for governor, Sabina Matos for lieutenant governor, Peter Neronha for attorney general, Gregg Amore for secretary of state and David Cicilline and Seth Magaziner for Congress.\n\nIn General Assembly races, Council 94 endorsed former state Rep. Elizabeth Crowley, who is running as an independent, over Democratic incumbent Sen. Jonathon Acosta in Central Falls. And it endorsed Republican Anthony Deluca over Democrat Jennifer Rourke for Senate in Warwick.\n\nIn the House, the union endorsed independent Antonio Desimas over incumbent Democratic Rep. Brianna Henries of East Providence.\n\nOCT. 5: Magaziner goes after GOP on Social Security\n\nJOHNSTON -- Seth Magaziner Tuesday said if Republicans retake the House thanks to a victory by his opponent Allan Fung, they will try to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits.\n\n\"The Republican agenda in Washington could not be more extreme on this issue,\" Magaziner told supporters at the Johnston Senior Center. \"Just this summer, the Republicans in Washington came out with something they called the Blueprint to Save America. That blueprint included raising the Social Security age. For most people that is already 67. How much longer do they want people to have to work?\"\n\nMagaziner's Johnston event was held to accept the endorsement from the National Committee to Protect Social Security and Medicare, a left-leaning group founded by the son of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nCommittee to Protect Social Security PAC President Max Richtman said \"we've seen a lot of talk about sunsetting these programs.\"\n\n\"That doesn't sound dangerous, but what it means is we start from scratch every five years,\" he said. \"Can you imagine that? Can you imagine how complicated it would be to recreate Social Security?\"\n\nIn television interviews, Fung has said Magaziner has \"distorted\" his position on Social Security which he said he does not want to cut.\n\nFung's campaign did not respond to Magaziner's comments Tuesday or questions about how he would fund Social Security and whether that could include raising the age when Americans can collect full Social Security benefits.\n\nAs evidence for the claim that Republicans would cut Social Security, Magaziner cited a plan that Rep. Kevin McCarthy worked on with former Speaker Paul Ryan a decade ago, which moved to privatize Social Security. McCarthy, who is expected to be speaker if the GOP retakes the House, has raised money and financed ads backing Fung in Rhode Island's second congressional district.\n\nThe Blueprint to Save America was released by the Republican Study Committee in June.\n\nAs for how he would shore up Social Security, Magaziner said he supports raising payroll taxes on people who make more than $400,000 per year. Currently earnings subject to the payroll taxes that fund Social Security are capped at $147,000 per year.\n\nSEPT. 27: McKee, Kalus at odds over need for special legislative session to suspend tax on electricity bills\n\nDays after Gov. Dan McKee promised to push legislation to suspend the state’s 4% gross receipt tax on electricity bills when lawmakers reconvene in January, his GOP opponent Ashley Kalus is asking: why wait?\n\nKalus renewed her earlier call for a special session to blunt the the impact of the big increase Rhode Islanders will see in their electric bills starting on Oct. 1, as a result of the approval last Friday, by state regulators, of the rate hike requested by the state’s largest energy company.\n\nHer Tweet: \"If @DanMcKeeRI cared about working families, seniors, & low-income Rhode Islanders, he would call the General Assembly in now for an emergency session to suspend the Gross Receipts Tax on electricity rather than wait until January.\"\n\nArticle IX of the state Constitution gives the governor the power to call the legislature - which closed up shop in June - back to the State House for an emergency legislative session.\n\nBut the governor and legislative leaders say it doesn't apply.\n\nWhen asked why Democrat McKee was not exercising this option, the governor's spokesman Matt Sheaff told The Journal: “The Governor’s legal counsel believes that the Governor currently does not have the authority to call the General Assembly back into session.”\n\nAsked to elaborate, he said: \" The Rhode Island General Assembly is not currently in adjournment. It has the power to come back into session at any time. We read the Governor’s constitutional power to convene a special session as applicable only when the General Assembly is in adjournment. \"\n\nIn their own joint statement, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said: “The Governor currently is not constitutionally empowered to convene the General Assembly.”\n\nThey did not explain the basis for their conclusion, though John Marion, executive director of the citizens' advocacy group Common Cause, suggested the Constitution may not apply in years, such as now, when the General Assembly has recessed, rather than adjourned. No court has ruled on this.\n\nA day earlier: Sheaff said the governor, nonetheless, \"continues to be committed to providing relief for all Rhode Islanders.\"\n\nHe said McKee advocated against the rate increase and redirected $3.8 million in Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative funds to \"direct rate relief\" for low-income customers.\n\nBeyond that, he said McKee is \"renewing his proposal to suspend the state’s 4% gross receipt tax on all electricity bills through the April 2023 utility billing period, which is the last month that winter electricity rates will be reflected in constituents’ utility bills.\"\n\n\"Additionally,\" Sheaff said, \"the governor proposed 2 relief tools that would apply to all ratepayers – both were approved by the PUC: 1) Suspending the customer charge on electric bills 2) Distributing $32 million in settlement credits with the Attorney General back to ratepayers.”\n\nThe credit and the suspended customer charge will reduce the impact of the rate increase by about a third for most residential customers. Instead of paying an additional $312 over the winter period, the typical ratepayer will see an increase of about $212.\n\nAs a result, however, of moves taken so far, \"We have effectively eliminated the impact for our most vulnerable constituents, and they will not see an increase in their overall electric bills when compared to last winter,\" McKee said earlier.\n\nThe credit and the suspended customer charge will reduce the impact of the rate increase by about a third for most residential customers. Instead of paying an additional $312 over the winter period, the typical ratepayer will see an increase of about $212. .\"\n\nIt is unclear how much the suspension of the 4% gross receipts tax might shave off the new rates approved Friday by the state's Public Utilities Commission.\n\nAsked how much revenue the state would forgo, Department of Revenue spokesman Paul Grimaldi told The Journal: \"The estimate we have is a revenue loss of around $42 million to $47 million for a six-month waiver of the gross receipts tax on electricity.\"\n\nKalus contends: \"Dan McKee wants to hold relief for Rhode Islanders hostage until after November.\"\n\nMcKee's campaign has not responded.\n\nKalus first raised the idea of a special session to suspend the gross receipts tax in a July 23 Tweet, soon after The Journal published a story about the rate hikes filed with state regulators by Rhode Island Energy.\n\nMcKee spokesman Matt Sheaff told The Journal Tuesday night that \"suspension of the gross receipts tax was one of the proposals that Governor McKee brought to legislative leaders during their weekly meetings to discuss potential ways to provide relief to Rhode Islanders with the surplus.\"\n\n\"At that time it was not clear exactly what the increase would be so it was decided that this proposal would be reviewed at the beginning of the [next] legislative session. \"\n\nLegislative spokesman Larry Berman said House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi recalls this coming up during their May meetings. He said: \"This will be addressed in January.\"\n\nSEPT. 21: Former Republicans stump for Magaziner\n\nClaudine Schneider, who was a Republican when she represented Rhode Island in Congress, was among five GOP defectors to endorse Democrat Seth Magaziner Wednesday.\n\n“The Republican Party of today is not the same Republican Party it was when I represented the Rhode Island second congressional district in the 1980s,\" Schneider said in a news release. \"The GOP in Washington has become the party of insurrectionist Donald Trump, and it is directly at odds with the values of Rhode Islanders.\"\n\nSchneider, the first woman to represent Rhode Island in Congress, currently lives in Colorado.\n\nThe other former Republicans to endorse Magaziner were Republican State Sen. Dawson Hodgson, former State Rep. Robert Nardolillo, Cranston Councilman Robert Ferri, and former gubernatorial candidate Vincent Marzullo.\n\nHodgson will support Kevin McCarthy for Speaker of the House, and this is unacceptable,\" Hodgson said. \"McCarthy voted to overturn the 2020 election, in direct opposition to the Constitution that we all hold dear.\"\n\nSEPT. 20: Warwick Democrat delivers Chamber endorsement to GOP's Fung\n\nWARWICK -- He may be a Democrat, but in his day job Warwick City Council President Stephen McAllister is a regional vice president for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAnd the U.S. Chamber, unlike some local chambers, leans to the right.\n\nSo in a week of post-primary Democratic unity, it was McAllister who joined Republican Allan Fung to deliver the Chamber's endorsement of the former Cranston mayor, who is trying to flip Rhode Island's second congressional district to the GOP.\n\n\"Our number one goal is to send people like Allan to Washington D.C. that want to roll up their sleeves and get to work,\" McAllister said Tuesday sitting next to Fung. \"Big things can happen when Congress gets together, negotiates and moves things forward.\"\n\nThe big things McAllister had in mind were the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed by Congress last year and the \"CHIPS Act\" to boost the semi-conductor industry, which passed earlier this year.\n\nFung says he supported both bills, which were passed by a Democratic Congress and opposed by House GOP leadership, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. McCarthy raised money for Fung and controls a PAC running negative ads against Democratic nominee Seth Magaziner. (The CHIPS Act was spearheaded by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who has defeated Fung in the last two Rhode Island gubernatorial elections.)\n\nMcAllister declined to commit to voting for Fung personally in November, but said he supports the Chamber's political agenda.\n\nFung accepted the Chamber endorsement at Brewed Awakenings on Bald Hill Road, across the street from GOP governor nominee Ashley Kalus' campaign headquarters.\n\nAnd he took the opportunity to hammer away increases in the cost of living over the past year under Democratic control of Washington, his top campaign issue.\n\n\"Coming to Washington D.C. hopefully in January I want to bring common sense solutions, making sure we are focused on the right things to get our economy going, cut a lot of this crazy spending and drive down inflation.\" Fung said.\n\nHe did not provide any new details of what policies, if elected, he would pursue to reduce inflation, beyond cutting \"wasteful spending.\"\n\nAsked what spending should be cut, Fung mentioned the Presidio tunnel project in San Francisco he blasted at his campaign announcement in April and said last year's American Rescue Plan provided too much money to states. But he doesn't want try to claw that money back from state coffers.\n\nLike government spending, tax cuts are also inflationary, and Fung says he would not rule out voting for tax cuts if the GOP retakes Congress.\n\n\"I am going to take a look at everything that will help, not just business owners, but residents in general,\" Fung said. \"If that means tax cuts that benefits all walks of life, sure I will take a look at it.\"\n\nHe did not answer when asked what he thinks of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis flying migrants to New England, a topic that has dominated national news coverage this week.\n\nMagaziner responded to the U.S. Chamber endorsement by saying he would stand with workers instead of corporations.\n\n“Allan Fung is showing his true colors yet again, standing with billion-dollar corporate lobbyists who oppose the Affordable Care Act and any efforts to crack down on the price gouging that is hurting Rhode Islanders at the gas pump,\" Magaziner said in an email. \"Tonight, I will proudly accept the support of the AFL-CIO which represents 80,000 workers across the state of Rhode Island. In Congress, I will stand with working Rhode Islanders, while Allan Fung stands with the corporate lobbyists.”\n\nSEPT. 19: Congressional delegation endorses Magaziner\n\nRhode Island's all-Democratic congressional delegation Monday joined the party's post-primary effort to unify behind Seth Magaziner in the race against Republican Allan Fung.\n\nIn Johnston, U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Reps. David Cicilline and Jim Langevin were joined by Johnston Mayor Joseph Polisena and the Democrats Magaziner beat in the primary to stump for him.\n\n“Seth has served the second congressional district for the last eight years, fixing crumbling school buildings and creating clean energy jobs from Westerly to Burrillville,\" Langevin, whose decision not to run for reelection set off the battle for the Second District seat.\n\nRep. David Cicilline, who part of the House Democratic leadership team, was more more blunt.\n\n\"Allan Fung will be a vote for the national Republicans dead set on passing a national abortion ban, repealing the Affordable Care Act, and cutting programs like Social Security and Medicare that seniors rely on,\" Cicilline said. \"In the House, the majority party controls the agenda and decides which bills see the light of day.\"\n\nReed said \"a vote to send Allan Fung to Congress is a vote to empower Trump Republicans and tighten Trump's chokehold on our democracy.”\n\nThe congressional delegation event comes after the state party on Sunday night held a unity dinner in Warwick to bring statewide candidates together after the primary including the candidates for governor.\n\nAnd it comes as the national GOP targets Rhode Island's Second District as one of its top potential pickup targets as it tries to win back a majority in the House.\n\nA Super PAC controlled by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who visited Rhode Island to raise money for Fung this summer, spent $1 million on advertising in the district.\n\nA television spot from the Congressional Leadership Fund now airing in Rhode Island accuses Magaziner of using family money to \"buy his way into office.\"\n\nSEPT. 12: Former RI Health Director Alexander-Scott endorses Foulkes for governor\n\nA day ahead of Tuesday's five-way Democratic primary, former Rhode Island Health Director Nicole Alexander-Scott endorsed former CVS executive Helena Foulkes for governor over the incumbent, Dan McKee.\n\nIn a statement explaining why she is backing Foulkes over McKee, who was her boss until she gave two-weeks notice that she was leaving in January, Alexander-Scott said:\n\n\"For Rhode Island to be best equipped to handle the next crisis, the state cannot stay with the status quo. Early on, I saw how critical it was to have a Governor with vision, integrity, a listening ear, and a willingness to be accountable.\n\n\"Rhode Island needs change and needs new leadership. Helena Foulkes is the leader Rhode Island needs.\"\n\nThis was the response from the McKee campaign: \"Helena Foulkes is trying to change the conversation away from her role in fueling the opioid crisis and the nearly billion dollars in settlements that CVS now has to pay because of her negligent 'leadership'.\"\n\nIn February 2021, before McKee took office, \"Rhode Island received an F from Harvard on its vaccination rollout. Rhode Island was in the bottom 10 states nationwide per capita for deaths. The NY Times had Rhode Island dead last for share of its population that has received at least one vaccine dose and percentage of doses used.\n\n\"Governor McKee’s leadership changed that,\" campaign spokeswoman Alana O'Hare said. \"He partnered with municipalities and prioritized teachers to get shots off the shelves and into arms, and our state is now the most vaccinated in the nation.\"\n\n\"Gov. McKee’s record speaks for itself,\" she said.\n\nBut Alexander-Scott's deputy, Tom McCarthy, who resigned shortly after she did, pushed back with this Tweet:\n\n\"Unreal, it was a challenge to get the Governor to listen to and understand the FACTS let alone make a decision. It was easier to prop up a “whacky, waving inflatable arm” blow up at a car dealership than stiffen his spine to make a real decision.\"\n\nAlexander-Scott, who was hired by then-Gov. Gina Raimondo in 2015, never publicly explained why she quit before the end of her appointed term. She was given a $46,000 a month consulting gig - described as a \"transition services agreement\" - that ran from March 1 through May 31.\n\nMcKee's rivals in the race for governor blamed him for the departure, with one saying it \"signals a lack of confidence in [McKee's] leadership and handling of COVID-19.\"\n\nBut others in state government, including House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, said Alexander-Scott had privately told them that \"she's given all that she can to the job\" and she's just ready to move on.\n\nAnd McKee said at the time he regretted her leaving: “Her leadership has been crucial to our whole of government response — helping Rhode Island become number one in testing nationwide and getting more people vaccinated per capita than nearly any other state in the country,\" he said in a statement issued by his office.\n\nThere has been no response yet from McKee to Alexander-Scott's political shot at him and his administration.\n\nIn her statement, released by the Foulkes campaign, she said: \"Please do not let Tuesday pass without doing your part to ensure that Rhode Island has a leader who is ready to tackle the challenges lying ahead in education, housing, employment, and so many other areas.\n\nIn July, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials announced that Alexander-Scott had been hired as a \"senior executive consultant...[to] lead the creation of a national office that will serve as a resource hub for state, territorial, county, and local governments and public health agencies to effectively invest in communities using evidence-informed, place-based, community-led interventions.\"\n\nSEPT. 9: Elorza calls for removal of ExpressVote machines ahead of primary\n\nOn Friday, Mayor Jorge Elorza called for the ExpressVote machines to be removed ahead of the primary, putting the request in writing to Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea and the Board of Elections.\n\n“I just have very little faith that everything is going to be ready to go by Election Day, and so I think it’s prudent at this time to just pull these ExpressVote machines and get everything ready for the general election,” Elorza said.\n\nMore:As more ballot errors emerge, RI Board of Elections wants clarity around testing\n\nMore:New machines used in early voting listed candidates from 2018 on Spanish-language ballot\n\nThe mayor said existing machines, which are not the ExpressVote machines, “are more than enough to handle the volume of voters” in the primary, calling the ExpressVote machines unnecessary.\n\nVarious errors have been uncovered on Spanish language ballots shown on the machines, including the erroneous lists of candidates. Lists from the 2018 cycle were shown on some ballots, which included Elorza’s name. He is term-limited and not remain in office next year.\n\nElorza said he isn’t sure whether the Board of Elections has formally adopted a verification process, calling it a concern.\n\nThis comes after Elorza exchanged letters over the issue with Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, who is running for governor. Elorza has endorsed her opponent, Helena Foulkes.\n\nIn his letter, Elorza appeared to hold Gorbea responsible for the fiasco, along with the Board of Elections.\n\nIn her letter, Gorbea said responsibility lies with the Board of Elections, adding that she trusts Elorza’s statements were not made because of his endorsement of Foulkes.\n\n“That was upsetting,” Elorza said of Gorbea’s remarks. “I mean, come on. This has been a string of issues that continue to come out day after day after day, and it’s incumbent upon them. What I’m asking them to do is to ensure that we have a fair and accurate election.”\n\nIn a subsequent statement, Gorbea's campaign manager Dana Walton made an even stronger comment than the candidate herself had made, describing Elorza's press conference as a \"political stunt days before an election to help out Mayor Elorza’s endorsed candidate.\" Walton added that the Board of Elections held a public meeting on Wednesday when Elorza could have noted his concerns.\n\nIn a letter after his announcement, the Rhode Island branch of the American Civil Liberties Union and Common Cause Rhode Island released a statement demanding Elorza retract his call for the removal of the machines, stating it would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\n\"Voters with disabilities have a right to use a machine that can assist them voting their ballot, and the ExpressVote is that machine,\" said RIACLU Director Steven Brown.\n\nElorza said he asked the Secretary of State and Board of Elections \"whether these are the only ADA accessible machines\" and if so, to ensure people with disabilities have the option not to use them. The mayor says he hopes there's already a backup plan.\n\nSEPT. 1: Teachers union endorses LaFortune for Providence mayor\n\nThe Providence Teachers Union on Thursday endorsed Councilwoman Nirva LaFortune for mayor, pointing to her city experience and background as a public school graduate.\n\n\"Nirva’s impressive qualifications, her unique connection with our schools and her commonsense ideas to take our public schools to the next level after the state takeover ends, make her the clear choice for mayor,\" the union said.\n\nThe endorsement comes just after LaFortune released a plan to become what she called \"Providence's education mayor.\" LaFortune aims to end the state's takeover of public schools, establish a teacher residency program, and fix up and construct new school buildings, among a host of other initiatives.\n\nThe union said LaFortune would serve as \"a partner at City Hall, instead of an adversary.\"\n\nOther union endorsements in the race include Gonzalo Cuervo's firefighters union endorsement and Brett Smiley's painters union endorsement.\n\nMore:Providence mayoral candidates pressed to drop the talking points in debate. What they said\n\nMore:Why are they running? Providence mayoral candidates on the political and the personal\n\nAUG. 24: Two governor candidates added to Nov. ballot\n\nThe Rhode Island Board of Elections Wednesday added two candidates for governor -- libertarian Elijah Gizzarelli and independent Paul Rianna Jr. -- to the November general election ballot.\n\nThe BOE had previously ruled Gizzarelli was 14 nomination signatures short of the 1,000 needed to get on the ballot ,and Rianna 42 signatures short.\n\nBut the Board restored dozens of signatures for the candidates that local boards of canvassers had rejected, giving them enough to qualify for the ballot.\n\nGizzarelli and Rianna wil join the winners of the September 13 Democratic and Republican primaries on the November ballot and independent Zachary Hurwitz.\n\nAUG. 24: NRA gives few endorsements, many F's to RI candidates\n\nThe National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund has endorsed five Rhode Island House candidates in its 2022 report card for the upcoming elections and dished out \"F\" grades to General Assembly leaders after they passed a ban on high capacity magazines this year.\n\nThe new NRA grades include an \"F\" for formerly \"A\" rates Senate president Dominick Ruggerio, a gun owner and Second Amendment advocate in the past.\n\nOut of dozens of competitive races and hundreds of candidates the gun rights group endorsed:Republican Rep. Barbara Ann Fenton-Fung of Cranston, Democratic Rep. Camille Vella-Winkinson of Warwick, Rep. Edward Cardillo of Johnston, Rep. Robert Phillips of Woonsocket and Democratic House challenger Natalya Delsanto of Cranston. Delsanto is challenging Rep. Brandon Potter, whom the NRA gave an \"F.\"\n\nThe NRA made no endorsements in any of the statewide races, including the governor's race. It gave Democratic candidates Gov. Dan McKee, Helena Foulkes and Nellie Gorbea \"F\" grades. Matt Brown and Luis Daniel Muñoz received a \"?\" grade.\n\nRepublican Ashley Kalus also received a \"?.\" Her primary opponent got a \"B,\" but no endorsement.\n\nIn the lieutenant governor's race, Democrats Sabina Matos, Cynthia Mendes and Deborah Ruggiero all got \"Fs\"\n\nAlong with Ruggerio, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi also received a \"F.\"\n\nReps. Charlene Lima, D-Cranston; Joseph Solomon, D-Warwick and Arthur Corvese, D-North Providence, received \"Bs.\"\n\nSens. Frank Ciccone, D-Providence; Frank Lombardi, D-Cranston and Frank Lombardo, D-Johnston, also got \"Bs\" from the NRA.\n\nAUG. 10: Matos hits Ruggiero over matching funds\n\nSparring in the lieutenant governor's race escalated Wednesday when Lt.

Sabina Matos -- needled earlier in the week for debate ducking -- accused Democratic primary opponent Deborah Ruggiero of improperly seeking public campaign funding.\n\nThe complaint sent to the state Board of Elections from Matos campaign manager Evan England said Ruggiero had exceeded the amount of money a candidate can loan their campaign and receive state matching funds.\n\nThe state matching fund program limits how much candidates can spend while claiming public dollars and how much of that money -- 5% -- can come from personal funds. The Matos complaint calculates the limit for personal loans in a lieutenant governor race this year to be $43,233.\n\nIn March, Ruggiero loaned her campaign $15,000, which would not exceed the limit, but she had nearly $42,000 in her campaign account from her time as a state representative. Carrying those existing campaign funds over into the lieutenant governor campaign counts as a loan that would bring her total to around $57,000, the complaint alleges.\n\n\"When Rep. Ruggiero applied for taxpayer funds for her campaign, she agreed to follow certain rules,\" Matos campaign consultant Mike Raia wrote in an email. \"It's clear she has violated those rules.\"\n\nRuggiero spokesman Joe Caiazzo Wednesday night said the issue has been resolved.\n\nHe forwarded an email sent from Board of Elections Campaign Finance Director Richard Thornton to Ruggiero three hours after the Matos complaint was filed directing her to \"repay yourself for the loan made to the campaign to the extent necessary to comply with the [matching funds] pledge.\"\n\nAssuming the money, which comes out to around $14,000, is refunded, the letter from Thornton does not suggest Ruggiero will have any issue receiving matching funds.\n\nCaiazzo said Ruggiero will comply.\n\n\"This is another attempt by the Matos campaign to divert from the issues that actually matter to Rhode Islanders,\" Caiazzo wrote in an email. \"It is unfortunate she will not engage in dialogue and participate in debates.\"\n\nThe campaign finance complaint comes after Ruggiero attacked Matos earlier in the week for refusing to participate in more than one debate this year.\n\nRuggiero and fellow lieutenant governor candidate Sen. Cynthia Mendes taped a debate at WPRO-radio Tuesday that Matos declined to attend over a scheduling conflict.\n\n\"It is disappointing to see Sabina Matos and her team ignore our calls for debate participation,\" Ruggiero said in a news release Monday. \"Their previous remarks are dismissive and demeaning to all Rhode Islanders.\n\nMatos enjoys a healthy financial advantage in the race with $316,000 in her campaign account as of June 30 compared to $140,000 for Ruggiero. Matos is not seeking public matching funds in the race.\n\nMendes is also running in the Democratic primary and is seeking matching funds.\n\nAUG. 9: Seth Magaziner moves to second congressional district\n\nSeven months after launching his campaign for Congress, Rhode Island General Treasurer Seth Magaziner has moved to the Second Congressional District he hopes to represent, his campaign said Tuesday.\n\nMagaziner moved from the East Side of Providence to Cranston's Edgewood neighborhood, campaign spokeswoman Patricia Socarras said.\n\nMagaziner will be renting a townhouse on Norwood Avenue on a block that dead-ends at Roger Williams Park. The move was first reported by the Boston Globe.\n\nThe move allowed Magaziner to register in the Second District so he can vote for himself ahead of the voter registration deadline.\n\nMagaziner grew up in the East Bay, which is in the First District, and some of Magaziner's election opponents have attacked him for not being from the district he wants to represent.\n\nSocarras said Magaziner plans to put his East Side home on the market to sell, but it has not been listed yet.\n\nAUG. 6: McCarthy visits Fung in RI\n\nKevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, was in Rhode Island Saturday to meet and presumably raise money for second congressional district candidate Allan Fung.\n\n\"Great day with a great candidate. Let’s turn #RI02 red @AllanFungRI,\" McCarthy, of California, tweeted around 4 p.m. with a photo of himself and Fung, dressed in nearly matching white shirts, khaki pants and navy blue blazers, standing on a manicured lawn overlooking Narragansett Bay.\n\nThe Fung campaign has not responded to questions about McCarthy's visit or where the anticipated fundraising event was held.\n\nThe Democrats hoping to replace retiring Rep. Jim Langevin in Washington next year, however, blasted the alliance.\n\n“MAGA Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy supports privatizing Social Security, repealing the Affordable Care Act, and passing a national abortion ban, \" Patricia Socarras, spokeswoman for Seth Magaziner wrote in an email. \"The fact McCarthy is campaigning for Allan Fung in RI confirms what we already knew— Fung and the extremists Republicans would be a disaster for Rhode Island seniors, Rhode Islander workers and Rhode Island women.”\n\nBryan McNamara, spokesman for Sarah Morgenthau, wrote that Fung is “rolling out the red carpet for Kevin McCarthy and his radical far-right agenda, proving once again he is out-of-touch with the voters of the Second District.”\n\nJames Singer, regional press secretary for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee tweeted: \"Can make a promise: Democrats will make sure voters see this photo again and again #ri02.\"\n\nAUG. 1: Gorbea says she's still the frontrunner, according to her polster\n\nSecretary of State Nellie Gorbea's says a new poll she commissioned shows her leading the race for governor by five percentage points.\n\nIn a poll of likely Democratic primary conducted last week, 27% of respondents prefered Gorbea compared to 22% for Dan McKee, 14% for Helena Buonanno Foulkes, 7% for Matt Brown and 3% for Luis Daniel Muñoz, according to a polling memo from Gorbea pollster Celinda Lake. The Gorbea campaign did not release the full poll including what questions were asked.\n\nAccording to the Lake polling memo, 53% of likely voters view Gorbea favorably, compared to 49% who view McKee favorably and 33% who view Foulkes favorably.\n\nThe last public poll of the Democratic primary, done in late June, showed Gorbea at 24%, McKee 20% and Foulkes 16%.\n\nThe last time Gorbea released select results of a poll was in April and showed her with 30% of the vote, compared to 24% for McKee, 10% for Brown and 7% for Foulkes.\n\nIn her polling memo Lake emphasized Gorbea's lead over Foulkes who, while still trailing, in most recent polls has been gaining ground.\n\n\"Despite Foulkes heavy spending on television advertising, she is a distant third,\" Lake wrote.\n\nLate last week Foulkes announced a set of prominent endorsements including Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza.\n\nThe polling memo shows a large chunk of the electorate -- 22% -- remains undecided on who they would support for governor.\n\nJULY 25: AFL-CIO and state's largest teachers' union endorse McKee\n\nGov. Dan McKee on Monday continued to rack up support from organized labor with the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and National Education Association Rhode Island teachers' union endorsing him.\n\nGeorge Nee, president of Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said since McKee assumed the governorship in March, 2021, he has signed labor-friendly bills that raise the minimum wage, require greenhouse gas emission reductions, set minimum staffing levels at nursing homes and require state-backed construction projects to pay a prevailing wage.\n\n\"Gov. McKee has consistently demonstrated a commitment to making life better for working Rhode Islanders,\" Nee said in a news release. \"We look forward to continuing to work with the McKee Administration on issues that affect not only the 80,000 men and women of the Rhode Island labor movement but all of the Ocean State’s working people.”\n\nThe NEARI endorsement was perhaps more of a surprise and comes despite McKee's long-standing support for charter schools, which has put him at odds with the union over the years. Last year McKee helped block a union-backed moratorium on new charter schools in Rhode Island.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, McKee pushed to have teachers vaccinated for COVID-19 before the general public at a point in the pandemic when doses were scarce.\n\nSeeing organized labor line up behind the incumbent in a Democratic primary is not a surprise, especially in this election year where state governments across the country have had the opportunity to dole out billions of dollars in federal COVID aid.\n\n“Governor McKee put his money where his mouth is by ensuring funding for public school construction and even finally paying off an old debt owed by the state to the pension system,” NEARI President Larry Purtill said in a news release. “There have been, and still are, areas where we disagree with the Governor and frankly, all his rivals. However, communication with the McKee Administration has steadily become more active and robust as he accrues time in the role of governor.”\n\nThe release also credited McKee with responding to \"issues at the Community College of Rhode Island, by placing Purtill on the Council on Postsecondary Education.\n\nThe 12,000-member NEARI is the largest teachers' union in the state.\n\nJULY 20: McKee wins UNAP endorsement\n\nGov. Dan McKee has won the endorsement of the United Nurses and Allied Professionals.\n\nIn making the announcement on Wednesday, UNAP - which describes itself as Rhode Island's largest health care workers' union with more than 5,500 members - thanked McKee for steering millions in federal Coronavirus relief dollars towards health care workers and hospitals.\n\n“In less than a year and a half, Governor McKee has delivered big results for health care workers,” said Lynn Blais, President of the UNAP, in a statement released by the union.\n\n“He kept us and our patients safe during the worst of COVID by mandating the vaccine for health care workers. He’s made workplace development in the health care field a top priority, with a focus on alleviating hospital staffing issues, which have plagued us for years.\n\nAnd \"he worked with General Assembly leaders to deliver real financial relief in the form of ARPA funding and increased Medicaid reimbursements for our hospitals, keeping them out of the hands of the for-profit vultures looking to make a profit at the expense of health care workers and patients.\n\nThe union also credited him for the \"major investments'' in the new state budget for the state-run Eleanor Slater Hospital, including \"money for a new medical facility, upgrades to existing buildings and the development of a long-awaited electronic medical records system.”\n\nMcKee also presided over the award of recrutiment and mentoring bonuses -ranging from $500 to $10,000 - on top of the $3,000 bonsues given other state employees - fornew nurses and certified nursing assistants at the Slater Hospital, the Rhode Island Veterans Home and the medical wing of the state prison.\n\nIn her statement, Blais said: McKee \" has earned our endorsement through his actions to help not just nurses and health professionals, but the entire health care community in Rhode Island, and we look forward to supporting him in the Democratic Primary and beyond.”\n\nJULY 17: Magaziner leads congressional fundraising\n\nSeth Magaziner continues to raise more money than any other candidate seeking to replace the retiring Jim Langevin representing Rhode Island's Second Congressional District, according to the latest quarterly filings with the Federal Elections Commission.\n\nDemocrat Magaziner had $1.7 million in his campaign account at the end of June. So far this year he has raised $2.1 million and spent $400,000.\n\nMagaziner's donors are a who's who of Rhode Island industry and political influencers. They include former Fleet bank chief Terrence Murray, former IGT chairman Donald Sweitzer, former congressman Patrick Kennedy, Cornish Associates founder Arnold \"Buff\" Chace, Rhode Island Convention Center Chairman Bernie Buonanno Jr. and state Senate Majority Whip Maryellen Goodwin.\n\nHe also collected donations from political action committees representing unions such as Unite Here, International Union of Operating, Engineers, United Food and Commercial Workers, Plumbers and Pipefitters and the Laborers International Union.\n\nRepublican Allan Fung had second largest campaign warchest at the end of the second quarter, with $762,000. Fung has raised $857,000 so far this year, loaned his campaign $50,000 and spent $145,000.\n\nFung's donors include Carlos Trujillo, a Federalist Society contributor who was U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States under President Donald Trump. Fung also received $5,000 from the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers PAC and $14,000 from members of the Tasca family that own auto dealerships.\n\nDemocrat Sarah Morgenthau had $621,000 in the bank. She has raised $692,000 so far this year, loaned her campaign $200,000 and spent $271,000.\n\nShe received $5,000 from New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's Off the Sidelines PAC and $1,000 from California Congressman Adam Schiff’s Frontline USA PAC.\n\nMost of her support came from out of state with only around two dozen individual donors from Rhode Island.\n\nDemocrat David Segal had $325,000 in the bank. He has raised $404,000, loaned his campaign $65,000 and spent $144,000 so far this year.\n\nLike Morgenthau. Segal also received most of his from out of state.\n\nHis Rhode Island donors included State Rep. John Lombardi and Providence City Council member Rachel Miller.\n\nDemocrat Joy Fox had $173,000 in the bank. She raised $281,000 and spent $108,000 so far this year.\n\nSome of her notable Rhodedonors included former lieutenant governor Elizabeth Roberts, former state Department of Human Services Director Courtney Hawkins and former candidate for governor Myrth York.\n\nNo second quarter campaign finance report was posted on the FEC website for Democrat Omar Bah as of Sunday.\n\nJULY 11: Morgenthau gets Booker endorsement\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker endorsed Sarah Morgenthau for Congress on Monday as the Democrats running for Rhode Island's 2nd Congressional District seat continue to tout support from prominent Washington lawmakers.\n\nMorgenthau, who quit a job in the Biden administration to run for Congress, worked on Booker's successful 2006 campaign for mayor of Newark.\n\n\"I have known Sarah for years. She had faith in me at a time few others did, and came to work for my mayoral campaign in Newark, which was no easy thing,” Booker said in a news release. “I am asking the voters of Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District to have the same faith in Sarah Morgenthau that she had in me. Sarah is hardworking, compassionate, and knows how to get things done in Washington.\"\n\nMorgenthau's Booker endorsement comes after Treasurer Seth Magaziner two weeks ago announced the endorsement of U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, who holds the seat the candidates are trying to fill.\n\nMagaziner also received an endorsement from Massachusetts 4rth District Congressman Jake Auchincloss last week.\n\nBack in April, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren endorsed David Segal for Rhode Island's 2nd District and held an online fundraiser for him at the end of last month.\n\nJULY 8: Construction unions hit the air for McKee\n\nUnlike his Democratic primary rivals, Gov. Dan McKee hasn't done any campaign advertising so far this year and thanks to local building trades unions may not need to very soon.\n\nThe Rhode Island Building Trades Council on Friday launched television ads backing McKee Friday and thanking him for recent rounds of state spending programs.\n\n\"Since taking office, Gov. Dan McKee has delivered an historic investment in much-needed affordable housing. He's taken the lead on historic school construction projects,\" the ad said. \"So while some candidates have talked a good game, Dan McKee has delivered historic results.\"\n\nHaving the unions run independent ads backing you shows the power of incumbency and the political advantages of being in control of a $13 billion state budget.\n\nMichael Sabitoni, president of the Building Trades Council, said Friday that the unions' support for McKee was a result of what he has delivered for them since taking office last year.\n\n\"At the end of the day he gets an 'A' from us since he has been in office,\" Sabitoni said. \"Everything he has done with Covid, everything he has done with the state employees.\"\n\n\"All the other people say they are going to do this, they are going to do that. He has already done it,\" he added. \"There is only one person who has submitted a budget and had the General Assembly pass a budget.\"\n\nSaboitoni said the current ad will run \"two or three weeks\" and that there would be another ad coming focusing on infrastructure.\n\nAccording to a filing with the Board of Elections, the Building Trades Council spent $100,000 placing the ad with the television networks and cable.\n\nEarlier this week Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea's campaign released a new ad describing her housing plan.\n\nAnd she announced the endorsement of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 328.\n\nJUNE 24-26: House speaker, Senate president endorse McKee in crowded race for governor\n\nAhead of the state Democratic Party's endorsement convention on Sunday night, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio have gone public with their choice in the crowded race for governor: Dan McKee, the Democratic incumbent.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Ruggerio issued a statement, announcing his endorsement of McKee for Governor and Sabina Matos for Lieutenant Governor.\n\nIn his statement, Ruggerio said, McKee and Matos, his appointed successor as lieutenant governor, \"have been effective partners with the Senate over the past year and a half, and they have helped to deliver results that will benefit the people and small businesses of our state now and into the future.\"\n\n“Dan McKee was thrust into the Governor’s office during a difficult time, amid a pandemic, and he rose to meet the challenge,\" RUggerio said.\n\n\"We worked collaboratively to ensure Rhode Islanders struggling under the weight of inflation saw immediate, tangible relief by eliminating the car tax, providing child tax credits, expanding low-income property tax breaks, and much more.\n\n\"Governor McKee is attuned to the challenges facing small businesses in Rhode Island, and he has succeeded in addressing many of these challenges, taking action to mitigate the worker shortage, improve workforce training, and reduce taxes,\" he said.\n\n“Lieutenant Governor Matos has provided indispensable leadership throughout her time in the lieutenant governor’s office,\" he added, citing several examples. Among them: \"Her work on housing, which has been a primary focus, has helped our state make historic progress.\"\n\nOn Friday, on the day after the close of the six-month legislative session – and round after round of negotiations with McKee's team, Shekarchi publicly endorsed McKee for election to the job to which he ascended in March 2021 after then-Gov. Gina Raimondo left for a Biden Cabinet post.\n\n“I appreciate his leadership and ability to collaborate with the legislature on such key issues as the landmark Act on Climate bill to protect our precious environment, as well as making key investments in education, health care and assisting our small businesses,\" Shekarchi said.\n\n\"We have an excellent working relationship which resulted in a great budget for all Rhode Islanders this year,\" added Shekarchi, citing the elimination of the car tax a year ahead of schedule, expanded tax credits for seniors and disabled people, and a tax credit for working families with children.\n\n“The Governor and I [also] share the mutual goal of increasing affordable housing opportunities for all Rhode Islanders, which is evident by the $250 million in housing investments contained in the budget, and we worked together on a comprehensive package of new housing bills.\"\n\nShekarchi will not have a direct vote on the endorsements the Democratic State Committee will hand out on Sunday night. But the speaker traditionally has had significant sway as the chosen leader of the Democrat-dominated House of representatives.\n\nThe explanation lies in the math: The committee's voting members include a state committeeman and a state committeewoman from each of the 75 House Districts, which equates to 150 of the 250 voting members.\n\nMcKee is facing four Democratic challengers: Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, former Secretary of State Matt Brown, former CVS executive Helena Foulkes and health-care advocate Luis Daniel Muñoz.\n\nWinning the endorsement will require more than 50% of those voting.\n\nOn Saturday, Shekarchi also endorsed current state Treasurer Seth Magaziner for R.I.'s 2nd Congressional District seat.\n\n\"I am strongly supporting Seth Magaziner to fight against the radical views in Washington that are clearly out of step with Rhode Islanders,\" Shekarchi said.\n\n\"Having worked well with Seth as our General Treasurer for the past eight years, I can attest to his intelligence, character and strength that will serve us so well in Congress. We need Seth to join with Senator [Jack] Reed, Senator [Sheldon] Whitehouse and Congressman [David] Cicilline to carry forth the Democratic values that are so critical to our future as a state and a nation.\"\n\nThe Speaker has not [yet] weighed in on the primary race between Democrats Stefan Pryor and James Diossa to succeed Magaziner as treasurer.\n\nBut Pryor, who was until this past Tuesday the state's commerce secretary, won an endorsement from the Rhode Island Building & Construction Trades Council, a coalition of 16 local trade unions .\n\n“I have seen first hand Stefan Pryor’s work creating economic development. He created thousands of local union construction jobs, and his record is second to none. He is running a serious campaign on issues impacting all of Rhode Island and his record demonstrates that he is the type of leader we need as General Treasurer,” said Building Trades President Michael F. Sabitoni.\n\nJUNE 20: Senate Judiciary Chair Coyne not seeking reelection\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairwoman Cynthia Coyne is not seeking reelection to the Senate District 32 seat — representing all of Barrington and portions of B​ristol and East Providence — that she first won in 2014..\n\nWith the start of the candidate declaration period now only days away, Democrat Coyne — one of the highest ranked women in the R.I. Senate — issued this statement:\n\n“I have decided that the time is right to retire from the Senate, but I am not retiring from public service.\"\n\n\"In the immediate future, I look forward to spending more quality time with family and friends. I don’t know what my future may hold after that, but I know that I will always be engaged and eager to serve the community in some capacity.\"\n\nWithin hours of Coyne's announcement, Barrington Democratic Town Committee Chair Pam Lauria announced her candidacy for Coyne's seat.\n\nShe is a primary care nurse practitioner at Coastal Medical, now serving as a Trustee on Coastal’s Board. She is a volunteer and advocate with Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, and a member of Barrington’s Housing Board of Trustees, \"working to increase affordable housing in Barrington.\" She has led the Barrington Democratic Town Committee since 2017,\n\nShe listed, as her priorities: \"Affordable/equitable/accessible healthcare, commonsense laws to reduce gun violence, affordable housing, supporting children educationally and emotionally, and making RI affordable for all.\"\n\nCoyne is a former state trooper who retired at the rank of lieutenant in 2006, and a graduate of the FBI National Academy.,\n\nIn her first term, \"she worked to enact legislation to protect domestic violence victims by removing firearms from felony abusers... In more recent years, she championed new laws prohibiting untraceable ghost guns and 3-D printed guns.\"\n\nShe was also the lead Senate sponsor of legislation to limit firearm magazine capacity to 10 rounds of ammunition that won General Assembly approval last week after an initial tie vote in her committee that would have doomed it, has Senate leaders not vailed themselves of a rule allowing \"immediate consideration:\" of the House-passed version.\n\nThe legislation is expected to be signed into law by Gov. Dan McKee this week.\n\nOn Monday, Coyne also pointed with pride to her sponsorship of legislation requiring public reporting on all child deaths or near fatalities, background checks for people working or volunteering with children and reforms to the state’s human trafficking laws.\n\nOther bills she sponsored — or co-sponsored — increased the age to purchase tobacco in Rhode Island to 21, and opened the door to compensation to individuals who were wrongfully convicted.\n\nFirst elected to the Senate in 2014, she previously served as a member of the Barrington Town Council.\n\n“The issues that come before the Judiciary Committee are some of the most emotional and divisive issues to be considered by the Senate,\" Coyne said Monday.\n\n\"I tried to find common ground and start from a place of respect to build consensus whenever we could. We were able to get a lot accomplished, and I am appreciative of everyone I have had the opportunity to work with over the years.”\n\nJUNE 17: Candidates opt in, out of contest for Democratic Party endorsements\n\nA noon deadline has now come and gone for candidates for top state and federal office to signal whether or not they want the state Democratic Party endorsement.\n\nAnd, no surprise - most do - including Gov. Dan McKee and his challengers: Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, former Secretary of State Matt Brown, former CVS executive Helena Foulkes and .health care activist Luis Daniel Munoz.\n\nUnder new party rules, they not only had to declare their candidacies by noon Friday for the endorsements that will be voted on June 26, they had to name the individuals who will be nominating them and seconding their nominations.\n\nFor example, McKee is counting on North Providence Mayor Charlie Lombardi and Sen. Ana Quezada to put his name in the hat. Gorbea named Central Falls Mayor Maria Rivera and party activist Ann Gooding.\n\nFoulkes named Sen. Louis DiPalma and David Chenevert, the lohg-time executive director of the Rhode Island Manufacturers Association; Brown named Portsmouth Town Councilmember Linda Ujifusa and Aaron Pearson, and Munoz named Meg Cotter and Dwayne Keys.\n\nIf none of the candidates are able to muster more than 50% of the votes in three rounds of elimination voting, there will be no endorsement as has happened on occasion in the past, but would obviously not be a good look for a sitting governor.\n\nOnly two candidates in the crowded race for the 2nd District Congressioal seat that long-time Rep. Jim Langevin is vacating opted not to seek the endorsement: Joy Fox and Omar Bah.\n\nThe other Democrats seeking the seat all threw their names in, including state Treas. Seth Magaziner, former state Rep. David Segal, Rhode Island. political newcomer Sarah Morgenthau and Providence firefighter Cameron Moquin.\n\nIn the three-way race for lieutenant, incumbent Sabina Matos is seeking the nomination. So is state Sen. Cynthia Mendes of East Providence..\n\nBut the third Democrat in the lieutenant governor's race - state Rep. Deb Ruggiero - is not.\n\nRuggiero, D-Jamestown, explained her rationale in a letter to members of the state Democratic Committee that said, in part:.\n\n\"Like you, I'm a life-long Democrat. I believe in the values of our Party; equity, equality, and justice.\"\n\n\"As Democrats, we believe in small \"d\" democracy. We have faith in our citizens and believe the more people that participate the better the process. That is my message to the voters - if you believe in me and give me your vote, I will work tirelessly for you.\"\n\n\"For this reason, I have decided NOT to seek the endorsement of the Democratic Party in my race for Lt. Governor in hopes of not dividing our Party.\"\n\nIn her own letter to the party, Matos - who was chosen by Gov. Dan McKee as his replacement when he ascended from lieutenant governor to governor in March 2021, has made this case:\n\n\"In more than a decade as a city councilor in Providence and over the past year as Lieutenant Governor, I have had the opportunity to meet and work alongside many of you.\n\n\"I know the commitment required to keeping our Democratic values and priorities front and center,\" she wrote.\n\nBoth Democrats in the race for treasurer opted to seek the nomination: Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor and former Central Falls Mayor James Diossa.\n\nThere are 250 voting members of the State Democratic Committee.(An earlier version of the blog poist said 286 based on incorrect information initially provided by the party.)\n\nThe list inlcudes, but is not limitd to: the party chairs in every city and town, three appointees each by the House Speaker and the Senate president, the state's four-member Congressional delegation, the five general officers, the party's Democratic National Committeeman and woman, and the committeeman and women in each House district, according to party advisor Kate Coyne McCoy..\n\nJUNE 15: Diossa says Pryor should resign over soccer stadium\n\nCandidate for treasurer and Central Falls Mayor James Diossa on Wednesday called on Democratic rival and state Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor to resign from negotiating a Pawtucket soccer stadium deal.\n\nPryor announced his campaign for treasurer on May 24 with a plan to step down as commerce secretary in \"two weeks\" and hit the campaign trail.\n\nBut negotiations on a bailout plan for the \"Tidewater Landing\" soccer stadium project have gotten messy. The Commerce Corporation Board of Directors on Tuesday declined to vote on a new agreement Pryor struck with developer Fortuitous Partners.\n\nThe board's concern was that the new proposal would strip public funding from the housing, infrastructure and non-stadium elements of the project, raising the possibility the state will have to spend significantly more money down the road.\n\nBut Diossa, a supporter of the stadium, blames the board's concerns about the deal on Pryor keeping them \"in the dark until such a late stage.\"\n\n\"Multiple members of the Board were visibly bothered by the lack of ready answers from Commerce staff to the Board’s basic questions,\" Diossa said in a news release. \"Transparency is critical, and the intelligent, capable members of the Commerce Board deserve access to all the information and to have their questions answered so that they can do their due diligence.\"\n\nDiossa cited comments by board member Donna Sams in particular that she was \"frustrated\" at not getting sufficient answers from Pryor.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Sams took issue with Diossa attacking Pryor in her name, saying in an email that she found his answers \"satisfactory and convincing\" and that she \"would never rush Stefan's departure.\"\n\nNevertheless, Diossa went on in the Wednesday news release, accusing Pryor of using the stadium for \"political gain,\" although it was not entirely clear how Pryor is benefitting from a deal now in serious risk of collapse.\n\n\"A now declared candidate for General Treasurer, Mr. Pryor pledged to leave office within two weeks,\" Diossa wrote. \"That time having passed, Mr. Pryor has recklessly clung to power in an attempt to influence the outcome of these negotiations for future political gain.\"\n\nDiossa's partner state Sen. Sandra Cano is Pawtucket's commerce director and is part of Mayor Donald Grebien's team pushing for more state help to rescue the stadium.\n\nGrebien has endorsed Diossa for state treasurer.\n\nPryor could not immediately be reached for comment on Diossa's remarks.\n\nJUNE 8: New mayoral endorsements for Cuervo and LaFortune\n\nFormer Boston Mayor Kim Janey has endorsed Providence mayoral candidate and councilwoman Nirva LaFortune.\n\n\"I know that Councilwoman LaFortune is ready to meet the challenges facing Providence. Nirva has the experience – both professional and lived experience – to hit the ground running on Day One and begin delivering results for the people of Providence,\" Janey said in a statement.\n\nJaney served as Boston's acting mayor in 2021 for eight months, becoming the city's first woman and first Black mayor after former Mayor Marty Walsh joined President Joe Biden's cabinet as secretary of labor.\n\nAnother Providence mayoral hopeful, Gonzalo Cuervo, also added an new endorsement to his list – City Councilwoman Mary Kay Harris, who described Cuervo as capable of leading \"the fight for social and economic justice.\"\n\n\"Gonzalo has been a strong advocate and ally for working families in Providence for decades; as a community leader, small business owner, and within city and state government,\" Harris said. \"He has the experience, vision, and strong community ties to create greater economic opportunities for our youth, families, and neighborhoods.\"\n\nJUNE 7: Rep. Cassar joins ranks of departing state lawmakers\n\nAs the candidate declaration period approaches, a fourth member of the House of Representatives has announced that she is not seeking reelection: Barrington Democrat Liana Cassar, whose district includes a slice of Riverside in East Providence.\n\nA two-term legislator, she waged a short-lived campaign to become House speaker in the fall of 2020, when then-Speaker Nicholas Mattiello was on the ropes. She has led this year's legislative campaign to repeal the ban on state-paid insurance coverage for state workers and Medicaid recipients seeking abortions.\n\nIn an email to colleagues, Cassar wrote: “After careful deliberation, I have decided not to seek re-election. ... The demanding legislative schedule does not leave me able to fully honor my commitments to the House, along with my commitments to my career and my family.\"\n\n\"When my current term is complete at the end of this year, I will miss the daily collaboration. ... [But] be assured that I will remain a strong voice advocating for my community as well as for justice and equity in Rhode Island.”\n\nThree other House Democrats are leaving: Rep. Gregg Amore of East Providence, to run for secretary of state; Rep. Deborah Ruggiero, to run for lieutenant governor; and freshman Steven Lima of Woonsocket, who has endorsed former Rep. Jon Brien, a Democrat-turned-independent, to replace him.\n\nBrien last served in the House in 2012. He had four years on the Woonsocket City Council more recently. Another former Woonsocket councilman, Alex Kithes, running under the Rhode Island Political Cooperative banner, has also announced for Lima's seat.\n\nOn the Senate side, there are three announced departures so far, including Senate Republican leader Dennis Algiere of Westerly. More are expected.\n\nTwo Democrats candidates so far have announced for the seat that Algiere has held for close to three decades: Victoria Gu and Michael Niemeyer.\n\nForced by redistricting into a potential fight to keep her Senate seat in a district straddling Warwick and Cranston, first-term Sen. Kendra Anderson also chose to bow out. She endorsed Harrison Tuttle, head of the Black Lives Matter Rhode Island Political Action Committee,as her replacement.\n\nAt least one other candidate, former state prosecutor Matt LaMountain, has announced for the seat.\n\nFreshman Sen. Cynthia Mendes, D-East Providence, has opted to run for lieutenant governor. At least two Democrats have expressed an interest in running for the seat: Jeff Britto and Greg Greco.\n\nCandidates have three days, June 27 to 29, to file their official paperwork to run for election to a state or local seat. The primary is Sept. 13 and the general election is Nov. 8. in the September 13 primary and the November 8 general election.\n\nJUNE 3: Raimondo joins former colleague Smiley for campaign event\n\nFormer Gov. Gina Raimondo is set to join mayoral candidate Brett Smiley on Friday, her support marking the highest-level endorsement in the race so far.\n\nRaimondo, who now serves as President Joe Biden's secretary of commerce, is scheduled to appear with Smiley at Farm Fresh Rhode Island, a local nonprofit that organizes farmers markets, among other activities.\n\nSmiley, who served as a top aide to Raimondo during her time as governor, will discuss the her administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an event description.\n\n\"Together, with our colleagues in government, we opened Rhode Island schools during a global pandemic, established statewide testing facilities and built field hospitals,\" a campaign email stated, adding that the duo will \"talk about both what we accomplished and how I will bring those lessons with me as Providence’s next mayor.\"\n\nRaimondo's trip comes not long after Raimondo visited Brown University in March to give a lecture on international affairs.\n\nMAY 31: Ex-mayoral candidate Michael Solomon endorses Brett Smiley\n\nMichael Solomon, who dropped out of Providence's mayoral race earlier this month, endorsed candidate Brett Smiley on Tuesday. He is part of a lengthy list of endorsements the former top aide to Gov. Gina Raimondo has received, several of them from the City Council. That includes Council President John Igliozzi, Councilwoman Jo-Ann Ryan and Councilmen Nicholas Narducci, Michael Correia and Jim Taylor.\n\nCandidate Gonzalo Cuervo has also amassed a list of endorsements from his former boss, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, Central Falls Mayor Maria Rivera, former Central Falls Mayor James Diossa, Providence Councilwoman Rachel Miller and others. Former and current state lawmakers have also endorsed Smiley and Cuervo.\n\nCouncilwoman Nirva LaFortune has endorsements for from Reps. Marcia Ranglin-Vassell and Rebecca Kislak, and Dr. Joanna Brown, who teaches family medicine at Brown University.\n\nMAY 25: Democratic committee chairs endorse challengers over incumbents\n\nA majority of the chairs of 31 Democratic city and town committees have endorsed challengers over Gov. Dan McKee and his appointed lieutenant governor, Sabina Matos.\n\nVoting on Tuesday night, the Association of City and Town Democratic Chairs endorsed term-limited Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea for governor, over McKee, and Rep. Deborah Ruggiero, over Matos, according to Pam Lauria, the chair of the Barrington Democratic Town Committee and vice president of the chairs' association.\n\nThe group also endorsed Stefan Pryor for state treasurer over former Central Falls Mayor James Diossa, only hours after Pryor announced his candidacy, and Rep. Gregg Amore for secretary of state.\n\nThe votes represent a slice of the potential Democratic primary vote in September, but it is unclear how representative they are.\n\nIt has not been disclosed, for example, which cities and towns were represented in the vote, and which were not though Lauria, when asked, said she did not believe the chair of the Providence Democrats participated in the vote.\n\nIt is also unclear how many of the city and town committees have conducted their own votes, and the extent to which their votes matched those of their chairs.\n\nFor example, the Democrats on the Barrington committee endorsed Matos over Ruggiero, according to a list provided by Lauria. She said she was only aware of two that have voted so far, including her own.\n\nAccording to one account: Gorbea captured 17 of the 31 chairs voting, McKee 12 while two votes went elsewhere.\n\nAsked what he made of the endorsement by the association of chairs, McKee on Wednesday said: \"I don't make much of it.\"\n\nHe said the communities that were \"supporting us there...[are those] with populations that are very large,\" and \"communities with the largest populations in the state of Rhode Island are very supportive of me.\"\n\nMAY 16: Foulkes hits the air with first TV ad\n\nThe election-year air war is about to heat up with Democratic candidate for governor Helena Buonanno Foulkes -- sitting on the largest campaign bank balance of anyone in the race -- set to run her first television commercial.\n\nThe one-minute ad called \"Big Things\" focuses on the former CVS executive's biography and briefly touches on her main policy plans.\n\n\"I'm Helena Foulkes. Let's get big things done for Rhode Island,\" she says at the end of the ad as the camera pans from downtown Providence to the State House.\n\nCampaign watchers have been wondering when Foulkes would start advertising because of her sizable campaign war chest, but relatively low political profile, having never run for elected office before.\n\nAt the end of March, Foulkes reported $1.5 million in her campaign account.\n\nShe has hired veteran ad producer Tad Devine.\n\nRepublican Ashley Kalus, who is also new to politics, was the first gubernatorial candidate to hit the airwaves when she began advertising last month.\n\nMAY 12: Gorbea wins first union endorsement, while Foulkes doubles down on abortion funding\n\nWhile Helena Foulkes nudged Gov. Dan McKee on Thursday to take more aggressive action on abortion funding, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea - announced her first union endorsement.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Ashley Kalus - the only candidate in the governor's race with TV ads so far - aired a new commercial stating her goals, without a lot of specifics on how she would get there. Among her goals: \"creating a world class education system.\"\n\nOn the endorsement front: \"Nellie Gorbea has and will continue to be a friend of workers and our union,\" said Derek Dunne with the United Steelworkers Local 12431 out of District 4 in a statement made public by the Gorbea campaign.\n\nThe union mentioned Democrat Gorbea's focus on \"creating good paying jobs through significant investment in sustainable housing and growing the blue economy.\"\n\nWith earlier endorsements from EMILY's List and the Latino Victory Fund, Gorbea has a ways to catch up with McKee.\n\nOn March 10, the McKee campaign announced endorsements from a coalition of construction unions and the powerful Laborers' International Union.\n\nThat included an endorsement from the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council representing 17 unions and the Rhode Island Laborers’ District Council.\n\nOn abortion, there is no major policy difference between Foulkes, a former CVS executive, and McKee.\n\nBut Foulkes on Thursday called on McKee to \"immediately submit a revised budget to the General Assembly that eliminates bans on abortion coverage\" for state workers and Medicaid recipients. .\n\n\"Abortion is healthcare and must be accessible for all, regardless of how much money you make or how you get health insurance,\" said Foulkes, accusing McKee of failing - in his then role as lieutenant governor - \"to lead in support'' of the 2019 law enshrining abortion rights in state law.\n\nThe McKee campaign declined comment. But soon after the potential repeal by the U.S. Supreme Court of the landmark Roe V. Wade abortion rights decision went public, McKee announced his \"full support\" for a pending bill to remove the restrictions on state-paid insurance coverage for abortions.\n\n\"He urges the General Assembly to pass this bill and send it to his desk for signature,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\nMAY 9: The race heats up between Gorbea and Foulkes with exchange of digs\n\nWithout once mentioning the name of former CVS executive Helena Foulkes, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea tried Monday to link her fellow contender for governor to the potentially imminent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the landmark abortion-rights decision Roe v. Wade.\n\nGorbea fired off a fundraising email centered on Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell's role in shaping the current makeup of the court.\n\nIn an earlier tweet, she said: \"Reminder that Mitch McConnell stole a Supreme Court seat which helped make [this] horrifying news possible. Which is just one in a very long list of reasons why donating to Mitch McConnell is never okay and inexcusable for someone who wants to be governor of RI.\"\n\nElaborating in a fundraising email that went out Monday, the Gorbea campaign said: \"McConnell has always been anti-choice and has spent decades reshaping our courts to ban abortion.\n\n\"That’s why it’s so shocking that Nellie’s wealthiest opponent personally contributed to his re-election campaign. ... This isn’t behavior we should accept from our next Democratic Governor of Rhode Island — and that’s why we need your support to win this race.\"\n\nFoulkes has acknowledged and publicly stated her regret for donating $500 to McConnell in 2014, about six months before Republicans took control of the Senate in midterm elections and McConnell became majority leader. She was head of CVS Health's pharmacy empire at the time.\n\nThe response from Foulkes spokeswoman Audrey Lucas to Gorbea: \"It is extremely disappointing that at a moment when reproductive rights are literally being taken away from women across the country, Secretary Gorbea would choose to attack a strongly pro-choice candidate.\n\n\"Sadly, this is typical for career politicians who spend their time launching attacks on their opponents rather than getting things done for Rhode Islanders.\n\n\"It’s also an interesting line of criticism coming from the Secretary, who started her career working for a Republican governor, refused to endorse Rhode Island’s first woman governor in her re-election, and knocked doors to help elect the pro-life Speaker of the House who prevented Rhode Island from codifying Roe v. Wade into state law for years.\"\n\nThe response alluded to an online photo of Gorbea knocking on doors on the campaign trail with then-House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello.\n\nIn response to earlier questions about the McConnell contribution, Foulkes said:\n\n\"Over the years I've made campaign contributions – mostly to Democrats, but to some Republicans, too – because, like most Rhode Islanders, I wanted a government where people from both parties could work together and get things done.\n\n\"One of the last Republicans I contributed to many years ago was Mitch McConnell and it's something I deeply regret and would never do again,\" she continued. \"It was before he colluded with Donald Trump to destroy the Supreme Court and more. I sincerely apologize.\"\n\nAPRIL 29: Gorbea says she leads the RI governor's race, according her pollster\n\nSecretary of State Nellie Gorbea says a poll conducted by her campaign shows she is the frontrunner in the Democratic gubernatorial primary.\n\nLake Research Partners, Gorbea's polling firm, released a polling memo Friday saying Gorbea had the support of 30% of the voters surveyed in a poll conducted earlier this month, compared to 24% for Gov. Dan McKee, 10% for former Secretary of State Matt Brown, 7% for former CVS executive Helena Buonanno Foulkes and 1% for Luis-Daniel Muñoz.\n\nTwenty-six percent of voters polled were undecided, the memo said. The full poll was not\n\nThe poll was conducted April 11 to 14 on both cell phones and landlines of 600 likely Democratic primary voters, the Lake polling memo said.\n\nLake Research Partners is the polling firm of longtime Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.\n\nWhen Lake last polled the field, McKee led the field with 26% of the vote, the memo said.\n\nGorbea's poll said 55% of respondents had a favorable opinion of Gorbea compared with 48% for McKee, according to the memo.\n\nAPRIL 28: McKee's approval rate drops to 42% in new poll\n\nGov. Dan McKee's popularity has fallen dramatically since last year, according to a new online poll released Thursday that said 42% of Rhode Island voters approve of the job he is doing and 40% disapprove.\n\nLast fall, 60% of surveyed voters approved of the job McKee was doing and only 25% disapproved, according to Morning Consult. The 48th\n\nThe 18 percentage point drop in McKee's approval rating was the largest of any governor, Morning Consult said. And only two governors, Kate Brown of Oregon and David Ige of Hawaii, posted lower approval ratings.\n\nMassachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker retained the highest approval rating in the nation -- 74% -- in the survey, which was conducted from Jan. 1 to March 31 and included \"at least 601 registered voters in each state.\" Baker's disapproval rating was 21%.\n\nConnecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont posted the 18th highest approval rating at 57%, with 35% disapproving of the job he is doing.\n\nAPRIL 21: Segal lands Elizabeth Warren endorsement\n\nA day after he officially launched his campaign for Congress, former State Rep. Segal picked up the endorsement of Massachusetts U.S. Sen. recent presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\"I’ve worked with @DavidSegalRI on plans to level the economic playing field, support a responsible foreign policy, and build a government that Americans can trust to work for them,\" Warren tweeted Thursday morning. \"I’m happy to endorse him for Congress in #RI02 because he’s ready to make change happen.\"\n\nSegal, who co-founded the progressive advocacy group Demand Progress after leaving the General Assembly in 2011, is running on the left of what is now a five-person Democratic primary field to replace retiring Rep. Jim Langevin in the second congressional district.\n\nAPRIL 20: GOP candidate for RI governor, Ashley Kalus airing first TV ads of campaign season\n\nPROVIDENCE — Ashley Kalus, the Republican candidate for governor, has purchased roughly $109,000 of airtime in Rhode Island for the first TV ads of the '22 campaign season and separately, gone on the attack against R.I.'s political establishment.\n\nThe ad buy - scheduled to run Wednesday through April 26 - was first reported by the local CBS affiliate, WPRI, and confirmed by Kalus' Ohio-based media buying firm, Medium Buying. It is scheduled to run on \"broadcast, cable, radio and regional sports\" networks, according to the firm.\n\nThe 60-second TV ad echoes the video clip Kalus, a relative newcomer to Rhode Island, released to introduce herself to her new home state when she announced for governor, including her declaration that the days of \"I know a guy\" are over.\n\nShe sent a link to the ad to members of the Republican State Central Committee on Tuesday night, along with an email that said, in part: \"Big News!\"\n\n\"I wanted you to be the first to know that we are taking our campaign across all media fronts tomorrow. Since we launched last month, we have campaigned through almost every city and town across Rhode Island.\n\n\"We are going to campaign just as hard in Providence and Pawtucket as we are in Warwick and Cranston. For too long, Democrats have taken the Black and Hispanic vote for granted and I plan on fighting for everyone’s vote.\"\n\nFrom there she launched into an attack on the \"career politicians and insiders [who] have taken advantage of the taxpayers.\"\n\n\"Rhode Islanders foot the bill so insiders can line their own pockets,'' she wrote. \"Just the latest examples are the failed merger of Lifespan and Care New England, handing out $3,000 bonuses to politically appointed judges, and now the proposed corporate welfare for the Superman Building.\"\n\n\"I'm going to the Statehouse to shake things up!\" she said, in her email, not the ad.\n\nFor the record, the $3,000 bonuses for judges were awarded by the Chief Justice of the R.I. Supreme Court, not Gov. Dan McKee, the Democrat she hopes to replace. But the award came to light after McKee awarded like-sized \"retention bonuses to unionized employees across state government.\n\nAPRIL 18: Gorbea releases 10 years of tax filings, asks competitors in race for governor to do same\n\nPROVIDENCE — Rhode Island's term-limited Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea on Monday made 10 years of her tax filings public, and called on her opponents in the race for governor to do the same.\n\nThere has been no direct response to that late-day challenge from incumbent Gov. Dan McKee, who was headed out-of-state to a Democratic governor's conference on Monday, or the other candidates in the race.\n\nWith two exceptions, all of Gorbea's competitors have released their own tax returns annually, to one degree or another, but none going back 10 years.\n\nThe two exceptions: dark horse Democratic candidate Luis-Daniel Munoz, who declined to do so in the past, and Republican candidate Ashley Kalus who has not yet responded to Journal inquiries on Monday on her willingness to make her tax filings public.\n\nAs a starting point, Gorbea made public the top pages of her filings as she has done before during her years in state office - but did so for a ten-year period that extends back to a point before she held elected office.\n\nMost recently, she and her husband, Steven L. DHondt paid $60,127 in federal taxes and $16,818 in state taxes to Rhode Island on their adjusted gross income of $325,666.\n\nHer campaign said copies of her full return would be made available to the media upon request.\n\nExplaining her own decision to release 10 years of tax filings, Gorbea said: \"Rhode Islanders deserve nothing less than full transparency from their elected officials—especially from anyone who is seeking to lead the state.\n\n\"This shouldn’t be complicated,” she said.\n\n“As gubernatorial candidates, we are asking Rhode Islanders for their trust to run our state. They deserve to know how much we are paid, any potential conflicts of interest, and then how much we paid in state and federal taxes.\n\n\"Too many voters are cynical and disillusioned,\" she said. \"It’s not healthy for our politics locally or our democracy as a whole. I’m committed to transparency and accountability.\"\n\nAPRIL 15: Lt. Gov. Matos touts endorsements- 'an American success story'\n\nPROVIDENCE — A day after her official campaign launch, Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos is touting a swath of endorsements from the labor and political world, including Armand Sabitoni, the general-secretary- treasurer of the Laborers International Union of North America.\n\nOne of her two Democratic primary opponents - Rep. Deborah Ruggiero - has captured the endorsement of many of her House colleagues, including the speaker who has an outsized voice over the state Democratic Party endorsement...\n\nBut Matos - who highlights her status as \"the first Black woman to hold statewide office in Rhode Island\" - on Friday announced endorsements from the governor and nine state lawmakers - including Senate Majority Whip Maryellen Goodwin and Rep. Grace Diaz, the vice-chair of the state Democratic Party,\n\nOthers on the list of people endorsing Matos - who was the president of the Providence City Council until Gov. Dan McKee appointed her lieutenant governor a year ago - include the mayors of East Providence, Pawtucket, North Providence and Newport and former Providence Mayor Angel Tavares.\n\n\"Like many of our members, Sabina Matos is an American success story,\" said Michael Sabitoni, chairman of the Rhode Island Council of Building Trades.\n\nRecalling her history as an immigrant from the Dominican Republic 28 years ago who became the president of the Providence City Council before her appointment to lieutenant governor, Sabitoni said:\n\n“While on the council, she championed the passage of numerous ordinances promoting economic development for Providence residents and their families... She shattered a glass ceiling long overdue for smashing, and uses her office every day to advocate for all Rhode Islanders.\" (Michael and Armand Sabitoni are cousins.)\n\nOther union leaders on the list are affiliated with SEIU Local 580 and the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades.\n\nMatos also picked up an endorsement from former state Democratic Party chairman Bill Lynch.\n\nMatos is seeking election for the first time to the job to which she was appointed by McKee after he ascended from lieutenant governor on March 2, 2021 on the heels of Gina Raimondo's resignation to take a Biden cabinet post.\n\nShe is competing with Ruggiero and state Sen. Cynthia Mendes for the Democratic nomination.\n\nAPRIL 14:\n\nCandidate Michael Neary issued a statement Thursday from Columbus, Ohio, confirming his intent to stay in the race for Rhode Island's 2nd Congressional District seat despite his recent arrest on charges of drug possession and \"menacing\" an Ohio couple on an interstate.\n\n\"I am currently seeking medical and mental health treatment and have been referred to a neurologist for a possible non-Epileptic seizure-related condition,'' Neary said in his statement, affirming his plans to remain in the Congressional race \"all the way to the September primary.\"\n\n\"I know there are many questions surrounding recent news reports, and a full statement will be forthcoming in the coming days,\" he said. .\n\nThe Ohio couple told authorities they were \"scared for their life\" after a bizarre run-in with Neary on the road the morning of March 23, according to an arrest report released by the Miami County Sheriff's Office.\n\nNeary pleaded not guilty to the charges, was released on $2,500 bond and ordered to appear in court for a pretrial conference on April 21, according to court records.\n\nAsked Thursday to clarify his situation, Neary said: \"I changed my voter registration some time ago and have been staying with my parents in Coventry while trying to find a permanent living situation in town.\"\n\nBut, \"I am currently in Columbus where ... I am actively seeking medical treatment. ... That is where I am right now and what I am currently doing before I can return home to Rhode Island permanently.\"\n\nThe Ohio couple described being followed by a vehicle that sped up, slowed down and exited the highway when they did, more than once.\n\nWhen the authorities caught up with him, \"Mr. Neary appeared to be nervous, his eyes were bloodshot and he was talking fast,\" the report said.\n\nNeary initially told deputies that he had known the driver of the car that he was following, but then changed his story and said that he was \"drawn to the Ohio registration on that vehicle,\" according to the police report.\n\nNeary reportedly told police that he \"recently has been stressed and went out for a drive to clear his head,\" that he had been staying with his parents in Rhode Island and had a big argument with them before he left.\n\nNeary allowed police to search his 2017 Hyundai Elantra, which is registered to a Columbus address. According to the report, police found a half-empty bottle of whisky, a clear plastic container containing baggies of marijuana, a ceramic pipe and a grinder.\n\nBefore his arrest, Neary told The Providence Journal that he was a sixth-generation Rhode Islander who had grown up in Coventry but had recently been living in Ohio.\n\nIn his statement on Thursday, Neary said this is the first time he has ever been arrested,, \"so I am also focused on addressing the Misdemeanor charges here in Ohio.\" In the interim, he said: \"steps have been taken to retain legal counsel.\"\n\n\"While these have been a difficult few weeks for our family as we deal with various private matters together, the stories we have heard from Rhode Islanders about the problems they are facing in their everyday lives over the last several months is my only motivation to continue this campaign.\"\n\nAPRIL 14:\n\nFoulkes reports raising $1.3 million in first quarter\n\nFormer CVS executive Helena Buonanno Foulkes' campaign said Thursday she raised $1.3 million in the first three months of the year, the largest quarterly fundraising total claimed by any of the candidates for governor so far.\n\nFoulkes' first-quarter fundraising includes $900,000 in donations and a $400,000 personal loan to her campaign, spokeswoman Audrey Lucas said. She said \"nearly half\" of the contributions came from new donors.\n\nThe $1.3-million tally should give Foulkes the financial edge in the battle for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, she raised $973,000 from donors and put $100,000 of her own money into the race, which at the time was the largest fundraising quarter of the race.\n\nGov. Dan McKee's campaign said he raised over $400,000 in the first quarter of this year.\n\nSecretary of State Nellie Gorbea and former secretary of state Matt Brown have not shared any details of their first-quarter fundraising yet.\n\nOn the Republican side, Ashley Kalus two weeks ago announced that she had loaned her campaign $500,000 of her own money.\n\nRhode Island candidates have until the end of the month to file their official campaign finance reports.\n\nThose reports will include how much each of the candidates have spent as well as a breakdown of their donors.\n\n“Every day our campaign gets stronger as Helena meets Rhode Islanders all across the state and shares her positive vision to transform our public schools, make it more affordable to live in Rhode Island and create great jobs for all,” Lucas said in a news release. “We are so grateful for the support we’ve received, which will allow us to get our message out to voters and position us to win this race.”\n\nAPRIL 8:\n\nLt. Gov. Sabina Matos assembles election campaign team\n\nLt. Gov. Sabina Matos will make it official on Thursday that she is running for election to the job to which she was appointed by Gov. Dan McKee last spring after his own blink-of-the eye ascension to governor..\n\nIn a news release that went out Friday afternoon, Matos – the first Afro-Latina to hold statewide office in Rhode Island – also named the key members of her campaign team. They include many familiar names.\n\n\"When I came to Rhode Island as a 20-year-old immigrant from the Dominican Republic, I never thought I would run for public office, much less serve as Lieutenant Governor,\" she said, according to the news release.\n\n\"But in America, anything is possible. Now I’m working to fix systemic injustices and make sure everyone has the same opportunities I did. I understand the challenges facing Rhode Islanders because they’re mine as well. I’m running for Lieutenant Governor because Rhode Islanders deserve a champion that puts them first.”\n\nHer campaign hires include:\n\n*Kristina Contreras Fox as campaign manager. Contreras Fox most recently led policy and advocacy efforts for the Rhode Island Coalition for the Homeless, and before that was field director for Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza's campaign. .\n\n*Mike Raia of Half Street Strategic Consulting, as senior advisor for communications. Raia did a turn as Gov. Gina Raimondo's communications director and also served as a senior advisor to Raimondo’s 2018 reelection campaign.\n\n*Pete Brodnitz of Expedition Strategies as the campaign’s research consultant. Brodnitz did polling for Raimondo, consulted on both of her winning campaigns for governor and led the research operation for Attorney General Peter Neronha’s campaign in 2018.\n\n*Tierney Hunt and Matt Burgess of The New Media Firm as the leads on Matos's television, digital and radio advertising efforts. Hunt and Burgess have worked on a number of notable Democratic and progressive campaigns, including efforts for EMILY’s List and Planned Parenthood Votes.\n\nDemocrat Matos, the former president of the Providence City Council, was appointed by McKee to replace himself as lieutenant governor when Raimondo left for a Biden Cabinet post, and he was automatically elevated to governor.\n\nMatos faces two Democratic challengers so far, state Rep. Deb Ruggiero and state Sen. Cynthia Mendes.\n\nAPRIL 6:\n\nHouse speaker endorses Rep. Ruggiero's campaign for lieutenant governor\n\nIf Gov. Dan McKee was hoping state Democratic Party leaders would endorse his hand-picked lieutenant governor, the chances dimmed Wednesday when House Speaker Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi endorsed a House colleague instead.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rep. Deb Ruggiero's campaign announced that she had picked up the endorsements of Shekarchi and 35 other Democratic office-holders and activists, including the House Majority Leader Christopher Blazejewski and Majority Whip Katherine Kazarian, and 10 other House colleagues.\n\nWhoever is House speaker traditionally has an outsized voice in who gets the state Democratic Committee endorsement, because the majority of the members are appointed by House District Committees, whose members are themselves appointed by state representatives who, in turn, have elected the speaker as their leader.\n\nIn this case, Shekarchi endorsed Ruggiero over the incumbent, Sabina Matos, who was appointed by McKee to take his place after then-Gov. Gina Raimondo resigned for a post in the Biden Cabinet last year. State Sen. Cynthia Mendes is also running for the Democratic nomination.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday morning, Ruggiero told The Journal she does not intend to seek the state Democratic Party's endorsement. \"I am going to stay in my lane, run my race, stay focused and positive ... and do the work I need to do.\n\n\"I don't want this to be divisive,\" she said.\n\nOne potential outcome – seen before – is that the state party opts for neutrality in a race that pits that governor's choice against the speaker's.\n\nIn a statement accompanying Wednesday's announcement, Shekarchi said he was \"proudly\" endorsing Ruggiero, with whom he has worked since he was first elected 10 years ago.\n\n\"She is an extremely dedicated, hard-working and honest public servant. As a long-time member of the House Finance Committee, Deb has a great understanding of state government and she is highly qualified to hit the ground running from Day One,\" he said.\n\nRuggiero has represented House District 74, encompassing Jamestown and Middletown, for the past 14 years and currently chairs the House Committee on Innovation, Internet, and Technology and has a seat on the House Finance Committee.\n\nIn other campaign news, Democrat McKee picked up the endorsement of two other private-sector unions: the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Locals 99 and 2323, which together say they represent about 2,850 current and retired electrical and telecom workers.\n\nMcKee \"has been a strong ally for our members and all people who work with their hands for a living. Coming into office during one of the most challenging moments in our state’s history, [he] rolled up his sleeves and focused on keeping our economy open and getting people back to work,\" said Joe Walsh Jr., IBEW Local 99 business manager.\n\n“Governor McKee has been put to the test in his first year in office – leading our state through a difficult public health and economic crisis – and has earned re-election,\" echoed Christopher Buffery, IBEW Local 2323 business manager.\n\nThe two locals join the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council, the Laborers’ District Council, and seven mayors and town administrators in endorsing McKee's election bid.\n\nAPRIL 4:\n\nCongressional candidates tout big Q1 fundraising totals\n\nSarah Morgenthau's and Allan Fung's congressional campaigns said Monday they've raised more than $500,000 in the first three months of the year, while Seth Magaziner said he's pulled in $1.4 million over that period.\n\nOn Tuesday Democrat Joy Fox, a former staffer to U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin and Gina Raimondo, said she had raised \"more than $175,000 from 406 contributions since launching in February.\"\n\nFormer state Rep. David Segal, who is officially still exploring getting in the second district Democratic primary, said he raised $252,000 since late February.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Republican state Sen.

The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Having less white matter can slow the brain’s ability to process information, pay attention and remember. Lower levels of white matter have also been connected to psychiatric issues such as depression, anxiety and irritability.\n\n“This new study is particularly interesting in showing the extent to which white matter, which is required for neurons to connect with each other, is affected by medication use,” said Thomas Ritz, a professor of psychology at Southern Methodist University who has researched the impact of steroids on people with asthma. He was not involved in the study.\n\nHowever, “there’s no reason for alarm,” said neuroimmunologist Dr. Avindra Nath, the clinical director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, who was also not involved in the study. Doctors have long known that, if you give patients steroids, “the brain does shrink, but when you take them off the steroids, it comes back,” Nath said.\n\nDue to brain plasticity – the ability of the brain to reorganize its structure, functions or connections – “these could be temporary effects,” he said. “They don’t necessarily have to be permanent. White matter can repair itself.”\n\nWidespread use\n\nGlucocorticoids are some of the most frequently prescribed anti-inflammatory medications due to their widespread use in a number of conditions, experts say.\n\nIn addition to asthma, both oral and inhaled glucocorticoids can be used to treat allergies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Crohn’s disease and other types of inflammatory bowel disease, eczema and other skin conditions, lupus, tendinitis, multiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nDon't confuse glucocorticoid inhalers like this with rescue inhalers, which contain a different type of medication. Peter Dazeley/The Image Bank RF/Getty Images\n\nHowever, glucocorticoid inhalers should not be confused with quick-relief inhalers used to stop an asthma attack. Quick-relief inhalers contain non-steroid medications that relax the muscles in the lungs, such as albuterol, levalbuterol and pirbuterol, which can open airways in minutes. Inhaled corticosteroids do not work in emergencies – they are prescribed for longer-term control of inflammatory conditions.\n\nPrior research has linked the long-term use of oral glucocorticoids to structural brain abnormalities and shrinkage of certain areas of the brain, as well as mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, confusion and disorientation. Studies have also shown that people who have lived with asthma have higher rates of cognitive and memory impairment later in life than people without the condition.\n\nBut much prior research has been small in scale, and at times, inconclusive, experts say.\n\nThe new study used data from the UK BioBank, a large biomedical research center that followed 500,000 residents of the United Kingdom from 2006 to 2010. From that database, the researchers were able to find 222 oral glucocorticoid users and 557 users of inhaled glucocorticoids who did not have a previous diagnosis of any neurological, hormonal or mental health disorder.\n\nThose people underwent cognitive and mental health testing and received a diffusion MRI of the brain. Researchers pulled that data and compared those MRI and cognitive findings to over 24,000 people in the database who did not use steroids.\n\n“To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study to date assessing the association between glucocorticoid use and brain structure, and the first to investigate these associations in inhaled glucocorticoid users,” wrote the study authors.\n\nInhalers had smallest impact\n\nThe study found the greatest amount of white matter damage in people who use oral steroids regularly over long periods of time. The mental processing speed of chronic oral steroid users tested lower than non-users. People on oral steroids also had more apathy, depression, fatigue and restlessness than non-users of steroids.\n\nThe smallest impact on white matter occurred in people who use inhaled steroids, the study found.\n\nThat fits with what doctors see in clinical practice, said pulmonologist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“We don’t see side effects as often with the inhaled form of glucocorticoids,” he said. “And of course, mainstay of therapy for allergies and asthma is always going to be avoiding the triggers and making lifestyle modifications.”\n\nPulmonologists and rheumatologists are cautious about prescribing the smallest dose of steroids needed to control symptoms, Dasgupta said, due to the large number of side effects from steroid use that can also impact health, including brain health.\n\n“As a clinician, the minute you start a person on these medications, you’re immediately thinking, ‘How do I safely take that person off in a timely fashion?’ Steroids cause weight gain, and weight gain is always going to be a risk for developing diabetes and high blood pressure,d” Dasgupta said.\n\n“When you give steroids to people with diabetes, their blood sugar can go up,” he added. “When you take steroids acutely, you could definitely have insomnia and trouble sleeping, and when you’re on long-term steroids, it puts you at a high risk for infections because they are an immunosuppressant.”\n\nMore research needed\n\nThe new study had limitations. For one, it was not able to determine steroid dose or track adherence, Ritz said.\n\n“We know that only about 50% of patients with asthma take their medication as prescribed, and potential overreporting of intake is also an issue,” Ritz said. “You should take your inhaled corticosteroids, which reduce the inflammation locally, as regularly as possible, albeit at the lowest possible dose that allows you to control you asthma.\n\n“This study gives us another reason to keep the dosages low,” he added.\n\nAnother limitation was that it was unable to differentiate between people who take steroid tablets and those who use infusions, according to study authors.\n\n“The study mainly confirms what we know for a long time in asthma management: Take as few systemic (oral) corticosteroids as possible, as long as you are not a patient with severe asthma. Stick to inhaled steroids and discuss with your treating physician plans to step down medication regimens during good times,” Ritz said.\n\n“It’s a very well done study,” Nath said. “But the findings demand another study to be done to see how long these effects last and how they can be reversed.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2023/09/14/prenuvo-full-body-mri-is-it-worth-it/70830562007/", "title": "Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, more recommend Prenuvo MRI. So I ...", "text": "Jennifer Jolly\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nI’m staring at black-and-white images of my brain.\n\n“See this little white dot that almost looks like a star right there?” Diagnostic Radiologist Dr. Sean London asks over Zoom call. He’s sharing his screen with me while we go frame-by-frame over a high-tech, elective, full-body MRI scan I had a few weeks ago. The scan was done by Prenuvo, the company recently touted by stars like Kim Kardashian, her mom Kris Jenner, Paris Hilton and Maria Menunos, to name a few.\n\n“These are really common, and I’m not worried about them,\" London says regarding the markings on my scan. \"Sometimes they’re signs of migraines, or they can be from trauma where these small vessels get injured, and you can kind of think of them like scar tissue,” he pauses to see if I have any questions so far.\n\nI tell him that I used to get horrible migraines and I’ve had several concussions.\n\nFor the next 40 minutes, London takes me on a fascinating tour of the inside of my body, unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before.\n\nI find out that the nagging pain in my right shoulder my primary care physician said was “a sign of age,” is a partially torn rotator cuff. (\"I knew it,\" I think. It happened when I fell off my horse several months ago.)\n\nI also see a smattering of benign cysts; some I know about because I can feel them under my skin, and others, like one behind my left knee, are a complete surprise. None of this worries me, though. It’s a huge relief.\n\nAt 52, I’m strong, healthy, and aging better than ever. There are no signs of cancers, aneurysms or degenerative diseases. Whew.\n\nSeveral of my family members have not been so lucky.\n\nWhy I got a Prenuvo scan\n\nI’m adopted, so genetic medical information has, for the most part, been a massive mystery. But I met my birth mother as an adult, and she was sick. She died a few years ago from lung damage caused by a genetic condition called Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.\n\nThen, about a year and a half ago, I met my half-sisters. One of them has been in remission from breast cancer for 20 years. It came back this summer, and updated DNA tests show it’s hereditary.\n\nNot long after she called to tell me about her diagnosis, I found a lump.\n\nWhen I mentioned all of this at my 10-minute-long annual visit with my primary care physician, she said we could revisit it all next year if I started showing any symptoms.\n\nI didn’t love that answer.\n\nIf an hour-long, non-invasive, safe, full-body scan could give me something even remotely close to a crystal ball look into my health in an empowering versus alarming way, why on earth would I not do it?\n\nMoney.\n\nIs Prenuvo covered by insurance?\n\nI did my scan at Prenuvo in Redwood City, California — right in the heart of Silicon Valley. It’s one of eight current Prenuvo sites operating around the United States and Canada, with 12 more opening over the next year.\n\nThe clinic is like many other spotless spa-like diagnostic centers in an area where the median cost of a home is edging close to $3 million. Scans here start at $1,000. The out-of-pocket cost for the full body scan I had was $2,500.\n\nIt’s a huge cost for the average American, and insurance doesn’t cover it.\n\nWhat conditions can Prenuvo detect?\n\nPrenuvo says the whole-body scan screens for 500 conditions, including most tumors, aneurysms and cysts. They also say their MRIs show potentially life-saving insights for one out of every 20 people they see. That includes actress and TV host Maria Menounos. She credits Prenuvo with finding her Stage 2 pancreatic cancer after doctors told her the abdominal pain she was having was “nothing.”\n\n“Basically what this is, is a physical exam, but taking pictures of the inside, so it’s just getting a direct insight into your body’s health,” London tells me during a sit-down interview after my scan. “We talk a lot about preventative care, but we don’t see a lot of action. I think this is one way to really contribute toward the whole of preventative care that people are looking for.”\n\nA series of professionally shot video testimonials on YouTube underscore this point. There’s a 47-year old Army vet discovering a Stage 3 tumor in his kidney and a mother of two finding out she has thyroid cancer.\n\nFeedback from everyone I’ve spoken with who has had a Prenuvo scan, including my husband, is overwhelmingly positive. The scan turned up a “shadow” on his pancreas that his primary care team will now monitor.\n\nWhy many doctors advise against getting full-body scans\n\nYou know who doesn’t like them? Many family doctors, radiologists, and specialists who say they often cause more problems than they solve.\n\n“The ‘incidentaloma' is an exponentially growing entity, as more people get imaging that is unnecessary and unwarranted,” spinal surgeon and CMO of Sword Health, Dr. Vijay Yanamadala tells me via email. “It is not only a significant cost to the system, but it also creates significant psychological distress for individuals who now have to deal with potentially months of work-up to conclude that it was an incidental finding. I see this all the time in my patients.”\n\nThe American College of Preventive Medicine recommends against full-body scans in people who don’t have any red-flag symptoms. The American College of Radiology also released a statement earlier this year saying that there’s no “documented evidence that total body screening is cost-efficient or effective in prolonging life.”\n\nBoard-certified orthopedic spine surgeon Dr. Rahul Shah, adds that the lack of standardization in boutique clinics could be a concern as well.\n\n“Unlike established screening tools like mammograms or colonoscopies, there is no standardized protocol for full-body MRI scans in asymptomatic individuals,” Shah wrote in an email. “This lack of standardization can lead to variability in results and recommendations … leading to unnecessary worry, additional testing and potential harm.”\n\nThis kind of scan wouldn’t work for a hypochondriac or someone who isn’t able to hear the intricacies of the findings.\n\nThe bottom line?\n\nFor myself and my husband, this experience alleviated stress and worry.\n\nWhen it comes to proactive versus reactive healthcare, there has to be more modern medicine can do than tell us to exercise and eat right. Especially given that four in 10 people will develop cancer in their lifetime, and studies show women are diagnosed later than men in more than 700 diseases.\n\nWhile this might not save my life right now, it may very well in the future.\n\n“Medicine, as innovative as it is, can take time to move forward,” London says carefully when we talk about these concerns. “We don’t really practice wellness,” he adds. “We’re trying to change that.”\n\nJennifer Jolly is an Emmy Award-winning consumer tech columnist and on-air correspondent.

Dick’s walker hadn’t stopped him, with Barbara by his side, from seeing the palaces of St. Petersburg and the grasslands of Africa. Now Barbara had decided that Dick’s worsening health made those trips impractical.\n\nThen finally, impossible.\n\nJust the night before, Dick talked excitedly about the trip and summer away in a rented condo. Then the next morning, as Barbara packed her last few things, Dick walked into the bathroom and asked what she was doing.\n\n“I’m packing my cosmetics and then I’m ready to go,” Barbara said.\n\n“But those are Barbara's things,” he said.\n\nThe response gave her a chill. The dementia and paranoia she’d maneuvered since Dick’s stroke had suddenly advanced to a new horrific stage where he thought his wife was an impostor.\n\n“It was almost like a psychotic break,” Barbara, 75, says now. “We wound up in the hospital. We never went to Park City. And that was the beginning of the end.”\n\nA series of strokes have left Dick with vascular dementia. He is unaware of his living circumstances and will assume he’s in a hotel. But he does know Barbara, and that’s a small blessing compared to what many spouses and children of dementia patients experience as they see those memories fade in the disease's progression. It took months for Dick to recognize his wife of nearly three decades. Four years later, he’s living in a nursing home near the house overlooking a golf course they purchased in 2000, two years before Dick had his first major stroke. Barbara now drives to visit her husband every day, sometimes more than once.\n\nDementia’s toll goes beyond the patient. Family members who step up to care for these patients often feel overwhelmed due to the increased stress and responsibility.\n\nIn 2011, more than 15 million Americans spent 17.5 billion hours, or an average of just under 22 hours per week, caring for a family member with dementia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAnd it can go on for years. Jerry Sallo can’t count the time spent. He was married to his wife, Jane, for 61 years, and she fought Alzheimer’s for nearly 10 years.\n\n“It’s a gradual, terrible, horrible progression,” says Sallo, 86, whose wife, Jane, died in September after fighting Alzheimer’s disease, the leading form of dementia.\n\nJane was primarily a housewife who raised three kids while staying active in social groups, including terms as president for the family’s temple in Burbank and the local Jewish Family Services.\n\nToward the end, Jane was forgetting her children’s names and calling Jerry “daddy.” She often talked to herself in the mirror. Once, Jerry stood quietly outside the bathroom door and listened. Jane was talking to her long-dead mother.\n\nThe television scared and confused Jane. “Can they see us?” she asked Jerry one day as they sat watching TV.\n\nOne afternoon Jerry came home to find Jane and her caregiver watching reruns of “Will & Grace.” Jane would have never watched the show, but it was safe now because the commercials were so benign. Otherwise, a commercial for “The Walking Dead” might flash on screen and send Jane into a panic.\n\n“This is what you’re dealing with,” Jerry says. “You can’t comprehend it. Nobody who’s not done it can comprehend it.”\n\nDementia covers a group of disorders identified by cognitive impairment and memory loss that typically arise in older adults. Because it’s a range of conditions, the exact prevalence of dementia is hard to pinpoint. But one 2013 analysis estimated that between 5 percent and 7 percent of people 60 and older worldwide have some form of dementia.\n\nAlzheimer’s, the most common cause of dementia in older adults, is characterized by a gradual decline in memory and brain function caused by the buildup of materials in the brain called plaques and tangles. As many as 5.3 million Americans have Alzheimer’s. As the population ages, that number is expected to more than double by 2050.\n\nMedical conditions that affect the brain, including strokes, can cause other forms of permanent dementia. Still, other types are the result of the gradual dying off of brain cells.\n\nWith more people living longer, the number of Americans suffering from dementia is also rising. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, one in three seniors die of some form of dementia.\n\nEach Wednesday morning, Jerry and Barbara have a chance to talk with people who understand. They are both seasoned veterans in a weekly caregivers support group organized by the Alzheimer’s Association that meets in Rancho Mirage.They take their seats in a circle with a dozen people or more, some of whom have become their close friends. Many are caregivers, like Barbara, and usually a spouse. Other members are like Jerry and have lost their wives or husbands, sometimes years ago. One woman, in her 80s, was caring for her son-in-law, in his 70s, and had recently moved him to a nursing home.\n\nConsidering that 40 percent of Alzheimer’s caregivers die from stress-related disorders before the patient dies, according to one Stanford University study, the group makes the health of the caregiver as important as that of the person they’re looking after. The same study found that Alzheimer’s caregivers have a 63 percent higher mortality rate than non-caregivers.\n\nEach person has a chance to talk, vent or query the group. And the topics range from the bureaucracies of insurance and legal matters to the extremely personal. One morning in January, a woman came in hours after the man she’d been with for 15 years died. The group then spent much of the next two hours opening up about their own grieving process.\n\nAnother time, a woman asked what to do now that her dementia-suffering husband was asking to see his brother, whose death she never shared. The group decided it was OK to tell him he must have forgotten the news, but only if he brought up his brother again.\n\nAs a fairly new member, Jerry asked the group what to do about Jane refusing to change her clothes before bed. Let her wear whatever she wants to bed, they told him, this fight was not worth having.\n\nAnother morning, Jerry dragged himself into a meeting after several nights of interrupted sleep. A widow looked him over and said, “Jerry, you look terrible.”\n\nHe couldn’t deny it. “That kind of honesty was helpful,” he says.\n\nCandi Lindig, 60, began attending meetings after her husband, David, was diagnosed with a mixed form of dementia in 2010. She continues to go regularly since David died in October, on his 84th birthday.\n\nThe meetings start at 10 a.m. When they wrap up around noon, Candi is among the members who will often continue talking over lunch. As she dealt with her husband’s disease and how to care for him, the group was Candi’s best resource. She never read any of the many available books or went online seeking answers.\n\n“You don’t know what to trust,” she says. “I trusted the group.”\n\nBruce Lansbury built a career sending shows like “Wonder Woman,” “Mission: Impossible,” and “Knight Rider” into American living rooms starting in the 1960s. His older sister, Angela, starred in “Murder, She Wrote,” which Bruce wrote and produced in the 1990s.\n\nAngela is acting into her 90s. Edgar Lansbury, Bruce’s twin brother, still works as a painter. But Bruce, 86, is now confined to a La Quinta care facility specially geared toward Alzheimer’s patients.\n\n“Bruce used to be one of those guys that did The New York Times crossword puzzle in ink,” his wife, Gail, says. “And now he can’t sign his name.”\n\nWhereas other friends have receded from her life, the support group members understand what’s happening.\n\n“People who have known us as a couple have disappeared,” Gail says.\n\nFriends from out of town would visit, but Bruce couldn’t remember them and conversations were a struggle. And then those friends didn’t want to come back.\n\n“He’s not much of a conversationalist, but he’s listening,” Gail, 73, says.\n\nAlzheimer’s gradually affects a person’s brain function and memory. It is slow and irreversible. Its causes are not fully understood but are believed to involve genetics plus some combination of environmental and lifestyle factors. Activities that stimulate the body and mind are thought to help, and prescription medication can temporarily slow the progression once early symptoms are detected.\n\nBruce’s Alzheimer’s began typically, moments of harmless forgetfulness that could have been considered normal signs of aging. When he couldn’t find his way home in the car or follow Gail’s directions over the phone, she decided Bruce could no longer drive. Those dramatic memory problems distinguish dementia from the normal aging process.\n\nEventually, Bruce couldn’t be left alone, so Gail took him along as she went shopping. He sat in Starbucks drinking coffee while she gathered the groceries. Then Bruce began to fall and was hospitalized after one serious accident. Gail decided she needed help and hired caregivers to be at the house three days a week.\n\nShe no longer had to be with Bruce every hour of every day. Those few hours were her time to do the shopping, see friends, attend the support group.\n\n“You squeeze everything that you have to do into the times that caregivers are there,” she says. “And that gets difficult. You can’t be spontaneous. You can’t go out when you want. You’re kind of held hostage in a way because you need to be there.”\n\nThe caregivers started coming five days a week. After some time, even that wasn’t enough.\n\nGail awoke in bed at 3 a.m. one night and saw Bruce wasn’t in bed. Hysterical, she got dressed and ran out the front door. She found Bruce walking down their street lost and completely naked. “I’m so glad you’re here,” he said to her, without any sign of concern. “I couldn’t find the house. ”\n\nThe trauma pushed Gail to move Bruce into a nursing home about 10 minutes from their house in La Quinta.\n\nCaregivers often say they waited too long before moving a person with dementia into a full-time care location. For Jerry Sallo, the decision came following those many restless nights that were noticeably draining his energy.\n\nThe heavy medications Jane was taking to help her sleep through the night weren’t working. She’d often wake up and wake Jerry in the process. Motion detectors placed in the bedroom helped him know when she was out of bed.\n\nJerry awoke one night around 2 a.m. to Jane screaming. He ran to her in the bathroom and found a geyser of water shooting up from the toilet and Jane soaking wet and yelling. She had removed a piece from the toilet tank causing water to spray everywhere.\n\nJerry shut off the water to the toilet, cleaned up his wife, changed her clothes and mopped up the mess in the bathroom. After trying his hardest to keep Jane at home, he says, the continuous lack of sleep “was really what tipped me over.”\n\nJerry was going out of town for his grand-daughter’s high school graduation. Knowing Jane couldn't travel, he placed Jane in a short-term arrangement known as respite care. What Jerry then thought would be a temporary solution for his wife, turned into a long-term plan.\n\n“I remember after quitting smoking, the temptation to have a cigarette. And after three or four weeks into it, one of the things that would help you is you’d say ‘I’m not going through those three or four weeks again.’” Jerry says. “The pain of placing her, once I’d been through that and had her in a facility, I did not want to go through that again.”\n\nThree months before Jane died, Jerry moved her into hospice care. After making final arrangements for his wife, the funeral director said to Jerry, “This is probably the hardest thing you ever did.”\n\nNo, Jerry said, this was nothing compared to how difficult it was to take Jane out of her home.\n\nDespite her daughter’s urging, Candi Lindig never moved her husband into a nursing home. They argued about it, and though Candi looked into options, she never went through with it and continued to care for David at home until he died.\n\n“It was literally draining the life out of her,” says Gabby Lindig, 26. She was helping care for her father while taking college classes. Up late at night studying for finals, she’d hear him pounding on the bedroom walls.\n\nGabby sees TV ads for the Alzheimer’s drug Namenda XR and gets angry. One ad shows a woman with an older man who could be her father getting ice cream, playing outdoors with kids, and talking to doctors. She places a green capsule in the palm of his hand. The whole thing is slow paced and calming.\n\n“That’s not how it is at all,” Gabby said. “It’s the most stressful thing ever.”\n\nGabby was able to stay home with her father while Candi was out of the house. The family eventually used David's veterans benefits to bring caregivers to the house four hours a day and then hired full-time care in the final weeks of David’s life.\n\nCandi admits that she wanted to keep David at home for somewhat selfish reasons, but she had to consider what impact moving him would have on the family’s finances. David lived longer because he stayed in his house, Candi believes.\n\n“He was very much a social person but also a homebody,” Candi says. “He liked his surroundings. He liked his familiar things around him. I think that’s what helped him.”\n\nJerry remembers his wife first showing signs of Alzheimer’s about eight or nine years ago. Jane struggled playing with her granddaughters, and eventually her children asked Jerry what was wrong with mom. Then friends outside of the family noticed. When Jane was having trouble keeping up with her moshang club, she voluntarily quit before the other women asked her to stop.\n\n“She never admitted she had Alzheimer’s out loud, but I think she kind of knew it inside,” Jerry says. “That had a good and bad side. The bad side is that we never really had a chance to say goodbye (and) we never had a chance to talk about what was happening. The good side is maybe she didn’t really know what was happening to her.”\n\nJane adamantly refused to undergo brain scans that would have helped diagnose what was happening to her, but did relent to questions from a neurologist.\n\nAt the hospital, the doctor asked Jane where she was. She didn’t answer right away.\n\n“He wants to know the name of the hospital,” Jerry said, helping his wife.\n\nJane knew that answer: Eisenhower.\n\nBut the doctor knew better than to stop there. “Who was Eisenhower?” he asked.\n\nDementia care: when staying home is no longer an option\n\nJane, who got married the same year Dwight Eisenhower assumed the presidency, had no idea what the name meant.\n\nDavid Lindig’s memory problems also began as minor annoyances. Once a bottle of Windex ended up in the refrigerator. Then in 2008, he forgot to make the house payment and they were hit with a late charge.\n\nCandi asked her husband what happened and he seemed indifferent. The statement was on his desk but he never bothered to mail the check.\n\n“I started to take over the bills then,” she says.\n\nMoney caused other problems. Even if David didn’t retain a sense of its value, he wanted to have it.\n\nDavid would go to the ATM and withdraw large amounts of cash. When he could no longer drive, he convinced friends or neighbors to take him to the bank, telling them Candi knew what he was doing.\n\nOnce, Candi was struggling to balance the checking account. She came up $400 short. She asked David about it and he denied knowing anything.\n\nThat night, while David was sleeping, she checked his wallet. Inside was the missing $400.\n\nThe workaround the family devised for David’s money fixation was to give him small bills. Ten dollars, just in singles, was all it took. In David’s birthday card, he got $1 bills, but he thought it was a fortune.\n\n“They get to the point when they need to be watched just like a child,” Candi says.\n\nThese were the kinds of special accommodations needed for a former U.S. Army man who served in Korea and specialized in juggling multiple roles. He found joy flying commercial airplanes and at one point ran a hot dog cart in San Diego and even appeared in a few films. While living in Ramona he answered a casting call for extras and ended up on screen in \"Titanic.\"\n\nWhen Candi was laid off from her job managing a retail store, she decided to stay home and care for David instead of going back to work. Losing her paycheck added to the the family’s financial strain, even with the veteran’s medical benefits David received.\n\n“I could have gotten a job somewhere else as a manager or assistant manager, but I have no regrets because I got to spend more time with him,” she says.\n\nA simple treat would be taking David to Walmart. He’d get a haircut and some exercise walking around with Candi as she did the shopping.\n\nWhile most members of the support group are retirees who have managed to afford to place their loved ones or bring in some level of part-time in-home care, some talk about the added stress of having to balance a work schedule on top of everything else. A woman who took her husband to daycare while she worked shifts at a department store admitted feeling guilty about taking him there even when she has a day off.\n\nGail Lansbury feels lucky to have the help of her famous sister-in-law. “I certainly couldn’t do it myself,” she says. “It would take up all of my savings and everything we’ve worked for.”\n\nAt support group meetings, the stories of people struggling with finances are a reminder for Barbara Marks that, despite her own challenges with Dick, money hasn’t been one of them. They met while pursuing business careers in New York City; Barbara was doing promotional work for Lifesavers candy and Dick was the company’s vice president of sales. Dick (“Mr. Lifesavers” to respectful colleagues) continued to consult well past his retirement.\n\n“I’m grateful that we worked really hard, and that we had a really good financial adviser, and that we put money aside when we were younger, and we saved and did all of that because it makes a lot of stuff possible,” Barbara says. “It means that if you’re paying $100,000 to put your husband in a facility then you can do it, and he can be someplace wonderful.”\n\nBarbara describes herself as Dick’s “advocate,” and she consistently reinforces the need for group members to have a similar attitude. It’s a role she’s taken on since Dick’s major stroke, when he was in a coma and she sat in the hospital knitting scarves.\n\nSix days into his coma, she awoke from the realization that her husband had been in his hospital room all of that time without the TV on. A former salesman, Dick was used to having the TV on in his hotel rooms as he traveled. Barbara went straight to the hospital and implored the nurses to keep the TV on. About 24 hours later, Dick started to wake up.\n\nThese days, she’s still actively involved in her husband’s care and meets regularly with the nursing home staff to suggest improvements. She brings his laundry home even though the nursing home will do it for a price.\n\n“One thing I’ve learned is that even though my husband is in a facility doesn’t mean I’m out sipping cocktails somewhere.”\n\nBefore Alzheimer’s struck, Bruce and Gail Lansbury would take trips at least twice a year. Now Gail sometimes travels alone, like when she went to New York City for the holidays to see her son and daughter-in-law.\n\n“Bruce is not Bruce,” she says. “He’s a cared for — and very well cared for — love of my life.”\n\nThey met in 1997 when Gail sold Bruce a home in Venice. The connection was immediate, but Gail waited three months after closing escrow to ask him to dinner. Their marriage the following year was the second for both of them. Gail was in her 50s and Bruce was in his 60s.\n\nShe knows it’s corny, but she’s convinced they’re soulmates.\n\n“This was not in my plan for old age, let me tell you,” Gail says. “It’s not called the long goodbye for nothing. It’s a very long process. Bruce is now 86 years old, and he could go another 10 years or more.”\n\nThe grieving process also goes on for years, even before the person with dementia dies. In the support group, the men and women who’ve been through a death talk about the sense of the relief that can come along with the great sadness. Then there’s the finality of it and the realization that it’s time to enter a new stage of life.\n\nJerry’s gradual mourning process with Jane made her death easier to handle than what others might face. He was already used to sleeping alone when she died, but the sadness and the longing are still there.\n\n“When my daughter tells me of the things she’d like to be able to tell her mother, I say, ‘You know, I’m 86 and there are still things I’d like to be able to tell my mother.’ So that never really goes away,” he says.\n\nSomething else that helped him was meeting someone new. Jerry isn’t the only member of the support group to try dating again before a spouse has died. When she started seeing another woman about a year before Jane died, his children were OK with it.\n\n“That has helped me tremendously,” he says of that new relationship, “maybe kept me alive.”\n\nWhen he looks back on dementia and his time with Jane, Jerry sees the lessons learned. One is that he’s capable of doing much more than he ever realized, capable of caring much more than he thought was possible. Another is about anger.\n\n“It’s so easy to be angry with them when they keep asking you the same questions over and over again,” he says. “But I’m very angry at what happened to her, and I’m still angry.”\n\nSpending 15 minutes with Jane was enough time to make Jerry so angry that he would get back to his car, slam the door and fume over what had happened to his wife. Driving home, he called his daughter to talk it out and to hear a familiar voice.\n\n“It wasn’t so much poor me and what happened to me … but the horrible thing that she was going through and my inability to care for her,” he says. “I spent a lot of years taking care of this person and she took care of me. That was our deal.”\n\nBarbara Marks has found comfort in the activities she’s always enjoyed. She’s reading for two book clubs, going to the theater whenever she can and planning trips with her grandchildren.\n\n“I consider myself a wit,” she says, “a widow in training.”\n\nBarbara has been grieving for years. Her husband is still there, but the relationship is slowly dying. Dick knows who she is and still has the same sense of humor Barbara has loved for 30 years, but he’s often confused about where is. He sleeps a lot. His days of world travels are long gone.\n\n“I’ve had all of these other experiences, so I don’t miss having a man in my life because I still have my husband in my life,” Barbara says. “It’s not the same, but a lot of it is he can still get me more than anybody else I’ve ever met.”\n\nThis past Valentine’s Day, Barbara and Dick Marks celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary. Dick, who years ago thought another woman was impersonating his wife, was anticipating the celebration and waiting outside his nursing home for Barbara to arrive.\n\nShe came bearing his favorite foods — barbecue ribs, corn bread and chocolate covered strawberries — and a letter with a message of commitment to their marriage.\n\nShe reminded Dick of their wedding in Florida 30 years ago surrounded by their daughters and siblings, and a justice of the peace from the local traffic court. She reminded Dick of how they renewed their vows for their 20th anniversary with a black tie event and ceremony officiated by rabbi. Their six grand-children attended and harpist played wedding music.\n\n“Today on our 30th anniversary, I once again want to recommit to our marriage.” Barbara recited to Dick that day.\n\n“You are and always will be the great love of my life. I promise to love, honor, respect and cherish you for as long as we both shall live. I will care for you and comfort you in sickness and in health. I will always be here for you.”\n\nMonths after their anniversary, Barbara still carries around a folded up copy of that letter.\n\n“It reminds me of my commitment to him,” she says. “That’s important when things get difficult.\"\n\nHealth and wellness reporter Barrett Newkirk can be reached at (760)778-4767, barrett.newkirk@desertsun.com or on Twitter @barrettnewkirk.

He then captivated national audiences on David Letterman’s late-night talk show, \"Good Morning America\" and a number of his own Emmy-winning animal series that still run in syndication. He traveled the globe as a leading animal conservationist promoting Columbus. It was his home for decades. It’s even where he once said he wanted his ashes spread whenever he passes away.\n\nBut in this moment, none of that history feels familiar.\n\nJack pauses, then asks a question. “Have I ever been to Columbus, Ohio?”\n\nThe Jack Hanna the world once knew is gone.\n\nAt age 76, Alzheimer’s disease has stripped away his memory and the life he led in the public eye for almost a half century. He was first diagnosed in the fall of 2019 with early Alzheimer's but now the disease has advanced to the point where he doesn't know most of his own family.\n\nGone is the old Jack who enchanted nearly everyone he met with his Tennessee farm boy charm and endless funny stories. Gone are the khakis and the worn, leather outback hat that he made famous around the globe.\n\nThe Jack that remains now only remembers his wife Suzi, his dog Brassy and, at times, his oldest daughter Kathaleen when she travels nearly 5,000 miles from England to care for her dad. He spends hours baking himself in the sun on the back deck of his lakeside home. He asks Suzi a couple dozen times a day if she has fed the dog. He worries that the air coming out the vents might be hurting the house or the lights on the Christmas tree might catch everything on fire.\n\nOnce, Jack complained to Suzi that he had gone blind. He kept forgetting he had inserted his contact lenses and his doctor discovered he ended up with five in each eye.\n\nQ&A:Families combating Alzheimer's disease are not alone. What you need to know\n\nJack looks close to the same man who the public adored. But his frame is about 20 pounds lighter, his skin is a darker shade of tan, he wears black-framed glasses to avoid another contact mishap, and the eternal smile has been replaced by a strained, vacant expression. On most days, he dresses himself in jeans, a T-shirt, and an old, tattered, tan baseball hat with a rhino patch from his time working at the Columbus Zoo.\n\nThe couple of 54 years used to travel the world together, but for about two years, their life has been contained to a 30-mile radius in Northwest Montana centered around their house and 50-acre farm.\n\nIn Jack's mind, even the slightest change to his daily routine is the enemy. The continuity of his routine calms a man who has little memory of his previous life. Disruptions to it can cause outbursts of frustration or even anger, usually toward Suzi.\n\nHe and Suzi live the same day over and over. Jack is restless at night and often doesn’t fall asleep until 2 a.m. or later – a common experience for those with Alzheimer's. He rises mid-morning and eats the same breakfast – a bowl of blueberries, three scrambled eggs with cheese in the middle, bacon, tomatoes and two waffles with butter and lots of syrup. They take a late-morning, 2-mile walk. And until very recently, they would visit their farm to feed their two donkeys, but the upkeep is simply too much, so the farm went up for sale last month. There isn’t much else to their days except for Jack slowly moving around the house constantly checking the front door to see if it's locked or inside the washing machine but no one knows why.\n\n“My husband is still in there somewhere,” Suzi said. “There are still those sweet, tender moments – you know, pieces of him that made me and the rest of the world fall in love with him. It’s hard. Real hard some days. But he took care of me all those years, and so it’s my turn to take care of him.”\n\nThis is the first time the Hanna family has spoken publicly about their struggle with a disease that afflicts an estimated 6.7 million people in the United States, according to the Alzheimer's Association. There are about 24 million people worldwide living with Alzheimer's, according to the National Institute on Aging. It is the seventh leading cause of death for adults in the U.S. and is the most common cause of dementia among people over 65, according to the NIA.\n\nThe Hannas are telling Jack's story because they want other families to know they are not alone when the struggle with Alzheimer's feels overwhelming.\n\n“If this helps even one other family, it’s more than worth sharing dad’s story,” Kathaleen said. “He spent a lifetime helping everyone he could. He will never know it or understand it, but he is still doing it now.”\n\nOne walk at a time\n\nA few steps into their daily hike on the river trail about 5 miles from his home, Jack stops at the first tree he sees.\n\n\"Hello tree, you are a pretty tree,\" Jack says. \"I love you tree. God bless.\"\n\nA few steps later he touches the leaves on the next tree and holds his hands out in front of it like a preacher performing a blessing in church. What it means only Jack knows.\n\nA few steps after that, he touches another three. Then another and another. Sometimes Jack tempts fate and scares both Suzi and Kathaleen by reaching too far over the rocky, tree-lined ledge where the Swan River races about 50 feet below.\n\nJack is asked why he touches all the trees, but he just says he loves them and continues down the path.\n\nSuzi said the scene repeats itself nearly every day. It takes more than an hour to go a mile because of all the stops, but Suzi, who is 75, doesn’t care. Jack can still walk pretty well for a man with two knee replacements and Alzheimer’s, and the hikes remind her of the life they used to have. The life that took them all over the world together, giving them experiences with both animals and people from cultures around the world that they couldn't dream about when they fell in love as college sweethearts at Muskingum College.\n\n“I want to hold on to these walks as long as I can,” Suzi said. “I remember the day this all officially started. The day the doctor told us what it was. I’ve just tried to hang on to the little pieces of Jack since then.”\n\nIt was Oct. 3, 2019, when Jack Hanna started shaking his head back and forth in defiance the instant Dr. Douglas Scharre told him he had Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n“No way,” Jack said. “I don’t have that.”\n\nJack had every rationalization at the ready.\n\nIt was just old age. He was famous, even beloved, for his 20-second attention span. He always knew he had attention deficit disorder. His life went 100 mph. He was used to traveling more than 200 days a year. All those tests the doctor had him take must be wrong. Jack always said he was never good at taking tests in school.\n\nScharre, a neurologist and Alzheimer’s specialist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, was kind and positive while explaining the diagnosis to Jack, Suzi, and their daughters, Julie and Suzanne.\n\nScharre explained that the mild cognitive impairment had transformed now into full Alzheimer's. He told the family there was no doubt in his mind that the symptoms that he traced back to 2017 were Alzheimer’s.\n\nJulie cried in disbelief. Suzanne hurt for her dad but wasn’t surprised at all because she had seen symptoms in the past year. Suzi did what she could to comfort Jack, but his mood quickly darkened.\n\nHe lowered his head, stared at the floor and continued to cast doubt on the diagnosis as the devastation set in.\n\n“I know my brain doesn’t work so good sometimes, but I’m OK,” Jack said. “No way, I got this.”\n\nJack didn’t use the word Alzheimer’s that day.\n\nIn fact, he has never uttered it, and those around him didn’t dare use it either.\n\nJack didn’t want the world to know.\n\nAnd when they went back home that night, he made Suzi promise no one outside their family would ever find out.\n\nSuzi said Jack was worried that if the public found out he had the disease his career would be over, and he wasn't ready to stop working.\n\n“People will think I’m dumb, Sue,” Jack said. “We can’t tell anyone Sue. Promise me.”\n\nSuzi vowed to her husband she would keep the diagnosis secret.\n\nThe family didn’t ask Scharre about life expectancy. But the Alzheimer’s expert said that people with Jack’s diagnosis live typically between eight and 12 years after first showing symptoms.\n\nScharre said Jack’s reaction was not out of the ordinary.\n\n“It was fairly typical, nothing dramatic,” Scharre said. “Most Alzheimer’s patients have a bit of denial. The thinking is, ‘Yeah, I am a little forgetful, but so is everyone else.’”\n\nBut the reality is those within Jack’s world already suspected he had something much more than forgetfulness in the months before his diagnosis.\n\nJack's family and friends said there were times leading up to the diagnosis when Jack would forget what city he was in or what he was doing that day. When he would get on stage for his traveling animal shows, he would sometimes forget names and even details about the animals that were his life. Few on the planet had more passion for educating the public about the animals and taking them to their habitats through the power of his television shows.\n\nThere was another time in early 2019 when he was supposed to introduce an old friend who was receiving an award. But when he got on stage, he forgot why he was there.\n\nHis family, friends and those who worked with Jack would cover for him by speaking for him or reminding him where he was or what he was supposed to be doing at that moment.\n\nThey were used to Jack’s mind racing from one thing to the next without worrying about details, but this was something different.\n\nGuy Nickerson, Jack’s longtime friend and business partner, first noticed Jack’s decline while they were producing some of the last episodes of Jack’s popular \"Into the Wild\" television show in the fall of 2018. On a trip in Rwanda, Nickerson explained to Jack all of the details of who they were meeting and when they were going to see the gorillas. Three minutes later, Jack asked Nickerson the questions he had already answered. Suzi constantly tried to cover for him during filming, but there was only so much she could do.\n\nOn Jack’s last major international trip to South Africa in November of 2019, Nickerson said the man he considers to be somewhere between a father and a brother because of the close relationship, just wasn’t there anymore.\n\n“We had an interview set up with a legend in the animal world and a good friend of Jack’s, and when it started, Jack didn’t know who he was talking with,” said Nickerson, who lives in Tampa, Florida.\n\n“I never said a word to Suzi or Jack, but that felt like the beginning of the end. I didn’t know about the diagnosis until the rest of the world, but I knew something medically had to be wrong. I love Jack so much; it was so hard to watch all of that.”\n\nShortly after the Alzheimer’s diagnosis, Jack quietly started making plans to retreat from public life. His last theater performance with animals on stage was in March 2020, and the COVID pandemic canceled about a half dozen more shows. He publicly announced his plan to retire from the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium after 42 years in June 2020. He formally retired on Dec. 31, 2020.\n\nBack on their river trail walk, Kathaleen tears up recalling how hard it was for her parents to give up their public life while hiding the reason for it.\n\n“He would have worked until the day he died. He only retired due to the Alzheimer’s,” Kathaleen said. “He was embarrassed by it. He lived in fear the public would find out.”\n\n'My teeth are fine'\n\nThe second Jack hears the word dentist, he gets back in the car.\n\nHe needs a permanent crown on one tooth and a cavity dealt with on another.\n\nHe won’t budge from the car seat until Suzi lies to him. She convinces him that she is the one who needs to see the dentist, and he is going to hold her hand.\n\nThe soft, caring husband comes out for a few minutes until Jack sees the dentist chair.\n\nHe knows he is really today’s patient and glares at his wife.\n\n“Sue, my teeth are fine,” Jack says in a rising voice. “Let go home. We have to feed the dog.”\n\nSuzi and the dentist coax Jack into the chair, where he continues to protest over and over.\n\nSuzi holds Jack’s hand as the dentist inserts the needle into Jack’s gum.\n\nThe dentist uses the same gentleness he would with a toddler, but Jack squeals in pain and tries to get out of the chair until Suzi calms him and the numbing takes hold.\n\nSuzi and Kathaleen each take shifts comforting Jack, who manages to stay in the chair for more than two hours while his teeth are fixed.\n\nSuzi hates seeing her husband in pain and hates lying even more, but the family has been through far worse.\n\n“If we can get through the week we had a couple years ago, we can get through anything,” Suzi said. “I’m so glad Jack didn’t know what happened. It would have crushed him.”\n\nPerfect storm\n\nOn March 25, 2021, doctors removed another tumor from Jack's daughter's spine, fearing if they didn’t, she would no longer be able to walk.\n\nJulie Hanna almost died from leukemia in 1977 when she was 2 years old. Jack has said helplessly watching doctors try to save her while watching behind a glass wall was among the worst moments of his life. The primitive radiation available back then saved Julie, but it has caused a lifetime of chronic pain, tumors and surgeries.\n\nBut this time, her father wasn’t able to even be at the hospital. The Alzheimer’s had advanced to the point where Jack didn’t really understand what was happening to his youngest daughter.\n\nThen, as Julie continued to suffer severe pain, the Hanna family was suddenly thrust into a new fight – this one for Jack’s legacy.\n\nOn March 29, 2021, The Columbus Dispatch, a member of the USA TODAY Network, reported that Tom Stalf, former zoo president and CEO; and Greg Bell, former chief financial officer, resigned after an investigation by the newspaper detailed their extensive personal use of zoo resources. The zoo's board eventually conducted forensic audits, which confirmed improper spending and questionable business practices by the former top two executives, resulting in more than $630,000 in zoo losses. Stalf and other top executives eventually agreed to pay back hundreds of thousands of dollars to the zoo.\n\nJack hadn’t been an active director of the zoo since 1992 and wasn’t directly involved in the zoo executive controversy.\n\nBut he did have a close relationship with Stalf. And he helped Stalf join the zoo as its chief operating officer in 2010.\n\nJulie, who is now 48, was finally released from the hospital on April 3, 2021 and taken to the Hanna family home just outside the zoo.\n\nWhile the family cared for her and tried to digest the zoo controversy, the next blow was delivered.\n\nThe Hannas learned on the morning of April 5, 2021, that a new documentary called “The Conversation Game” was being released to the public. It alleged that the baby tigers and snow leopards that sat in Jack’s lap on late-night talk shows often didn’t come from the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium and didn’t end up there when the cameras stopped rolling.\n\nInstead, the documentary says, the animals were shuffled among backyard breeders and unaccredited roadside zoos that were compared to “animal prisons” in some cases. The filmmakers say Jack and other celebrity animal conservationists actively misrepresented where the exotic cats came from and where they were going, leading the public to believe they were moving between accredited facilities.\n\nThe Columbus Zoo eventually lost its accreditation for almost 18 months as part of the fallout.\n\nIn the view of some close to the Hannas, the documentary made it seem like Jack didn’t care if animals were being taken from and returned to places where they were abused or neglected.\n\nThe next two days would be among the worst the Hanna family said they ever experienced.\n\nThere were tears and anger and debates on how to handle it all.\n\nKathaleen, the protector of the family, wanted to rush out in front of the television cameras and defend her father. But others thought that would only add more fuel to the story. They decided not to watch the documentary – ever.\n\nKathaleen said Jack wasn't aware of any of the controversy.\n\n“It was hell – absolute hell,” Kathaleen said. “He would never knowingly allow animals to suffer. They created a narrative around my dad that isn’t true, and he couldn’t defend himself. My dad would have faced all this head on like he always did. In hindsight, we all wish things had been handled better by the people working with my dad. And yes, it’s fair to say my dad should have known more about the animals. But he was always moving so fast. He would have wanted every animal to be safe and returned to a safe environment. He dedicated most of his life to protecting animals. It was all so heartbreaking.”\n\nJerry Borin had a front row seat for Jack the showman for almost 40 years.\n\nThey met back in 1984 when Jerry was working in the Columbus Parks and Recreation Department and Jack was transforming the Columbus Zoo from a dilapidated place few visited to a world-class destination for those who loved animals.\n\nBorin was the zoo’s executive director from 1993 to 2008, and then after the zoo executives resigned in 2021, Borin was brought back to be the zoo’s interim CEO for about eight months.\n\nBorin said when he returned to the zoo in 2021, he stepped into a mess surrounding the accreditation issue.\n\nHe said the records or paper trail left behind by those who were responsible for acquiring and tracking the animals was \"not good.\" He said it’s fair to criticize his long-time friend for not paying attention to where some of the animals he used on television came from.\n\n“The records I saw weren’t good,” Borin said. “Jack just didn’t do details. But I don’t think Jack knew what was happening. If someone had told him face to face the animals were coming from unaccredited places, I believe he would have fixed it. It was a massive crisis for sure, but the zoo has recovered and is thriving.”\n\nJack had no idea the controversies were unfolding, and family members took turns keeping him away from the television. But one evening, Jack saw his own picture on the screen and started riddling Suzi with angry questions.\n\nHe thought Suzi had betrayed him and told the media about the Alzheimer’s.\n\n“He just kept saying, ‘Sue, you told them, didn’t you? You promised me Sue, you promised,’” Suzi said. “It would have broken Jack’s heart to hear what was going on at the zoo. If we had tried to tell him, he wouldn’t have understood.”\n\nBut finally, with some demanding a public response from Jack, the family decided they had no choice.\n\nIt was time to tell the world about Jack’s Alzheimer’s. And, yes, the family was aware that some would accuse them of exaggerating Jack’s condition as a way to hide from the media.\n\nKathaleen had lobbied for a long time to go public, but Suzi didn’t want to betray Jack’s wishes. His legacy, however, was more important.\n\nOn April 7, 2021, the family issued a short statement announcing that Jack had Alzheimer’s.\n\nIn the following days, the Hanna family heard from many offering their sympathies.\n\nThat included the celebrity Jack was associated with the most – David Letterman.\n\nOn that call with Letterman, Jack retold a famous story about a beaver from the show. He repeated it to Letterman about four times.\n\nLetterman understood what the family was dealing with and at one point used the word Alzheimer’s while the call was on speakerphone. That caused Suzi to run into the other room, fearing her husband would hear the word they never used.\n\nTo this day, Jack doesn’t know his family told the public he has Alzheimer’s.\n\n“It killed me,” Suzi said, “to break that promise.”\n\nFamily therapy\n\nThe four women to whom Jack devoted his life are all crying when he takes a mid-afternoon break from the Montana sun and shuffles back into the kitchen.\n\nHis wife Suzi is sitting at the table with Kathaleen, while Suzanne and Julie are on the phone from Suzanne’s home in Cincinnati.\n\nJack takes a seat at the end of the table and starts eating a bowl of grapes. He is oblivious to his daughter Suzanne talking about what it feels like to be the first forgotten by him.\n\nHis wife and daughters said Jack's Alzheimer’s has now gone from moderate to advanced.\n\n“He just stopped remembering who I was in all ways,” Suzanne tells her mom and sisters. “Whether it was in person or by phone, he had no idea I was his daughter. I think it’s because he didn’t see me as much because I got married so young and I moved away.”\n\nSuzi hears the pain in her daughter’s voice and attempts to see if Jack can remember Suzanne.\n\n“Jack, Suzanne is on the phone. She is your daughter; can you say hello?” Suzi asks. “Can you tell her you love her?”\n\nJack has no clue who is on the other end of the phone. But eventually he speaks.\n\n“I love you too, sweetie,” he says. “Have fun.”\n\nSuzi is now sobbing and tells Suzanne she wishes she was there in Montana to give her a hug.\n\nWhat they dubbed family therapy continues for hours. They share raw feelings with one another they never have before.\n\nThe responsibility of caring for Jack around the clock weighs on all. Julie feels helpless that her own health problems prevent her from caring for her dad.\n\nSuzanne, 50, has four grown children and helps care for Julie and wishes she could make more trips than she has to Montana. Her dad hasn’t been able attend two of her kids' weddings nor has he met his only great grandchild.\n\nKathaleen, 53, who appeared with her dad on his television shows as a young girl, has two teenagers and a husband back in England. She has traveled across an ocean more times than she can count, juggling two lives to help Suzi care for her dad.\n\nSuzi is reluctant to share with her daughters how hard it is to care for Jack alone, not wanting them to think she can’t handle it. The night Jack threw his back out, for example, he couldn’t get off the floor and Suzi struggled to get him up alone.\n\nJack takes several medications multiple times a day to combat his Alzheimer’s symptoms. Tracking all of them and making sure he consumes them is a part-time job by itself for Suzi.\n\nYet, Suzi refuses to let home health care providers come in and help her when her daughters can’t be there.\n\nThis frustrates and even angers Kathaleen, who has begged her mom for more than a year to get help. Kathaleen has even arranged for more help, only to have her mom cancel it.\n\n“Mom you are 75 now, this is killing you,” Kathaleen says to Suzi. “Let us give you some more help. We have the money. And you need this.”\n\nSuzi brushes aside the plea.\n\nKathaleen turns to her sister Suzanne for backup, but she doesn’t wade into the loving brawl.\n\n“I am Switzerland,” Suzanne says. “Remember?”\n\n“That’s why you are the favorite,” Suzi says, which sparks laughter from all three daughters.\n\n“Thank God we all get along, right?” Kathaleen says in between tears.\n\nThroughout it all, Jack stares out toward the beautiful lake and is halfway through another bowl of grapes.\n\n“I just want it to be your dad and I for as long as I can,” Suzi said.\n\nLasting legacy\n\nThe morning is about half over when Jack emerges from his bedroom bare-chested, wearing only jeans and a heavy lathering of shaving cream on his face.\n\nHe stops, looks around the room, and flashes a sheepish smile at Suzi and his guests, who can’t help but laugh.\n\nThis is a planned performance; one he repeats from time to time pretending to be Santa Claus.\n\n“The showman is still in there somewhere,” Suzi said. “Jack loved making people laugh as much as he loved taking care of animals.\"\n\nThere was a time when Jack couldn't take three steps in Columbus or almost anywhere else in the world without someone asking for an autograph, wanting a selfie, or telling him that they watched him on television while they were growing up.\n\nAt the Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio, Jack would get more attention from the fans than the famous golfers – even Tiger Woods.\n\nAnd Jack would have a pleasant greeting or more for every single person who approached him. Their age or skin color or cultural background didn't matter to Jack. And he left no one out. If he signed autographs for servers in a restaurant, he would walk back into the kitchen to say hello to the cooks and dishwashers.\n\n“Jack's legacy is that he was one of the greatest animal advocates the world has ever seen,” said his friend Borin. “He might have done more to help people than the animals. And the public still loves Jack for all of it.\"\n\nNow when Jack walks into a restaurant in or near this Montana town of about 5,000, the locals might offer a friendly hello, but they give Jack and Suzi their space. Those who know Jack is living with Alzheimer's wait for the right moment to give Suzi a hug of support and tell her to hang in there as the main caretaker.\n\nShortly after finishing his second piece of cheesecake, Jack is eager to head back home.\n\nHe is worried Brassy doesn't have enough food and wants a few more hours of baking in the sun.\n\nSuzi caresses her husband's forehead to counter the anxiety.\n\nAlzheimer's is commonly called the long goodbye as family and friends watch their loved one slowly fade away over time. Suzi has no idea how much longer her goodbye will last with Jack. She tries not to think about the more difficult days ahead – or when it might end.\n\n\"The river, the sun, Brassy, our walks. ... That's what we have left,\" Suzi said. \"The Jack people knew isn't here anymore, but pieces of my husband are. And I'm going to hang onto them for as long as I can.\"\n\nWagner can be reached at mwagner@dispatch.com or on Twitter @MikeWagner48.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/08/21/faith-guides-family-journey-help-autistic-children/32149425/", "title": "Faith guides family on journey to help autistic children", "text": "DAN MORRIS\n\ndanmorris44@charter.net\n\nDave and Bobbie Ann Boroughs were numb after hearing the doctor’s prognosis.\n\nJordan, their 5-year-old son, had severe autism, a developmental disability. He would probably never speak and would eventually be in a home for the disabled. It was best to begin looking for a suitable facility for the child, the doctor said.\n\n“It was one of the most devastating days we have been through,” Dave said. “The doctor didn’t give us any hope.”\n\n“I had a few cries on the way home,” Bobbie said. “It was depressing, but Dave and I were pretty much determined that we wouldn’t accept that prognosis.\n\n“We didn’t know what we were going to do at the time, but we were determined to figure out something that would help Jordan.”\n\nThat was in 2000 and proved to be the catalyst for a series of life-changing events, which led to the formation of Sheltering Tree Ranch in Savannah in 2012.\n\nSheltering Tree is a public facility that provides intensive instruction in educational, emotional, social and physical skills for children with autism and other learning challenges. And it offers emotional support and biblical guidance to the students’ parents.\n\nDave, 47, is president of the Sheltering Tree Ranch corporation, and Bobbie, 44, is the director of the school. They recently celebrated their 26th wedding anniversary and reflected on the emotional and challenging journey they believe God led them through in order to help other families with similar trials.\n\nWarning signs\n\nOther than underdeveloped lungs as a premature baby, all seemed well when Jordan was born on Jan. 30, 1995. After eight days in a Memphis hospital, he went home to Savannah.\n\nBobbie became suspicious that something was wrong when she noticed a difference in the development of Jordan compared to his baby cousin, Cade, whom she kept while Cade’s mother attended college classes.\n\n“Before he was a year old, Cade was sitting up and falling over, but Jordan was just trying to roll over,” Bobbie said. “I realized something wasn’t right.”\n\nShe said visits to three pediatricians over the next two years resulted in similar responses.\n\n“I was always assured by the doctors that, since Jordan was a preemie, he would catch up over a period of time,” she said.\n\nInstead, Jordan regressed.\n\n“I realized that the language skills Jordan had developed were fading away, and it seemed like it happened almost overnight,” she said.\n\nHe no longer said Mama or Dada or the words to “Itsy Bitsy Spider.” And he displayed odd behavior, often removing the bowls from a kitchen cabinet, crawling inside and shutting the door.\n\n“At first, it was cute,” Bobbie said. “But then I realized he was crawling into the corner of his closet and, instead of a gaze, he was zoning out.”\n\nThat’s when the pediatricians referred Jordan to a neurologist, a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the nervous system. Jordan saw three neurologists, each of whom ordered multiple tests.\n\n“When one couldn’t tell us anything, we would try a different one,” Bobbie said. “They sent us to speech, physical and occupational therapists, and we drove to Jackson for about two years to do that.”\n\nJordan was also in a special-needs class in the Hardin County school system, but none of the treatment or classes improved his development, Bobbie said.\n\nShe searched the Internet, trying to find a medical explanation for Jordan’s behavior. That’s when she came across the word “autism.”\n\n“I had never heard of it,” she said. “And I didn’t know anything about it. I didn’t really care what it meant; all I knew was that it matched Jordan’s actions, and I might have found an answer.\n\n“Good, bad or ugly, I just wanted an answer,” she said.\n\nBy this time, Jordan was 5. That’s when the family went to Knoxville to see a child psychologist. His diagnosis for Jordan was autism, and his prognosis was devastating.\n\n“On the way home we realized that everything we had dreamed about for Jordan, like playing ball and having friends over and graduation and marriage, might not take place,” Bobbie said. “So you go through almost a grieving process.”\n\nBobbie and Dave said the grieving ended by the time they arrived home.\n\n“We’ve just always been the kind that says, ‘OK, our faith is strong and our marriage is strong, and this isn’t the first time someone has had autism,’” Dave said. “Somebody else has got it, and if you can beat it, we’re going to beat it. If it can be done, we’re going to do it.”\n\nBobbie’s homework\n\nIn 2000, a diagnosis of autism was not as common as it is today. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that today “about 1 in 68 children has been identified with autism spectrum disorder,” compared to about 1 in 380 in 2000.\n\nIt occurs in all racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups but is almost five times more common among boys than among girls, according to the CDC website, cdc.gov. Symptoms can range from mild to severe.\n\n“Autism is brain damage,” Bobbie said. “Part of the brain isn’t functioning properly. We don’t know why, and nobody knows what causes it. There are tons and tons of debate and theories, but nobody really knows.”\n\nThere is no cure for autism, but research shows that early intervention can significantly improve a child’s development, according to the CDC.\n\nIn 2000, Bobbie and the doctors she visited knew little about autism and methods for treatment. So Bobbie immersed herself in research on the Internet.\n\nShe found a method called Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and decided to use it to help Jordan.\n\n“Back then, ABA was new,” Bobbie said. “But it was tried and proven research, where the rest of my reading was about experimental things. I decided ABA was where I wanted to plant my roots to try and help Jordan. Right or wrong, I wanted to concentrate on one technique and try to stick to it.”\n\nShe read everything she could find about ABA. She ordered books and manuals about the treatment process, took online classes and attended workshops in Jackson and at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.\n\nShe took thousands of notes and has three three-ring binders filled with those notes, which she still uses today.\n\n“The more I learned about it, the more I realized that Jordan needed some intensive intervention, one on one,” she said. “And it had to come from more than one teacher.”\n\n“It’s like cancer; you have to attack it,” Dave said.\n\nJordan’s test scores at age 9 were below the scores he had when he was 6, Dave said. Something had to change, not only for Jordan but for five other autistic students in Hardin County schools.\n\nDave and Bobbie asked the school system to allow Vanderbilt instructors to train Hardin County’s special-needs teachers how to do ABA. The school system declined, so the Boroughses filed a lawsuit.\n\n“We didn’t ask for any money, just the training,” Dave said.\n\nA year later, a judge ruled against the Boroughses. Today they realize it was a blessing. If they had won the lawsuit, Sheltering Tree would probably not exist.\n\nSheltering tree is born\n\nJordan was 10 when Dave and Bobbie removed him from the public school system. They decided to use the money they had set aside for Jordan’s college education to hire a teacher to work with him and train Bobbie.\n\nAfter a year, the money ran out. So Bobbie began homeschooling Jordan, using a curriculum she developed from her research and classes.\n\nShe used ABA methods for academics and behavior but also incorporated techniques to improve fine and gross motor skills, cognitive skills and social skills.\n\nShe taught Jordan in the morning, and three students were hired to come in the afternoons and teach the same lessons Bobbie had done earlier that day. They used 30-minute sessions.\n\nAutistic children “need to be in different settings with different teachers so they will generalize things,” Bobbie said. And they often need a specific environment to be able to learn. The earlier that process begins, the better the results.\n\n“There is a critical window of time for intervention, between the ages of 2 and 5,” Bobbie said. “That’s not to say they can’t learn after that, but it’s much tougher.”\n\nShe realized that window had passed for Jordan, but she was slowly seeing progress. He was still non-verbal, but he began learning the alphabet. And a special communication device called a DynaVox helped him learn the value of communication.\n\nThe device speaks for you when you touch a picture. For example, if you want juice, you touch the juice picture.\n\nAfter a year of homeschooling, Bobbie realized she needed to get Jordan out of the house and not keep him in an enclosed environment. So she asked Kris Smith, principal at Savannah Christian Academy, if she and Jordan could sit in the back of a fourth-grade classroom. Savannah Christian was part of Sharon Baptist Church, which Bobbie and Dave attended.\n\n“Looking back, it’s a miracle they said yes,” Bobbie said. “But Kris helped me all she could and understood why I needed to do it. Jordan and I had a desk off in the corner by ourselves in front of a bathroom. If he started having behavioral issues, I could get him to the bathroom so it wouldn’t disturb the class.”\n\nDuring lunch and physical education, Jordan gained social skills by interacting with students. His eye contact improved, and he began to recognize words and letter sounds.\n\n“It was far under his age level, but it was much better progress than the doctor told us Jordan would achieve when he was diagnosed,” Bobbie said. “They said he would never be able to do any of that stuff.”\n\nBobbie knew she was making a difference in Jordan’s life. So, when two concerned mothers asked Bobbie to tutor their 2-year-old autistic sons during the summer of 2004, she accepted the challenge and saw progress in the boys.\n\nWhen the school year started at Savannah Christian, Principal Smith offered to clean out a small, 9-by-12-foot storage closet so Bobbie could use it as a classroom to teach the three boys —Jordan, Jacob and Dawson.\n\nBobbie accepted and asked Kayle Gray, one of her former Sunday school students, to help when she wasn’t in school. Bobbie trained Gray, who had a natural gift to assist autistic children.\n\nThe name Sheltering Tree was born when Smith came to the room and told Bobbie she had to put a name on the classroom door to designate its purpose.\n\nSmith and Bobbie decided they would each find five Bible verses that had special meaning to them and try to choose a name from those Scriptures.\n\nSheltering Tree was derived from Psalm 1:3, which says, “He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season; whose leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he does shall prosper.”\n\nBobbie was planting her methods in autistic children, and the fruit of improvement blessed each participant.\n\nSheltering growth\n\nWord spread, and Sheltering Tree had six children in February 2008. Then a tornado destroyed Savannah Christian School and Sharon Baptist Church, which had adopted Sheltering Tree as a ministry.\n\n“I felt a lot of pressure to find a new place for school because, if you have too much time lapse with these kids, they lose momentum,” Bobbie said.\n\nSheltering Tree and Savannah Christian both finished the semester in the basement of First United Methodist Church in Savannah. Then Sheltering Tree used the First Baptist Church youth center and Northside Baptist Sunday School rooms until Sharon Baptist set up portable buildings on its campus.\n\nSheltering Tree’s portable building was a larger room than it previously used and was able to accommodate more students. But even that was small compared to the new classroom Sharon Baptist constructed for Sheltering Tree when it rebuilt Savannah Christian in 2011.\n\n“Sharon Baptist has been so good to us,” Bobbie said. “They came to us and asked what we needed when they were designing their new buildings.\n\n“In 2011 we had about 10 students, and we thought we would be at Savannah Christian forever. We had reached our capacity and honestly didn’t think we would have any more families come to us. Jordan was 16, and we thought when the younger ones got out of school, we would be done and we would go about our lives.”\n\nBut the calls kept coming through word of mouth, not by publicity.\n\n“We tried not to do anything in the public eye,” Bobbie said. “We didn’t want to be in the paper or publicize Sheltering Tree. We weren’t encouraging any more families to call because we had all we could do and didn’t want any new students.”\n\nShying away from publicity was partly due to Bobbie’s lack of credentials. She graduated from Hardin County High School in 1989 but has no formal education beyond a high school diploma.\n\nShe is self-educated in the treatment of autism through extensive research and study as well as trial and error with Jordan.\n\n“When parents come to us, we make it clear that Bobbie Ann is not degreed in this,” Dave said. “We are not professionals. We have no certification. This is just stuff that we’ve tried, and we know it works with these kids. The parents sign a document that they understand that.”\n\nTara Darrington has seen significant progress with her daughter, Mykuh, at Sheltering Tree and considers Bobbie to be a special person.\n\n“My daughter was the first little girl to enter Sheltering Tree,” she said. “She was 4 then and is 9 now. She talked and could hold a normal conversation until she was about 4, and then she began regressing. I’d say she has improved 80 percent since she came to Sheltering Tree.\n\n“Bobbie is just so passionate about what she does and so loving and understanding,” Darrington said. “You can see she is a strong person and that she’s genuine.”\n\nDarrington, who teaches at Hardin County Middle School, believes in Sheltering Tree so strongly that she became a board member when the ranch was organized.\n\nEugenie Jones enrolled her son Nathan at Sheltering Tree when he was 3. He is now 6 and has made significant progress by communicating using an iPad, she said.\n\n“He learns differently than the way we learn,” Jones said. “I had to understand that. I’ve never seen a person like Bobbie. She is so patient and has such a big heart. The kids can understand what she teaches. She’s just a really special person.”\n\nBobbie said the goal has always been to improve children’s skills to the point that they can return to a public or private school setting and function well.\n\nBy the 2012-13 school year, Sheltering Tree had 15 students and eight full-time teachers. The school was receiving calls almost daily from parents wanting to enroll their children.\n\nBobbie and Dave felt they were at a crossroad. Jordan was 18 and destined to be with them for life. Bobbie had dedicated herself to helping Jordan and other autistic children. But should she continue her work?\n\n“It was very evident that Sheltering Tree was not going to stop,” Dave said. “The question was, were we going to step out in faith and remain a part of it or were we going to walk away and let someone else run it?\n\n“We struggled for months, praying and asking the Lord what he wanted us to do,” he said.\n\nThe answer came on Aug. 23, 2012, three years ago today.\n\nTransformation\n\nDave said he was driving home from a Bible study in Jackson when he felt “the spirit of God” tell him to build a ranch for Sheltering Tree.\n\nHe was stunned because he no longer had money or a means to borrow the money to build a ranch. Bankruptcy was looming, and his financial status had plummeted.\n\nDave was once considered a wealthy man by worldly standards. He had four companies, 70 employees and a steady cash flow.\n\nBut he was $6 million in debt, and that got him in trouble when the economy tanked in 2008. He said he fell victim to a Ponzi scheme and lost “several hundred thousands” of dollars in cash retirement savings. He had to dissolve all but one of his companies, and in 2013 he filed Chapter 11 corporate and personal bankruptcy.\n\n“You talk about overwhelmed,” he said. “And it continued to get worse.”\n\nHe said his financial woes tested his Christian faith and gave him a new perspective on life. The biggest transformation came in 2012 on an Alabama beach. He sold a pistol for $600 and used the money to take Bobbie to Orange Beach, just to get away for a few days.\n\n“The only things I took with me were my Bible and Dave Ramsey’s book, ‘The Total Money Makeover,’” he said. “I read it on the beach, and it changed my life.”\n\nHe and Bobbie returned home and began practicing what Ramsey’s book teaches: Get out of debt.\n\nThey sold their 3,600-square-foot house, their airplane, the boat, the motor home, four or five cars and “other toys” like a motorcycle and shop tools.\n\nDave said he paid off $4.5 million in debt between 2010 and 2013 but had to file bankruptcy in August 2013 when one bank declined to renegotiate his loans. A year later, he was out of bankruptcy and had paid all of his personal debt, he said.\n\n“I went from $6 million to $385,000 in debt within five years,” he said. His resource is Riverside Medical, a medical supplies company where he is president and majority owner. The company continues to be his family’s livelihood.\n\nThey rent a house but live in a camper on the ranch most of the time and drive used vehicles. They have no credit cards, personal or business.\n\n“I am much happier and more content now than I was back then,” Bobbie said. “When all that stuff was gone, it felt like something had been lifted off us, and that feeling was awesome.”\n\n“But I also think God had to put us through that,” she said. “We didn’t know at the time that Sheltering Tree would become what it is today. I think God wanted us to know that it wasn’t us. It was just him. We can’t financially or physically or mentally do it ourselves.”\n\nBobbie had never taken a paycheck at Sheltering Tree since its inception in 2004.\n\n“I didn’t have to make money,” she said. “Dave was doing great, and he paid for all the supplies, desks, chairs, materials and computers we needed for Sheltering Tree for years.”\n\n“And Sheltering Tree continued doing well during the time it was so bad on us financially as a family,” she said. “We just couldn’t use our money to help Sheltering Tree anymore.”\n\nThat’s why Bobbie was startled when Dave came home on Aug. 23, 2012, and said the Lord had told him to build a ranch for Sheltering Tree.\n\n“I didn’t say it out loud, but I’m thinking, ‘How in the world is that going to happen?’ ” she said. “But I could tell by Dave’s look, his tone and his demeanor that afternoon that I needed to take it serious. Whatever was coming out of his mouth, I needed to listen.”\n\nThe ranch rises\n\nDave shared his vision with trusted Christian friends and received guidance from attorneys, real estate agents and development professionals.\n\nHe was looking for about 60 acres in Hardin County with easy access and a natural water supply. He found it on a Google map when he saw “two little white lines” within a map of 10,000 acres.\n\n“Those two white lines drew my attention, and when we pulled it up it was about 50 acres of land for sale with Horse Creek running along the back side for three-fourths of a mile,” he said. “It was perfect.”\n\nDave drove to the site and saw a jungle of stumps, high weeds and trees. But he said he could immediately envision where the Lord wanted every aspect of Sheltering Tree to be located on the property, which is across the road from Savannah-Hardin County Airport.\n\nThe owner had placed a six-inch water main on the property and paved a road leading to building lots, but the bad economy had stalled his plans.\n\nIn September 2012, Sheltering Tree Ranch was established as a Tennessee public nonprofit corporation, run by a board of directors. Dave is president, and Bobbie is vice president of the corporation and acting director of Sheltering Tree school.\n\nOn Dec. 31, 2012, Sheltering Tree Ranch purchased the 50 acres for $518,000. It was made possible by “a banker believing in the dream,” and by the previous owner, who signed as the guarantor, Dave said.\n\nThe corporation filed for tax-exempt status in November 2012, and Dave was told it should arrive within 90 days. The wait turned into an agonizing 16 months before the status was granted in February 2014.\n\n“It was getting to the point where people were thinking it’s not going to happen,” Bobbie said. “We were getting some negative response, and it was difficult.”\n\n“But we never missed a payment, and we never missed payroll for our teachers,” she said. “God blessed us with some really good fundraisers during that time.”\n\nWithout tax-exempt status, donations to Sheltering Tree dried up, and Dave said the corporation couldn’t pay the bank note. But the bank restructured the loan to ease the burden.\n\n“Wayne County Bank has been a tremendous blessing to Sheltering Tree,” Dave said. He vividly remembers the day he received notification of tax-exempt status.\n\n“I got the letter, and I sat there in my office and cried,” he said. “I’ll never forget it. I took a picture of the letter and sent it to all of our directors. We don’t take that lightly because it’s so vital for support.”\n\nBy June of 2014, progress was being made at the ranch. Equipment was donated that allowed Dave to cut the weeds and remove 800 stumps, which he buried on the property.\n\nThen the horse barn arrived. That was among a string of “miracles” that Bobbie and Dave point to as faith builders and spirit lifters.\n\nBobbie, who has taught horse-riding lessons since she was 18, had already established a therapeutic program that uses horse riding to improve fine and gross motor skills, social skills and communication skills in the children she teaches.\n\nUnexpectedly, Dave got a call from a man who said he had intended to move his horse barn to Crump but felt led by God to give it to Sheltering Tree. It was a Morton horse barn, considered by many to be the best.\n\nThe only catch was the expense of reassembling the barn at Sheltering Tree. It would cost about $4,750. Dave said the corporation didn’t have the money, but he told the man Sheltering Tree would gladly accept.\n\n“I start moving dirt and preparing the location for the barn,” Dave said, all the time wondering how the Lord would provide the money.\n\n“About three days later, a man who knew nothing about our immediate need gave me a $2,500 check,” Dave said. “Then on a Wednesday afternoon, I got a call from a man I didn’t know who asked if he could come out to the ranch. He and his wife drove up, and he said, ‘We really think what you are doing is remarkable.’ And he handed me a check for $20,000.\n\n“I cried, took a picture of it and sent the photo to our board members,” Dave said. “That’s just how the Lord has worked throughout all of this.”\n\nNext came the education building. Dave found a used modular building in Chattanooga. It cost $9,500. He spread the word in the community and within two weeks $25,000 was raised, including a $10,000 commitment from the Worley Foundation.\n\nThe installation of the building, including a septic tank and line, electrical and plumbing needs, ramps and a security system were all donated.\n\nThe education building opened Monday with its first class on the ranch property. There are 15 students from preschool through fourth grade and eight teachers. It has students from Hardin, Decatur, Wayne and McNairy counties and north Mississippi.\n\nTuition is $425 a month. That provides 42 percent of Sheltering Tree’s monthly budget, Dave said. Another 10 percent comes from donors who provide scholarships or smaller gifts each month. The other 48 percent comes from fundraisers and special donations.\n\nDave said he has never accepted pay for his work and time at Sheltering Tree and never will. He said Bobbie was never paid until the past five years when the family needed help to make ends meet. Even then, the most she has received in a year is less than $12,000, he said. Last year, she was paid slightly more than $9,000.\n\n“I’m not ever going to feel guilty asking for anything for Sheltering Tree based on what we’ve done here,” Dave said. “If I’m asking you to give $10, I better be giving $100. Our books are open for anyone to examine.”\n\n“We can’t take credit for anything you see at Sheltering Tree Ranch right now, nothing,” Bobbie said. “It’s all come about by faith and donations by the people.”\n\nDave said he and Bobbie plan to purchase a double-wide mobile home and make that their residence at the ranch until a permanent structure can be built.\n\nThe 50-acre property includes a clearing for a baseball field, a soccer field and basketball courts. Long-range goals include an educational center that can serve 100 students and swimming pools for recreational and therapeutic use. There will be cabins along the creek for weekend retreats and a worship center. The public will have access to the facilities.\n\nThe creek, which has already been used for baptisms and fishing, will offer float trips on tire tubes, as well as a place for meditation. Dave, who is an ordained minister, plans to offer marriage counseling, especially to the parents of autistic children.\n\nThere is also a plan for adults like Jordan, who is 20 and too old to attend school. Dave and Bobbie want to provide supervised housing and achievable jobs for those persons.\n\n“Those folks need something now,” Dave said. “This whole master plan could be financed for about $3 million, and God could do it tomorrow. We know that from experience.”\n\n“There’s not another Sheltering Tree that I know of in the nation that does what we do here,” Dave said. “Who knows? The Lord might use it as a catalyst for more of these places.”\n\nWhat to know\n\n•Sheltering Tree Ranch, at 3090 TN-226 in Savannah, is having an open house on Sunday, Aug. 23 from noon until 6 p.m. It will have a ribbon-cutting ceremony at 5 p.m. to celebrate the opening of its new educational center.\n\n•Call (731) 607-7777 for more information, or visit the website at www.shelteringtree.org.\n\n•Donations can be sent to Sheltering Tree Ranch, P.O.

We stare at her small chest, praying for it to rise. There’s one breath, we say — but then nothing for two seconds, five seconds, seven seconds — there, another breath. This is all wrong. She is young. We are old. Yet every minute her heartbeats slow, while ours are racing.\n\n“Is she in pain?” I whisper.\n\n“She is not in pain,” the nurses say.\n\nA small plastic meter dangles from her middle finger, flashing digits, her pulse, her oxygen. For months, we have been fixated on this device, checking it nervously throughout the day and night. I hate it. I want to smash it into a million pieces.\n\nSomeone has figured how to put photos on the bedroom TV and they slide across silently, happy photos, Chika in a bathing suit, Chika writing on a blackboard, Chika with her face painted at a county fair, where she told the ride workers, “Guess where I am from? Haiti!”\n\nThe phone rings. No one answers. An oxygen machine thrums and sputters, breathing more regularly than she does. A plastic tube trails from her nose to her ears and behind a pink ribbon in her hair.\n\nPink. She loved pink.\n\nLoves pink. She is still with us.\n\nBreathe, I say silently.\n\nShe makes a small noise, like the squeal of a deflating balloon.\n\n“Are you sure she’s not in pain?” we ask.\n\n“She is not in pain.”\n\n“Then why--’’\n\n“In the final minutes, these are the sounds children sometimes make.”\n\nThese are the sounds children sometimes make. It seems so clinical, like we are observing a copy machine, not a 7-year-old. I glance at my wife. Her eyes are dripping tears. I look at Chika, this little girl — not our girl, and yet, our girl. Our girl. In every way, our girl.\n\nThe phone rings. No one answers. Once, the sounds from her little mouth were joyous; squeals of delight at her first American hot dog, high-pitched laughter while descending her first sled hill, and singing — always singing — like an Ethel Merman in size 1 shoes, belting out Creole prayers in our suburban Detroit home the way she once did at a Port-au-Prince orphanage, seeking the Lord’s ear beneath starry Caribbean skies.\n\nThat was before the long journey here, the operations, the catheters in her head, our worldwide search to cure the incurable, and the endless decisions we were forced to make — Which doctor? Which drug? Which country? — all funneled into this, here, now, a warm Friday afternoon, and one last choice:\n\nHow to watch her die.\n\nWe have chosen to surround her in bed, the way she always loved. We rub her narrow shoulders. We run fingers over her soft cheeks. We look again at the gentle face that rests between us, her large eyes mostly closed now, like someone fighting sleep.\n\nIt is a face that touched the lives of so many.\n\nA face that changed the doctors’ thinking.\n\nA face that brought parenthood to a man and a woman too old to be parents.\n\n“It’s all right, Chika,” we whisper. “We’re right here, Chika …”\n\nThe phone rings. No one answers.\n\nMAY 2015\n\nThe phone rings.\n\n“Hello, Sir?”\n\nYes, Alain?\n\n“Something is wrong with Chika.”\n\nThis is how it begins. Alain Charles, the 32-year-old director at the Have Faith Haiti Orphanage/Mission in Port-au-Prince, has a habit of delivering news in declarative statements. “We have no water.” “The van is broken.” “There’s something wrong with Chika.” It is up to me, as the person operating the orphanage, to explore the particulars.\n\nWhat’s wrong with Chika, Alain?\n\n“Her face is funny.”\n\nHow is it funny?\n\n“It is lowered. Her mouth. And her eye.”\n\nLowered? You mean drooped?\n\n“Drooped. Yes.”\n\nDid you take her to the doctor?\n\n“Yes.”\n\nWhat did he do?\n\n“He gave her eye drops.\"\n\nAlain, it’s not her eyes. It might be something they call Bell’s palsy.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\nDo you know what that is?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\nShe needs a neurologist.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\nCan you find one?\n\n“I think so.”\n\nWe need to find one.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n[Click here to watch a documentary on Chika's battle with DIPG]\n\n* * * *\n\nWhat followed seems monumental compared to that simple conversation, but then, simple things often turn monumental in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Daily life is a hot, exhausting struggle. Money is scarce. Water is scarce. Food is scarce. And children die.\n\nOften.\n\nSeven out of every 100 Haitian children will pass away before their fifth birthday — 10 times the rate of the U.S. The fortunate families get some kind of explanation. The others, who lack money, live in far-off provinces or can’t reach a doctor, get nothing. “Ca se volonte Bondye,\" they lament, This is what God wants — although, in most cases, death may be less about God than malnutrition, injury, childbirth complications or pneumonia.\n\nBut even by Haitian standards, what struck 5-year-old Medjerda (Chika) Jeune was crushing.\n\nAnd rare.\n\nA proud, curious child with full cheeks, pouty lips and eyes as big as Haitian mountains, Chika had never exhibited health problems before. She was fond of pushing around the boys at the orphanage, or diving into a second helping of rice and beans, or dancing wildly during church services to the beat of conga-driven devotions.\n\nBut in late May 2015, she sat next to Alain, with her drooping mouth and drooping eye, inside a dimly lit Port-au-Prince medical facility, awaiting the sole MRI machine in their country.\n\nAlain had followed protocol: show up early and pay cash in advance (750 U.S. dollars). Haiti has no private medical insurance to speak of. More than 75% of health care costs come out of people’s pockets.\n\nFinally, after several hours, a nurse emerged and told Chika to drink some syrup. It made her sleepy. She was carried through a door and placed inside the machine. Halfway through the process, Chika woke up, asking where she was. More syrup was given. Again, she fell asleep. The MRI finished, and Alain and Chika went home.\n\nWhen the results were in, Alain was given the scan and a note. No explanation.\n\nHe took them to a neurologist.\n\n“It is something in her brain,” the doctor said. “It is very bad.”\n\n“What should I do?” Alain asked.\n\n“Is there any way you can get her to the United States?”\n\n“Why?’’\n\n“Because whatever this is, there is no one in Haiti who can help her.”\n\nJANUARY 2010\n\nShe is born on Jan. 9, three days before the worst earthquake to hit her country in nearly 200 years. She comes so quickly, her mother doesn’t have time to call the midwife, an older man named Albert. By the time he gets to the house, the baby is already in the world.\n\nThey formally name her “Medjerda,” a made-up name, but she will soon answer to “Chika,” a made-up nickname. Her mother, Rezulia Guerrier, is a tall, strong woman in her mid-30s who sells small items in the street for money. Her father, Fedner Jeune (the parents are not married), has experience with construction but, like many men in Haiti, looks for work and rarely finds it. He is around and not around.\n\nOn the third day of her life, Chika lies in bed with Rezulia in their one-room cinder-block house, taking shelter from the afternoon heat. At 4:53 p.m., the ground starts shaking as if thunder were just outside the door. In seconds, the house splits in two and crumbles around them, leaving mother and child exposed like a cracked-open walnut.\n\nIt is a 7.0 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter less than 16 miles from Port-au-Prince, the capital city. Nearly 3% of Haiti’s population will die from it. Ten percent — almost a million people — will be left homeless, including Rezulia, Chika and her two older sisters.\n\nThey spend that night in the sugarcane fields. Chika’s bed is a layer of leaves. The country is in ruins.\n\nThe baby sleeps.\n\nJUNE 2015\n\nIt was not easy to get Chika into the U.S. Even with help from Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who had once visited our orphanage, it took several weeks of phone calls and filings. Getting a passport. Medical affidavits. Securing an interview at the U.S. embassy. (No one moves fast in Haiti, even for terminal illness.)\n\nChika finally cleared her paperwork, and on June 3, holding Alain’s hand, she boarded her first airplane, at the same hour her friends at the orphanage were lining up for school. She arrived in Detroit late that night, wearing a pink dress and a white sweater and shivering from the air conditioning. In a bathroom, she turned a sink handle and yelled, \"Oooh!\"\n\nShe had never experienced hot water from a faucet.\n\nIn her time at the orphanage, Chika had always been curious. But this trip would test her sense of wonder. Every moment was a discovery. Every item was worth touching. We took her to Mott Children’s Hospital in Ann Arbor where they gave her a sticker (“Look!” she cooed) and she posed with a Superman statue. When the elevator lifted — her first ride — she beamed as if watching a magic trick.\n\nThat afternoon, she lay inside another MRI machine. The results left doctors skeptical. It was a brain tumor, a significant one, the kind often deemed not worth the risk of surgery. Days passed. They deliberated. Eventually, at a tumor board meeting, the members voted, by a narrow margin, to proceed with an operation, in hopes that, despite its size, what had invaded this little girl’s head was still a lower grade glioma.\n\nOn June 15, less than two weeks into her first trip out of Haiti — and not yet 4 feet tall — Chika was given a light blue gown, some yellow socks and an intravenous needle drip in the back of her hand. She was rolled away to surgery and my wife, Janine, and I were handed a pager.\n\n“Wait until it vibrates,” they told us.\n\nWe waited.\n\nDECEMBER 2010\n\nBaby Chika is baptized. Her cinder-block house is rebuilt. As Haiti struggles to recover from the earthquake, Chika learns to walk and talk. She sleeps beside her mother atop a single mattress on the dirt floor, along with her two older sisters.\n\nThey eat once a day. There is no electricity and no indoor plumbing. Chika is bathed in a bucket, with a can of water poured over her head. The water comes from a well on another property.\n\nSometimes, when Rezulia goes to a muddy river to wash clothes, she takes Chika with her. Years later, Chika will claim to remember those journeys. She will tell strangers in America, “My mommy used to take me to the swimming pool.”\n\n“Degaje pa peche” says a Haitian proverb. To get by is not a sin.\n\nJUNE 2015\n\nIn the operating room at Mott Hospital, the neurosurgeon, Dr. Hugh Garton, found himself dealing with a monster. The tumor tissue in Chika's brain was everywhere, wrapped throughout the healthy tissue. He could remove only 10% before disturbing vital elements of the brain itself.\n\nWhat he did remove was sent for pathology analysis.\n\n“Let’s hope for the best,” he said.\n\nHe forced a smile. There remained a slim belief that, despite the cancer’s spread, it was just Stage I, or at worst, Stage II.\n\nWere that the case, with treatment, Chika could eventually return to Haiti.\n\nAnd we would return to our previous life.\n\nWhich was what I always thought would happen.\n\nAnd.\n\nIt was never going to happen.\n\nAUGUST 2012\n\nChika’s mother dies.\n\nIt happens as she is giving birth to a son, inside the cinder-block house. The midwife — Albert, the same man who arrived late for Chika’s birth — does not realize how much blood Rezulia is losing. The boy is born with her last breath. He enters the world as a motherless child.\n\nNo one is called. No police. No investigation. Rezulia is buried the next day, in a nearby field.\n\nChika never gets to say good-bye.\n\nThe children are scattered among relatives, the stunned father unable or uninterested in caring for them. The newborn son goes to an uncle. The sisters are split up.\n\nChika is taken away by her godmother, a friend of Rezulia’s named Herzulia Desamour. \"From now on, you will live with me,\" she tells Chika. They share a one-room apartment by a church, with Herzulia’s husband and their three other children.\n\nChika eats mostly rice. Her mattress is in a corner. She tends to her own soiled sheets, carrying them up steps to dry on the roof, even though she is barely 3 years old.\n\nIn the spring of 2013, less than a year after taking her in, Herzulia puts Chika in a dress and loads her inside a Haitian “tap tap,” a rickety share taxi with a back door open to the traffic exhaust. Her destination is the Have Faith Haiti orphanage/mission, which I have been operating since 2010.\n\nShe wants us to take the child.\n\nI do the admission interview. I hear Herzulia say there is no money for this extra mouth to feed, that her own family can barely get by.\n\nI wave at the full-cheeked girl in front of me. She waves back. I make a face. She makes one back. A good sign, I think. Most Haitian children keep their heads down during these interviews.\n\nI tell Herzulia we will consider her request. She leaves holding Chika’s hand. Neither one looks back. But later I learn that every day that followed, Chika asked, ‘Kile blanc ap voye chache’m?”\n\n“When is the white man going to send for me?”\n\nHome video: See Chika during her first week at the mission\n\n* * * *\n\nI should say something here about my background. Although I have operated the orphanage/mission in Haiti since 2010, and make monthly visits to our 39 children there, my wife and I have no kids of our own. We were married in our late 30s, and despite our efforts, parenthood never happened. In time, we gave up trying, and a layer of acceptance settled in like sea fog, blocking the particular light of children from ever reaching us.\n\nOur brothers and sisters almost all had kids, and there were a lot of them: 15 nieces and nephews. We celebrated their milestones — birthdays, communions, graduations — we gave cards and kisses and presents that were too big, and in the car rides home we spoke about how cute they were, how big they were getting, but we never spoke about any emptiness we were feeling. We made our lives busy. We traveled. Our house was spacious and mature, lacking stray toys or crayon drawings on the refrigerator. We fell into that category that is both envied and pitied: The Couple Without Kids.\n\nSo it may seem strange that, in our late 50s, we found ourselves in a meeting room at Mott Hospital, looking every bit like a mother and father, side by side, braced for the news, parental in our posture, our furrowed brows — parental in everything except an actual relationship to the child.\n\nBut there we were. And with the biopsy results in, Dr. Garton, a thin, fit man who enjoys mountain climbing, had to scale a less pleasurable rock; telling the de facto parents about Chika’s disease, and adding a new four-letter word to our vocabulary:\n\nDIPG.\n\nIt stands for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, an insidious cancer of the brain stem that is nearly exclusive to children. It is the worst kind of tumor: the kind for which they don’t bother giving you hope.\n\nDIPG is aggressive and debilitating, invading the pons, which controls most of the body’s vital functions (heart rate, swallowing, breathing). It is rare — only 300 kids in the U.S. are diagnosed with it each year (there are no statistics for Haiti). And yet, because of its severity, it is the leading cause of death from pediatric brain tumors.\n\nThis is the bad news. Then comes the worst news: In more than 50 years of study, since astronaut Neil Armstrong’s 2-year-old daughter died from it in 1962, no real progress has been made.\n\nSurvival rate is, essentially, zero.\n\n“The average life expectancy without treatment,” Garton explained, “is maybe five months. If Chika gets radiation you could extend that another five or six months. But …”\n\nBut?\n\n“There’s a price to pay for radiation. It goes on for weeks. It’s not fun. Kids don’t like it. And there are potential complications. She’d be on steroids. She could get tired, vomit.”\n\nHe looked at us empathetically. He knew about Haiti. He knew about the 38 children Chika called her family. He knew how far Ann Arbor was from Port-au-Prince.\n\nHe knew how old we were.\n\n“Maybe,” he said, softly, “it would be better if you took her back, and let her live out her final months there.”\n\nI looked at Janine. She looked at me. The Couple Without Kids now faced a decision no couple with kids should have to face: to put a child through a hopeless medical marathon, or to stoically accept a doomed fate.\n\nWe went back to the room where Chika was recovering. Her head had been bandaged up high, like a white fez. Someone had brought her breakfast, and when we entered, Chika was in a chair, working her way through a blueberry muffin. All our kids in Haiti love to eat, having been hungry much of their lives. But here was this curious little girl, days after brain surgery, intent on digging a fork into a muffin and getting it to her mouth before it crumbled.\n\n\n\nAnd I knew what our answer would be.\n\nShe was a fighter.\n\nSo we would be fighters.\n\n“If she goes through the radiation, she has to be here for months,” the doctor had said. “Does she have someone to stay with?”\n\nWithout even looking at one another, Janine and I said, “Us.”\n\nAnd that is how a family was born.\n\nJULY 2015\n\nHere is Chika rolling on the carpet of my office, playing with flash cards. She has been here five weeks, and I am working on her English.\n\n“Five plus ONE!” she yells.\n\nHow much is that?\n\n“SIX!”\n\nCheck the back, I say.\n\nShe checks it.\n\n“I was … white!”\n\nYou were right.\n\n“I was … wwwwrrrright!”\n\nShe giggles wildly. I point to a chair.\n\nWhere is the chair? I ask.\n\n“There is it!”\n\nThere it is, I say. Not \"there is it.\"\n\n“There … it … is.”\n\nWhere is the paper?\n\n“There is it!”\n\nThere it is, I say.\n\nShe stops, squints and looks at me.\n\n“Where is the odder kids?” she asks.\n\nI realize she means the children at the mission. Is she missing them? Missing her home? I point to a photo of them on my desk.\n\n“There is it!” she yells.\n\nHome video: Chika studies math with Mitch\n\n* * * *\n\nWe got a second bed.\n\nThis would be where Chika slept — at the foot of our own bed and a few feet from the armoire. Janine and I had to quickly reset the house. We'd owned it for 24 years; it was organized, down to the throw pillows on the couch.\n\nBut your world turns elastic when a child arrives. And so our kitchen cabinet was stocked with Cheerios, and little shoes appeared in the closet, and a hanging rack of pint-sized clothes took root in our bathroom. Everyone who came by seemed to bring a toy, and we quickly collected a basket full of stuffed ponies, talking dinosaurs and silky-haired princesses.\n\nChika’s new bed was made up with a colorful blanket from Disney’s “Frozen.” The first night she slept there, we kissed her, got under our covers, and heard her little voice from somewhere below our feet:\n\n“Goodnight, Mr. Mitch. Goodnight, Miss Janine.”\n\nTo be honest, nothing was the same after that.\n\n* * * *\n\nCancer is speed. Broken down, that’s where it draws its power. The malignant cells spread illogically fast, splitting and multiplying and defying efforts to slow them.\n\nAs those cells were racing through her healthy brain tissue, Chika was racing through a brand new world. She’d rumble around the living room in a circle, touching each piece of furniture. She’d stand by a large window and scream, “Bird!” Everything was a revelation. The TV set. The dishwasher. When we drove her to the hospital, I watched her wide-eyed gazing out the car window, billboards, fast food outlets, a passing limousine. What must she be thinking, I wondered? Her sensory input was on overdrive.\n\nPerhaps that’s why she loved to hide. When I came in from the outside, she would pull a blanket over her head and yell, “Mr. Mitch? Where is Chika?”\n\n“Hmm, where is Chika?” I’d repeat. I’d fake a search. When I finally unearthed her, she’d howl with laughter.\n\n“There is she!” she’d yell.\n\n“There she is,” I’d correct.\n\nHer radiation began. Five days a week for six straight weeks, on a lower level at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak. She was fitted for a helmet and had to lie on a slab, as a giant machine shot a beam at her tumor in hopes of destroying DNA in the cancer cells while leaving healthy cells intact.\n\nChika understood none of this. Only that she had to stay still — and if she was good, we would go for ice cream or to the toy store. We had chosen not to explain cancer to her. We didn’t nickname her tumor. We told her only that she was a little sick right now, and these treatments would make her better. Our thinking was, she's a child, let her be a child. There’s no right way to do it. You pick a path. This was ours.\n\n“How old is she again?” the radiation oncologist, Dr. Peter Chen, asked one morning as we watched from a monitor outside the room.\n\n“She’s 5,” I said.\n\n“Really?”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“She’s lying so still. She’s better than the adults we treat.”\n\n“Well, she’s 5,” I said.\n\n“Remarkable,” he mumbled.\n\n* * * *\n\nI observe how quickly her English improves. She, meanwhile, is observing me.\n\nOne day, at the table, I am reading a complicated contract.\n\nOh, boy, I sigh.\n\n“Why do you say 'oh, boy'?” she asks. “There is no boy here.”\n\nIt’s just something people say when they are tired, I say.\n\nShe thinks.\n\n“Why don’t you say, ‘Oh, girl?’\n\nShe loves to sing, but the words are her own. Mary had a little lamb — “whose crease was crise of snow.” A spoon — “from the sugar” — makes the medicine go down. When I correct her, she insists, “It’s my mouth, I can say it the way I want.”\n\nOne morning, she makes an observation.\n\n“Mr. Mitch, when you sleep, you sound like a bear.”\n\nJanine laughs. I laugh. Chika laughs at us laughing. She makes a snorting sound and we laugh even harder. She is so happy, so pleased. There is rare delight, I recall, in making your parents crack up.\n\nEven if they are not your parents.\n\nAUGUST 2015\n\nRadiating a brain tumor can cause swelling, or edema. So steroids are prescribed to reduce that risk, which in turn quickly puff up a child. This is why, in photos of DIPG kids, they often seem ill-formed, their faces grotesquely swollen.\n\nIn Chika’s case, the doctors prescribed Dexamethasone (a substance, I noted, that will get you thrown out of the Olympics). I had written about steroids over the years, decrying their risk and long-term consequences. I silently cringed when she swallowed them every morning, hidden inside a spoonful of applesauce.\n\nBreakfast had become part of our routine, scrambled eggs, toast and, as the steroids increased her appetite, more eggs, more toast — plus avocado, tomato, jelly, cereal. Chika insisted that she could make the eggs (after watching me do it) so I stood behind her as she scrambled them in a bowl. She came up to my waist and sometimes I would wiggle my fingers in her hair.\n\n“Hey,” she would say, laughing, “stop doing that!’’\n\n“But I like it,” I’d say.\n\n“Ohhh-k,” she’d relent.\n\nOne day, as I did this, her hair came out in my fingers. She turned and looked. I quickly closed my fist.\n\nSoon, such changes were obvious. Chika’s soft, round face grew large and distorted (the steroids). Her middle swelled. Her thighs puffed. She ballooned from 48 pounds to 72 pounds. Lifting her became a challenge.\n\nMore patches of hair fell out. At night, her head got hot and she sweated, and at times she would scream during her sleep, much of it in Creole that we did not understand. In the morning, we asked if she had a bad dream, and she sometimes said, “I dreamed about a monster.”\n\nWe went through the summer this way, shuffling her to medical appointments, doctors, homeschooling her at the house. I fell behind on jobs. I was late filing stories. The parenting process hijacked every hour we used to have for ourselves.\n\nAnd yet, it never felt like a burden. More like a new purpose we had suddenly tumbled into, rendering our old life a phone call we just couldn’t make, or an appointment we just kept missing.\n\nJanine and I divvied up the daily tasks of keeping Chika occupied, Janine taking the dressing, the showering, the tea parties and game playing, while I handled the doctor appointments, the food gathering, the toy store runs — and the dental care.\n\nEach morning when Chika rose and each night before she went to bed, I would squeeze toothpaste on her newly purchased toothbrush. She’d developed some gum issues, so I added mouthwash in a little cup. As she went through her routine, I stood behind her, studying our reflections in the bathroom mirror, and the obvious contrasts in our ethnicity.\n\nI wondered how Chika saw us. Black? White? Haitian? American? She never asked about our differences, although in that mirror we could not have looked more opposite, short, tall, dark-skinned, light-skinned. It didn’t matter. We were there to brush teeth. Eventually, I would say, “OK, spit” and she would do so and laugh.\n\nOne night, Chika clomped ahead of me to the bathroom. She shut the door mischievously, before I could get in.\n\n“What are you doing, Chika?”\n\n“Just a minute!” she yelled.\n\nJust a minute?\n\nI knocked again.\n\n“Just a minute!”\n\nFinally, when she hollered, “OK!” I entered saying, “Chika, come on, you can’t shut—\"\n\nI stopped. She had laid two toothbrushes side by side, squeezed out the toothpaste, and lined up two cups of mouthwash.\n\n“Now, you can brush your teeth with me,” she said.\n\nAs the doctor said. Remarkable.\n\nHome video: Chika and Mitch bond over nightly ritual\n\n* * * *\n\nOn a monthly visit to Haiti, one of our young boys asks me, “When is Chika coming back?”\n\nHe asks in front of a dozen other kids standing in the dusty yard. I have been avoiding this question. I don’t want to lie. I tell them Chika is getting treatment from the doctors and we hope to bring her back for a visit soon.\n\n“Does she sleep with you and Miss Janine?”\n\nYes.\n\n“In your bed?”\n\nShe has her own.\n\n“Does she eat with you?”\n\nYes.\n\n“Beans and rice?”\n\nOther things.\n\n“Does she have dolls?\"\n\nSome dolls.\n\n“Which ones?”\n\nI don’t know their names.\n\n“Should we pray for Chika?”\n\nAlways.\n\n“Every night?”\n\nEvery night.\n\nThey look off, as if trying to comprehend all this. It is hot, as usual, and they squint in the sun. One girl raises her hand.\n\n“When Chika comes back, can she bring the dolls?”\n\nSEPTEMBER 2015\n\nAnyone dealing with a terminal illness today will, at some point, face a fundamental decision: explore the Internet, or not.\n\nWe avoided it for months, having once scrolled the “DIPG” entries and seen countless heartbreaking Facebook posts and wide-reaching but often contradictory suggestions. It seemed confusing, even depressing, photographs of swollen children, holding teddy bears at fund-raisers, making final trips to Disneyland, parents bravely pushing up smiles. And the medical conclusions were all over the map. Try this. Don't try this. This worked. This didn't work.\n\nI stopped looking. Wanting to believe our case was unique, however naive that was, held off a crashing wave of hopelessness.\n\nSo instead of the Internet, I spoke with doctors, I called them, hounded them — especially the pediatric oncologists at Mott, Dr. Pat Robertson and Dr. Carl Koschmann. I asked them constantly about alternative treatments. What were other researchers finding? What were the latest drugs? What about Europe? I’d been warned that radiation provides a “false honeymoon” for DIPG kids, and could improve Chika to a point where we thought she was OK.\n\n“Don’t be fooled,” they cautioned, “the tumor comes back — and stronger.” So I tried to be preemptive. Unfortunately, besides radiation, there is no real treatment for DIPG. What exists are clinical trials, experimental drugs, a potpourri of unproven choices, like some massive medical casino. Choose your odds. Place your bets.\n\nMeanwhile, during this time, DIPG was unusually present in our local news.\n\nChad Carr, the 4-year-old grandson of Lloyd Carr, the former Michigan football coach, had been diagnosed with the same disease, in the fall of 2014. His parents, Tammi and Jason Carr, had made his battle public, to raise awareness of DIPG. Stories were written. Photos were taken. A hashtag — #ChadTough — was created.\n\nRead more:\n\nChadTough gala raises $1.025 million to combat DIPG, pediatric cancer\n\nChad Carr's family sets up DIPG Day in Michigan in his honor\n\nOn the afternoon of Sept. 12, 2015, I was at Michigan Stadium, covering the Wolverines football game against Oregon State. Just before kickoff, the crowd rose and cheered.\n\nChad Carr was being carried onto the field by his family.\n\nThe stadium announcer bellowed, “Joining the game captains for the coin toss is Chad Carr. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Carr family…”\n\nAt that moment, more than 100,000 spectators knew this little boy was fighting for his life. Fighting DIPG. It might have been natural to tell a colleague, “I have a child with that same cancer.”\n\nI didn’t. I kept quiet. I went home and never mentioned it to Janine. I knew, deep down, this was folly, thinking silence could affect anything. But when it comes to facing a child’s certain death, folly is underrated.\n\nOCTOBER 2015\n\nWe are in New York City. We have committed Chika to an experimental procedure run out of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, something called CED, Convection Enhanced Delivery. In this process, a catheter is inserted directly into the tumor, and a radioactive iodine, attached to an antibody, is dripped through the tube and into the cancerous tissue. The theory is this will be more effective, because CED circumvents the blood-brain barrier that keeps other drugs — even chemotherapy — from ever reaching the trouble spot.\n\nIt is the second time in four months that doctors will break through Chika’s skull.\n\nWe try to make the trip an adventure. Chika has never been to a city like New York, and her head is a swivel. Her new word is “Hey!” and she puts it before everything.\n\n“Hey! That building is so tall!”\n\n“Hey! There is a horse in the street!”\n\nI think about what she is about to go through. I hug her close and put my head on top of hers.\n\n“Hey! Why do you lean on me? I am not a bed!”\n\nShe is giddy with the energy of Manhattan, and Janine and I each take a hand as we lead her across busy intersections. I realize, had things been different, this could be a snapshot of us 30 years earlier, a happy young family darting across the street.\n\nNow we look like grandparents.\n\nWe visit Serendipity on the East Side, a restaurant famous for gargantuan frozen hot chocolates. We get Chika one and take photos of her sipping it. Bloated by the steroids, her face and belly are huge, and I notice an older woman looking at her with an expression that says, “Does she really need to eat more?” I glare back.\n\nLater, we walk Chika through Times Square. There are people dressed as Superman, Spiderman, Olaf. We take photos. One of the characters, on a break, removes his large cartoon head.\n\n“Hey!” Chika screams. “There is a man inside Mickey Mouse!”\n\nThat night, in the hotel room, we sit with Chika between us on the bed. I rub her cheeks. She has been taking liothyronine and super-saturated potassium iodine to block the potential harm to her thyroid. We have been warned that this operation, which requires precise, hours-long, computer-aided placement of the catheter, might be dangerous. I’ve been given a form that lists the possible risks:\n\nComa.\n\nPotentially uncontrollable seizures.\n\nDeath.\n\nI ask myself who am I to sign this? What right do I have? Who gave me that power?\n\nAnd then I remember checking in at the hospital and being given a badge that read “PARENT.” And I sign the form, because as a parent, even a substitute one, letting Chika sink is not an option. I put on a happy face and hide behind it as I play with her, like a man inside a Mickey Mouse.\n\nNOVEMBER 2015\n\nChika made it through the procedure. In truth, she sailed through it, which gave us hope. The lead doctor, Mark Souweidane, a pediatric neurosurgeon, was pleased with the way the treatment spread around the tumor. He showed us a scan, the luminescent green being the radioactive agent; it was like watching Kryptonite invade Superman’s head.\n\nI realized how many times I had now seen Chika’s brain on film. When previous scans were put side by side, it was clear that something we had tried had shrunk the tumor significantly.\n\n“This is good, right?” I’d ask the doctors.\n\n“It’s good,” they’d say, but there was always something behind their response, a hesitation, a filter; I was stung that they would not share my enthusiasm. Had they become that hardened to good news?\n\nChika, for her part, remained nonplussed, asking mostly about toy stores or a trip back to Haiti. No matter where we dragged her, or how much weight she gained, we were astonished at her lack of a complaint gene. The closest she came was after her surgery at Sloan Kettering, when Janine took her into the bathroom, and she looked in the mirror, and realized the doctors, in clearing a path for the catheter, had shaved a 3-inch square patch of her hair just above the forehead. It looked as if someone let a lawnmower run over it.\n\n“Hey!” she declared. “What happened to my hair?”\n\nWe bought her headbands to cover the spot. They had large, colorful flowers.\n\nShe was happy once again.\n\nCHRISTMAS 2015\n\nKeeping a promise, I take her back to Haiti. She bounces up and down as the airplane lands. If not for the seat belt, she might fly away.\n\nIn the Port-au-Prince terminal, a five-piece band plays just beyond passport control, and Chika stops to dance freely in front of them, a smile pasted across her still-chubby face.\n\nHer arrival at the orphanage is triumphant. She hides behind the seat when the SUV pulls in, but she can hear chants of “Chi-ka! Chi-ka!” The children mob the door, calling her name.\n\nAmid an ocean of wild hugging and squeals from the happy nannies, she strips off her sweatshirt and runs to the swing set. The other kids surround her, pushing her higher. As she rises into the Haitian air, her face is a portrait of relief.\n\nShe is home.\n\nWatch: Chika returns to Haiti\n\nThat night, she returns to her lower bunk bed in a crowded room of 13 other girls. In Michigan, she has accumulated a bevy of dolls, shelves of books, games and toys.\n\nHere, she has none of that. Just a cubby for her clothes and a toothbrush in the common outdoor sink area. But if she misses anything, she does not show it. She falls in line for meals, for showers. I wait for her to hold court, regaling the other kids with stories of her U.S. adventures. It never happens. Perhaps talking about America reminds her she will have to go back.\n\nI give small toys to all the kids. After a day, Chika’s breaks. She brings it to me to fix.\n\nI get a screwdriver. I fix it. Chika says “thank you” and runs off happy.\n\nKids expect grown-ups to fix things. I know, deep down, she expects us to fix her.\n\nWe’re trying, Chika. We’re trying.\n\nFEBRUARY 2016\n\nIf terminal cancer allows a “honeymoon” period, we were surely in it during the early months of 2016. Chika’s walking had improved greatly. She could swim (something she loved). Her left eye had readjusted, her smile was nearly even, and her body was slowly returning to normal, the steroids, blessedly, no longer needed.\n\nOn a visit to Mott, Chika took off down the hallway, then ran back and jumped, unexpectedly, into Dr. Robertson’s arms.\n\n“Oooh,” the doctor said, nearly knocked backward. She hugged Chika, and I silently took pride in how well this little girl — our little girl — was performing.\n\n“She’s doing great, right?” I said.\n\n“Uh-huh,” came the reply, again, in my mind, less enthusiastic than I wanted.\n\nChika’s affection, reserved when she first arrived, was full-bore now. She regularly hoisted herself into our bed and snuggled between Janine and me. She knew, when visitors came, to give the “two arm hug.” And the more cartoon movies about princesses she watched, the more fascinated she became with kissing.\n\nSometimes, in the early mornings, I’d be down in my office and my cell phone would ring. The house line was calling.\n\n“Mr. Mitch?” came her voice, still froggy with sleep. “Do you want to play fluffy cozy bed camp?”\n\nAnd I would tramp upstairs, enter the bedroom, and see two lumps under the blankets. Forgetting about writing, I would crawl beneath them and tussle a giggling Chika, who promptly informed me that, “I am the boss, and Miss Janine is the second boss. You can be the third boss.”\n\nShe passed her sixth birthday with a celebration at the Rain Forest Café, and more than 30 people came out — friends and relatives who helped entertain and care for her. She drew cards for them. On Valentine's Day, she drew one for us, with a small figure (her) standing beside two bigger figures (us). It read: \"I love you Mr. Mitch, Miss Janine, CHIKA.”\n\nWhoever she encountered was instantly taken with her. Once, while in a Belleville Cracker Barrel with our friends, Jeff and Patty Alley, Chika’s enthusiasm caught the attention of Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh. He had no idea who she was – and she certainly didn’t know him – but he was so taken with her, he bought her a toy guitar.\n\nShe had that effect.\n\nHer voice was magnetic — people actually stopped and complimented us on how sweet she sounded — and she was unafraid to use that voice to blurt out her growing immersion into English, even when her signals got crossed.\n\nExamples? When she washed with cold water, she declared, “Cold water, warm heart!” When I said I was bad at coloring, she said, “You never know since you try.”\n\nShe couldn’t get the word “rewind” right, so if I zoomed too far with the remote control, she’d say, “No! You have to remind it!”\n\nShe insisted the “Itsy Bitsy Spider” was the “Isby Bisby Spider” and the \"Sound of Music\" song went “Do-a-deer, an e-mail deer.” When she ate something she liked — which was all the time — she yelled “Yummy-yummy-yummy in my tummy, tummy, tummy!” and when she got dressed or used the bathroom it was “Privacy, please!” If she got testy, I’d say, “Remember, nobody likes a grumpy girl.”\n\n“Nobody like a grumpy boy, either!” she’d shoot back.\n\nOnce, while I was writing, she interrupted me multiple times to ask for crayons. I turned to her, patiently as I could, and said, “Chika, I have to work.”\n\n“Mr. Mitch,” she replied, “I have to play.”\n\nJanine and I made all the joyous stops with her, like one of those happy montage scenes in a movie. We took her to a musical, to Disneyland, we took her to “meet” Daniel Tiger. I took her for her first sled ride, which terrified her until she completed it and quickly yelled, “Can I do it AGAIN?” We hit the aquarium, the mall. We bought her a frilly yellow dress, a replica of the one Belle wore in “Beauty and the Beast.” She tried it on in front of a mirror and stared at herself for a long time\n\n“You’re a princess, Chika,” Janine said.\n\nChika beamed.\n\nAnd when she did, it was possible to think, even with a tumor the size of rubber ball sitting in her brain stem, that this child was going to be an exception, that she would push through and live to wear an adult version of that dress one day. This is what children do. They make you believe their youth can overcome anything.\n\nThen one day, she was swimming with an instructor, and I was on my way to work, and my phone rang and it was Janine. She was frantic.\n\n“Chika just threw up in the pool,” she said.\n\nI sped back home.\n\nHoneymoon over.\n\n****\n\nWe never hear from her father. According to the godmother, Herzulia, he is alive, but hasn’t been interested in his daughter since the day his wife died. She says he drinks. All the time. I cannot verify this. I have never met him.\n\nOn a monthly trip to Haiti, I ask Alain whether he thinks he can locate him.\n\n“I can try,” he says.\n\nHe makes some phone calls. He drives off in the mission car. Hours later, he returns with a short, mustached man, wearing gray slacks and a long-sleeved white shirt in the oppressive heat. Chika’s father. When I ask how he pulled this off, Alain shrugs. He says he made some inquiries, found a village, found the man and asked him to come.\n\nOnly in Haiti, I tell myself.\n\nHis name is Fedner Jeune. He is maybe 5 feet 7, slightly built. His large eyes are bloodshot, but they are Chika’s eyes. He looks like an unhappy, grown-up, male version of her. When I greet him, I feel empathy and resentment.\n\nTell him I’d like to know more about his daughter, I say.\n\nAlain does. He responds in Creole.\n\n“He says whatever you want to know, he will tell you.”\n\nI ask questions. About her birth. About her mother. I ask if he can take us to where Chika grew up. He says yes. We get in the car. He is missing two of his lower teeth. He never looks me in the eye.\n\nWe drive for an hour, beyond the traffic-choked maze of Port-au-Prince, teeming with street vendors and women carrying baskets on their heads. We reach the outskirts, where vegetation replaces buildings and paved roads turn to mud.\n\nAlain stops the car.\n\n“We are here,” he says.\n\nA tin door is hinged to a tree trunk. Inside, a patch of earth surrounds a small, square, cinder-block house, which is doorless.\n\nThis is where Chika was born? I ask.\n\n“Yes,” he says.\n\nThere is an extension cord that comes through the breadfruit trees. A single light bulb is hooked to it.\n\nAnd Chika’s mother died here, I ask?\n\n“Yes.”\n\nWhere is she buried?\n\nHe points outside.\n\nCan we go? I ask.\n\nIn a few minutes, we are at the site. I was expecting a cemetery. Instead, it is just a clearing, dotted by bushes and an old shack made of wood and tin. Laundry hangs on tree branches, and a woman and her children sit on buckets, watching us silently. A goat and a pig wander loose.\n\nSeveral slabs of concrete, each a different size, are above the ground. Fedner points to the biggest one.\n\n“There,” he says.\n\nShe is buried beneath that? I say.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nWith others?\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHow many others?\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\nIt is a mass grave. There are no markers. No names.\n\nHe pays someone every year, he says, to rent the space.\n\nThe goat bleats. Fedner scratches his head. I can tell he wonders why we are bothering with all this. I ask Alain to explain how sick Chika is, and how we hope we can find a cure for her tumor, but it is possible we may not.\n\nFedner has no reaction.\n\n\"If Chika dies,\" Alain asks him, \"Do you have any wishes where she should be buried?\"\n\nHe looks down and mumbles something.\n\nWhat did he say, I ask?\n\n“He says whatever you decide is fine with him.”\n\nA bug whizzes by my head. I study the slab above the mother’s remains. I promise myself it won’t be anything like this.\n\nMAY 2016\n\nThe tumor, it turns out, was like a sleeping bear: After winter hibernation, it grew hungry and stirred.\n\nChika’s eye drooped again. Her walking grew unsteady. February, March and April saw numerous medical maneuvers. A drug called Afinitor (Everolimus) was introduced, followed by Avastin, designed to shrink back some of the tumor growth. A new chemotherapy drug called Panobinostat — hailed as promising against DIPG by a Stanford physician — was procured by Dr. Robertson. Chika was approved to receive it and we braced ourselves to enter the “chemo” world. We were following a regimen of multiple nutritional supplements, mixed into a daily shake that Chika dutifully drank from a large princess cup.\n\nPrior to that, desperate to stay ahead of the tumor’s progression, we'd enrolled in a second CED treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering. The initial procedure again went well. But in the middle of the night, with the catheter locked in her skull and the radioactive iodine oozing into her tumor, Chika somehow got out of bed and walked over to where I slept in a chair.\n\nI heard a noise. My eyes sprung open. There was Chika, inches away, the line from the catheter stretched like a kitchen phone cord.\n\n“Can we go to the toy store?” she asked, dreamily.\n\nI lurched her back toward the bed, the cord retracting. \"Oh, my God, Chika,\" I said. I frantically called the nurses. It was nearly 4 a.m. When Dr. Souweidane rushed in, he was, like the rest of us, in virtual disbelief. But apparently, after careful review, no damage was done.\n\nAn hour later, Chika was sleeping, Dr. Souweidane was gone, the nurses were tending to other patients, and I was shaking my head.\n\nThe toy store?\n\n* * * *\n\nShe has trouble walking now, and I hold both hands and guide her up and down staircases.\n\n“Step, step, step,” I say.\n\n“Step, step, step,” she repeats.\n\nSometimes she wobbles and lands on her rear end. She does not cry. She’ll say “Woops!” or “Hey, I fell on my butt!”\n\nI find myself learning from her simple joys. She is just so content. She makes the bed for her dolls. She delights in brushing Janine’s hair. On airplanes, she takes things from the snack basket and meticulously tucks them away for later, happy as an industrious squirrel. She claps at the end of family movies. She shimmies when she hears music. When I can’t remember the words to a movie song, she exclaims, “You didn’t watch Mary Poppins before? Are you CRAZY?” I apologize and she says, “You just have to watch it again. No problem.”\n\nDuring the day, she is joyous when occupied. She colors. She reads. She watches Bible stories. But at night, when I tuck her in, I can see the illness bothers her.\n\n“When am I going to walk right?” she asks.\n\nI hope soon, I answer. That’s why we’re going to the doctors.\n\n“Mister Mitch?”\n\nMmm?\n\n“If I can’t walk, can I still live with the other kids?”\n\nOf course, I say.\n\nThis breaks my heart.\n\nChika, I say, do you know how much I love you?\n\nShe shakes her head no.\n\nThis much, I say.\n\nI hold my arms out and grunt as I stretch them behind me. I turn to show her. Suddenly, I feel her hands pushing mine even closer together, closer, until the fingers touch.\n\n“That much?” she says.\n\nThat much, I say.\n\nJULY 2016\n\nOver the months, we lost track of how many needles Chika absorbed. Her veins were extremely hard to find, hiding as if they knew what was coming. Nurses tried her arms, wrists, feet, toes. Warm compresses. Vein finders.\n\nNothing helped. Every blood test was a major struggle. Chika was like a pincushion, and she howled with every poke, more scared — like most kids — of the second needle than the first.\n\nFinally, in late June, an Avastin treatment had to be canceled because they could not get a clean vein for infusion. Janine and I were advised that, in order to continue, she would require an intravenous port.\n\n“No! I hate that idea,” Janine said. I agreed. A foreign chamber placed under the skin? With a catheter into a vein that travels to the heart? It was frighteningly futuristic, a permanent branding. But in the end, we had no choice. It was that, or no more medicine.\n\nThe procedure was done at Mott (“We do thousands of these” we were told) and once she got home, Chika studied this new addition to her upper chest. She called it her “bump.” We told her it meant “no more stickies,” which seemed to appease her.\n\nAs a reward, I promised her another trip to Haiti, after her first port infusion. She endured that.\n\nAnd the next day, we left.\n\nBut something seemed off. Just hours after our arrival at the mission, Chika’s forehead was hot. She looked tired. She wanted to sleep in her bunk bed with the girls, but I suggested she spend that night with me.\n\nAfter brushing her teeth, and putting her on a pillow, I lay down next to her and shut my eyes.\n\n“Mr. Mitch?”\n\n“Yes, Chika?”\n\nShe vomited all over me.\n\nShe started to cry. “It’s all right, Chika, it’s fine, this is nothing,” I said, wiping the mess with the sheets. “Here we go. Here we go.” I hurried her to the bathroom.\n\nThirty minutes later, having cleaned the floor, the bed, changed her clothes (and mine) and put her back onto the pillow, she called my name once more. Her chest was heaving. I turned.\n\nShe vomited again.\n\nIt happened two more times. I ran out of towels and put old T-shirts beneath us. She finally fell into a troubled sleep, while I stayed awake, monitoring her breathing, hoping this was a stomach bug and fearing far worse.\n\nThe rest of the trip was a blur. Chika was mostly groggy, rarely engaged, sleepwalking through events that would normally have her giddy. She didn’t play. She hardly sang during devotions. When we left for the airport, she didn’t even want to say good-bye to the other kids. She just got into the SUV and looked out the window.\n\nShe slept much of the ride home.\n\nWithin a day back in Detroit, she’d developed a raging fever. We raced to Beaumont Hospital and then, via ambulance, she was transferred to Mott. An infection of some kind, they said. Antibiotics were started. CT scans. PT scans. MRIs. Her temperature zoomed above 104. Her heart rate reached 160 beats a minutes. They thought it was her lungs. They checked for meningitis. They spoke of sepsis. We fell into a nervous vigil in the hospital room, sleeping in chairs, eating from the cafeteria, bringing in balloons to try to brighten the drabness.\n\nIn the end, the infection was traced back to the port. Somehow, bacteria had entered during the one time they’d used it. The device was removed (a month after its insertion) leaving a scar on Chika’s soft chest and endless head shaking from Janine and me.\n\n“I knew it was a bad idea,’’ Janine said, near tears. “I knew it. I knew it.”\n\nNow, we were informed, even as Chika lay groggy, sweating, pumped full of antibiotics, that she needed a new form of delivery. A PICC line was suggested (Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter) a long, thin tube that goes through an arm vein and, as with the port, tips into a larger vein that goes to the heart. But unlike the port, a PICC protrudes, hanging from your biceps like a marionette string; it needs to be constantly cleaned and protected.\n\nAgain, what choice did we have? The line was put inside Chika and we were given a crash course in how to use it, flush it, sanitize its tips, seal, tuck, then repeat the process.\n\nWe hid our frustration. Chika had been through enough. The night before she was to leave the hospital, we all watched a Cinderella movie on the room’s TV set. She loved to see Cinderella dance with Prince Charming.\n\n“You can dance that way at your wedding,\" Janine said.\n\n“If I marry a prince?”\n\n“Maybe.” Janine knew Chika's best friend in America was one of our nephews, a sweetly-tempered 8-year-old named Aidan. “Maybe if you marry Aidan,” she said, teasingly.\n\nChika frowned and shook her head.\n\n“Aidan will not marry a sick girl.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Aidan will not marry a girl who cannot walk.”\n\nWe were stunned.\n\n“Chika. Of course he would.”\n\n“Aidan will not marry a girl who is missing her hair.”\n\n“Sweetheart. You marry people because you love them, no matter what their problems. Don’t say things like that.”\n\nShe looked at us blankly, as if these were the facts that we were too naïve to accept. With a tube sticking out of her arm, she turned back to the screen where Cinderella was dancing, a fairy tale more comforting than the truth.\n\n* * * *\n\nThe infection puts a hold on everything — including the chemotherapy she had started. It also shoots a hole in our confidence. The chemo is, at best, a long shot. Chika has already endured a second radiation therapy — something considered risky, but that we still tried. Any more radiation could damage her brain and possibly kill her.\n\nWe are running out of options, as if someone is crossing them off a list and saying, “Nope.”\n\nReluctantly, I return to the Internet. There are studies going on worldwide. Experimental drugs. Experimental trials. Each morning, I make calls and leave numbers. I send e-mails around the globe. Everyone wants to know what stage “the patient” is in, and when I detail what she has already been through — brain surgery, two radiations, two CEDs, chemo — a number of places say she is too deep into conflicting therapies, or, worse, just too far along. Every denial is like a chiming clock.\n\nI speak with Tammi Carr. She has offered to help. Her son, Chad, after a courageous battle, died of his DIPG, two months after that game at Michigan Stadium.\n\n“Chad gained his angel wings,” Tammi had written on her Facebook page.\n\nFifteen months from diagnosis to death.\n\nChika is at 15 months.\n\n“I know someone in Bristol,” Tammi says. “Bristol” is Bristol, England — just as “Houston” is the MD Anderson Cancer Center and “Mexico” is the intra-arterial treatments they are trying in that country. DIPG has a code of its own; all parents seem to know the shorthand.\n\nThe Bristol program is similar to Sloan Kettering, but instead of putting one catheter into the brain tumor, they use four. I correspond with the doctors there. I send scans through overnight delivery. Eventually, Chika is determined to be too far along (those words again). The doctor suggests an immunology program in Cologne, Germany.\n\nGermany?\n\nE-mails are sent. MRIs are sent. A Skype session is arranged. Chika qualifies. It is $45,000 for the treatment, no insurance taken, and at least three visits are required over three months time, eight days per visit, to judge the procedure's effectiveness.\n\nPlace your bets.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2016\n\nI pulled Chika’s wheelchair backward, up the small ramp and into the three-story apartment building in Cologne. A trolley rolled past. Passengers unloaded, students chatting loudly in German. We’d rented a flat here, and had been in it a week.\n\n“I have to go potty,” Chika moaned.\n\n“Hang on, hang on,” I huffed. I undid her belt, lifted beneath her arms, hoisted her onto my shoulders and clomped up a 20-step staircase. There was no elevator in the building.\n\n“Hang on, hang on,” I said, my breathing labored.\n\n“I have to go baaad.”\n\n“Hang onnnn.”\n\nI fumbled with the keys. I opened the door.\n\n“Hurry!”\n\nInto the bathroom, jacket off, leggings yanked down, hoist her onto the seat.\n\n“OK? OK?” I said, panting.\n\n“Privacy, please,” she replied.\n\nOut I went. In came Janine. This was our routine now. Chika had regressed from a walker to a wheelchair. For short distances she crawled across the floor. “My feet are sleepy,” she would say.\n\nShe had increasing issues with her bladder. Bathroom runs were a fire drill. Sometimes we found her quietly sobbing in the morning, and we’d say, “What’s wrong?” and we’d see the wet sheet beneath her and she’d say, “I need new underwear.”\n\nHer left eye no longer blinked, and at night we put soft tape over it to keep it from drying out. Her PICC line required constant care, robbing her of her beloved swimming or bubble baths. She could no longer pedal a toy car or run to hide behind a couch. We prayed that this immunology treatment would be her miracle. But the laundry list of things she had to surrender was growing longer than things she could do.\n\nAnd yet. Her adjustment skills were incredible. We’d sit and watch a film and she’d get so happy she’d throw her arms around me and say, “This is a really good movie!” I’d ask her what was her favorite part and she’d say, “Um, I don’t really understand what’s happening.”\n\nOr in Germany, in a small apartment, where we had to sleep in three twin beds pushed together. Chika loved it. She flopped between us as if we were pillows, asking Janine and me to kiss so she could watch. When we did, she clapped and said, “Now we can live happily ever after.”\n\nEvery day, after her treatments, we’d explore the streets of Cologne, me pushing her in her wheelchair, Chika flapping her arms and singing out loud, butchering lyrics from “Annie,”, “Frozen” or Christmas songs (“down through the chimney comes old, sick Nick!”). She remained totally unembarrassed. I envied her bravado.\n\nI wheeled her once to the towering Cologne Cathedral, first built in the 13th Century, and she surveyed it from her wheelchair and said she had never seen a building so big. I told her it was a church and that people prayed inside it.\n\n“What do they pray for?” she asked.\n\n“They pray for everything. They pray for their family. They pray they’ll get better if they are sick.”\n\n“They don’t pray for me. I’m not their child!”\n\n“They might be praying for you.”\n\n“They don’t even know me.”\n\n“People don’t have to know you to pray for you.”\n\n\n\nShe thought about that, then went back to chewing on a pretzel.\n\nChika was no stranger to faith. Sunday church and nightly devotions are routine at the Haiti mission, and she was always a loud and joyous force during those prayers. In Michigan, Janine once walked in on her intently singing a worship song to herself.\n\n“I’m no longer a slave to fear\n\nI am a child of God...”\n\nShe sang it, uninterrupted, for nine minutes, as if in private discourse with the Lord, her face calm, her eyes wide.\n\n\"I’m no longer a slave to fear\n\nI am a child of God.\"\n\nOne night, she asked if her mommy was in heaven.\n\n“Yes, she is,” we said.\n\n“When I go to heaven, will I see her?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“How will she know me?”\n\n“She’ll know you.”\n\n“Can you walk in heaven?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Can you run?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Can you have candy?”\n\n“Yes. Why?”\n\nShe shrugged. And then it hit me. She was listing all the things she could no longer do down here.\n\n* * * *\n\nOf all the maddening aspects of cancer, the worst may be the deal it seems to make with our immune systems. While our T-cells regularly attack other infections, cancer employs what some call a \"secret handshake\" that renders T-cells blind to their threat.\n\n\"Immunotherapy\" is a treatment that tries to alter that handshake — often by fooling the immune system into fighting the cancer. The Cologne clinic that treated Chika (called IOZK, and run by a Belgian oncologist) employed a technique that uses the patient’s own blood to create a cancer-fighting vaccine. This is done through the injection of a virus (NDV) that is deadly to poultry but harmless to humans. It attacks the DIPG tumor, the attack is studied, dendritic cells are beefed up in a specialized laboratory facility, and, ultimately, a vaccine from the patient’s own white cells and tumor antigens is injected back into the body, with the hope that the immune system does what the virus did: attack and kill the cancer cells in the brain.\n\nChika, again, didn’t understand any of this. But she listened to the doctors speak “a funny language” and she liked the water bed they let her lay in. The clinic was sparse, simple, on the fourth floor of an office building, one level above a gym. We sat near Chika as her head was heated by hyperthermia, and the poultry virus dripped through her PICC line, while she watched an iPad movie, lost in the magic of “101 Dalmatians.”\n\nA nurse brought me a cup of coffee. I heard conversations in German. I thought about how far we were from Haiti, and our kids kicking a soccer ball in the yard, wondering where Chika was and what she might be doing.\n\n* * * *\n\nI go to a doctor. I’m having pain in my lower abdomen. I may have a hernia.\n\n“Are you doing a lot of lifting?” the doctor asks.\n\nI almost laugh. Chika is constantly in my arms, and even at 62 pounds, is a challenge to pick up from funny angles.\n\nYes, I tell the doctor, a lot of lifting.\n\n“That could do it,” he says.\n\nHe says I should stop, but I know I will not. Holding this little girl, her arms hooked around my neck, head cradled beneath my chin, is the most satisfying posture I have ever known. I can feel Chika relax, feel the security that she gets from my grip. I try to find the word for it.\n\nTrust. That’s the word.\n\nTotal, unconditional trust.\n\nOne night I carry her to her bed, and I lay her down and she looks up sweetly. Janine is there, too.\n\n“How did you find me?” she whispers.\n\nHow did we find you? we say, surprised. You mean how did you come to us?\n\nShe nods.\n\nWe look at each other. It is the first time, really, she is asking who she is.\n\nSo we tell her. Her birth. The earthquake. Her long journey to this moment. When we finish, she seems satisfied. “One day,\" she says. \"I want to go back and live in Haiti.”\n\nBut if you weren’t here, we would miss you very much, we say.\n\n“Well,” she responds, “when I'm not here, you can close your eyes and think of me!”\n\nAnd while we cannot imagine life without her, the truth is, we would surely take this if it meant she could grow, if she could live out her years, seeing adolescence, graduating high school, finding a purpose, realizing her dream of being, as she once wished, “big.”\n\nWe would take it in a heartbeat.\n\nDECEMBER 2016\n\nThere was no joy at Christmas. Chika had suffered what the doctors euphemistically called “a setback.”\n\nUpon returning from her third trip to Germany, she was sluggish, her left side showed weakness and she threw up several times. She was drooling and her speech was slurring.\n\nWe returned to Mott. They took an MRI. The worst news was confirmed.\n\nThe tumor had sharply progressed.\n\nThis is the moment DIPG families dread. They are warned. They are briefed. Still, when it happens, it is like a sneak attack. I spoke with other parents. One told me his DIPG son was walking and talking and a week later, he was gone.\n\nFor the first time since Alain’s phone call, I began waking up in fear.\n\nChika’s eating grew labored. Her drinking, too. Her right arm and hand weren’t really functioning, and when I gave her cups, she bobbled them and they spilled.\n\n“Oops,” she'd say, quickly. “Sorry.”\n\n“It’s all right, no problem,” I’d reply, putting a cheer on every sentence.\n\nBut when your child’s outlook changes, your world changes with it. There was no personal time any more. Projects were tabled. Work meetings were canceled. I all but stopped writing for the newspaper. Janine and I wore floppy clothes around the house, showered less frequently, and almost never went out socially. The normal Christmas stuff was put on hold. No shopping. No gatherings. Instead, we spent nights monitoring Chika’s breathing, getting her to the bathroom on time, sitting with her as she tried to color, frustrated that her shaking hands could not stay within the lines.\n\nShe lost a tooth one night and, as was custom, she put it under her pillow for the Tooth Fairy. But we were so exhausted from giving her medicine, flushing her PICC line, and feeding her through syringes (which took hours, because she could no longer swallow whole food) that we fell asleep that night without tending to the matter.\n\nIn the morning, we found Chika sitting up, her head bowed, the tooth her hand.\n\n“Chika, what’s the matter?” we asked.\n\n“The Tooth Fairy forgot me,” she mumbled.\n\nOur fall was complete.\n\nOn Christmas Day, we woke her up, and dressed her in a red sweater. We tried to stir her interest, but she was groggy, her eyes blank. We sat her by the tree and slid in one present after another, gifts people had brought for her. She responded slowly, lacking any thrill of a year earlier, when she ripped open everything.\n\nIn the middle of this, Janine leaned over and gave her a kiss. Then she asked, “Do you want to kiss Mr. Mitch?” She nodded and kissed my cheek with a spitty smack. Then Chika whispered, “Kiss each other.”\n\nSo we did, in front of her face, and she had a look of wonder, and Janine started to cry and said, \"Thank you, angel.\" And with her good hand, Chika reached for the tissues and pulled one out and tried to dab Janine's tears, which only made her cry more.\n\nWatch: A lullaby for Chika\n\n* * * *\n\nThe disease progression is like death by a thousand cuts. But the hardest loss is Chika’s voice. That precious voice, like cotton candy melting in the air. When it begins to fade, I am desperate to hang on to its sound.\n\nGood morning, Chika, I say.\n\nNo response. Just a stare.\n\nGood morning, sweetheart.\n\nNothing.\n\nShe sleeps with many dolls now, so I take one, a small bear, and ask it questions, hoping to engage her.\n\nDo you belong to Chika? I ask the bear.\n\n“Yes,” Chika finally whispers.\n\nAh. You're a lucky bear. I think Chika is a really special girl. But don’t tell her! That’s just between you and me.\n\n“But ... I’m her bear,” she says. “I have to tell her everything.”\n\nOh, really? Well. I don’t want you to tell her how much I love her.\n\n“She knows.”\n\nShe does? How much? How much do I love her?\n\nChika slowly takes the arms of the teddy bear and pulls them behind its back.\n\n“This much,” she whispers.\n\nI choke up.\n\nThat’s right, I say. That much.\n\nWatch: Chika is celebrated on her birthday.\n\nFEBRUARY 2017\n\nNurses had arrived in our home. Hospice workers, too. Rehab was arranged, where therapists worked Chika’s otherwise motionless appendages. A support team of friends and family combined for 24-hour shifts. And Chika made a trade. Her PICC line was removed, because of swelling in her arm.\n\nAnd a feeding tube was inserted.\n\nAbove her belly button, just below her sternum, a tiny balloon was pushed through her skin topped by an exposed valve that was connected to a tube. Through that tube, you could drip almost anything — water, apple juice, smoothies, drugs.\n\nWe had to use it, because Chika’s swallowing was gone. Her speaking was gone. Her voluntary movement was limited to a finger wave — all because of the relentless DIPG tumor rooted in her pons and spreading like an ooze, slowly crippling her every ability. Germany was out. So were any return trips to Haiti. Chika could no longer endure the travel. I was almost grateful that she couldn’t ask to go home, because I hated having to disappoint her.\n\nShe’d thinned considerably, and with her hair braided, she looked younger, remarkably like the day she’d arrived, except for the 4 inches she’d sprouted, seemingly all in her legs. A hospital bed had replaced her previous one, and she slept just 2 feet away from us now, close enough to hear every breath. The pulse/oxygen monitor was placed on her finger, and small red digits were a constant reminder of her status. If they dropped, we needed to do something: tap her chest, pound on her back, put a suction tube down her throat and pull up whatever was clogging it.\n\nBecause so much of this felt barely human, we did all we could to humanize the rest. We read to Chika. We sang to her. We recited a special prayer. Each night, we Skyped with the kids in Haiti as they sang their devotions, and one by one, they stepped before the camera and said “Good night, Chika,” “Good night, sister.”\n\nWatch: The other childen wish Chika a good night.\n\nShe responded to their voices like Tinkerbell to pixie dust. I hated to cut off the connection. Sometimes she looked at me silently, and I remembered fixing her toy, and I could almost hear her say, “Can’t you fix this? You’re the grown-up.”\n\nIt haunted me.\n\nFor the first time in my career, I missed the Super Bowl, because Chika was throwing up the morning of my plane. I canceled all commitments. I stopped answering the phone. Our entire focus was on prolonging Chika's life.\n\nShe was a fighter.\n\nWe would be fighters.\n\nOur medical Hail Mary was a drug that few had heard of, Buparlisib, or BKM120, technically a “pan class phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor.” We understood it only as something that might stall the tumor growth, because Chika’s specific tumor mutations, on paper, matched up to this agent. It was nearly impossible to get. Numerous pleas were made to Novartis, the Swiss-based global health care company, to grant us the drug (not available to the public) through its “compassionate care” program. Although we were turned down several times, with help, we ultimately were granted a supply. Each morning, Janine and I opened the little capsules and dissolved them into water, then pulled the water into syringes and pushed it through Chika's feeding tube.\n\nJanine and I did this silently. Carefully. Neither one of us wanted to say what we were thinking: that we were out of chips, the last bet had been placed.\n\nSometimes, when we sat with Chika, I thought about how, in a certain way, she was growing backward, toward infancy. She'd gone from running to walking to crawling to being lifted. From eating to being fed. From bathrooms to being wiped.\n\nFrom talking to silence.\n\nShe was, in a strange way, returning to where she started.\n\nSo far from where she started.\n\n* * * *\n\nI arrange a one-day trip to Haiti.\n\nI have to purchase a grave.\n\nThe laws, I am told, require proof of interment arrangements before a body will be allowed to come into Haiti. I long ago decided that if things went badly, she would be buried here, in her home country, where one day the other children could come and visit. But I cannot fathom making these arrangements if Chika dies, and so I do it now, while it still seems abstract.\n\nAlain drives me to a cemetery called Parc Du Souvenir on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. I am told it is the nicest one. But in comparison to an American cemetery, it is only fair, the graves in uneven rows, plain white headstones, erratic plantings.\n\nI find two empty sites together. We go to the office and Alain informs the manager, a broad-faced, middle-age woman, that I want to purchase them.\n\n“For how many people?”\n\nOne, I say.\n\nShe almost laughs.\n\n“One person, you should use the crypt in the wall. A grave is for five people.\"\n\nAlain explains that in Haiti, bodies are stacked five high in grave sites.\n\n“Two would be for 10 people,” the woman adds.\n\nWell, I want two plots, I repeat. I want space for her loved ones to be able to sit and visit.\n\nShe shakes her head as if I am crazy.\n\n“Who is it for?” she asks.\n\nI don’t want to tell her the whole story.\n\nMy daughter, I say.\n\nShe looks at me.\n\n“I'm sorry,” she says.\n\nAPRIL 7, 2017\n\nThe phone rings. No one answers it. This is back where the story began, in our bedroom, on a Friday afternoon. Our friends and family have said their good-byes, exiting in tears. It is only Janine, the nurses, me.\n\nAnd Chika.\n\nWe surround her in the bed. We want to “cuddle” her, a word she loved, to hold her in our arms for her final hours. We are trembling. Her breaths are so infrequent. There’s one, we say. We were told that when the end came, it would be like this, the brain no longer sending the proper signals to breathe. It sounded chaotic. But it is not that at all. It is slow, gradual, like watching a sun disappear over the horizon.\n\nWe have surrendered, I hear myself say. I feel like such a failure. All the doctors tried so hard, the U-M doctors, the Beaumont doctors, the New York and Germany doctors — and the nurses, the therapists, the specialists, the radiologists, all great, all earnest, all answering phones in the middle of the night and procuring the latest drugs, treatments, procedures, data — and yet none of it could build the wall. None of it could stop the monster.\n\nOnly Chika was left, at the end, a sweet-voiced David versus Goliath, to make a final stand.\n\nThe day before, her breaths had slowed like this, she was down to one or two a minute, and we leaned on her tender body and the hospice nurses who had been called confirmed that this was likely the end.\n\nBut Janine heard a small sound, and another one, and said out loud, “It sounds like she’s trying to breathe.”\n\nWe heard it again.\n\n“If she’s trying, we’re trying,” I insisted.\n\nAnd so we propped her up, tapped her back with soft rubber pounders, suctioned her throat and nose. And rather quickly, Chika was breathing 33 times a minute. She’d literally risen from the almost-dead. The hospice people shook their heads in disbelief.\n\n“She’s unlike anyone we’ve ever seen,” they said.\n\nAnd she was. She always was. She was strong and stubborn and so filled with life that even a killer tumor struggled to suppress it. The doctors who predicted a quick demise were stunned by her longevity — 23 months is an eternity with DIPG — and her Michigan doctors said they learned things from her German doctors and her New York doctors and the drug interactions and the immunology we tried. It enlightened them to new ways of looking at this disease.\n\n“She’s taught us all a few things,” admitted Dr. Ken Pituch, the director of Mott’s palliative care team.\n\nAnd yet, she is only human.\n\nAnd the cancer is not.\n\nThe sun is strong outside. Soft prayer music is playing through an iPad. Suddenly, for no apparent reason, Janine asks for a stethoscope. She has never done this before. Something about the moment makes her want to listen.\n\nI kiss Chika’s cheeks. I rub her small shoulders. I realize, squeezed between the guard rails of the mattress, that we made the decision to get into this bed a long time ago, back when the whole thing started, that all parents of sick children do, you get into bed and you hug and you pray and you try desperately to protect your little one from an eternal sleep.\n\nThe music playing is the song Chika once sang by herself:\n\n\"I’m no longer a slave to fear\n\nI am a child of God …\"\n\nJanine puts the tips of the stethoscope into her ears. She leans over. She holds the diaphragm to Chika’s soft chest.\n\nShe listens.\n\nShe hears one final heartbeat.\n\nAnd our little girl is gone.\n\n* * * *\n\nI remember a day, after Chika was no longer walking, that we were sitting around the kitchen table, coloring. I looked at my watch.\n\n“Oh, wow, Chika,” I said. “I have to go.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“To work.”\n\n“I don’t want you to go.”\n\n“I have to.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because, Chika. It’s my job.”\n\nShe flashed her eyes.\n\n“No, it isn’t,” she said. “Your job is carrying me.”\n\nAnd she was right. Carrying her was my job. Carrying her to doctors, to hospitals, to the bathroom, to bed, carrying her through her amazing little life. It was the most honorable job I have ever had.\n\nAnd so, I carried her one last time.\n\nAfter Janine and her sisters and several friends had lovingly bathed her and done her hair and put on her favorite sherbet-colored dress and high-heeled princess shoes, I lifted this little girl, our little girl, and her head rolled into my chest. She looked beautiful, no more tubes, no more monitors, and I carried her down the hallway and out the front door, because nobody was coming in to touch her, and no stranger was ever going to take her from a home again.\n\nJanine was beside me. We walked down the driveway to a hearse that had been waiting. We placed Chika's body inside. And we watched the car pull away. The sky was clear and the trees were budding and the air was warm with a new, coming summer.\n\nI fell to my knees and buried my face in Janine’s hands.\n\n* * * *\n\nNearly 200 people came to Chika’s memorial service in a Troy funeral home, even though it was never announced or posted anywhere. Some of them had met Chika just once. But once, it seemed, was enough.\n\nThe next day we flew to Haiti. We greeted the other children at the mission and we hugged them tight and we answered their many questions. When one of them asked, “Does this mean God doesn’t listen to our prayers?” I nearly broke down. I had to say, “God listens to every prayer. But sometimes he doesn't give you the answer you want.\"\n\nI could not tell them why.\n\nI don’t know myself.\n\nAt Parc Du Souvenir, where Chika was laid to her final rest, the teachers who taught her and the nannies who looked after her sang prayers and cried, alongside Chika’s uncle, her baby brother, her two older sisters, her godmother, and even her father, who stood stoically near the back.\n\nAnd standing there, in the Haitian heat, the first time I had ever worn a suit and tie in this country, I realized families are like pieces of art: They can be made from many materials. Sometimes they are from birth, sometimes they are melded, sometimes they are forcibly constructed, and sometimes they are merely the confluence and time and circumstance, mixing together, like eggs being scrambled in a Michigan kitchen.\n\nBut they are all real. Chika was a daughter to a number of people. And for the last two years, she was ours, gloriously ours. And if we did not begin in the same place as other DIPG families, we ended there, railing against this tormenting disease and furious at the lack of weapons to fight it.\n\nYou can close your eyes and think of me, she once said. And that is all we are left with now. Medjerda (Chika) Jeune was born on the brink of an earthquake, and she shook our world in her own special way. With her, we became a combat unit, fighting against the unconquerable. But we also became something else:\n\nA family.\n\nAnd for all the harsh emptiness we feel today, for all our restless nights and morning tears, we can only be grateful the time we had. It was 23 months of an incomparable journey, endless memories, and limitless love. How can we be angry? We did not lose a child. We were given one.\n\nContact Mitch Albom: malbom@freepress.com.

Their eyes all lock on an enormous chandelier hanging over the central lobby, before the boys are lured to the gift booth, where they secure a souvenir program and, for Brendan, a small stuffed Santa Claus.\n\nUnlike most of the other ticketholders milling about before the 5 p.m. curtain -- the show is performed between two and six times each day through Dec. 30 -- the Mercers are guests of the house. Brad, a military veteran, was referred by the Wounded Warriors Project to the Garden of Dreams Foundation, a non-profit charity partnered with the Madison Square Garden Company (Radio City's parent) that provides opportunities for children and families facing a variety of obstacles, from disease to homelessness.\n\nGDF arranges tickets and meet-and-greets for events at all MSG venues, and other opportunities to interact with entertainers and athletes, including a shopping spree with the New York Knicks at a Target store in White Plains, NY and Christmas dinner with the New York Rangers. There's also an annual Garden of Dreams talent show; one of this year's participants, Julianna Pierre, 7, got to perform on Radio City's Great Stage as part of the opening festivities for this year's Christmas Spectacular. (The foundation can be contacted at www.gardenofdreamsfoundation.org.)\n\nBrad, 31, joined the army in 2001, fresh out of high school. Serving as a specialist team leader during Operation Enduring Freedom in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he was injured trying to clear a fellow infantry soldier's jammed weapon. The \"round cooked off in the chamber,\" causing him to lose all hearing in his right ear and 50 per cent in his left.\n\nIn addition to wearing hearing aids, Mercer suffers from memory loss, headaches -- \"to the point that I can't get out of bed\" -- and post-traumatic stress disorder. He regularly sees a neurologist and a speech therapist, \"to help me remember words and what they mean.\"\n\nHe insists, \"It's not too bad. I thank God every day that I have a great support system. My beautiful wife and kids help me every day.\" (Brad also cites the \"great help\" of the Wounded Warrior Project.)\n\nCorinne adds that they \"try to make the best of\" the tougher days. When Brad is stuck in bed, \"we'll play small, quiet games, or have a movie/pajama day, or a dinner picnic in bed! It's made Brad and I closer as husband and wife also...Sometimes it's difficult with Brad's disabilities, especially with the kids, but everyday we learn from it, and grow as a family.\"\n\nCertainly, on this late afternoon, standing next to Corinne, 30, his wife of 11 years, and their elder sons -- they have an 18-month-old, Avery (at home with his grandmother), and Corinne is three months pregnant with a fourth child -- Brad is all smiles. They have traveled from upstate Watertown, near Fort Drum, where he helps manage the barracks for soldiers coming from and going to the base.\n\nThe honorably discharged solider is soft-spoken and polite, but shows a dry sense of humor. He notes that he was deployed just once -- \"One trip was all it took\" -- and refers to Corinne as his \"translator,\" though speaking directly and clearly into his better ear usually suffices. The couple has been to Manhattan several times before, once taking in a performance of Broadway's Mamma Mia! It is Keagan and Brendan's second visit, preceded by one this past summer.\n\n\"We did a lot of walking that time,\" recalls Keagan, apparently the more reserved of the two, sitting on a sofa in the upstairs lobby before the show. \"But it was fun walking around with my family.\"\n\n\"It was great!\" chimes in Brendan, wide-eyed and breathless. The highlight for him? The enormous ToysRUs store in Times Square, no question. \"Yeah yeah yeah!\"\n\nThe boys are dressed smartly but not fussily, Keagan in a black argyle sweater and Brendan in a grey vest over a patterned shirt. Entering the theater with their parents, they are led to a prime spot in the orchestra section; Brad insists that the reporter accompanying them take the choice aisle seat. Corinne is excited to see how the Rockettes \"all keep their legs together when they kick.\"\n\nOnce the performance begins, there is some quiet shifting of seats, to allow the children optimum views. Brad and Keagan swap places, and Brendan ends up perched on his mom's lap. As the 90-minute show proceeds from the opening \"Sleigh Ride\" scene, where the Rockettes are revealed as Santa's reindeer, to the climactic \"Living Nativity\" -- in which three camels, two sheep and one donkey join the company -- the boys sit rapt. Keagan guards a plastic bag without making crinkling noises, even when he applauds. (He could give a few grownup theatergoers lessons in etiquette.)\n\nBrendan is particularly taken by \"Here Comes Santa Claus,\" a number featuring dozens of dancing Kris Kringles. When the principal Santa -- Charles Edward Hall, who serves as narrator -- takes his bow during the curtain call, the \"almost-8\"-year-old waves his stuffed replica high in the air.\n\n\"Did you see my face when they all came out?\" Brendan asks later, as the audience starts to file out. \"I was like...\" He makes his eyes even bigger, and drops his jaw as far down as it can reach.\n\nBrendan's other favorite part was the camels. \"I wonder if they know that Wednesday is 'hump day,'\" he quips, grinning impishly. Keagan has a tougher time narrowing down the high points -- \"I liked the whole thing,\" he says sweetly. Brad agrees: \"There was a lot of talent.\"\n\nBut for the Mercers, the show isn't over. The four are guided backstage, where two Rockettes, Sara Hoenes and Alexis Olson, still in costume, greet Keagan and Brendan with swag bags. The leggy ladies ask Corinne if she has another child at home, and she nods, adding, \"and one in my belly,\" eliciting squeals of delight from her hosts.\n\nAs they walk across the now-bare stage, Brendan begins peppering Hoenes, who is making her debut with the Rockettes this year, and Olson, a ten-year-veteran, with questions. \"How did you guys end up in different clothes when you got off the tour bus?\" he asks, referring to a segment in which the chorines board a double-decker bus that whirls through projections of Big Apple landmarks.\n\n\"It's magic,\" Olson responds, not missing a beat. \"We're friends with Santa, so we have all kinds of magical things going on here.\"\n\nBrendan also wants to know if they can all see the camels. They can, and end up posing for photos with two of them, named Ted and Carol.\n\nThe Mercers also check out one of the Rockettes' dressing rooms, with its racks of glittering costumes. Back onstage, they pose for more photos. Brendan is happily positioned between Hoenes and Olson, ready for his closeup. Keagan is, predictably, more shy; but eager to oblige his parents, he ends up joining his kid brother for a number of shots.\n\nThe family leaves through the stage door, and heads through the cold, dark evening to the hotel where they will spend the night before returning to Watertown. The next day, Brad sends the reporter who trailed them through their special visit an email message.\n\n\"Thank you so much for the opportunity last night,\" he writes. \"We had a great time, and hope you received all the information you were looking for.\"\n\nHe closes with, \"Thank you again, and have a great day!\" Brendan might have added an extra exclamation point, or a smiley face; but his father's enthusiasm, and sense of appreciation, are just as palpable.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/karinabland/2017/12/29/alzheimers-disease-wife-cares-husband-who-forgot-how-care/922063001/", "title": "Alzheimer's disease: A wife cares for a husband who forgot how to ...", "text": "Harvey Boyd is a smart man.\n\nHis IQ is just over 140, which means he’s a genius or nearly so.\n\nHe graduated from California State University-Hayward, magna cum laude with a bachelor’s degree in business administration in 1969 and an MBA in finance and management in 1974.\n\nHe’s an accountant by training, so he’s good with numbers. He’s read every book on business, the economy and politics in the packed, floor-to-ceiling bookcases in his home office, books about Warren Buffett and George W. Bush.\n\nHe is retired now, but he worked in cable television for 35 years, beginning at a time when the industry was booming and the pace frantic. He was a corporate vice president by the time he was 27.\n\nEven as a boy on a farm in Nebraska and later in San Francisco, Harvey would get his schoolbooks for the next grade and read them over the summer. He wanted to know everything before anyone else.\n\n“I liked being the smartest person in the room,” Harvey says.\n\nHe was often in the room with a lot of smart people.\n\nHarvey worked with Katharine Graham, former publisher of The Washington Post; its former executive editor, Ben Bradlee; and business magnate Warren Buffett.\n\n“I was never intimidated to work with people like that,” Harvey says.\n\nNor was he daunted when he met U.S. Supreme Court justices, members of Congress or even President Ronald Reagan in the course of his work.\n\n“I always felt worthy.”\n\nNot anymore.\n\nHis life as he knew it is over.\n\nHarvey leans back in his brown recliner in the living room of his Mesa home. He flicks a hand toward the books on the side table, none of them the sort he would have kept in the bookcases in his office.\n\nThese are all about Alzheimer’s disease: one from the Mayo Clinic, another by two doctors, and the third, “Alzheimer’s for Dummies.”\n\nThat’s how he feels, he says. Like a dummy. Trying to learn about the disease that will kill him. Trying to master concepts he will never use.\n\n“I do my research best I can,” Harvey says.\n\nBy the time he reads to the end of the page, he can’t remember what it said. So he starts over, reading the same page, jotting notes on a yellow legal pad that won’t make any sense later.\n\nIt’s almost like Harvey can feel his brain deteriorating — not just one fact, one idea, one memory at a time, but a flow of them, like a faucet he can’t turn off.\n\nHis wife, Darlene, helps when Harvey can’t remember a name, or a date, or how to button his pajamas.\n\nHe resents her for it. She didn’t graduate from high school — she has a general education diploma, a GED — and now she’s giving him answers?\n\n“There are just some things that you need help with,” Darlene says, soothingly. She sets a glass of Diet Pepsi on a coaster on the side table next to him.\n\nHe glares at her. “At least I’m still smarter than you,” he says.\n\nDarlene looks at the floor.\n\nSuddenly Harvey asks, “How long have we been married?”\n\n“Too long,” Darlene says, looking up and laughing.\n\n♦ ♦ ♦\n\nThis is not a love story. Really, it never was.\n\nDarlene fell in love with the man Harvey presented in public, not the one he was in private.\n\nThe man he shows the rest of the world is smart, capable, tough but compassionate. At home, with Darlene, he is often impatient and critical.\n\nHarvey admits he likes things done a certain way: “my way,” he says, “if I’m being honest.”\n\nHarvey is being honest. He doesn’t really have much choice now.\n\nAs Alzheimer’s disease and dementia progress, they destroy parts of the brain. Personality traits and quirks, good and bad, can be exaggerated in one way or another. Good if a person is endearing, optimistic or easygoing. Bad if he is angry, critical or stubborn.\n\nHarvey has no filter now. One of his doctors compared it to losing the brakes in a car: There is nothing to slow it down, let alone stop it.\n\nHarvey and Darlene married in 1987, divorced in 1991, and remarried in 1996.\n\nThere were times she left him — too many to count, Darlene and Harvey agree. Harvey would call and cajole to get her to come back. When that didn’t work, he would threaten to let their dog loose, or to kill himself.\n\nDarlene would come back, and everything would be fine. For a while.\n\nEven now, there are times when Darlene packs her things and puts them in the back of her car. She sits in the driveway, the engine running, the car in reverse, tears running down her face.\n\nShe doesn’t leave.\n\nNow she can’t.\n\nMay 2016:\n\n'All about me now, isn't it?'\n\nA square white board propped up against the fireplace says, “Wednesday, 5/12/16,” so Harvey knows what day it is.\n\nHe has visitors today, from the newspaper.\n\nHarvey wants to talk about what is happening to him. He wants to write a newspaper column or talk to a reporter. He believes he can help other people.\n\n“It’s something no one thinks will ever happen to them, but it is something that we are all afraid will happen to us,” he says.\n\nHe’s a writer himself, having self-published a book called “Western Madness.” He tells Darlene to fetch a copy from a box in the garage. Maybe he could write about the disease as it progresses.\n\nHe still wants to show how smart he is. He can’t imagine living with less intellect.\n\nBut he knows he is not the same as he was.\n\n“I can feel that I’m losing my mind,” he says. “I’m not the smartest person in the room anymore, and I don’t like it.”\n\nHe wonders what his IQ would be if he was tested now.\n\nHarvey thinks he will have a year, maybe 18 months, from now before he begins to lose his cognitive abilities.\n\nHe won't get even that.\n\n“It’s probably not going to be pretty,” Harvey warns.\n\n“I wasn’t always a very nice person. I’ve been told I’m narcissistic — and that’s probably true.”\n\nAnd then he grins: “But it is about me now, isn’t it?”\n\nVideo: 'It's a tough thing to face'\n\nJuly 2015:\n\nAsking questions, getting lost\n\nLooking back now, Darlene thinks Harvey had experienced some memory loss for years before he was actually diagnosed.\n\nShe was at work in 2009 when she got a call from the manager of the Home Depot near their house. Harvey was in the store, but he could not remember his name or where he parked his car. Could Darlene pick him up?\n\nHarvey seemed fine by the time she arrived, and they brushed off the incident, figuring maybe he had been tired or dehydrated. Harvey was president and CEO of Western Broadband then and worked long hours.\n\nIt wasn’t long after Harvey retired in 2011 that Darlene noticed that her husband, who had always prided himself on knowing more than she did, was asking a lot of questions.\n\nWhat was the name of that restaurant? And the man he used to work with?\n\nAnd then one day when they left a restaurant, Harvey tried to get into the wrong car in the parking lot, frightening the woman inside.\n\nWhen Darlene suggested something might be wrong, Harvey told her she was stupid. She began to write down the incidents in a binder, now thick with paperwork.\n\nHarvey’s questions grew more frequent, and then alarming.\n\nWhere are my clothes? Is it daytime or night?\n\nAnd then Harvey began to get lost. On the way to the pharmacy. On his way back from the gym.\n\nAt first, Harvey would use the GPS on his cellphone to guide him home, showing up hours late. But then he forgot how to use it, or that it was on his phone at all.\n\nHarvey would pull over and call Darlene, reading her the street signs he could see. She would get in her car and find him, and then he would follow her home.\n\nSometimes, Harvey says, even when he followed Darlene into their driveway, he’d look at their house, and it wouldn’t be familiar.\n\nBut Darlene would be there, standing outside, waiting for him.\n\nHe knew her.\n\nHarvey was 67, retired for four years, in July 2015 when he agreed to see the neurologist who would diagnose him with dementia. A brain scan showed atrophy, a wasting away of tissue.\n\nEight months later, in March 2016, a clinical neuropsychologist would confirm dementia and add a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nInterlude:\n\n'I'll miss the ending'\n\nThe TV mounted above the fireplace is on, the volume up loud, and tuned to CNN. Nothing Harvey watches on TV makes any sense.\n\n“Maybe it’s just a habit now,” he says.\n\nTelevision was once his life. Harvey was on the board of directors of C-SPAN for 12 years. He was inducted into the Southwest Cable Communications Association Pioneer Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nNow he can’t keep track of the new ways people watch TV. He says he hasn’t heard of Netflix or Hulu, though behind Harvey, where he can’t see her, Darlene nods, yes, he has.\n\n“I guess that’s proof I have Alzheimer’s, isn’t it?” Harvey says. He doesn’t want to believe it, though he knows it is true.\n\n“I want to get mad at somebody,\" he says, \"and there’s nobody to get mad at.\"\n\nDespite all the research, doctors don't have a real understanding of how Alzheimer's occurs, or why.\n\nHarvey hates that he can’t get straight answers. That’s why he likes math. There is always one correct answer. None of this ambiguity, this mystery.\n\nThe only thing he knows for sure is there is no cure.\n\nDarlene asks Harvey if he could turn down the volume on the TV.\n\nHe picks up the remote and studies it. It is sheathed in bubble wrap to keep it from shattering when Harvey gets frustrated and throws it.\n\nDarlene gives Harvey a few moments before she leans over and points out the volume button. Harvey presses it and sets the remote gently on the side table.\n\n“Well,” he admits, “I have my moments when I get mad at God — and everyone else.\n\n“But really I’m not mad. I’m just sad. I had a better life than most.\n\n“But I’ll miss the ending. I’ll leave before the movie is over.”\n\nBefore:\n\nThey meet, she marries him\n\nDarlene and Harvey met in 1987.\n\nShe was Darlene Kunz then, working part time for a cable company in Globe. She was 28 years old, in the midst of a divorce, living in a trailer with three children. She wore blue jeans and cowboy boots and kept horses in her backyard.\n\nHarvey was a vice president from the corporate office in Phoenix. He was 37, the divorced father of three. He wore crisp suits and a different tie every trip.\n\nHe had a tough reputation, the person management sent in when someone was going to be laid off.\n\n\"If he asked you for breakfast, you weren’t working there by lunch,” Darlene says.\n\nHe was sweet to Darlene, leaning on her desk to talk. But she wasn’t interested in dating anyone, let alone someone 10 years older who lived two hours away.\n\n“I was too old for her then, and fat,” Harvey says. He was almost 6 foot 2 and weighed 300 pounds.\n\nDarlene was slight, 130 pounds, and Miss Copper Dust Stampede in 1973.\n\nBy May of that year, Darlene had another job at a construction company. Through a mutual friend, Harvey asked if Darlene would give him the pleasure of dining with him.\n\nHe said it like that, Darlene says. The pleasure of dining with him. She was taken by his politeness.\n\n“You have to remember, I was from Globe, and in Globe, your date usually got drunk and slobbered on you,” Darlene says. She said she would go.\n\nWithin an hour of her reply, Harvey sent a dozen roses and a poem.\n\n“Did I?” Harvey asks, smiling. He leans forward, as if he is hearing this story for the first time and eager to know what happens next.\n\nDarlene agreed to dinner, at the old Copper Hills restaurant, the first of many dates.\n\nHarvey made the 60-mile round trip to Globe every weekend. He would call each night, long-distance from his apartment near the Arizona Biltmore.\n\nHarvey took Darlene to dinner and dancing; she took him fishing. He showed up with all new fishing gear and the first time he cast, his reel flew off into Roosevelt Lake.\n\nDarlene laughed hard, crossing her legs to keep from wetting her pants.\n\nThat summer, Harvey asked her to move to Phoenix to live with him. They moved into a big house in Scottsdale, with horse corrals out back.\n\nDarlene’s son Craig was 12. Wendy was 11, and Brett was in preschool. Harvey had three children, too, they lived in California with their mother.\n\nHarvey bought Darlene a truck and horse trailer and took her to Hawaii for the first time. He pressed her to get married, but she thought they were fine as they were.\n\nFinally, she tore a page for wedding chapels from the phone book and told him to make the arrangements.\n\nHe did, picking the date and place. They married on Dec. 14, 1987, in a Mesa wedding chapel, with no flowers, just the two of them with her children.\n\nAfter:\n\nThey split and marry again\n\nEverything changed after they got married.\n\nHarvey didn't like the way Darlene kept the house, or the time she got dinner on the table, or how late the kids slept on weekends.\n\nHe would discount what she said, whether it was about horses or what was on the news. “You’re stupid,” he spat at her. If she cried, he made fun of her. She hurled insults back.\n\nHe didn’t hit her, but he was a big man. He’d shout and the kids would scatter.\n\n“I soon learned it was better to comply,” Darlene says. She had dinner on the table when Harvey got home and the kids up early doing chores on Saturdays.\n\n“That was probably smart,” Harvey says.\n\nHis chin is in his hand, listening, like he's watching old movies of his life. Harvey wishes he had been less aggressive, less controlling. He thinks he would have been a less effective manager, but probably would have more friends and a better marriage.\n\n“I wasn’t always nice,” he says. “I regret that now.”\n\nBy 1991, Darlene had enough. She packed up her things and left with the children. She rented a house in Mesa and got a job.\n\nWithin months, Harvey was at her door. He brought roses. He invited her to dinner.\n\nCraig was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a rare form of cancer, at age 16. Harvey bought him a car.\n\nThe divorce went through, the paperwork final on July 5, 1991. But Harvey and Darlene continued to see each other.\n\n“Harvey was a much better boyfriend than he was a husband,” Darlene says. He was kinder and more attentive. He was a good provider.\n\nThey got married again on Jan. 20, 1996, in a small ceremony at the Orange Tree Resort in Scottsdale.\n\nHarvey bought a Yorkie puppy with hair that stood straight up. He named him “Albert Einstein.” Darlene called him “Bert.” Harvey took Darlene to Hawaii again.\n\nThings were good again. For a while.\n\nInterlude:\n\nShe could leave, someday\n\nDarlene kept a journal. The short, dated entries tell of company parties, job changes and doctor appointments.\n\nHer son Brett moved into a new apartment in 2010. She had a tooth pulled in 2011.\n\nBut in phrases interspersed among those everyday things are glimpses of an often-unhappy marriage.\n\nJune 3, 2012: Harvey wore new suit to church to day. Looks very nice on him. I wish church would make him nicer to me.\n\nJune 8, 2012: Harvey very mad. Stomped off to bed. He said some nasty things to me.\n\nIf Darlene left the bed unmade, the sheets still in disarray when Harvey got home from work, he accused her of having a boyfriend.\n\nDarlene's children told her she should leave. So did her sisters. In 2008, her boss at Verizon took her aside, nodding at the brace on her wrist, and offered to help her relocate.\n\nDarlene thanked her but no, she would stay. “I was no angel,” Darlene says. “I would talk back. I would argue.”\n\nShe told her boss and her family that if it got worse, she would leave. She made recordings of their fights just in case.\n\nShe always thought leaving would be an option.\n\n2016:\n\nShifting moods, rolling fog\n\nThis is not what Harvey had planned for his retirement.\n\nHarvey and Darlene live in a modest house in Mesa with two dogs, a white one named Peppy and a brown one named Lola, and a cat named Gracie. Brett, who is 32 and has a disability, lives in the converted garage.\n\nHarvey wanted to show Darlene the Alamo in Texas and Niagara Falls in New York. He wanted to visit his children, all grown and married. One daughter lives in Florida, and another daughter and son are in California.\n\n“I worked for 40 years, and I was looking forward to retirement,\" Harvey says. \"It’s been stolen from me.\"\n\nInstead of road trips and cruises, there is a basket of medication — for his heart, high blood pressure and an anti-psychotic to help regulate his mood — doctor’s appointments three and sometimes four times a week, and so many unanswered questions.\n\nIt is why Harvey is reading the books, or trying to anyway.\n\nDarlene chuckles. “I’ll spend less on books now because he’ll read the same ones over and over,” she says.\n\nHarvey laughs, too. “That is funny,” he tells her.\n\nDarlene looks pleased. This has been a good day.\n\n“Yes,” Harvey agrees, “It’s been a peaceful day.”\n\nHe can feel when his mood shifts, but he can’t do anything to stop it. He says he doesn’t feel bad when he lashes out, or maybe he does. He can’t tell for sure since the disease destroys brain cells, flattening some emotional responses.\n\n“What’s scary is that it’s not bad yet,” Harvey says. “It’s going to get much worse. The worst is still to come.”\n\nHe nods to Darlene. “She’s the one who will have the hardest time. She’ll have to clean up any messes I make. She’ll have to come and get me and get me home.\n\n“I’ll have it easy compared to you,” he says.\n\n“So you should be really nice to me,” Darlene says.\n\n“Why?” Harvey asks. “You have to do it whether I’m nice or not.”\n\n♦ ♦ ♦\n\nThe books Harvey used to love depress him now.\n\n“I’m still very analytical,” Harvey says. He can do complicated math in his head, but he can’t figure out how to button his shirt. He wears clothes without buttons or zippers now, T-shirts and sweatpants. He doesn’t remember how to tie a tie.\n\nIt’s more than forgetting, not like when you wonder where you left your keys or can’t put a name to a familiar face right away.\n\nIn fact, the word \"forget\" is a bit of a misnomer for what happens in a brain affected by Alzheimer's disease. The word suggests that whatever it is that has been forgotten — names, ideas, stories — is still in there somewhere, waiting. It's not. Alzheimer's disease wipes it out completely.\n\n“I lie awake at night, and I can’t think of things,\" Harvey says. He tries to pull up names of people or places, and he can’t.\n\n“It’s like a fog bank,\" he says. \"It rolls in.\"\n\nSometimes things come back to him. “Kevin Costner!” he calls out suddenly to Darlene in the other room. He had been trying to think of the actor in the movie “Field of Dreams.”\n\nSometimes things never come, and he doesn’t remember that he even wanted to know.\n\n“It seems like it is gradual to everyone else,\" he says. \"It feels like it’s galloping to me.”\n\nMay 2017:\n\n'Don't we live in California?'\n\nDarlene is in the kitchen making chicken enchiladas for dinner.\n\nHarvey is in his recliner, working a puzzle in the light of a tall lamp. The doctor says puzzles are good for his brain, like exercise for his mind.\n\n“So I do some every day,” he says. Word searches, mostly. “I hope that works.”\n\nSome days, Harvey seems like his old self. He gets the newspaper off the driveway in the morning and asks about Darlene's plans for the day.\n\nBut the other day, Harvey brought the newspaper in and showed Darlene the front page, The Arizona Republic. “Don’t we live in California?” he asked.\n\nOn those days, Harvey might ask when the children will be home from school, or Darlene will find him shaving at 2 a.m., worried that he is late for a meeting at work.\n\nHe uses a cane now, in case he stumbles, but still drives. “That’s one of my concerns,\" he says. \"When should I stop.”\n\n“I know the time will come,\" he says. \"I will count on Darlene to tell me when I can’t drive anymore. I don’t want to hurt anyone.”\n\nBut when Darlene asks Harvey for his car keys, he refuses to give them up. He is angry he has to depend on her.\n\n“She’s going to be my biggest blessing, and she will also be the person who receives the brunt of my behavior, the brunt of my temper,” he says.\n\nTheir whole marriage, Harvey managed the household budget and kept the checkbook. He’s had to turn it over to Darlene to pay the bills he forgets now.\n\nShe reminds Harvey to eat or that he’s already eaten. She answers the same question 10 times in 10 minutes.\n\n“I’ve been told I have the patience of Job,\" Darlene says. \"It’s not enough.” Her voice cracks. She blinks away tears.\n\nHarvey doesn’t understand why Darlene is upset. “Are you mad at me?” he asks.\n\nHe’s mad at her. “I get irritable,” he says. “It’s this Alzheimer’s. If I misspeak on something, she corrects me, and that makes me mad.”\n\nShe corrects him because many of the things Harvey says now aren’t true. Not because he is lying but because he thinks it is the truth.\n\nWhen Harvey says he goes to the gym every day for a couple of hours, walking on the treadmill for 30 minutes and lifting weights, Darlene shakes her head slightly. He might go once a week now, and he’s usually there and back in half an hour.\n\nHarvey huffs and turns his back on Darlene.\n\n“Maybe I humiliated her too many times,” he says. “Maybe she wants to humiliate me.”\n\nAt home:\n\nFamily ties\n\nNo one can give Harvey the answer he wants to know most. How long will he live?\n\nThe doctors say there is no way to know for sure. Harvey wonders if the doctors know but don’t want to tell him.\n\n“I won’t hold them to it,” he says.\n\nHarvey is in the best physical shape he’s been in since he played football in high school. He had heart bypass surgery after a heart attack at 45 and gastric bypass surgery in 2000. He weighs 180 now, more than a third less than when they met.\n\n“Darlene is the fat one now,” Harvey says. Darlene grimaces.\n\nHarvey says he tells her she is fat so she’ll do something about it. Darlene has diabetes and if she doesn’t take care of herself, she won’t be able to care for him. He needs her.\n\nHarvey has a brother, but they haven’t spoken in 15 years. Harvey sent him an email when he was diagnosed. “I thought you ought to know it in case it was hereditary,” he wrote. His brother did not respond.\n\nHis children call and text. One daughter sent money every month for almost two years. They haven't visited yet, not since Harvey’s diagnosis.\n\nHarvey understands. They are busy. Travel is expensive.\n\nThere is more to it than that, Harvey's older daughter says. For as long as she can remember, her dad and Darlene brought out the worst in each other.\n\n\"They just always had an extremely intensive, turbulent relationship,\" she says. As kids, they cut visits short. As adults, the constant noxious bickering kept them away.\n\n\"It was not healthy for me to be involved in that,\" she says. \"It killed me inside.\"\n\nShe doesn't understand why her dad wants to tell his story in a newspaper and she would decide she doesn't want her name used.\n\nShe loves her dad. Her parents divorced when she was in high school, but her dad paid more than the court-ordered alimony and child support.\n\n\"He never stopped taking care of us,\" she says.\n\nHe returned every call and text.\n\nShe lived with her dad when she attended college in Arizona, when he and Darlene were separated. She and her dad would talk for hours about business, leadership, Wall Street and politics. She learned a lot from him.\n\nThe last time she saw her dad was in September 2015, when he came to California for a high school reunion. Harvey and Darlene brought presents for the grandchildren, and they all went out to lunch.\n\n\"It was a nice day,\" his daughter says.\n\nShe will remember that.\n\nDarlene has family here: a daughter in Payson and three sisters, one just a mile away, the others in Chandler and Queen Creek. None come to visit. She has him.\n\nHarvey appreciates what Darlene does for him. He watched as she cared for her son Craig, who died of cancer at age 25 in 2000.\n\n\"She’s there every time I need her,\" Harvey says. \"If it was the other way around, I don’t think I could be half as good as she could.\"\n\nHarvey says he thought about taking his own life. But when the time came, he would be incapable of doing it. He imagines himself in adult diapers and slurping soup, and it horrifies him.\n\nOn bad days, Darlene tells him to go ahead and do it.\n\n“With my luck, I would do it the day before they found a cure,” he says. “I have to accept there is no escaping this.”\n\nMay 2016:\n\nGood moments, bad days\n\nThe lamp next to Harvey's chair is broken.\n\n“I spend all day fixing my lamp,” Harvey says proudly. The lamp shade is on the table, the part where the light bulb goes toppled to one side. A nut is missing.\n\n“Harvey put it somewhere safe,” Darlene explains, chuckling. “Now he can’t remember where he put it.”\n\nThe night before, Harvey had picked up the lamp and swung it at her, like a baseball bat. He missed and then threw it at her. It smashed on the floor.\n\nHarvey doesn’t remember. He saw the broken lamp this morning and wondered aloud what had happened.\n\nHe sets aside the lamp when it is time to leave for his appointment at Valbuena Wellness Center in Scottsdale.\n\nHarvey signs in at the reception desk.\n\n“What’s the date?” he asks Darlene. May 25, 2016, she tells him. He writes it down.\n\nHarvey is participating in a cognitive rehabilitation program with John DenBoer, a clinical neuropsychologist who specializes in early-stage dementia.\n\nToday Harvey is working with Erin Shannon, a speech-language pathologist. The goal is to help Harvey retain his cognitive abilities for as long as possible.\n\nSo far, Harvey's scores show that his cognitive abilities — his memory and focus — have remained steady and in some areas have improved.\n\nShannon runs him through a series of challenges: recalling holidays, planning a party and filling in the blanks on a list of well-known expressions.\n\nA stitch in time saves ... “A dime?” Harvey asks.\n\nLast, Harvey does a maze, his pencil skirting over the paper and quickly. The next one, he starts and then gets stuck in a corner.\n\n“Oh, for crying out loud,” he says and starts over, chuckling. “This is what I went to graduate school for.”\n\nJune 2016:\n\nIt gets worse after sundown\n\nBy June, the changes are more evident. Harvey put a mock plastic card that came in the mail with a credit offer in his wallet, thinking it was real. He thinks he works for Donald Trump as a financial adviser.\n\nWhen he's mad, he takes swings at Darlene. She steps away and firmly tells him, “No,” as if he was a toddler, as the doctor advised. No hitting.\n\n“When he’s angry, it’s almost out-of-control angry. When he’s sad, he’s too sad,” she says. There is nothing in the middle anymore.\n\nThe nights are the worst.\n\nAs soon as the sun goes down, Harvey becomes more confused, more agitated. He paces the house, sometimes like he’s looking for something and at other times like he is scared.\n\nThe experts call it “sundowning,” or “late-day confusion,” and say it is a common symptom of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.\n\nIt happens in the transition between daylight and darkness, though no one is sure why. Some speculate that it could be an overload of stimulation during the day, but it seems to happen to Harvey whether the day had been busy or boring.\n\nFrom the office, Harvey bellows, “Did you turn the computer off?”\n\nDarlene did. Because he told her to turn it off.\n\n“It should be on 24/7. I never turn it off,” Harvey says. “Don’t turn it off. Never turn it off.”\n\n“You asked me to,” she tells him.\n\n“I did NOT.”\n\n“Yes, you did,” she says. Harvey steps toward her, his fists clenched; Darlene takes a few steps back, out of arm’s reach. He looks from her to the visitors in his living room.\n\n“If I did,” he says, “I misspoke.”\n\nHarvey stands still for moment, breathing in through his nose and out through his mouth. And then he pushes up his glasses and wipes his tears.\n\n“No one is out to get me, but sometimes it feels like that,” he says.\n\nSome nights, he is so sure that someone is trying to get him that he tells Darlene to lock all the doors and windows and then double and triple checks to make sure she did. “Don’t let them kill me,” he whispers to her.\n\nDarlene helps Harvey into his pajamas and into bed. He sleeps for four hours at a time, sometimes six.\n\n“It’s kind of nice when I go to sleep at night because I get away from it,” Harvey says.\n\nHe does, but Darlene doesn’t. Some nights, Harvey wakes from a dream and thinks that it is real.\n\nAugust 2016:\n\nTwo trips to the hospital\n\nHarvey wakes up about 1 a.m. one night, sure there were burglars in the yard. He pulls open the front door and hurries out.\n\nIn the darkness, Harvey trips on the patio and falls, hitting his head against the porch post. He’s bleeding but he wants Darlene to go after the burglars.\n\nThey are just out there, he says, pointing, by the shed.\n\nDarlene calls 911. At the hospital, a CT scan shows no damage, but the doctor keep Harvey overnight for observation.\n\nDarlene gets home and into bed at 3 a.m. Her phone rings at 7 a.m. Harvey wants her to come back.\n\nAt the hospital, Harvey tells her, “You are starving me.\" He wants a hamburger, but when it arrives, he only stares at it.\n\n“Do you want some help eating?” Darlene asks.\n\n“I can do it,” he tells her. But he doesn’t eat. He pushes the plate away.\n\n“I should be locked up and put away,” he tells her.\n\n♦ ♦ ♦\n\nDarlene fell asleep on the couch and woke up to Harvey yelling at her.\n\n“You’re so lazy,” he says.\n\nHarvey had just gotten out of the hospital for the second time that month after his right leg gave out on him. He is pacing now, agitated.\n\nHe tells her these things for her own good, he says. “No one else will tell you,” he says. “You should be grateful.”\n\nHarvey says he is going to visit a friend in Sun Lakes. She tries to stop him, but he rushes past her.\n\n“He’s angry all the time now,” Darlene says. She is crying. She leaves the house so she is not there when he gets back.\n\n“I had to. I couldn’t take it anymore,” she says.\n\nHarvey calls her cellphone. She doesn’t answer. He leaves voicemails, one after another:\n\n“Hi, Darlene I just got home. I got lost. There is no Sun Lakes — I can’t find it and then you’re gone. Where the hell are you now? You were getting rid of me so you could leave, I guess. Things are working for me so well. God.”\n\nA few minutes later, he calls again.\n\n“I changed my mind on Peppy. You don’t want him. I don’t want him. I’ve taken his collar off, and he’s in the car waiting for me. I’m going to go drop him in a park about a mile and a half from here, far enough away where he won’t find his way back. Hopefully, he’ll find a new home.\n\n“I’ll do the same with the cat if I see her.\"\n\nDarlene listens to the voicemails where she sits at a picnic table in a nearby park. She wipes her face and gets back in her car.\n\nShe goes back. She always goes back.\n\nMarch 2017:\n\nA break and a cloud lifts\n\nBy spring, there is no pleasing Harvey and no reasoning with him. The littlest things set him off.\n\nIf he doesn’t like what Darlene made for dinner, he throws the plate at her.\n\nHe smashed the lamp he had once spent all day fixing.\n\n“It is hard to separate what is the disease and what is Harvey,” Darlene says.\n\nOn March 2, a Thursday, Harvey is admitted to Quail Run Behavioral Health for observation and evaluation. Darlene hopes the right combination of medication could calm him.\n\nThey meet with a doctor, and Darlene explains Harvey’s behavior. Harvey says Darlene is exaggerating.\n\n“You want to see my bloody knees where you pushed me down?” she asks.\n\nShe pulled up her pant legs to show two skinned knees. “What happened?” Harvey asks.\n\nWhen it is time for her to leave, Darlene watches Harvey’s face until the door between them closes. She feels like she is abandoning him.\n\n“I’m trying to do everything right,\" she says, \"and it seems like I’m not.”\n\n“There have been times when I’ve lost my temper and said, ‘Harvey, I hate you.’ I’ve learned that it doesn’t help to say it, although it does feel good. I’m embarrassed to say it, but it does.”\n\nHarvey calls later, to tell her that his flight to San Francisco had been good and he had just arrived at the hotel for the convention. He was going to meet friends from work for dinner.\n\nFor most of the next three days, she sleeps, getting up only to use the bathroom and feed the dogs. On Sunday, she orders a pizza and watches a movie on TV with Brett.\n\n“It felt like a dark cloud lifted,” she says. “Once I was rested, I felt like I could carry the world on my shoulders again.”\n\nOn Monday, Harvey’s face lights up when he sees her: “You made it!”\n\nHarvey tells her that the convention was going well. He is glad she could join them for dinner. “The guys will be here soon,” he tells her.\n\nHe opens the door of the visitation room to return to the geriatric floor. The aide nods at Darlene. She can go. She walks with Harvey to the room where other residents are watching TV.\n\n“Ah, they’re all here!” Harvey says. He joins them, taking the only open chair.\n\nDarlene stands in the doorway and watches him lean over to talk to one person and then another, smiling and then laughing. He doesn't look for her.\n\nShe thinks he must have been lonely at their house, with just her for company. She hasn’t seen him smile in months.\n\n“He was happy, and that’s something I’m not giving him,” she says. “He has found his little happiness.”\n\nThe next day, Darlene gets a call from someone at Quail Run. Harvey is having chest pains.\n\nMarch 2017:\n\nInside looking out\n\nHarvey would stay in the hospital for a week.\n\nHe is different when he comes home. He shuffles when he walks. He’s not interested in his books or puzzles.\n\nThe certified nursing assistant comes by and then a hospice nurse. She orders a hospital bed and has it set up in the middle of the living room.\n\nHarvey spends most of his time on the bed under a thin cotton sheet. He wants only coffee and toast, and then he doesn’t even want that. The TV is on, tuned to CNN. He stares at it.\n\nDarlene helps him to the bathroom and back. He says he can do it himself.\n\nBut when he tries, he falls. She can’t pull him to his feet, not even with help from Brett. She calls the fire department, and paramedics lift him back onto the bed.\n\nKeep him in bed, they tell her. It easier said than done. She sits on the edge of the bed to block his way.\n\nShe smooths his sheet and stares at the TV, too. It seems unreal that while everything inside her house has slowed down, the world goes on as normal.\n\nHarvey is restless, throwing his arms up over his head like he’s trying to reach for something. She pats them down.\n\n“Talk to me,” she tells him. His words are slurred. She can't make out what he is saying.\n\nHarvey falls asleep.\n\n♦ ♦ ♦\n\nDarlene pulls a load of laundry from the dryer and puts the basket on her bed. She turns on the TV. She watches “The Walking Dead” as she folds clothes and towels. She puts them away.\n\nAbout 11 p.m., she stretches out on the bed and turns off the light. She falls asleep.\n\nSuddenly, she sits up in the darkness and listens. It is quiet. Too quiet.\n\nShe jumps up out of bed and hurries to the living room. She stops a few feet from Harvey’s bed.\n\nIt was the silence that had woken her, as clearly as if he had called out to her.\n\nHarvey wasn't breathing.\n\nDarlene reaches out and touches his arm. She touches his cheek. He still feels warm.\n\nShe wakes Brett and calls the hospice nurse.\n\nDarlene hangs up and the sits down, waiting. She waits for her reaction.\n\nShe realizes she is relieved.\n\nMarch 20:\n\n'Find your happiness'\n\n\"Harvey died this morning.\"\n\nDarlene sends out text messages starting at 6 a.m.\n\nThe hospice nurse had come about 1 a.m. and stayed for a couple of hours. Two men had come for Harvey’s body, wrapping him in a sheet like swaddling a baby. They slid his body into a black bag on a gurney.\n\nOne of the men hesitated before he pulled closed the zipper. “Do you want to say goodbye?” he had asked.\n\nDarlene had shook her head. No. She had already said goodbye to Harvey, when she was alone with him, in the quiet, before anyone had arrived.\n\nShe had kissed his forehead.\n\n“Harvey, I did love you,” she whispered, “and I’m sorry it was so difficult to live with one another. I know you’ll find your happiness.”\n\nMaybe she would find hers.\n\nDarlene called Harvey’s son and he called his sisters. The oldest texted Darlene, “I’m sad to hear about dad’s passing. I know he is at peace. My heart is saying prayers for you.”\n\nAnd then the other daughter: “I’m very sorry for all you went through. I hope you can finally find peace. Thank you for taking care of him.”\n\nThere will be no funeral or memorial service, at Harvey's request. He asked to be cremated. Harvey’s children won’t be coming to Arizona. Darlene would pack up some of Harvey’s things for them, whatever they wanted.\n\nThree hours later, at 9 a.m., Darlene sits at the kitchen table. The TV is off.\n\n“It’s so quiet in here,” she says. There is marvel in her voice.\n\nHer phone buzzes with text messages, a flurry of them from her sisters. Valerie writes, \"That's the nicest thing he's ever done for you.\"\n\nIt seems a bit unreal, Darlene says. The hospital bed is still in the middle of the living room, the striped sheet in disarray, showing the blue mattress underneath.\n\n“I can’t believe he’s gone,” she says. “I keep thinking he’s going to hear me and come after me and be mad at me.\"\n\nMore silence.\n\n“He’s gone,” Darlene says again, as if reassuring herself. “I just have to get it in my head that he’s not coming back.” She laughs. “I’m afraid he will haunt me.”\n\nHer bishop has come and gone. It is quiet again.\n\n“I’m standing there thinking, ‘Did this really happen?’” Darlene says. “Then there’s guilt because I was so angry with him some of the time for all of the things he put me through.”\n\nAnd then she smiles, even though she’s crying, too. “But I made it,” she says. “I made it.”\n\nVIDEO: A new beginning for Darlene Boyd\n\nApril 1:\n\nOne last time\n\nA few weeks later, on a sunny Saturday, a 5-foot-tall statue of a knight in armor stands in the front yard of the house. A sign propped up in its arms says, “Yard sale.”\n\nThe yard is covered with sheets spread with shoes in neat rows and stacks of books. Harvey’s shirts and pants hang on a pole between two ladders.\n\n“This was Harvey’s,” Darlene says. She holds up a T-shirt with the Grinch on the front and the words, “You’re a mean one” underneath.\n\nShe eases down onto a chair on the patio in the shade. The tomato plants she planted with Harvey are twice the size.\n\nShe waves a hand at everything for sale.\n\n“I imagined what it would be like if he was standing over me,” Darlene says. “He would be so mad that I didn’t think these things were important anymore.”\n\nNo one has bought any of his books. Not “Decision Points” by George W. Bush or the seven-volume set of “The New Webster’s Library of Practical Information.”\n\nThere’s a stack of empty frames that used to hold Harvey’s pictures and award certificates.\n\nShe packed those up for Harvey’s children, along with a few knickknacks and some of his ties. He had hundreds of ties. Harvey's daughter sent $500 to pay for shipping.\n\nDarlene got a few offers to buy the statue of the knight out front. But she and Harvey had bought it together on a trip to Oklahoma in a spontaneous moment of agreement; they both loved it.\n\nShe’s keeping it.\n\nDarlene has to think if there is anything she would like to keep.\n\n“No, no, there isn’t. There really isn’t,” she says.\n\nMaybe she will keep Harvey’s Rolex. Oh, and the diamond engagement ring Harvey gave to her.\n\nBut then she says, “Maybe I will sell that too.”\n\nAltogether, Darlene makes $150 from the yard sale. She’ll take Harvey’s good suits to a consignment store. The rest, she donates to charity.\n\nShe feels more relief than grief, she says, though she did cry when a woman from a crematorium called to tell her she could pick up Harvey’s ashes.\n\n“Your husband is ready for you to take him home,” she told Darlene. Like he was lost and couldn't find his way back to her.\n\nShe picked Harvey up one last time.\n\nDarlene has lost 15 pounds. She bought a new computer. She goes to lunch with her sisters.\n\nDarlene feels relaxed and anxious at the same time.\n\nThere’s so much to do. She has a stack of medical bills. Her car needs repairs.\n\nShe’s 60 now. Could she go to college or is she too old? When she left Verizon in 2011, she got certified as a nursing assistant at Brookline College. She thought she might be a nurse.\n\n“I have to have a new life,\" Darlene says. \"I wonder what that will be like.”\n\nShe cries and laughs at the same time. “Well, enough of that.\"\n\n“I’m going to have a happy ending after all.”\n\nThe end:\n\nGoodbye, Harvey\n\nOver the next six months, Darlene sorts through the house, deciding what to save and what to throw away. She has put the house up for sale.\n\nShe’d like something smaller, maybe some place with room for a little garden. She'll paint every room a different color.\n\n“I’m not unhappy. I’m not unhappy that Harvey’s gone,” she says. But there are times she feels depressed. She’s not sure if it is grief, or if she is mourning the changes in her life.\n\nShe is clearing the house out, room by room. It is surprisingly easy to get rid of things. She drags a picture she never liked, or a box full of knickknacks out to the big black trash can and dumps it in.\n\nAs the lid to the trash can fell shut, Darlene says, “Goodbye, Harvey.\" She found herself saying it again and again.\n\nShe still looks around, thinking Harvey might hear her. She thinks she hears his footsteps or his breathing. She laughs at herself for being silly.\n\nDarlene donated Harvey’s brown recliner to a charity. A friend from church helped her drag it outside to the sidewalk and load it onto a truck.\n\nBefore Darlene could say it, her friend did: “Goodbye, Harvey.”\n\nIn one of the kitchen cabinets, she finds a calendar from 2013 turned to the last page, to December. Darlene has to sit down.\n\nBecause she remembers how she had decided in December of 2013 that she would make a red X on the calendar for every day that she cried because she and Harvey argued.\n\nShe starts to cry as she counts the red Xs. There are 21 of them, including Xs every day the week of the 15th through the 21st and on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.\n\nShe remembers how unhappy she was. She can’t believe she stayed, that she stayed until she couldn’t leave.\n\n“How did I live that life?” she asks. She’s embarrassed, mad and sad, all at the same time.\n\nShe wishes she had left before it was too late. And then she shakes her head.\n\nThere’s no point in crying now. She’s done too much of that already. Too many red Xs on a calendar.\n\nShe folds up the calendar, takes it outside to the trash can and drops it inside.\n\nReach Bland at 602-444-8614 or karina.bland@arizonarepublic.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/28/corn-curb-buttery-cow-six-triple-eight-news-around-states/50535587/", "title": "Corn on the curb, buttery cow, 'Six Triple Eight': News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontogmery:Romay Davis, 102, the oldest living member of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, the largest all-Black, all-female group to serve in World War II, was honored Tuesday at City Hall that followed President Joe Biden’s decision in March to sign a bill authorizing the Congressional Gold Medal for the unit, nicknamed the “Six Triple Eight.” More than 800 Black women formed the 6888th, which began sailing for England in February 1945. Once there, they were confronted not only by mountains of undelivered mail but by racism and sexism. They were denied entry into an American Red Cross club and hotels, according to the history, and a senior officer was threatened with being being replaced by a white first lieutenant when some unit members missed an inspection. Working under the motto of “No Mail, Low Morale,” the women served 24/7 in shifts and developed a new tracking system that processed about 65,000 items each shift, allowing them to clear a six-month backlog of mail in just three months. The medals themselves won’t be ready for months, but leaders decided to go ahead with events for Davis and five other surviving members of the 6888th given their advanced age.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: A male brown bear going through trash was killed by authorities in a city that experienced a record number of bear incidents last year. The weekend shooting of the bear by Sitka police was the first this year in the southeast Alaska city, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reported. Last year, 14 bears were killed in and around Sitka, which the newspaper reported was a record for the community. Steve Bethune, a wildlife biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, said four shots were fired, at least two of which hit the bear. Police received a call about a bear at about 11:40 p.m. Saturday. By the time Bethune arrived about 1 a.m. Sunday, officers had killed the animal, he said. Police later Sunday issued citations at three addresses for having bear attractants. Bethune estimated the bear was 8 to 12 years old and otherwise healthy.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The Arizona Supreme Court denied a request from the Cyber Ninjas, a company that oversaw a partisan Arizona election review, to reject a daily $50,000 penalty for refusing to hand over records related to the state Senate’s ballot review. The court also denied Cyber Ninjas’ request to find the records are not public documents. It was the second time they had made that request to the high court, and the second time the court rejected it this year. The court’s brief order means the fines continue, as the Ninjas’ owner have been slow to comply with a court order that its records related to last year’s ballot review are public documents. The court also denied a request from The Arizona Republic for attorney fees in its appeal to the high court. The decision does not affect a pending request for fees in the ongoing fight in the lower court. The Republic is suing Cyber Ninjas and its owners, Doug and Meghan Logan, arguing records the company has that are related to the state Senate-ordered ballot review of the 2020 Maricopa County election results are public records. The lawsuit also extends to the Senate, but it was not a party to the Supreme Court appeal.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: A fire at a northwestern Arkansas home killed six people, including four children, authorities said. The Washington County Sheriff’s Office said Monday the fire happened early Sunday at a trailer home in Springdale, about 145 miles northwest of Little Rock. Emergency responders received a call at about 2 a.m. about a fire and that people were still inside the home, the sheriff’s office said. One child was able to escape. Detectives are investigating the cause of the blaze. The victims’ bodies have been sent to the state crime lab to determine cause of death. The sheriff’s office did not release names or ages of the victims. Television station KNWA reported the Springdale School District said the victims included students enrolled in the district.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Tap water used by more than 900,000 Californians is unsafe to drink and the state isn’t acting fast enough to help clean it up, state auditors said in a report. Thousands of water systems supply the state’s 39 million people, and about 5% of them have some type of contaminant, such as nitrates or arsenic, in them, according to the audit. That means people can’t safely drink the water or use it to cook or bathe. Most of the 370 failing systems are in economically disadvantaged communities, many in the Central Valley, the state’s agricultural heartland. The State Water Resources Control Board has provided at least $1.7 billion in grants since 2016 for design and construction to improve water systems. That could include building new treatment plants, consolidating water systems or other actions designed to improve water quality. But it took the board 33 months on average in 2021 for water system operators to complete the application process and receive money, the audit found – nearly double the time it took in 2017. The audit found a lack of clear metrics and poor communication created confusion for water districts seeking help and slowed down the award process. Eileen Sobeck, executive director for the water board, told state auditors the board agrees the process could be clearer and faster. But she disagreed with the conclusion the board hasn’t acted with urgency to improve contaminated water systems, saying the board’s “highest priority is advancing the human right to water.” California made a right to safe drinking water state law in 2013. The water board has previously said it would need $4.5 billion to address all the needs through 2025.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Two Republicans who suggested their losses in last month’s GOP primaries in Colorado might be the result of fraud filed their second round of requests for recounts Tuesday. Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters and state Rep. Ron Hanks echoed former President Donald Trump’s claims about the 2020 election during their own races for their party’s nomination for Secretary of State and U.S. Senate, respectively. After they each lost by more than 40,000 votes, they requested a hand recount. The Colorado Secretary of State’s office said their regulations required any recounts to be done by machine and that it would cost $236,000. When the candidates didn’t pay, it proceeded with certification of their losses.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Max Reiss, the face of Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration for the past three years, said he is leaving next month to take a new position in the private sector. Reiss, 36, will become a senior vice president at M&T Bank, which recently completed the acquisition of Connecticut-based People’s United Financial, Inc. and will now have a presence in 12 states. Lamont praised his departing communications director, a former TV reporter who previously covered the Democratic administration for WVIT-TV, for his dedication, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reiss managed much of the state’s public outreach efforts and became a familiar voice for residents who tuned in daily for Lamont’s pandemic news conferences. Reiss previously worked as a TV and radio reporter in Alabama, Missouri and elsewhere. His final day as Lamont’s chief spokesperson is Aug. 5.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: The Town Council voted to give $24,750 to the Georgetown Historical Society, a nonprofit that allows a Confederate flag to be flown on its property. Councilwomen Angela Townsend made a motion to approve granting the funds, and the other council members all voted in favor of it. Mayor Bill West did not vote. Townsend’s motion stipulated “a committee would be formed to address the concerns,” but did not specify details. The Georgetown Historical Society’s Marvel Museum is home to numerous buildings, a collection of antique carriages and items related to Georgetown’s history. The grounds and buildings are often used for public and private events, as well. The Delaware Grays Sons of Confederate Veterans Camp #2068 reached an agreement with the society in 2007, allowing them to install and maintain the flag and a monument to Delawareans who fought for the Confederacy. It was only 15 years ago, but it was a decidedly different time, one in which then-Gov. Ruth Ann Minner celebrated the installation by declaring a statewide “Confederate History and Heritage Week.” By 2017, the Lower Sussex NAACP was calling for the removal of the flag. In 2019, the state declined to provide funding to the Georgetown Historical Society because of the flag.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Police said they found a woman for which they were searching after confirming their investigation into an armed kidnapping in Northwest D.C. on Wednesday morning. Lt. McHauly Murphy with the MPD's Second District originally announced police were looking for 30-year-old Selita Lee. Police said they believe she was kidnapped by her boyfriend, Marquez \"Mikko\" Antonio Parker, 44, for whom they are still searching. Parker is described by police as about 5-foot-8 and 140 pounds, with a medium build. He was last seen wearing a white T-shirt, light blue pants and white shoes. Police said he was carrying a black satchel and is armed with a black handgun. Anyone with information about this case should contact police by dialing 911, texting the department's tip line at 50411 or calling (202) 727-9099.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The state’s population grew slightly over a previous forecast in the first quarter of this year, but slowing growth with deaths outpacing births is still in the Sunshine State’s future over the next decade, according to estimates released last week. The estimates released by the state Demographic Estimating Conference showed that Florida’s population growth appears to have peaked last year with a 1.6% rate. Florida’s population in 2022 will stand at more than 22 million residents, trailing only California and Texas in size. The April 1 estimate was 3,795 residents higher than a forecast in December, reflecting an increase in migration. Although Florida will continue to grow over the next decade and beyond, with its population reaching just short of 25 million residents by 2032, it’s pace of growth will slow to 0.8% in 10 years and 0.6% by 2039, according to the estimates.\n\nGeorgia\n\nReidsville: A judge has been arrested on charges he threatened a man who confronted the jurist about taking vegetables from his garden. Tattnall County Chief Magistrate Judge Eddie Anderson, 70, was charged Monday with felony counts of making a terrorist threat and violating his oath of office, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a news release. He was booked at the county jail and released on his own recognizance. The GBI said a man reported to the county sheriff he believed the judge had come onto his property and taken vegetables without permission. The man told authorities Anderson threatened him with violence when confronted during a phone call. Witnesses overheard the judge making the threat, the GBI said. Anderson did not immediately respond to an a phone message left at his office or an email seeking comment Tuesday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man accused of using counterfeit bank checks totaling $1.2 million to bail three people out of a jail has been arrested and ordered held without bail, according to court records. Samuela Tuikolongahau Jr. was detained by federal authorities on Monday. A U.S. Secret Service affidavit filed in court alleged he presented the bank checks for $760,000, $400,000 and $50,000 in 2020 during the attempt to post bail for three people held at the Oahu Community Correctional Center. He left a Honolulu courthouse after being told the checks would need verification, the court document said. Officials determined the checks were counterfeit and the two men and woman he tried to get out of jail were not released. Court documents did not specify his relationship to the three jailed people. Tuikolongahau appeared in federal court Tuesday for a hearing, where a judge appointed defense attorney Walter Rodby to represent him. Tuikolongahau consented to be detained without bail as prosecutors requested, according to court records. Rodby did not immediately return email and phone messages seeking comment.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: More than 800 wildland firefighters and support staff are fighting a blaze in east-central Idaho that officials said is threatening homes, an important north-south corridor, energy infrastructure, recreation opportunities and the municipal watershed for the town of Salmon. The Moose Fire on Tuesday grew to nearly 60 square miles burning grass, timber understory and dead and down material in the Salmon-Challis National Forest. It’s only 10% contained. Firefighters are protecting structures in several areas, as well as the U.S. Highway 93 corridor, a major north-south route. Two helicopter pilots fighting the fire died last week when their CH-47D Series “Chinook” crashed in the Salmon River. Plans call for removing the helicopter from the river with a large crane. The cause of the fire that started July 17 is unknown. High temperatures and dry relative humidity are hampering efforts to control the blaze. Smoke has also been a problem.\n\nIllinois\n\nNorthbrook: A coyote on public display in suburban Chicago will get a larger den but not a transfer to a wild animal sanctuary in Colorado. A report for the Cook County Forest Preserve District said the coyote, named Rocky, is “happy and healthy” in his 266-square-foot home but will get more room. Critics, however, said his constant pacing is proof that he’s bored. “You put an animal in a cage they’re not happy,” said Jodie Wiederkehr, director of the Chicago Alliance for Animals. Rocky has been at the River Trail Nature Center in Northbrook since 2018, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. He was found as a pup in Tennessee. An expanded habitat is in the works at the nature center. A petition to relocate the coyote to a wild animal sanctuary in Keenesburg, Colorado, has more than 6,000 signatures. “Because the coyote is an imprinted animal that has lived with humans practically since birth, there is no guarantee it will thrive if moved across the country and introduced to other coyotes,” Forest Preserve officials said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Republican lawmakers on Tuesday narrowly advanced a plan to ban nearly all abortions in the state, despite opposition from abortion-rights supporters, who said the bill goes too far, and anti-abortion activists, who said it doesn’t go far enough. Indiana has one of the first Republican-run state Legislatures to debate tighter abortion laws since the U.S. Supreme Court last month overturned Roe v. Wade. The U.S. Supreme Court formally issued its judgment Tuesday in the June 24 Dobbs v. Jackson ruling — a step that allows some state trigger laws to ban abortion to take effect. In Indiana, chants from anti-abortion activists, such as “Let their heart beat,” could be heard inside the Senate chamber as a committee wrapped up two days of testimony during which none of the more than 60 people speaking voiced support for the Republican-sponsored bill. The committee voted 7-5 in favor of the ban after also adding provisions under which doctors could face felony criminal charges and up to six years in prison for performing an illegal abortion. That’s the same potential penalty for performing abortions under Indiana’s current 20-week ban. More amendments to the bill could be debated by the full Senate on Thursday.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The butter cow at the Iowa State Fair, which runs Aug. 11-21, will be showcased with a companion piece – a tribute to “The Music Man,” the Broadway musical written by Mason City native Meredith Willson in 1957. The musical based on the fictional town of River City, Iowa, celebrates its 60th year in film with a Broadway reboot that stars Hugh Jackman, who plays traveling salesman Harold Hill trying to sell a town of Iowans musical instruments and uniforms to start a band. Officials promised at least one of the 76 trombones from the musical’s centerpiece song to make an appearance. The 600-pound butter cow will have another companion piece, a relief that celebrates the 100th anniversary of Ye Old Mill. The 1,500-foot canal ride was first constructed in 1921. Couples like to float on the boats and many a couple shared a first kiss or proposed on the ride. In 1996, a strong wind blew down the mill, but a $100,000 gift from Boatmen’s Bank of Iowa helped the ride return for the State Fair that year. The butter cow became a regular fixture at the State Fair in 1911. The fair added a companion sculpture in 1996 that featured Grant Wood’s “American Gothic.” Through the years, sculptures of Harry Potter, Garth Brooks, the 25th anniversary of “Field of Dreams,” Superman and gymnast Shawn Johnson were featured.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Early voting is surging in Kansas ahead of next week’s statewide abortion vote. More than 2½ times as many people cast early ballots as of Tuesday compared to the same point in the 2018 midterm primary, the Kansas secretary of state’s office reported. Voters will decide Tuesday whether to amend the state Constitution to allow the Legislature to further restrict or ban abortion. The Kansas vote is the first statewide referendum on abortion policy since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in late June. The Republican-controlled Legislature put the anti-abortion measure on the ballot to overturn a 2019 state Supreme Court decision declaring access to abortion a “fundamental” right under the state constitution. The measure would add language saying the state constitution does not grant a right to abortion, allowing lawmakers to regulate it as they see fit.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission has awarded a license for a new facility with plans to offer quarter horse racing in the state. Revolutionary Racing will build in Ashland and feature an American quarter horse “sprint racing” track and a historical horse racing facility, Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration said Tuesday. Historical racing machines allow people to bet on randomly generated horse races from the past. The games typically show video of condensed horse races. Revolutionary Racing obtained the last available racing license in Kentucky, according to state officials. The project invests $55 million and creates 200 jobs, Beshear said. The construction project is expected to be completed in 2024.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Jury deliberations resumed Wednesday in the federal trial of New Orleans district attorney Jason Williams, who was elected to be the city’s top prosecutor in December 2020 despite having been indicted months earlier on tax charges. Williams and Nicole Burdett, who was an attorney in his law practice, were accused in an indictment of conspiring to cheat on Williams’ taxes during a five-year period ending in 2017. Prosecutors said Williams’ tax burden was illegally cut by $200,000. Prosecutors rested their case Tuesday morning, a week after the trial began. Prosecution witnesses included the tax preparer, Henry Timothy, who was cooperating with prosecutors after pleading guilty to a single tax charge. The defense rested Tuesday morning as well, without calling witnesses. Williams has long contended the prosecution was politically motivated. Defense attorneys have portrayed Timothy as a fraud while attacking his credibility, and questioned why others whose taxes were prepared by Timothy weren’t criminally prosecuted.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills increased her fundraising advantage over Republican challenger Paul LePage in the latest reporting period, hauling in $605,000 during the 42-day period, according to documents filed Tuesday. The report that covers the period from June 1 to July 19 lifted Mills’ fundraising haul to $3.8 million, with $2.7 million in cash on hand, according to the campaign disclosure reports. LePage, a former two-term governor, raised about $312,000 for the same period, bringing his total to nearly $1.8 million, the reports said. The race is one of several gubernatorial contests that will be on the national radar during the 2022 midterm elections. LePage is seeking to become the first governor to serve three, four-year terms. LePage served consecutive terms, but Maine allows a former governor to serve again after sitting out an election.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown:The Washington County Democratic Central Committee is expected to open its headquarters in downtown Hagerstown. An orientation was held Saturday by the county Democratic Central Committee, where volunteers received information on how to educate, support and encourage people to vote for Democratic candidates during the general election Nov. 8.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Legislation to ban discrimination based on natural and protective hairstyles – such as Afros, cornrows or tightly coiled twists – in workplaces, school districts and school-related organizations in Massachusetts was signed into law Tuesday by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker. Black women in particular have faced pressure in school and on the job to alter their hair to conform to policies that are biased against natural hairstyles, according to supporters of the law. The bill had been unanimously approved by the Democrat-controlled House and Senate. The new law defines natural and protective hairstyles as including “braids, locks, twists, Bantu knots and other formations,” and tasks the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination with enforcing the protections. Policies that limit or prohibit natural hairstyles in all school districts are now banned. The law also prohibits hair discrimination in employment, business, advertising and public spaces. Massachusetts is the 18th state to adopt a version of the the bill – known as the Crown Act – into law, legislators said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Thousands who were wrongly accused of fraud when seeking unemployment benefits can seek financial relief from the state, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled Tuesday, breaking new ground when someone claims their constitutional rights have been violated by the government. “The state is prohibited from violating the rights the Constitution guarantees. If it does so, it is liable for the harm it causes,” Justice Megan Cavanagh wrote in a 4-3 opinion.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: The Minnesota Chippewa Tribe has voted to remove a decades-old requirement that members have a minimum of 25% Chippewa blood. Officials said 65% of voters on an advisory referendum said the blood quantum requirement should be removed from membership in the six-reservation tribe. The referendum is a guide for tribal leaders who will now decide whether to ask voters to amend the tribe’s constitution. The majority of voters said each reservation – Fond du Lac, Mille Lacs, Bois Forte, Grand Portage, White Earth and Leech Lake – should be allowed to determine its own enrollment requirements, the Star Tribune reported. The blood quantum requirement has caused the tribe’s enrollment to shrink, with many children not considered members despite having a parent who is. About 15% of the tribe’s roughly 39,000 citizens are under age 18.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city is moving forward with creating an office for violence prevention and trauma recovery that was announced in early May, said Safiya R. Omari, the city’s chief of staff. The National League of Cities and Wells Fargo Bank awarded the city a $700,000 grant in May to create the office. In addition, the city will hire an executive director and policy analyst with public safety experience, while seeking additional funds for the prevention office, Omari said. “Students from local colleges will have the opportunity to serve as interns to broaden the community-based interventions towards violence prevention,” Omari said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield:Federal investigators said a Springfield man robbed a bank last week after writing a demand note in pink highlighter on the back of his birth certificate and handing it to the teller. On July 20, at about 11:30 a.m., court documents showed a 29-year-old man wearing a cut-off gray T-shirt, blue gym shorts and one orange shoe, entered the Bank of America on West Kearney Street and handed a teller a note reading “Give me your money now. Don’t say anything. I have a partner outside.” The teller emptied the cash drawer and handed the man the money and the note, at which time the man left and fled the scene in a black pickup truck, according to court documents. The man was arrested later that day because of a tip. The man allegedly confessed to the crime and told investigators he robbed the bank to “prove a point” to his girlfriend after they got into an argument. He told investigators that he didn’t know which bank he was going to rob, but drove by the Bank of America and decided it would be that one. According to court documents, the man told law enforcement he wrote the note on the back of his birth certificate in pink highlighter and after fleeing the scene, he threw his birth certificate and ID out the car window. The man is charged with one count of bank robbery, a federal crime that is punishable by up to 20 years in prison.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: A 79-year-old Florida man died in a fall in Glacier National Park while he was trying to scramble up an off-trail slope with a group of friends, park officials said Tuesday. The incident happened Monday morning on Rising Wolf Mountain, several hundred feet above the Two Medicine Campground in the southeastern part of the park, spokesperson Gina Kerzman said. The friends descended to the victim’s location, yelled to the campground for help and called 911. National Park Service staff responded. A search helicopter operated by Two Bear Air, which had been working to recover the bodies of two men who died in a climbing accident several days earlier, was temporarily diverted to help with the rescue. The helicopter transported the unconscious man to the Two Medicine Ranger Station, where an air ambulance was waiting. The air ambulance crew declared the man dead, authorities said. The man’s name and hometown were being withheld until family members could be notified. The bodies of the two 67-year-old Montana men who died in a fall on Dusty Star Mountain in the park’s interior were also recovered Monday, Kerzman said. Brian McKenzie Kennedy of Columbia Falls and Jack Dewayne Beard of Kalispell were expert climbers who had been summitting mountain peaks in Glacier park for decades, park officials said in releasing their names Tuesday. Both were members of the Glacier Mountaineering Society, the park said in a statement. The men set out for a climb on July 22 and were to return the next day. They were reported missing July 24 and their bodies were spotted from a search helicopter Monday morning.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: President Joe Biden approved a request for a federal disaster declaration for a portion of Nebraska that suffered damage from severe storms and straight-line winds in May. The designation allows state, local and tribal governments and some private nonprofit organizations to access federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and for the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The declaration covers 20 counties from central to northeastern Nebraska. The counties included in the declaration are Antelope, Boone, Burt, Cedar, Cuming, Custer, Dixon, Garfield, Greeley, Holt, Knox, Logan, Pierce, Polk, Sherman, Thurston, Valley, Wayne, Wheeler, and York. A line of severe storms that moved through the eastern half of the state on May 12 generated straight-line winds of up to 100 mph in some places, the National Weather Services reported, downing power lines, poles and trees and damaging buildings.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Another body has surfaced at Lake Mead – this time in a swimming area where water levels have dropped as the Colorado River reservoir behind Hoover Dam recedes because of drought. The National Park Service did not say in a statement how long officials believe the corpse was submerged in the Boulder Beach area before it was found Monday by people who summoned park rangers. Clark County Coroner Melanie Rouse said Tuesday it was partially encased in mud at the water line of the swimming area along the shore north of Hemenway Harbor marina. The gender of the dead person was not immediately apparent, Rouse said, and it was too early to tell a time, cause and manner of death. Investigators will review missing persons records as part of the effort, Rouse said. The corpse was the third found since May as the shoreline retreats at the shrinking reservoir between Nevada and Arizona east of Las Vegas. The lake surface has dropped more than 170 feet since the reservoir was full in 1983. It is now about 30% full. The coroner said her office was continuing work to identify a man whose body was found May 1 in a rusted barrel in the Hemenway Harbor area and a man whose bones were found May 7 in a newly surfaced sand bar near Callville Bay, more than 9 miles from the marina. On July 6, the body of a 22-year-old Boulder City woman was found in the water near where she disappeared while riding a personal watercraft. Rouse said it might take several weeks to determine her cause of death. The case of the body in the barrel was being investigated as a homicide after police said the man had been shot and his clothing dated to the mid-1970s to early 1980s.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHenniker: The state Executive Council – which approves nominations and state contracts – voted 4-1 to deny funding to the Equality Health Center, Lovering Health Center and Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. The contracts, which were supported by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, would have funded cancer screenings, testing for sexually transmitted diseases, contraception and other routine health care services for more than 16,000 low-income women. The outcome was the same when the council voted in September, December and January. Wednesday was the first vote since the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the federal right to abortion. Republican councilors previously raised concerns that public money would pay for abortions and continued to vote no even after audit reports confirmed that funds were not commingled.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton:Hospitalized patients in New Jersey who have tested positive for the coronavirus have surpassed 1,000 again for the first time since February and most of the state is back to seeing high rates of transmission as a new mutation continues to spread quickly, data from the state Department of Health shows. But administrators at some of the state’s largest hospital networks said most patients have relatively mild symptoms and are being sent home with medication. The latest surge is being driven by the omicron BA.5 subvariant, which makes up about 82% of all positive cases in New Jersey and New York – up from 64% less than two weeks ago.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gun-safety advocates said police, prosecutors and judges are still learning how to harness a 2020 red-flag law that can be used to seize guns from people who pose a danger to others or themselves. Shiela Lewis offers training to police, prosecutors and school administrators on how to petition a judge for a red-flag order to temporarily seize guns for a one-year period that can be extended. She told a panel of state legislators Tuesday that an incomplete understanding of the current law is limiting its use as a precaution against gun violence. Just nine petitions have been filed to have guns removed since New Mexico’s red-flag law went into effect in May 2020. The state Department of Health said it plans to begin soliciting grants aimed at preventing gun violence, starting in August.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A jury was asked Tuesday to consider whether a neurologist used his thriving pain-management practice to sexually prey on six patients or if he is a victim of accusers with false stories. The case against Dr. Ricardo Cruciani relied on “survivor stories of six very different women,” assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey said in closing arguments at Cruciani’s trial. “This is a trial about a doctor who raped, sodomized, hugged and manipulated his patients,” Lucey said. The prosecutor argued the evidence showed Cruciani groomed patients by overprescribing pain killers, sometimes to treat serious injuries from car wrecks and other accidents. The accusers testified the sexual abuse often occurred behind closed doors during appointments in 2013 at a Manhattan medical center, where the doctor would expose himself and demand sex. Defense attorney Fred Sosinsky countered by arguing the witnesses were unreliable, telling jurors, “You should have every reason to doubt these accusations.” He added that the witnesses “were willing to lie” and “dispute the indisputable.” Cruciani, 68, has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges, including rape, sexual abuse and predatory sexual assault. The jury worked for about an hour late Tuesday without reaching a verdict. It was to resume deliberations Wednesday morning.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Mayor Vi Lyles won a third term Tuesday as the Democrat defeated Republican rival Stephanie de Sarachaga-Bilbao by a more than 2-to-1 margin, according to unofficial results. In Greensboro, the state’s third-largest city, Mayor Nancy Vaughan led challenger Justin Outling by more than 400 votes in the officially nonpartisan race. The News & Record of Greensboro reported that Outling, a city councilmember, declined to concede late Tuesday, saying he wanted to wait for other votes to be counted. There are an unknown number of provisional and mail-in absentee ballots outstanding. About 15% of the mayoral votes counted by Tuesday were for write-in candidates. Meanwhile, Wake County Sheriff Gerald Baker lost handily to former deputy Willie Rowe in a runoff for the Democratic nomination. Rowe will now take on Republican Donnie Harrison – a former sheriff – in the November election.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state’s only abortion clinic was preparing for what could be its final day of performing procedures, with a trigger ban set to take effect Thursday that will likely force patients to travel hundreds of miles to receive care pending the clinic’s relocation across the border to Minnesota. Barring a judge’s intervention, the Red River Women’s Clinic will provide abortion services Wednesday and then shut down. Owner Tammi Kromenaker is building a clinic in Moorhead, Minnesota, with the aid of nearly $1 million raised through GoFundMe. Kromenaker has not said when the new clinic will open and she did not respond to messages Tuesday. Planned Parenthood has said it can perform abortions at its own Moorhead facility to fill the gap if needed, but it is not known if that will happen. Once North Dakota’s ban takes effect, the nearest abortion clinics will be in Minneapolis and Duluth, a drive of about 4 hours from Fargo, and in Billings, Montana, which is nearly 4 hours from North Dakota’s western border.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: An Ohio man who admitted threatening a witness after posting videos from the U.S. Capitol riots was sentenced Wednesday to two years of probation. Justin Stoll of Wilmington pleaded guilty in January in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati to transmitting a threat to injure. Authorities alleged Stoll breached the security barricades at the Capitol but did not enter the building on Jan. 6, 2021. According to court documents, Stoll attended the rally and went with other rioters past police barricades that had been torn down. He recorded videos showing this and posted them online. When one online viewer said they saved his video, Stoll warned if the viewer took action to “ever jeopardize me, from being with my family,” then the person would meet his or her “maker,” and that he would be the one to “arrange the meeting.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Crews are expected to break ground this fall for a new fairgrounds coliseum to replace “The Big House,” which opened in 1965 and helped the OKC Fairgrounds become known as “The Horse Show Capital of the World.” The new coliseum will be constructed for just over $102 million. Rising construction costs and inflation made the price tag much more than when a City Council memo in November 2020 estimated the cost at $73 million. Although a small portion of the Jim Norick arena will be demolished to make room for the coliseum, the arena will be fully operational during all phases of construction, fairgrounds spokesman Scott Munz said. The current fairgrounds arena has the largest economic impact of all publicly owned facilities in Oklahoma City, holding more than 250 event days a year, including international equine and livestock shows, concerts, sporting events and ice shows.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A man who reportedly ignited wildfires in a remote, forested corner of Oregon was apprehended by three local residents and tied to a tree until police arrived, a sheriff said Tuesday. Federal, state and county authorities responded to a radio call Monday from a U.S. Bureau of Land Management employee who reported a man was walking along a gravel road and setting fires in a forest about 25 miles northwest of Grants Pass. Ground crews, assisted by local residents, and three helicopters quickly got the two fires under control, Curry County Sheriff John Ward said. Meanwhile, three local residents located the suspect walking on the road near the fires and detained him. After being treated at a hospital for his injuries, Trennon Smith, 30, of Veneta, Oregon, was being held on Tuesday in the Curry County jail on charges of arson and reckless burning, Ward said. Court documents did not say if he has an attorney. Bond was set at $100,000.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A decision about whether the method of funding public education meets a state constitutional requirement was left in the hands of a state judge Tuesday when argument wrapped up in the long-running case. Commonwealth Court Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer did not indicate when she will rule but said attorneys left her with a massive record to review. The case could result in substantial changes, as the plaintiffs are challenging whether the amounts and method of distribution of the annual education subsidies issued by the General Assembly comport with the state Constitution. The defendants, Republican leaders in the state House and Senate, argued funding has been growing and is adequate. State education funding was boosted in the budget that passed earlier this month and has increased by billions of dollars during Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s nearly eight years in office.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Mayor Jorge Elorza said there would be no infringement of civil liberties with the deployment of the city’s license plate reading cameras despite concerns over a lack of public input. Although the Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has criticized the cameras, designed by Atlanta company Flock Safety, and opposes the expansion of surveillance efforts, Elorza said “concerns about civil liberties being compromised will not materialize.” “I just urge everybody to have an open mind,” said City Council President John Igliozzi, who contended the cameras are essential to creating “a safe and secure environment to live in.” Public Safety Commissioner Steven Paré said the cameras likely will be activated within the next 30 days. Paré said the policy governing the use of the cameras, which was distributed to reporters, was crafted over the course of 60 days. Flock is giving Providence 25 cameras at no cost for a one-year trial. The program did not receive any approval from the City Council, apparently because it did not need to be factored into the city’s budget.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster and Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette made history on Wednesday as the first gubernatorial ticket to file for reelection in South Carolina. This fall is only the second time voters will elect a governor and lieutenant governor together. Before 2018, lieutenant governors were elected separately. “We’ve had great success in the last four years,” McMaster told reporters after Evette signed her campaign paperwork. “She is fully conversant with the trials, tribulations and challenges of business. … I think that we offer a good, strong team that’s fully committed to the great people of South Carolina.” In 2018, as he sought his first full term, McMaster became the first governor to run on the same ticket as his pick for lieutenant governor. At the time, Evette was a political newcomer, a Greenville businesswoman McMaster said he picked in part because of her “fresh eyes” when it came to governing, as well as her relationships with the business community. Over the past four years, Evette has spent many months traveling the state, meeting with companies and businesses, as well as promoting relationships between South Carolina’s technical training schools, the strength of which both she and the governor have argued is key to the state’s growing manufacturing economy. In November, McMaster will face Democrat Joe Cunningham, a former one-term congressman. Cunningham has said he will announce his pick for a running mate next week. No Democrat has captured South Carolina’s top job in 20 years, and Republicans have held all statewide-elected offices for more than a decade.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A stalk of corn is growing in front of a home – in the concrete – at the 5700 block of W. Silver Valley Drive near Dunham Park on the city’s west side. It’s the second report of corn growing in unexpected places this week after a corn plant was found by a golfer at the Elmwood Gold Course on Monday in a sand bunker. Both plants were photographed and shared by separate people on the Sioux Falls Reddit page to the delight of others ready to relive what some consider the most positive story of 2020 in the city. In 2020, the 57th Street Corn became the talk of the town, inspiring T-shirts, memes and photos from fans across the region. The corn was later found pulled from the ground near the intersection at 57th Street and Minnesota Avenue. The Silver Valley Drive Corn is still a young plant, but Ldyia Smith, the owner of the house in front of the plant, said it’s in good hands. “I said that we could start serving street corn once it started growing,” Smith said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A Black repertory theater said it plans to open a tuition-free school for at-risk students and other groups in a historic church that will be renovated after falling into disrepair. Hattiloo Theatre said the new program is expected to begin in late 2023. Students will be accepted based on auditions, and two-thirds of admissions will be reserved for low-income and marginalized students, the theater said Tuesday. Hattiloo Theater School will hold free audition workshops in at-risk neighborhoods. Programs will include youth courses based on experience level and age, a diverse abilities course and a senior citizen course, the theater said. The school will be housed in the Third Presbyterian Church, built in 1860. A community redevelopment agency plans to fund renovations. The church served as a hospital for federal Civil War troops, and it has changed names and congregations over the years, the theater said.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The building housing one of the city’s oldest grocery stores will be remade into medical offices anchored by El Paso Children’s Hospital doctors’ offices and possibly a clinic. The Food City building at 5400 Alameda Ave. was sold June 30 by the grocery store owners to an El Paso developer for an undisclosed amount. The 50-year-old store is expected to close about Aug 10, a Food City official said. The building and the 5 acres it stands on are valued for tax purposes at $3.7 million by the El Paso Central Appraisal District. Food City officials notified the Texas Workforce Commission that it would lay off 90 people by Sept. 3. However, that number is now about 55 because some employees were placed at Food City’s two other El Paso stores, Carlos Loweree, Food City vice president, said Tuesday. El Paso Children’s Hospital officials in a statement said the hospital is leasing a portion of the Food City building because it needs more office space for doctors as it continues to employ more physician specialists.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Miniature bottles of alcohol could return to liquor stores in deeply religious Utah by the fall after the state agency that oversees alcohol approved a rule change Tuesday. Members of the state’s Department of Alcoholic Beverage Services Commission voted unanimously to allow spirits to be sold in sizes slightly larger than the average shot or glass of wine, Fox 13 reported. The commission plans to open the proposed rule change to public comment and, barring concerns, could institute it by the fall. A decadeslong prohibition on miniature alcohol bottles is one of many unique liquor laws in Utah, where a majority of the population are members of the alcohol-eschewing Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Church officials have said the state’s laws are reasonable and effectively curtail excessive drinking and DUIs while still allowing people to drink responsibly. As Utah draws an increasing number of tourists and residents who aren’t members of the church, new tensions have arisen over the state’s liquor laws and concerns have grown over whether they entrench the state’s reputation as a religiously conservative place intolerant of those who drink alcohol. Alcohol regulators said the push bring back mini-bottles came from businesses in tourist-reliant parts of the state.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Shelburne Street roundabout will soon be completely open to traffic after a year of construction, according to the Vermont Agency of Transportation. Although the $10 million project won't officially be done until next spring, the roundabout will be fully functional in late summer or early, fall said project manager Mike LaCroix via email. Planners hope the roundabout will lead to a safer situation for motorists and pedestrians as the former maze of merging lanes contributed to many serious accidents. The roundabout will be located at the intersection of Shelburne Road, South Willard Street, Ledge Road and Locust Street in the south end. Workers are now installing streetlights, curbing, splitter islands and sidewalks, as well as paving the shared-use paths and roadway, applying temporary line striping and making landscaping enhancements. This work will continue for the next few months.\n\nVirginia\n\nDanville: A Virginia company and its owner have agreed to pay $310,000 to resolve allegations they violated federal and state law by submitting false bills to Medicare and Medicaid, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Jacob Patterson, 66 of Danville was a pharmacist who owned and operated Piedmont Infusion Services. The company employed nurses and nursing assistants to provide patients with compounded ,prescriptions as well as needle and catheter method medications ordered by their physicians, the department’s news release said. Piedmont Infusion Services did not employ a physician or “physician extender” such as a physician’s assistant to provide patient care. From 2013 through the beginning of 2018, Patterson and Piedmont Infusion Services falsely billed Medicare and Medicaid for high-level office visits that didn’t occur, a news release said. In addition, Patterson and Piedmont Infusion Services also fraudulently double-billed Medicare Part B for medications already billed to Medicare Part D. Prosecutors said a former employee of Piedmont Infusion Services came forward as a whistleblower and helped the government in its investigation.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Seattle chapter of the Audubon Society said it is dropping “Audubon” from its name because the man the organization is named after was a slave owner and opposed abolition. KNKX reported Seattle Audubon is one the largest chapters of the National Audubon Society, the nonprofit dedicated to protecting birds and their habitats. Earlier this month, the board voted to change the chapter’s name because the man the organization is named after – illustrator, painter and bird lover John James Audubon, author of the seminal work “The Birds of America” – owned enslaved people. J. Drew Lanham, a former board member of the National Audubon Society and a wildlife ecology professor at Clemson University, called the move courageous. Lanham, who has written about Audubon and left the national chapter over concerns the nonprofit was not doing enough about racial equity, said organizations need to grapple with what to do about problematic monuments. Last year, the Audubon Naturalist Society, a Washington-based environmental organization, said it would remove “Audubon” from its name, but it is not affiliated with the National Audubon Society. Seattle Audubon said it plans to choose a new name by the end of the year.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia corrections commissioner Betsy Jividen is resigning, Gov. Jim Justice said. Jividen’s resignation is effective Aug. 5. Justice said Tuesday he will begin the process of filling the vacancy. Jividen was appointed to lead the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation in 2018. She served as an acting and interim U.S. attorney for the state’s northern district. Her work as an assistant federal prosecutor dates to 1980. The corrections division operates 15 prisons, work-release centers and related facilities. It has more than 2,000 employees.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels said during a debate he can be taken at his word that he won’t raise gas taxes. Primary challenger Rebecca Kleefisch accused him of not taking responsibility for previously being in leadership roles for groups that backed increasing gas taxes. Kleefisch, Michels and state Rep. Tim Ramthun debated on the radio three days after a television debate and less than two weeks before the Aug. 9 primary. The winner will advance to face Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in November. Michels, who is endorsed by Donald Trump and co-owns the state’s largest construction company, Michels Corp., said he “never once” said he wanted to raise the gas tax. He said the groups he was on that lobbied for raising the gas tax, including the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association, came to a consensus on issues and he didn’t always agree. Kleefisch and former Gov. Scott Walker have attacked Michels over the gas tax issue.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A judge temporarily blocked the state’s abortion ban on the day it took effect, siding with a women’s health clinic and others who argued the ban would harm health care workers and their patients and violate the state constitution. Attorneys arguing in front of Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens in Jackson disagreed over whether the state Constitution provided a right to abortion. Owens was sympathetic, however, with arguments that the ban left pregnant women with dangerous complications and their doctors in a difficult position. “That is a possible irreparable injury to the plaintiffs. They are left with no guidance,” Owens said. The U.S. Supreme Court formally issued its judgment Tuesday in the June 24 Dobbs v. Jackson ruling – a step that allows some state trigger laws to ban abortion to take effect. Those suing in Wyoming include a nonprofit opening a Casper women’s and LGBTQ health clinic that would have offered abortions. A May arson attack has set back the clinic’s opening from mid-June until at least the end of this year, months past the start of Wyoming’s new abortion ban. The four Wyoming women and two nonprofits that sued Monday claim the new law violates several rights guaranteed by the state constitution, including a “fundamental right to be left alone by the government.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}]}

The observatory said it was working closely with emergency management partners.\n\nThe eruption had remained confined to the summit caldera early Monday, but USGS Volcanoes and the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency later reported some overflowing on the southwest portion.

The oldest lava flows found on Earth, near the village of Inukjuak, on the shore of Hudson Bay in Canada, are 3.825 billion years old. These rocks are certainly the product of a volcanic eruption, but they were not the first volcanic rocks erupted on Earth. Earth is an active planet, on which the surface rocks are being constantly removed by erosion, buried by younger rocks and folded under by the movement of tectonic plates. The Earth is 4.56 billion years old, but the first 700 million years of Earth history are poorly preserved. When we look at the full moon, we can see light and dark areas. The dark patches are covered by extensive lava flows from lunar volcanoes that erupted 3.1 to 4.3 billion years ago. The moon is less geologically active than Earth, so old lunar lavas are better preserved than those on Earth.\n\nIf you are asking about the oldest volcano that still has the general, conical shape of a volcano, then these 3-to-4-billion-year-old lunar and terrestrial rocks don’t count. Mt. Etna in Italy is sometimes called the oldest active volcano because it has the longest historic record of eruptions. It has erupted 190 times in the last 3,500 years. This is a bit misleading, however, because it was already an old volcano when the first recorded eruption occurred in 1,500 BC. We don’t have historic records for volcanic eruptions before that, so we have to rely on isotopic age dates instead. The Island of Hawaii has two active volcanoes, Kilauea and Mauna Loa, which have been active for at least 100,000 years. Hawaii is the youngest of a long line of volcanoes called the Hawaiian-Emperor Sea Mount chain. The oldest volcano in the chain is the inactive volcano Meiji, which is 85 million years old.\n\nSo to answer your original question, volcanoes have been erupting on Earth for at least the last 4 billion years and were undoubtedly more active in the distant past than they are today. During historic times, not a year has gone by without a volcanic eruption somewhere on Earth.\n\nAsk a Scientist runs on Sundays. Questions are answered by faculty at Binghamton University.

However, human CO2 emissions dwarf even the combined volcanic emissions from all of Earth's volcanos. The eruption in Iceland was too small and brief to have released a large amount of CO2, according to researchers and Icelandic government officials.\n\nCO2 emissions from human activity much larger than Grindavik volcano emissions\n\nThe volcanic eruption occurred on Dec. 18 on Iceland’s Reykjanes Peninsula near the town of Grindavik. Thousands of area residents had evacuated after seismic activity began in November.\n\nÞorsteinn Jóhannsson, an air quality researcher at the Environment Agency of Iceland, told USA TODAY in an email that, while some CO2 measurements from the eruption were collected, they have not yet been published. However, he said the eruption only lasted for two and a half days, was fairly small and could not have dwarfed human CO2 emissions.\n\nThis is because humans produce roughly 100 times as much CO2 as all volcanos combined in a normal year, according to NASA. The agency also reports that even the largest volcanic events – \"super volcano\" eruptions that happen every 100,000 to 200,000 years – produce around the same amount of CO2 that humans produce in a year.\n\nThe Deep Carbon Observatory program reports that humans produce 40-100 times more CO2 annually than volcanos, according to a press release.\n\n\"There are 40-50 eruptions happening across the planet all the time,\" Ed Venzke, the senior data researcher at the Global Volcanism Program, told USA TODAY in an email. \"Any claim that one small fissure eruption (like the Reykjanes Peninsula eruption) is in any way comparable to overall anthropogenic (human-emitted) CO2 production is without scientific support.\"\n\nFact check: Can we count on renewable energy? Four ways wind, solar and water can power the US\n\nJake Lowenstern, Chief of the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program at the US Geological Survey, agreed with this sentiment.\n\n“Given the initial estimate of sulfur release during the opening phase of the (Reykjanes Peninsula) eruption, it’s very hard to imagine that the eruption could have released more than the equivalent of one hour of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions,\" he said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nUSA TODAY has previously debunked similar false volcano emissions claims. For instance, some social media users wrongly claimed that a recent volcanic eruption in Greece had \"put more CO2 in the atmosphere in 24 hours than humans have In (sic) our entire existence.\" In reality, there had been no recent eruption in Greece. Other users wrongly claimed that Italy's Mt.

JMA Himawari satellite/Japan Meteorological Agency\n\nOn social media, footage showed people fleeing as waves inundated Tonga’s capital, Nuku’alofa, and the afternoon sky turned pitch black due to the heavy ash cloud. Tsunami waves were also recorded thousands of miles away along the United States’ West Coast, in Peru, New Zealand and Japan. In Peru, at least two people died after being swept up by high waves.\n\nAt least two deaths have been reported and aid organizations are concerned about contaminated air and access to clean water for people in Tonga’s outlying islands.\n\nWith communications down, Australia and New Zealand sent flights to survey the damage.\n\nHere’s what we know about the eruption and fallout.\n\nWhere is Tonga’s Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai volcano?\n\nTonga is a Polynesian country of more than 170 South Pacific islands and home to about 100,000 people. It’s a remote archipelago that lies about 800 kilometers (500 miles) east of Fiji and 2,380 kilometers (1,500 miles) from New Zealand.\n\nThe Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai volcano, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of Tonga’s Fonuafo’ou island, sits underwater between two small islands at about 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) high from the sea floor, with about 100 meters (328 feet) visible above sea level.\n\nResearchers said it has erupted regularly over the past few decades.\n\nIn 2009, an eruption sent plumes of steam and ash into the air and formed new land above the water, and an eruption in January 2015 created a new island about 2 kilometers wide – effectively joining up Hunga-Tonga and Hunga-Ha’apai islands.\n\nThe most recent eruption began in December 2021, with gas, steam, and ash plumes rising about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) into the air. The volcano erupted again on January 14 and a massive eruption on January 15 sent shockwaves around the world and triggered tsunami waves across the Pacific.\n\nWhere did the tsunami hit?\n\nThe eruption caused a tsunami on Tonga’s largest island, Tongatapu, with waves recorded at 1.2 meters (about 4 feet) near Nuku’alofa city flowing onto coastal roads and flooding properties on Saturday.\n\nTsunami warnings went into effect across Pacific Island nations including Fiji, Samoa and Vanuatu.

By Sunday afternoon, all tsunami advisories had been lifted in Japan.\n\nThe eruption also sent waves to the US West Coast, with some exceeding 3 and 4 feet in height, according to the National Weather Service office in San Diego. Tsunami waves were felt in California, Alaska and Hawaii.\n\nWhat is happening with the ash cloud?\n\nA giant volcanic ash cloud blanketed Tonga over the weekend, turning the afternoon sky dark and coating Nuku’alofa in a thick foam of volcanic dust on Saturday.\n\nSave the Children said drinking water supplies could be contaminated by the ash and smoke and the immediate concern in Tonga is for air and water safety.\n\nThe ash cloud was drifting westwards and was visible over Fiji, Vanuatu and New Caledonia on Sunday. By Monday it had reached Australia’s Queensland, according to the state’s meteorological service.\n\n“If you noticed a particularly stunning sunrise, it was the sunlight being scattered by #Volcanic ash from the eruption over in #Tonga,” Queensland’s Bureau of Meteorology said on Twitter.\n\nThe ash prevented an Australian reconnaissance flight from departing to assess the damage in the early hours of January 17, though the flight did take off later that morning.\n\nPowerful undersea volcano eruption in Tonga on January 14. Tonga Geological Services/EyePress/Reuters\n\nSeveral flights from Australia, New Zealand and Fiji to Tonga were postponed due to the ash cloud.\n\nEarly data suggests the volcanic eruption was the biggest since the 1991 blast at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, New Zealand-based volcanologist Shane Cronin told Radio New Zealand.\n\n“This is an eruption best witnessed from space,” Cronin said, according to Reuters.\n\n“The large and explosive lateral spread of the eruption suggests that it was probably the biggest one since about the 1991 eruption of Pinatubo,” Cronin said.\n\nWhat is the scale of devastation?\n\nAt least two people, including a British national who lived in Nuku’alofa, were killed in Tonga following the eruption and tsunami.\n\nThe first images to emerge of the aftermath on January 18 show a thick layer of ash covering entire communities, but the extent of the damage remains unknown as communications – particularly on the outlying islands – have not yet been reestablished.\n\nTonga “needs immediate assistance to provide its citizens with fresh drinking water and food,” the country’s Speaker of the House Lord Fakafanua said in a statement posted to social media.\n\nHe said “many areas” had been affected by “substantial volcanic ashfall” but “the full extent of the harm to lives and property is currently unknown.”\n\nNew Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on January 16 that tsunami waves had a “significant impact” on Nuku’alofa, with boats and large boulders washed ashore. “Shops along the coast have been damaged and a significant cleanup will be needed,” she said.\n\nThe main undersea communications cable has also been impacted, likely due to loss of power.\n\nAustralia’s Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Zed Seselja, said there was “significant property damage” in Tonga, including to roads and houses. He said there is still “very limited, if any” information coming from the outer islands.\n\nNew Zealand’s High Commission in Nuku’alofa echoed this, saying in a statement Monday that “significant” damage has been reported along the western coast of Tongatapu.\n\nA family-owned beach resort located on Tongatapu also said the business had been destroyed. “It’s with sadness to say that our beautiful home Ha’atafu beach resort has been completely wiped out. The whole western coastline has been completely destroyed along with Kanukupolu village,” the Ha’atafu Beach Resort posted on Facebook on Monday.\n\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said its teams are on the ground and have enough supplies in the country to support 1,200 households.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows eruption that caused tsunami waves 01:37 - Source: CNN\n\n“From what little updates we have, the scale of the devastation could be immense, especially for outer lying islands,” said Katie Greenwood, IFRC’s Pacific Head of Delegation, according to Reuters.\n\nNew Zealand’s Defense Force dispatched an Orion aircraft for Tonga on a surveillance mission to assess the damage.

It's the same area where a stable with the remains of three harnessed horses were excavated in 2017.\n\nPompeii officials said the men apparently escaped the initial fall of ash from Mount Vesuvius then succumbed to a powerful volcanic blast that took place the next morning. The later blast \"apparently invaded the area from many points, surrounding and burying the victims in ash,\" Pompeii officials said in a statement.\n\nThe remains of the two victims, lying next to each other on their backs, were found in a layer of gray ash at least 6.5 feet deep, they said.\n\nAs has been done when other remains have been discovered at the Pompeii site, archaeologists poured liquid chalk into the cavities, or void, left by the decaying bodies in the ash and pumice that rained down from the volcano near modern-day Naples and demolished the upper levels of the villa.\n\nThe technique, pioneered in the 1800s, gives the image not only of the shape and position of the victims in the throes of death, but makes the remains \"seem like statues,\" said Massimo Osanna, an archaeologist who is director general of the archaeological park operated under the jurisdiction of the Italian Culture Ministry.\n\nJudging by cranial bones and teeth, one of the men was young, likely aged 18 to 25, with a spinal column with compressed discs. That finding led archaeologists to hypothesize that he was a young man who did manual labor, like that of a slave.\n\nThe other man had a robust bone structure, especially in his chest area, and died with his hands on his chest and his legs bent and spread apart. He was estimated to have been 30 to 40 years old, Pompeii officials said. Fragments of white paint were found near the man's face, probably remnants of a collapsed upper wall, the officials said.\n\nBoth skeletons were found in a side room along an underground corridor, or passageway, known in ancient Roman times as a cryptoporticus, which led to the upper level of the villa.\n\n\"The victims were probably looking for shelter in the cryptoporticus, in this underground space, where they thought they were better protected,\" said Osanna.\n\nInstead, on the morning of Oct. 25, 79 A.D., a \"blazing cloud (of volcanic material) arrived in Pompeii and...killed anyone it encountered on its way,\" Osanna said.\n\nBased on the impression of fabric folds left in the ash layer, it appeared the younger man was wearing a short, pleated tunic, possibly of wool. The older victim, in addition to wearing a tunic, appeared to have had a mantle over his left shoulder.\n\nMount Vesuvius remans an active volcano.

Multiple explosions shook the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv following weeks of relative calm, prompting widespread condemnation from global leaders. “They are trying to annihilate us and wipe us off the face of the earth,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today. The mayor of Kyiv has urged residents to remain in shelters after a children’s playground was among the sites hit by the apparent Russian strikes. Several blasts also rocked the Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv, Lviv, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk. This comes just two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin was humiliated following a massive explosion on a key strategic bridge linking Crimea and Russia.\n\n2. Hurricane Ian\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Ian, the lack of flood insurance in Central Florida has left many families struggling to rebuild amid the devastation. Homeowners’ insurance policies typically don’t cover flood damage and most people living in Ian’s path across Florida didn’t have a separate flood insurance policy. Inland areas that experienced historic rainfall and catastrophic floodwaters were especially unprepared, according to a CNN analysis of FEMA flood insurance data. While people without flood insurance will still be eligible for assistance payments from FEMA and potentially other aid approved by Congress, experts say many homeowners will likely only receive a tiny fraction of the cost of the damage they suffered.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Immigrant workers head to Florida to help with hurricane relief 03:31 - Source: CNN\n\n3.

It has been updated to reflect Florida’s 2023 special legislative session.\n\nCNN —\n\nDisney’s Orlando-area theme parks and who will govern them are under renewed scrutiny in Florida – the latest in a yearlong spat between Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the state’s largest private employer.\n\nLawmakers have returned to Tallahassee for a special session called in part to address what happens to Disney’s special taxing district, called the Reedy Creek Improvement District, after they previously passed legislation dissolving it, which was supposed to take effect in June.\n\nState Republicans on Monday unveiled a bill to turn over control of Disney’s special taxing district to a five-member board hand-picked by DeSantis and rebrand Reedy Creek the “Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.”\n\nThe move to take over Reedy Creek comes after DeSantis sparred last year with Disney over a bill to restrict certain classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nHere’s a look at the history of Reedy Creek, why it has become the focus of another special legislative session in Florida, and how proposed changes would give DeSantis more control.\n\nWhat is Reedy Creek?\n\nReedy Creek is the name for the Reedy Creek Improvement District, a special purpose district created by state law in May 1967 that gives The Walt Disney Company governmental control over the land in and around its central Florida theme parks. The district sits southwest of Orlando.\n\nAt the time, the land was little more than uninhabited pasture and swamp, according to Reedy Creek’s website. With the special purpose district, Disney took over responsibility for providing municipal services like power, water, roads and fire protection – but was also freed from dealing with legal red tape or paying taxes for services that benefited the broader public.\n\nAccording to Richard Foglesong, the author of the book “Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando,” Disney had previously had issues with the government of Anaheim, California, at its Disneyland park, completed a decade earlier. With those issues in mind, Disney pushed for a special purpose district in Florida that would give the company the ability to self-govern.\n\nIn exchange, Florida became the home base for Disney World and its millions of tourists.\n\n“Florida needed Disney more than Disney needed Florida,” Foglesong told CNN.\n\nToday, the Reedy Creek special district encompasses about 25,000 acres in Orange and Osceola counties, including four theme parks, two water parks, one sports complex, 175 lane miles of roadway, 67 miles of waterway, and the cities of Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, its website says.\n\n“The cooperation and commitment between the Reedy Creek Improvement District and Walt Disney World Company is as strong today as it was when the District was created in 1967,” the Reedy Creek website states. “The result is an example of how a working partnership between business and government can be prosperous for both sides.”\n\nWhy is this an issue now?\n\nLast year, DeSantis challenged lawmakers to unravel the 55-year-old Reedy Creek Improvement Act as part of a special legislative session and ultimately signed a bill that would sunset the district on June 1.\n\nLawmakers left town without a plan to unwind a half-century of Disney control or for how to ensure Orange and Osceola county residents wouldn’t be on the hook for funding Reedy Creek services or its $1 billion in debt. Amid the fallout, Reedy Creek told its bondholders that Florida could not dissolve the district without assuming its debts.\n\nDeSantis repeatedly offered assurances that taxpayers wouldn’t have to pick up the tab.\n\nNow, GOP lawmakers have returned to the state Capitol and are trying to breath new life into the taxing district and keep many of its special powers. The final page of the 189-page bill proposed Monday states: “The Reedy Creek Improvement District is not dissolved as of June 1, 2023, but continues in full force and effect under its new name.”\n\nThe Republican-controlled legislature is likely to pass the proposed changes within the next couple of weeks and the governor is supportive of them.\n\nWhat are lawmakers proposing?\n\nThe bill, introduced Monday by state Rep. Fred Hawkins, seeks to limit the damage that could be done to Disney, one of the state’s most vital tourism engines, and to taxpayers.\n\nThe measure guarantees that the changes to Reedy Creek will not affect the district’s existing debt or any other contracts.\n\nInstead of ending the district, the proposed legislation would rebrand it as the “Central Florida Tourism Oversight District” and curb some of its powers, including the ability to build an airport or a nuclear power plant.\n\nThe board, previously made up of Reedy Creek landowners with close ties to Disney, will instead become a five-member board of supervisors appointed by the governor. The bill makes clear that none of the appointees chosen by the governor can be recent Disney employees or their relatives, nor that of a competitor. The state Senate, where Republicans hold a super majority, would have final approval of the appointees.\n\n“These actions ensure a state-controlled district accountable to the people instead of a corporate-controlled kingdom,” DeSantis spokesman Jeremy Redfern said.\n\nWhat has Disney said?\n\nDisney said Monday it is watching the bill.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Jeff Vahle, the president of Walt Disney World Resort, said the company is “monitoring the progression of the draft legislation, which is complex given the long history of the Reedy Creek Improvement District.”\n\n“Disney works under a number of different models and jurisdictions around the world, and regardless of the outcome, we remain committed to providing the highest quality experience for the millions of guests who visit each year,” Vahle said.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Florida schools?\n\nReedy Creek has been tied to the feud between DeSantis, who has widely been seen as a potential 2024 GOP presidential contender, and Disney over a measure that bans certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom.\n\nThe “Parental Rights in Education” bill – which critics have dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill – was signed into law last March and prohibits schools from teaching children about sexual orientation or gender identity “in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate.” The legislation also allows parents to bring lawsuits against a school district for potential violations.\n\nThe law’s vague language and the threat of parental lawsuits have raised fears that it will lead to discrimination against LGBTQ students and will have a chilling effect on classroom discussion. DeSantis spokesperson Christina Pushaw said on Twitter last year that the legislation would protect kids from “groomers,” a slang term for pedophiles, and described those who oppose the law as “probably groomers.”\n\nBob Chapek, the then-CEO of Disney, which employs 75,000 people in Florida, initially declined to condemn the law last year but reversed course after facing employee criticism. A company spokesperson then released a statement stating its goal was for the law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts.\n\n“Florida’s HB 1557, also known as the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill, should never have passed and should never have been signed into law,” the March 2022 statement said. The company said it was “dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson Dianne Gallagher Steve Contorno Jack Forrest", "Eric Levenson", "Dianne Gallagher", "Steve Contorno", "Jack Forrest"], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/11/europe/faroe-islands-whale-hunt-dolphin-limit-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "title": "Faroe Islands will allow 500 dolphins to be killed in annual whale ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe government of the Faroe Islands has set a catch limit of 500 dolphins for the territory’s annual whale hunt this year.\n\nSituated halfway between Iceland and Scotland in the Atlantic Ocean, the Faroes are a self-governing territory of the Kingdom of Denmark made up of 18 islands.\n\nThe yearly whale cull, or grindadráp in Faroese, is a traditional practice that dates back to the first settlement of the islands by Vikings in 800 CE.\n\nAnimal rights organizations have historically condemned the cull, in which whales are killed by gashes to the neck and subsequent cuts to the spinal cord and carotid artery.\n\nOn September 12, 2021, a super-pod of 1,428 Atlantic white-sided dolphins was driven into the shallow water at Skalabotnur beach and killed. Sea Shepherd via ABACAPRESS.COM/Reuters\n\nHowever, the Faroese government has previously defended the practice, saying the meat from the hunt provides “valuable food” for local communities.\n\nWhale hunts take place to provide food and catches are distributed among the participants and local communities, according to the Whales and Whaling in the Faroe Islands website. Whale meat and blubber are sometimes available for sale on the dockside and at supermarkets.\n\n“The meat from each whale drive provides a large amount of valuable food, which is distributed free in the local communities where the whale drives take place… the meat of the 1,400 dolphins caught on Sunday has likewise been distributed among the participants in the catch and the local community,” Faroese government spokesman Páll Nolsøe told CNN after the hunt last year.\n\nThe government’s decision follows last year’s hunt, when a super-pod of 1,428 Atlantic white-sided dolphins were corralled by jet skis and speed boats onto Skálabotnur beach on the island of Eysturoy and eventually killed, according to marine conservation group Sea Shepherd.\n\nAt the time, the group denounced the killing as a “brutal and badly mishandled” massacre, and the largest single hunt in the territory’s history.\n\nIn a statement announcing its decision Sunday, the government said of the September 2021 hunt: “It has been acknowledged that aspects of that catch were not satisfactory, in particular the unusually large number of dolphins killed.”\n\n“This made procedures difficult to manage and is unlikely to be a sustainable level of catch on a long-term annual basis,” the government added.\n\nLukas Erichsen, a representative of Sea Shepherd, described the new quota as “totally meaningless.”\n\nErichsen, who is part of Sea Shepherd’s whale defense campaign in the Faroe Islands, told CNN in an emailed statement that there appeared to be no penalty for exceeding the quota. “Indeed who would be prosecuted or fined should over 500 be killed in the next two years? No doubt if over 500 were killed in a year then those responsible would claim they did not realize that the pod was so big until it was driven into the shallows and the dolphins killed,” he said.\n\n“This new ‘quota’ is meaningless for dolphins in the long run and has only hastily been announced as a thinly-veiled attempt to deceive both politicians and the press in the face of continued outrage over the killing of dolphins in the Faroe Islands,” Erichsen added.\n\nThe government said in its latest statement that it aligns itself with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, a set of 17 commitments that address global challenges, including the climate crisis and the need to preserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources.\n\n“Catches of small whales are an important supplement to the livelihoods of Faroe Islanders, who have for centuries relied on the sustainable use of marine resources for their economy and local food security,” it said.\n\n“The meat and blubber from each whale drive provide valuable food with a low carbon footprint, which is distributed for free in the different communities where the catches take place,” the government added.\n\nThere are about 80,000 white-sided dolphins in the seas surrounding the Faroe Islands, according to the government. It added that a yearly cull of just over 820 white-sided dolphins would therefore be “well within sustainable limits.”\n\nHowever, it said it has asked the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission to provide more up-to-date information on how to sustainably catch white-sided dolphins, after which it will assess the provisional annual limit of 500.\n\nThe government also said it would review the method used to kill the dolphins to reduce the length of time it takes for them to die.\n\nAfter last year’s killing, several whaling supporters condemned the hunt. Among them was Kristian Petersen, who told CNN at the time that “there were so many errors,” including stalking a big flock and prolonging the dolphins’ suffering by having too few people on the beaches to kill them.", "authors": ["Sana Noor Haq"], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/asia/taiwan-china-airspace-pelosi-trip-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Does Taiwan have its own airspace? China sets military drills close ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChina is conducting military drills around Taiwan to protest a visit to the island this week by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nChina issued a map showing six zones around Taiwan that would be the site of air and sea exercises, and long-range live-fire drills in coming days – part of what a spokesman described as a “blockade.” Ships and aircraft have been warned to stay out of the areas during the drills.\n\nOn Thursday, Taiwan’s Maritime and Port Bureau said China had added a seventh military exercise area for ships and aircraft to avoid “in the waters around eastern Taiwan.”\n\nThe exercise areas announced by Beijing extend well into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone – a buffer of airspace commonly referred to as an ADIZ – and in some cases come within 12 nautical miles (22.2 kilometers) of its shores. Twelve nautical miles is the distance that international law defines as constituting a country’s territorial airspace.\n\nAnalysts say it’s an extremely provocative move.\n\nCarl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center, said China is going “a lot farther than it ever has before” in putting its military assets close to Taiwan’s shores.\n\nBeijing’s threats have prompted much discussion over what, exactly, constitutes Taiwan’s airspace, and if it’s recognized under international law.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is a country’s airspace?\n\nUnder the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), a country’s territorial boundaries extend 12 nautical miles (22.2 kilometers) from its coastline.\n\nThe area above is considered the country’s territorial airspace, according to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, which also stipulates that government or military aircraft may not fly over the territory of another country without permission.\n\nChina is a signatory to UNCLOS, signing on December 10, 1982, and ratifying it in 1996. Taiwan is not.\n\nIf Taiwan isn’t an independent country, does it have its own airspace?\n\nTaiwan’s disputed status makes this question hard to answer definitively.\n\nWhile Taiwan is a self-governing democracy, mainland China insists it has sovereignty over the island and is fiercely opposed to any suggestion that it could be considered an independent country.\n\nMost countries in the world do not recognize Taiwan as an independent country – holding diplomatic relations with Beijing rather than Taipei.\n\nHowever, Drew Thompson, visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore and a former US Defense Department official, said most of the world treated Taiwan as if it were an independent country – and for that reason, it should be considered as having its own airspace.\n\n“The reality is Taiwan exists. Taiwan is autonomous. It is effectively independent of any other country. It elects its own government, collects its own taxes, defends its own borders. So for all intents and purposes, Taiwan is a country,” Thompson said.\n\nA view of the South China Sea between the city of Xiamen in China, in the far distance, and the islands of Kinmen in Taiwan, February 2, 2021. An Rong Xu/Getty Images/FILE\n\n“Under that principle, then perhaps we decide that international law applies, in which case Taiwan’s airspace extends to 12 miles beyond its baseline. Beyond the 12-mile limit is international waters, international airspace,” he added.\n\nThompson said there was also a matter of precedent and that even China’s military appeared to tacitly recognize this.\n\nDespite the “fact that the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) doesn’t recognize Taiwan, or China doesn’t recognize Taiwan, they’ve respected Taiwan’s airspace,” he said.\n\nChinese commercial aviation companies also respected Taiwan’s airspace, Thompson said, recognizing a “convention that effectively treats Taiwan as independent under civil aviation guidelines.”\n\nHowever, China contends that since Taiwan is its sovereign territory, its military aircraft do not need permission from Taiwan or any other entity to fly into the island’s territorial airspace. In Beijing’s eyes, Taiwan’s airspace is essentially China’s airspace.\n\nSo could China fly its military planes over Taiwan?\n\n“It would run against international law, but international law is flimsy and open to the interpretation of every country that decides whether or not they want to follow it or enforce it,” Thompson said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Chinese ambassador: Pelosi's Taiwan visit will escalate tensions 06:58 - Source: CNN\n\nBut what is “international law?” The International Court of Justice in the Hague, says it evaluates cases based on “international conventions,” such as treaties like UNCLOS; “international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law,” in other words, what countries usually do in a given circumstance; and “the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations.”\n\nThe United Nations’ website says international law is upheld “in many ways – by courts, tribunals, multilateral treaties – and by the Security Council, which can approve peacekeeping missions, impose sanctions, or authorize the use of force when there is a threat to international peace and security, if it deems this necessary.”\n\nBut remember, the five permanent members of the Security Council, including both China and the United States, have veto power, so they can block any UN attempt to enforce international law.\n\n“You’ve seen China disregard international law norms left and right for decades, not least in the South China Sea,” Thompson said, referring to the military facilities China has built on various islands despite having its claims to sovereignty rejected by an international tribunal in 2016.\n\nWhat’s the difference between airspace and an air defense identification zone?\n\nTaiwan has often been in the headlines recently when Chinese warplanes have entered its air defense identification zone.\n\nOn Tuesday, for example, Taiwan said 21 Chinese planes entered its ADIZ, and there have been almost daily incursions of PLA warplanes for the past month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See how China reacted to Pelosi's expected trip to Taiwan 03:00 - Source: CNN\n\nHowever, these zones are not the same as territorial airspace. Rather, they are unilaterally declared buffer areas that extend beyond territorial airspace, that are specifically set up to give defensive forces time to react when foreign aircraft approach. Consequently, not all countries have an air defense identification zone.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration defines the zones as “a designated area of airspace over land or water within which a country requires the immediate and positive identification, location and air traffic control of aircraft in the interest of the country’s national security.”\n\nMercedes Trent of the Federation of American Scientists wrote in a 2020 review that, “It is customary for foreign aircraft entering such zones to identify themselves and seek prior authorization from the country controlling the zone before entering.”\n\nIf foreign aircraft do enter an air defense identification zone without permission, the home jurisdiction will often scramble fighter aircraft to warn off the intruders. This has happened on numerous occasions when Chinese warplanes have entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone in recent years.\n\nHow did Taiwan set up its air defense identification zone?\n\nThe island’s air defense identification zone was actually the brainchild of the United States, which set up similar zones for Japan, South Korea and the Philippines to try to protect them from Chinese and Russian overflights, according to Trent, of the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nPart of Taiwan’s air defense identification zone actually extends over the Chinese mainland, but Chinese flights are challenged by Taiwan only if they cross the median line – the halfway point between the island and the mainland above the Taiwan Strait.\n\nDoes China have an air defense identification zone?\n\nYes. It is over the East China Sea and covers the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu island chain, which is controlled by Japan.\n\nChina’s air defense identification zone overlaps those of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. However, it does not cover the island of Taiwan itself, stopping just short of its northern tip.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon"], "publish_date": "2022/08/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/asia/china-taiwan-invasion-scenarios-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "title": "China has the power to take Taiwan, but it would cost an extremely ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nOn his first trip to Asia as United States President last week, Joe Biden gave his strongest warning yet to Beijing that Washington was committed to defending Taiwan militarily in the event of an attack from China.\n\nBiden’s comments, which compared a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, appeared to deviate from Washington’s decades-old policy of “strategic ambiguity” on the issue and seemingly raised the possibility of a military clash between US and Chinese forces.\n\nIt’s the third time Biden has made similar remarks since taking office and, just as on the other two occasions, they were quickly walked back by the White House – which insists its policy has not changed. However, it inevitably raises the question: if China tries to take Taiwan, are the United States and its allies able to stop it?\n\nAnd the alarming answer is: Quite possibly not. Analysts say China has more troops, more missiles and more ships than Taiwan or its possible supporters, like the US or Japan, could bring to a fight. That means that if China is absolutely determined to take the island it probably can.\n\nBut there’s a caveat; while China could likely prevail, any victory would come at an extremely bloody price for both Beijing and its adversaries.\n\nMany analysts say an invasion of Taiwan would be more dangerous and complex than the Allied D-Day landings in France in World War II. US government documents put the number of killed, injured and missing from both sides during the almost three-month-long Normandy campaign at almost half a million troops.\n\nAnd the civilian carnage could be far, far worse.\n\nTaiwan’s population of 24 million people is packed into dense urban areas like the capital Taipei, with an average of 9,575 people per square kilometer. Compare that to Mariupol, Ukraine – devastated in the war with Russia – and with an average of 2,690 people per square kilometer.\n\nDespite its numerical advantages in sea-, air- and land-based forces in the region, China has Achilles heels in each arena of war that would force Beijing to think long and hard about whether an invasion is worth the overwhelming human cost.\n\nHere are some scenarios of how a Chinese invasion might play out:\n\nThe naval war\n\nChina has the world’s largest navy, with around 360 combat vessels – bigger than the US’ fleet of just under 300 ships.\n\nBeijing also has the world’s most-advanced merchant fleet, a large coast guard and, experts say, a maritime militia – fishing boats unofficially aligned with the military – giving it access to hundreds of additional vessels that could be used to transport the hundreds of thousands of troops that analysts say China would need for an amphibious invasion.\n\nAnd those troops would need massive amounts of supplies.\n\n“For Beijing to have reasonable prospects of victory, the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) would have to move thousands of tanks, artillery guns, armored personnel vehicles, and rocket launchers across with the troops. Mountains of equipment and lakes of fuel would have to cross with them,” Ian Easton, a senior director at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote in The Diplomat last year.\n\nGetting a force of that size across the 110 miles (177 kilometers) of the Taiwan Strait would be a long, dangerous mission during which those vessels carrying the troops and equipment would be sitting ducks.\n\n“The thought about China invading Taiwan, that’s a massacre for the Chinese navy,” said Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\nThat’s because Taiwan has been stocking up on cheap and effective land-based anti-ship missiles, similar to the Neptunes Ukraine used to sink the Russian cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea in April.\n\n“Taiwan is mass-producing these things. And they’re small, it’s not like (China) can take them all out,” O’Brien said.\n\n“What’s cheap is a surface-to-ship missile, what’s expensive is a ship.”\n\nThe Chinese guided-missile destroyer Changsha returns to a port in Sanya City, China, in March 2017. Zeng Tao/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nStill, China could – given its numerical advantage – simply decide the losses were worth it, pointed out Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine captain and now an analyst at the Center for a New American Security.\n\n“There’s gonna be hundreds if not thousands of (Chinese) vessels there to soak up those (Taiwanese) missiles,” Shugart said.\n\nMissiles aside, China would face massive logistical hurdles in landing enough soldiers. Conventional military wisdom holds that an attacking force should outnumber defenders 3 to 1.\n\n“With a potential defending force of 450,000 Taiwanese today … China would need over 1.2 million soldiers (out of a total active force of more than 2 million) that would have to be transported in many thousands of ships,” Howard Ullman, a former US Navy officer and professor at the US Naval War College, wrote in a February essay for the Atlantic Council.\n\nHe estimated such an operation would take weeks and that despite China’s maritime strength, it “simply lacks the military capability and capacity to launch a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan for the foreseeable future.”\n\nAircraft carrier killers\n\nSome of the problems that would face China’s navy in Taiwan would also face any US naval force sent to defend the island.\n\nThe US Navy sees its aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, bristling with F-35 and F/A-18 jets, as its spear in the Pacific and would have a numerical advantage in this area. The US has 11 carriers in total, compared to China’s two. However, only about half are combat ready at any one time and even these might be vulnerable.\n\nO’Brien and others point out that the People’s Liberation Army has more than 2,000 conventionally armed missiles, many of which it has developed with the US Navy’s prized aircraft carriers in mind.\n\nOf particular concern would be China’s DF-26 and DF-21D – touted by Beijing’s state-run Global Times tabloid in 2020 as “aircraft carrier killers” and the “world’s first ballistic missiles capable of targeting large and medium-sized vessels.”\n\nAs O’Brien puts it, “The US better be careful thinking about, in any kind of war environment, sending carrier battle groups close to China … If you’re fighting a state-to-state war, you’re going to stay far away from shore.”\n\nOthers are more confident in the US carriers.\n\nRear Adm. Jeffery Anderson, the commander of the US Navy’s Carrier Strike Group Three centered on the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, recently told CNN his ships are more than ready to deal with the kind of missiles that sank the Moskva.\n\n“One thing I do know about our US ships is they’re extremely survivable. Not only are they lethal, but they are extremely survivable,” he said.\n\nA Chinese air force fighter jet takes off during training exercises in 2017. Liu Chang/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nThe air war\n\nChina is likely to seek air superiority early into any conflict, analysts say, and may feel it has an advantage in the skies.\n\nFlight Global’s 2022 directory of the world’s air forces shows the PLA with almost 1,600 combat aircraft, compared to Taiwan’s fewer than 300. The directory shows the US with more than 2,700 combat aircraft, but those cover the world while China’s are all in the region.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Taiwan holds ceremony for advanced F-16V fighter jets 02:11 - Source: CNN\n\nIn the air war, China also will have learned from Russia’s failures in Ukraine – where Moscow took months assembling its ground forces yet failed to soften up the terrain for them with a bombing campaign – and is more likely to emulate the “shock and awe” bombardments that preceded the US’ invasions of Iraq.\n\n“I’m sure the PLA is learning from what they’re seeing,” Shugart said. “You can read open-source translations of their strategic documents. They learned very carefully from what we did in Desert Storm and Kosovo.”\n\nBut even in the air China would face significant difficulties.\n\nA guided-missile-armed J-20 stealth fighter jet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force performs at Airshow China 2018. Shu ying/Imagine China/Reuters\n\nRussia’s failure to quickly seize control of the skies in Ukraine initially dumbfounded many analysts. Some put the failure down to the cheap antiaircraft missiles Western militaries have supplied to Kyiv.\n\nTaiwan has deals with the United States to supply it with Stinger antiaircraft missiles and Patriot missile defense batteries. And it also has been investing heavily in its own missile production facilities over the past three years in a project, when completed this summer, will see its missile production capabilities triple, according to a Janes report in March.\n\nOn the other hand, China would have an advantage over the US due to its closeness to Taiwan.\n\nA recent war game run by the Center for a New American Security concluded that an aerial conflict between the US and China would likely end in stalemate.\n\nCommenting on the result to Air Force Magazine, Lt. Gen. S. Clinton Hinote, US Air Force deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, said that while the US was used to dominating the skies some factors weren’t in its favor.\n\nChina had “invested in modern aircraft and weapons to fight us,” he noted, and US forces would also face the “tyranny of distance” – most of the US air power used in the war game operated out of the Philippines, about 500 miles (800 kilometers) away.\n\nThe war game simulated Chinese forces beginning their campaign by trying to take out the nearest US bases in places like Guam and Japan.\n\nHinote likened that move to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, saying China would be motivated by “many of the same reasons.”\n\n“The attack is designed to give Chinese forces the time they need to invade and present the world with a fait accompli,” he told the magazine.\n\nChina has a growing arsenal of short-, medium- and intermediate range ballistic missiles that can reach these far-flung targets.\n\nAs of 2020, the PLA had at least 425 missile launchers capable of hitting those US bases, according to the China Power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nA Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldier fires an anti-tank rocket during a live-fire military exercise in Wuzhong, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China in 2019. Reuters\n\nThe ground war\n\nEven in a scenario where China was willing to take these risks and managed to get a significant amount of troops ashore, its forces would then face another uphill battle.\n\nTaiwan has about 150,000 troops and 2.5 million reservists – and its entire national defense strategy is based on countering a Chinese invasion.\n\nLike their counterparts in Ukraine the Taiwanese would have the advantage of home turf, knowing the ground and being highly motivated to defend it.\n\nFirst, the PLA would need to find a decent landing spot – ideally close to both the mainland and a strategic city such as Taipei with nearby port and airport facilities. Experts have identified just 14 beaches that would fit the bill and Taiwan is well aware of which ones those are. Its engineers have spent decades digging tunnels and bunkers to protect them.\n\nTaiwan’s troops would also be relatively fresh compared to their Chinese counterparts, who would be drained from the journey over and would still need to push through the island’s western mud flats and mountains, with only narrow roads to assist them, toward Taipei.\n\nChinese troops could be dropped in from the air, but a lack of paratroopers in the PLA makes it unlikely.\n\nAnother problem for Chinese troops would be their lack of battlefield experience. The last time the PLA was in active combat was in 1979, when China fought a brief border war with Vietnam.\n\nSoldiers of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) fire a mortar during a live-fire military exercise in Anhui province, China May 22, 2021. cnsphoto/Reuters\n\nIn that effort, China “really got a bloody nose, it was not very successful operation,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\n“So China’s military today is not battle tested, and it could suffer great losses, if it indeed attacked Taiwan,” Glaser said.\n\nOthers pointed out that even battle-tested troops could struggle against a well-motivated defensive force – noting that the Russian military was bogged down in Ukraine despite its recent fighting experience in Syria and Georgia.\n\nStill, as with the other scenarios, it is not only Chinese forces that might be handicapped by a lack of experience. Taiwan’s troops have also not been tested, and depending on the scenario, there are holes in even the US’ experience. As Shugart put it: “There is not a single US naval officer who has sunk another ship in combat.”\n\nWhat are the chances China attacks?\n\nGlaser, the German Marshall Fund analyst, thinks a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is unlikely.\n\n“I think that the PLA lacks full confidence that it can seize and control Taiwan. The PLA itself talks about some of the deficiencies in its capability,” she said.\n\n“And obviously, the war in Ukraine highlights some of the challenges that China could face; it is certainly much harder to launch a war 100 miles across a body of water than it is across land borders, (such as those) between Russia and Ukraine,” she said.\n\nShe noted that the strong Ukrainian resistance may be giving Taiwan’s people reason to fight for their land.\n\n“Given how Ukraine has really demonstrated a very high morale and willingness to defend its freedoms … I think that this is likely to change the calculus of not only military leaders in China, but hopefully also of (Chinese leader) Xi Jinping personally,” she said.\n\nO’Brien, the University of St. Andrews professor, wrote in The Spectator this year that any war over Taiwan would lead to devastating losses on all sides, something that should make their leaders tread carefully before committing troops.\n\n“If the Ukrainian war teaches us anything, it is that war is almost always a rash choice. Don’t underestimate your opponent, and don’t assume your systems will all work that well.”\n\nA Chinese amy tank takes part in military drills in 2018. Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAny other option?\n\nOf course, the PLA has options other than a full-blown invasion.\n\nThese include taking outlying Taiwanese islands or imposing a quarantine on the main island, Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow wrote last year in a report for the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Residents of Taipei on edge about China after Russia invades Ukraine 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\nPossible PLA targets could be Taiping Island, Taiwan’s most far-flung outpost in the South China Sea; the tiny Pratas Island, a small outpost 170 nautical miles (320 kilometers) southeast of Hong Kong; Kinmen and Matsu islands, tiny territories just a few miles off mainland China’s coast; or Penghu in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nWhile a PLA victory of any of the four is almost assured, it could come at the cost of galvanizing support for Taiwan in the rest of the world – much as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has united the West against it.\n\nBlackwill and Zelikow said the quarantine option might be more effective.\n\n“In a quarantine scenario, the Chinese government would effectively take control of the air and sea borders of Taiwan,” they wrote. “The Chinese government would run effectively a clearance operation offshore or in the air to screen incoming ships and aircraft. The screeners could then wave along what they regarded as innocent traffic.”\n\nAnything regarded as belligerent, such as US military aid for Taiwan, could be blocked or confiscated as a violation of Chinese sovereignty, they say. Meanwhile, China could allow the Taiwan government to function as normal except for foreign affairs.\n\nThis option would have an advantage in China’s eyes: the ball would be in the US’ court as to whether to use force to end the quarantine. Then it would be the US that would have to consider whether to risk a war that could cost countless lives.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon Ivan Watson", "Brad Lendon", "Ivan Watson"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/africa/shell-oil-spills-nigeria-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Shell escaped liability for oil spills in Nigeria for years.

SPDC was also ordered to carry out an intensive clean-up of the damage to the communities.\n\nWilliams was on Wednesday awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize for his work in holding the company accountable for the environmental damage.\n\nHe is one of seven global winners of the prestigious award, announced Wednesday morning, to honor grassroots, environmental activists. The prize is awarded each year by The Goldman Environmental Foundation, with ceremonies in San Francisco and Washington, DC.\n\n“These seven leaders give us a reason for hope and remind us what can be accomplished in the face of adversity,” the Vice President of the Goldman Environmental Foundation, Jennifer Goldman Wallis, said in a statement.\n\nWilliams attributed his win to “the grace of God” in a video call with CNN from Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nA historic case\n\nShell had argued for the case to be tried in Nigeria while rejecting liability for the spills, which it said were caused by sabotage of its subsidiary’s pipelines. In 2013, a Dutch lower court ruled that the Shell parent company could not be held responsible for violations committed by its Nigerian division.\n\nHowever, Williams says he and his legal team pushed on because they had established that the parent company in the Netherlands had “authority flow,” to the subsidiary – Shell Nigeria – and therefore could not be exempt from its decisions and operations.\n\nOil Pollution in Goi, in Ogoniland, Niger Delta area of Nigeria, 2020. Photo: George Osodi George Osodi\n\n“That was what gave us the confidence to appeal against the judgment, and the Court of Appeal agreed with us that the district court was wrong,” Williams said.\n\n“The first ruling that we got favorably was on jurisdiction. The Dutch High Court sitting in The Hague ruled that they had jurisdiction to hear the cases from Nigeria. That was the first hurdle that we scaled through,” he said.\n\nAfter the final ruling in January last year, Shell said in a statement: “We continue to believe that the spills in Oruma and Goi were the result of sabotage. We are therefore disappointed that this court has made a different finding on the cause of these spills and in its finding,” noting out that sabotage, oil theft, and illegal refining are “a major challenge” in the region.\n\nShell Nigeria spokesman Bamidele Odugbesan told CNN the company had agreed a settlement with the four farmers from Goi and Oruma communities after last year’s ruling, and that representatives are “working amiably on the actualization of the judgment.”\n\nHundreds of oil spills every year\n\nShell is the largest oil operator in the Niger Delta, Africa’s largest oil-producing region. Its residents face high poverty rates and a largely degraded environment, owing to hundreds of spills every year.\n\n“We have groundwater polluted with benzene 900 times above WHO level, we have farmlands with poor yields, rivers that are barely fishable, neonatal deaths numbering thousands yearly as a result of spills. We have reduced neuroplasticity of the brain as a result of oil pollution,” Niger Delta activist Saatah Nubari told CNN.\n\nChima Williams (center) and colleagues visit an oil-polluted area in Ikebiri Southern Ijaw, an area of the Niger Delta (Photo: George Osodi) George Osodi\n\n“The Niger Delta is a graveyard of the living and we will never know how much harm has been done until we audit the entire environment,” Nubari also said.\n\nFor many years, Shell has attributed most spills to theft and sabotage by locals.\n\n“Over 95 percent of the spill incidents in our operations are caused by sabotage,” Odugbesan, the Shell Nigeria spokesman, told CNN.\n\n“Throughout our operations globally, in 2021, it’s only in Nigeria that we recorded crude theft. And this has implications on our cost. When our facilities are tampered with and there’s a spill, we spend money to stop the spill, fix our facility, clean up and remediate the environment,” Odugbesan said.\n\nOperational problems\n\nNubari believes oil companies are “untouchable in Nigeria and unaccountable and that is why communities and individuals approach foreign courts to get justice.”\n\nWilliams agrees it is difficult to hold multinational companies accountable through government agencies in Nigeria.\n\nShell Nigeria spokesman Odugbesan denied that Shell is untouchable in Nigeria and stated that the company paid out around 50 billion naira in 2021 (around $111 million as of last year) after being sued by another community.\n\nFor Williams, his lengthy David-versus-Goliath legal battle has come with highs and lows.\n\n“In 2008, I was arrested on a Shell facility when I went to expose that Shell was still flaring gas, despite a 2005 court ruling which ordered them to stop gas flaring in Iwhrekan community, in the Niger Delta,” he told CNN.\n\nWilliams lauded other court decisions that have signaled wins for the Niger Delta’s aggrieved communities.\n\n“After January 29th, there have been a lot of positive court decisions within and outside Nigeria, some with massive monetary awards.

President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping discussed it at length in a two-hour-and-17-minute phone call on Thursday, as tensions mounted between Washington and Beijing.\n\n“The question of Taiwan is the most sensitive, important core issue in China-US relations,” said Chinese Ambassador to the US Qin Gang at the Aspen Security Forum in July.\n\nWhile Biden has said publicly the US military did not believe it was a good time Pelosi to visit Taiwan, he has stopped short of telling her directly not to go, according to two sources.\n\nAdministration officials have worked over recent weeks to apprise the House speaker of the risks of visiting the democratic, self-governing island of 24 million residents, including in briefings from Pentagon and other administration officials. But Biden did not believe it was his place to tell her she should not go, and he has avoided commenting publicly about her trip since his initial statement on July 21.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN Beijing bureau chief on why the timing of Biden-Xi call is critical 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nBiden said last month that the US military opposed Pelosi visiting Taiwan, though since then has refused to elaborate on the warnings. The White House has said it is up to the House speaker where she travels.\n\nStill, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently said he’d discussed a visit to Asia with Pelosi.\n\nThe administration takes extra care for Pelosi’s security when she travels overseas because she is in the presidential line of succession.\n\nAdministration officials are concerned Pelosi’s trip comes at a particularly tense moment, as Xi is expected to seek an unprecedented third term at the upcoming Chinese Communist Party congress. Chinese party officials are expected to begin laying the groundwork for that conference in the coming weeks, putting pressure on the leadership in Beijing to show strength.\n\nOfficials also believe the Chinese leadership doesn’t completely grasp the political dynamics in the United States, leading to a misunderstanding over the significance of Pelosi’s potential visit. The officials say China may be confusing Pelosi’s visit with an official administration visit, since she and Biden are both Democrats. Administration officials are concerned that China doesn’t separate Pelosi from Biden much, if at all.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why one former diplomat is worried about Pelosi's visit to Taiwan 02:58 - Source: CNN\n\nPelosi has long been a critic of the Chinese Communist Party. She has met with pro-democracy dissidents and the Dalai Lama – the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader who remains a thorn in the side of the Chinese government. In 1991, Pelosi unfurled a black-and-white banner in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to commemorate victims of the 1989 massacre, which said, “To those who died for democracy.” In recent years, she voiced support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Chinese embassy to the United States has objected to her expected trip, which was planned for April before Pelosi tested positive for Covid-19, urging members of Congress to tell the speaker not to make it.\n\n“I would say there’s been a full-court press from the Chinese embassy to discourage a trip to Taiwan,” Washington Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen, the co-chair of Congress’ US-China working group, told CNN. “I just don’t think it’s their business to tell us what we ought to be doing. That was my message back.”\n\nLiu Pengyu, spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the US, responded that his office is in “regular contact” with members of Congress, including Larsen.\n\n“On the Taiwan question, we have made our stance loud and clear,” Pengyu said. “The Embassy is making all our efforts to prevent the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the stability of China-US relations being damaged by the potential visit of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.”\n\n“We hope serious consequences could be avoided,” he added. “This is in the common interests of both China and the US.”\n\nMany Democrats and Republicans in Congress said it was Pelosi’s right to travel to Taiwan.\n\n“It is Speaker Pelosi’s decision alone on whether or not to travel to Taiwan, not any other country,” said Illinois Republican Rep. Darin LaHood, Larsen’s Republican counterpart on the US-China working group. “In our democratic system – we operate with separate but equal branches of government.”\n\n“It is inappropriate for foreign governments, including the Chinese government, to attempt to influence the ability or the right to travel for the speaker, members of Congress, or other US government officials to Taiwan or anywhere else around the world,” he added.\n\nOther members appeared to be more cautious about the diplomatically sensitive trip.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Rep. Judy Chu, the first Chinese American woman elected to Congress, said she has “always supported Taiwan.”\n\nBut when asked whether a Taiwan trip now would send the wrong message, Chu said, “You could look at it two ways. One is that the relationships are very strained right now. But on the other hand, you could say maybe that’s when Taiwan also needs to be shown the strength and the support.”\n\nWhen asked what she thought, she said, “I leave it up to those who are going to make that decision.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Monday.", "authors": ["Eric Cheung Kylie Atwood Alex Rogers Kevin Liptak", "Eric Cheung", "Kylie Atwood", "Alex Rogers", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/politics/migrant-buses-desantis-abbott-what-matters/index.html", "title": "The surprising details behind DeSantis' and Abbott's immigration ...", "text": "A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nRepublican governors are in a cynical competition to outdo each other and send migrants from the US border by bus to New York, Washington, DC, Chicago and, now, by plane to Martha’s Vineyard.\n\nTwo unannounced planes carrying an estimated 50 migrants landed in the wealthy seaside enclave of Massachusetts on Wednesday night, surprising locals.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis claimed credit for the stunt, which took the migrants from Texas, not Florida, and left them without planning on the street.\n\nHis stunt may have been outdone by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who started sending buses of migrants to Washington, DC, back in April and on Thursday morning, left asylum-seekers outside Vice President Kamala Harris’ house at the US Naval Observatory. She’s under intense criticism from immigration hawks for saying on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that she was confident the border is “secure.”\n\nMany rightly pointed out that the political point came at the expense of vulnerable migrants who had already been through a tremendously arduous journey – but some of the details of the transport may surprise you. For starters, many of the migrants were appreciative of the ride.\n\nAre these migrants in the country illegally?\n\nThese stunts by Republican governors are built on the false idea that the migrants are in the country illegally. Technically, those on the buses and planes are asylum-seekers who have been processed by federal immigration authorities and are awaiting court dates.\n\nWhere are the migrants coming from?\n\nWhile most of these migrants crossed the border with Mexico, they are fleeing poor economies and dangerous situations at home in Central America and, increasingly, South America. After crossing the border and claiming asylum, they are released in the US to wait for hearings on their asylum claim.\n\nRELATED: A ‘radical shift’ at the border is making things tougher for Biden\n\nOne person left in Massachusetts, a 45-year-old named Leonel, told The New York Times about his three-month journey from Venezuela through Colombia and Central America. He tried more than once to cross the US border with Mexico before being detained and then released in San Antonio.\n\nIt was there that he was approached and asked if he wanted to go to Massachusetts. It’s not clear if he knew he was headed to a wealthy island community unprepared for the arrivals.\n\nAre they being forced on the buses and planes? No, they are not\n\nAnger at the stunts is in part also fed by the idea that the people are being forced onto buses. That is not true, as CNN’s Gary Tuchman found when he visited a shelter in Eagle Pass, Texas, in August.\n\nHe met asylum-seekers planning to meet up with family and friends already spread around the country. Other migrants coming to the US without somewhere to go were happy for the free trip.\n\nWho is happy for the ride? These people have incredible stories\n\nTuchman talked to a 28-year-old woman named Genesis Figueroa from Venezuela who traveled for a month and a half by foot, bus and boat to get to Eagle Pass with her husband.\n\n“I got very tired. My legs hurt and I got sick,” she told Tuchman in Spanish. “I came down with pneumonia. I was hospitalized for three days in Guatemala.” Watch Tuchman’s report.\n\nHe also talked to cousins traveling from Venezuela; one man’s brother died during the journey after disappearing while they crossed the Rio Grande.\n\nNearly 750 migrants are known to have died at the southern border since October 2021, CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez recently reported.\n\n“We left in search of a dream, but now it’s a very difficult, hard situation,” Luis Pulido told Tuchman in Spanish. He was going to get on a DC-bound bus, hoping to get off in Kentucky to be met by relatives before moving toward Chicago.\n\nWhat happens after the bus ride?\n\nA week after their bus trip, Tuchman found Pulido and his cousin in Chicago, where they had met up with relatives, were sheltered in a small, shared apartment and were looking for work in a restaurant. They likely can’t legally work for at least 180 days, according to rules posted on the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website.\n\nWatch Tuchman’s follow-up.\n\nTuchman told me Pulido and his cousin went to their first appointments, but it was mostly administrative and they are waiting for their next appearance.\n\nIt takes a long time to get a work permit\n\nGetting a work permit can take up to a year, New York City officials told CNN’s Polo Sandoval, who also reported on this issue last month.\n\nHe went to a shelter in Brooklyn and met a young couple from Venezuela, Anabel and Crisman Urbaez, who are seeking asylum.\n\nThey showed him cellphone videos from their two-month, 10-country trek, often on foot, which started in Peru and continued through jungles in Colombia and the Darien Gap linking South and Central America – all with their 6- and 9-year-olds and their dog Max.\n\nHow long does it take to settle an immigration case?\n\nIt takes years. The average time to complete an immigration case is 1,110 days, according to data maintained by Syracuse University. During that time, migrants and asylum-seekers start to build American lives.\n\nHow many will be granted asylum?\n\nLess than half of asylum applications have been granted in recent years, according to Syracuse.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, the rate of denial was over 70%, but during the first year of the Biden administration the grant rate grew to nearly 40%.\n\nWhy are so many coming from Venezuela?\n\nAlvarez wrote recently about the mass exodus from Venezuela. The United Nations says similar numbers of people are fleeing the South American country – which has suffered from years of political repression and economic unrest – as war-torn Ukraine. Around 6.8 million Venezuelans are part of this diaspora.\n\nHow many people have crossed the border this year?\n\nThere have been nearly 2 million border encounters reported by US Customs and Border Protection so far in the fiscal year that ends September 30.\n\nSome of those encounters are repeat crossers. Others have been turned away under a Trump-era Covid-19 policy the Biden administration has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to end. A fraction are seeking asylum.\n\nWhy are officials declaring states of emergency?\n\nOfficials in New York City, Illinois and Washington, DC, have declared emergencies to deal with the buses, and they have complained they have no idea when or where to expect them, and they want warning from Texas, Arizona and now Florida.\n\nTexas has spent more than $12 million and bused around 9,000 migrants up north.\n\nOverall, the buses and now planes have moved thousands of migrants, but it’s a small fraction of the nearly 700,000 pending asylum applications slowly working through the justice system.\n\nThese stories are all unique, but so many of them share the theme of fleeing a home without opportunity and being comparatively happy for the trip inside the US from the border.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Erica Lee/CNN\n\nStallings cut him off.\n\n“She was like, look, this one died, part of their original party. And he died and this one died. The mud is like to up to here to them,” she said Friday in the shade of the parish house porch, pointing to her thigh. “And you see them, they literally have to lift their legs out the mud. They die because they get stuck.”\n\nDuring their whirlwind 44-hour visit this week, migrants like the young Venezuelan woman left an indelible mark on their accidental hosts in this isolated enclave known as a summer playground for former US presidents, celebrities and billionaires.\n\nThey were flown from Texas on Florida’s dime\n\nThe guests, including young children, boarded buses Friday morning around the corner from St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church.\n\nDays of uncertainty on the small island off the coast of Massachusetts and a massive effort by locals to provide for them ended with a new odyssey – a ferry ride and then another bus caravan to temporary housing at Joint Base Cape Cod.\n\nA mother stands outside St. Andrew's church with her child. The migrants were fed lunch with donated food from the community. Jonathan Wiggs/The Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nThe asylum seekers – most of them from Venezuela – had been flown from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard on Wednesday under arrangements made by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – part of a series of moves by Republican governors to transport migrants to liberal cities to protest what they describe as the failure of the federal government to secure the southern border.\n\nMartha’s Vineyard had not been expecting them but a small army of activists mobilized to help people who had become pawns in the contentious debate over America’s broken immigration system.\n\nDeSantis’ move was sharply denounced by the White House, Democratic officials and immigration lawyers who vowed legal action on grounds, they said, the migrants were lured north with promises of work, housing and help with immigration papers and ultimately misled about their final destination.\n\nFlorida’s governor denied the migrants did not know where they were going. He said they had signed a waiver and had been provided with a packet that included a map of Martha’s Vineyard. “It’s obvious that’s where they were going,” he said, adding that the move was voluntary.\n\nLisa Belcastro, winter shelter coordinator for the Harbor Homes nonprofit, was close to tears about an hour after the migrants left the island on Friday, with volunteers beginning to clean up the parish house and church hall where the newcomers slept.\n\nInside St. Andrew's Parish House, where the migrants slept for two nights in the basement. Erica Lee/CNN\n\n“I want them to have a good life,” she said. “I want the journey they experienced and the hardships they experienced to have been worth it for them and their families. I want them to come to America and be embraced. They all want to work. And I just I want their journey to have a happy ending.”\n\n‘No one knew we were coming’\n\nOn Thursday night, a group of young male migrants congregated on the narrow street outside the church, just blocks from the glittering upscale shops, restaurants and art galleries on Main Street in Edgartown. One asylum seeker, in his early 20s, ventured down the street to explore at one point. He asked about the price of a hamburger at a fancy eatery. When told it was $26, he noted that was much more than he earned in a month in Venezuela when he could find work.\n\nThrough a front window in the parish house, young children could be seen in a playroom filled with books and stuffed animals.\n\nJuan Ramirez, who is 24 but appears younger, stood outside the hall of the 123-year-old church – where 18 of the men slept on portable cots and inflatable mattresses under donated blankets for two nights. He teared up talking about the family he left behind in Táchira state in western Venezuela when he embarked on his journey in late July with his phone and $400 in cash.\n\n“My friends thought I was crazy for leaving, that I would never make it. I only want a better future for my family,” he said of his parents, grandparents and his favorite niece back home. “I try but it’s hard not to think about them.”\n\nThe cash was long gone and his phone stolen by the time Ramirez reached northern Mexico and the border with the United States, he said.\n\nRamirez and other migrants said they were released by US immigration authorities with an order to return for a hearing. In San Antonio, they were approached by a woman who offered them a plane ride to a shelter in the Northeast where there would be housing, jobs and assistance with immigration papers. The migrants were put up in a hotel until about 50 of them were assembled for the flight to Massachusetts.\n\nThe migrants gather outside the church on Wednesday, the day they arrived on Martha's Vineyard. Juan Ramirez said he and the other migrants \"came upon kindhearted people who have supported us with everything we need.\" Ray Ewing/Vineyard Gazette/AP\n\n“When we landed no one was waiting for us,” he said. “No one knew we were coming. We realized they had lied to us. But, thankfully, we came upon kindhearted people who have supported us with everything we need.”\n\n‘We’re all in this together’\n\nPedro Luis Torrealba, 37, said he left the Venezuelan capital of Caracas with his wife in mid July. Their two children – ages 6 and 11 – stayed behind with relatives.\n\nThe couple started the roadless crossing on the border between Colombia and Panama – the deadly Darién Gap – with more than 60 other migrants, Torrealba said outside the parish house on Thursday night. Only 22 completed the trek across the 60 miles of jungle and steep mountains, he said. Some fell from cliffs, others were swept away by flood waters.\n\nThose deaths are occurring at a time when a record number of undocumented migrants are overwhelming the US-Mexico border and dying while attempting to cross.\n\nIn Mexico, Torrealba said, the couple and other migrants were briefly abducted by members of the Zetas cartel, a violent drug trafficking organization. When he told them he could not make the extortion payment to allow them to continue, he said, a cartel member used pliers to pull out his two gold teeth.\n\nThey finally made it across the US-Mexico earlier this month. In San Antonio, they encountered a woman who offered them a free flight to a place they had never heard of, along with a promise of immigration assistance, housing and employment. Torrealba did not receive treatment for the injuries to his mouth and jaw until they arrived on Martha’s Vineyard.\n\nAnother Venezuelan, David Bautista, 26, said he left San Cristóbal, the capital city of Táchira state, in late July. More than a month later he crossed the Rio Grande to Eagle Pass, Texas, from the Mexican border city of Piedras Negras. He said he was released by US immigration authorities after 11 days in detention. They gave him papers for an immigration hearing in Washington, DC.\n\nAt a migrant shelter in San Antonio, he too was offered the free flight and the benefits that supposedly came with it – including help with changing the date and location of his immigration hearing.\n\n“I can’t tell you any more because I don’t know any more,” he said. “We’re all lost. We’re all in this together. We just know this is an island somewhere in the United States.”\n\nMartha's Vineyard is known as an affluent vacation spot. The migrants arrived as the offseason gets going. Erica Lee/CNN\n\nStanding next to Bautista, a 52-year-old man named Osmar Cabral, who said he is from Portugal and has been living on Martha’s Vineyard for four months, handed the migrant a folded $100 bill.\n\n“I’ve never met him before,” Cabral said. “But I came here with a friend because I wanted to help. We’re all brothers.”\n\nHis friend, Franklin Pierre, a Venezuelan who has lived on Martha’s Vineyard since 2015 and works for a party rental company, was there to speak with some migrants and offer them advice.\n\n“You have to show up for your immigration hearing or you’ll be deported,” Pierre told Bautista and other young men gathered around him. “You’re arriving here after the busy summer season and work is hard to find. And winter is very cold, sometimes reaching 10 degrees below zero. Imagine that and not having work.”\n\nA sweet gesture\n\nAt one point Thursday night, a group of lawyers who had interviewed the migrants told reporters outside the parish house that they were exploring legal action, claiming that due process and the civil rights of the migrants had been violated.\n\n“This is a human rights violation. This is a constitutional violation,” Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director for Lawyers for Civil Rights Boston, said as volunteers and other supporters applauded. “And we will hold the states and perpetrators accountable to the fullest extent of the law. This will not go unanswered.”\n\nSome passersby recorded the scene on their cell phones.\n\nWorkers behind St. Andrew's help build a house in Edgartown. Franklin Pierre, a Venezuelan who has lived on Martha's Vineyard since 2015, advised the migrants that \"work is hard to find\" after the busy summer season. Erica Lee/CNN\n\nRachel Self, an immigration attorney from Boston, also drew applause.\n\n“We’ve got their backs and they are not alone. And to that end, I would like to specifically thank Trader Fred for donating underwear because Martha’s Vineyard doesn’t have a Walmart down the street,” she said, referring to the migrants and a local retailer who stepped up to help them.\n\nA bystander suddenly tossed a bag of chocolates.\n\n“I brought the candy,” said Matt Frederick, 54, a local who said he works as a waiter and cab driver and lives in his car. He had been handing out bags of candy to the migrants on the street. He said he had spent $100 on the sweets.\n\n“I just feel compassion,” he said, adding that he lives in his car because he refuses to pay the exorbitant rents on the island. “There are lot of people here who are struggling to get by. It’s not all rich people.”\n\nOn Friday, after the migrants had left Martha’s Vineyard, a volunteer with the Harbor Homes nonprofit, Sean O’Sullivan, disassembled the folding cots that 18 of the male migrants slept on in the parish hall.\n\n“The year round community is very strong because you are kind of isolated here – whether it’s the ferry or the bad weather, you’re stuck here,” he said. “We’re used to helping each other. We’re used to dealing with people in need and we’re super happy – like they enriched us, we’re happy to help them on their journey.”\n\nAt the empty parish house hours after the migrants had departed, Charles Rus, the church organist and music director, said the place felt lonely.\n\nCharles Rus, the music director at St. Andrew's, lives on the upper floor of the parish house where the migrants stayed. He said now the place feels lonely. Erica Lee/CNN\n\n“The governor of Florida got it wrong,” he said. “I think he thought we wouldn’t know what to do. And actually people here really give a damn. They really care.”\n\nJackie Stallings said she hopes to visit the migrants at the Cape Cod base, a temporary accommodation.\n\nThe migrants “will be housed in dormitory-style spaces … with separate spaces accommodating both individuals and families,” and families will not be separated, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker’s office said in a news release. They will have access to services including legal, health care, food, hygiene kits, and crisis counseling.\n\n“I kept telling them it was like a dormitory.

Using this as a pretext to smear China is unacceptable.” Instead, China has claimed the facilities are administrative hubs, set up to help Chinese expatriates with tasks like renewing their driver’s licenses. China has also said the offices were a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which had left many citizens locked down in other countries and locked out of China, unable to renew documentation.\n\nWhen approached by CNN last month about Safeguard Defenders’ original allegations, China’s foreign affairs ministry said the overseas stations were staffed by volunteers. However, the organization’s latest report claims one police network it examined had hired 135 people for its first 21 stations.\n\nThe organization also sourced a three-year contract for a worker hired at an overseas station in Stockholm.\n\nUndeclared consular activities outside of a nation’s official diplomatic missions are highly unusual and illegal, unless a host nation has given their explicit consent, and the Safeguard Defenders report claims China’s overseas offices predate the pandemic by several years.\n\nTheir reports have prompted investigations in at least 13 different countries so far and enflamed an increasingly heated diplomatic tussle between China and nations like Canada, home to a large Chinese diaspora.\n\nChina isn’t the only superpower to be accused of employing extrajudicial means to reach targets for law enforcement or for the purposes of political persecution abroad.\n\nRussia, for instance, has on two occasions been accused of deploying lethal chemical and radioactive substances on British soil to try to assassinate its former spies – allegations Russia has always denied.\n\nIn the United States, the CIA was embroiled in a scandal over the extraordinary rendition of terrorism suspects from the streets of Italy to Guantanamo Bay after 9/11.\n\nYet the suggestion of widescale repression of Chinese citizens in foreign countries comes at a pivotal time for a nation contending with its own unrest at home, amid fatigue at the country’s restrictive zero-Covid policy, as leader Xi Jinping’s third term in power gets under way. Last week, China indicated it would loosen some of its pandemic restrictions, three years after the onset of Covid-19.\n\nAs the second largest economy in the world, China has developed a deepening relationship with many of the countries where the new police stations have been allegedly found, raising awkward questions for national governments balancing commercial interests against national security.\n\nChina signs police patrol agreements with nations\n\nItaly, which signed a series of bilateral security deals with China over successive governments since 2015, has kept largely silent during the revelations of alleged activities on its soil.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2018 Italian police conducted multiple joint patrols with Chinese police – first in Rome and Milan – and later in other cities including Naples where at the same time, Safeguard Defenders says, it has found evidence that a video surveillance system was added to a Chinese residential area ostensibly “to effectively deter crimes there.”\n\nIn 2016, an Italian police official told NPR that joint policing would “lead to a wider international cooperation, exchange of information and sharing resources to combat the criminal and terrorist groups that afflict our countries.”\n\nThe NGO determines Italy has hosted 11 Chinese police stations, including in Venice and in Prato, near Florence.\n\nOne ceremony in Rome to mark the opening of a new station was attended by Italian police officials in 2018, according to videos posted on Chinese websites, demonstrating the close ties between police forces in the two countries.\n\nA Chinese national flag is flown at half-staff to mourn the death of former leader Jiang Zemin at the Chinese Embassy in Italy on November 30, 2022.

Jin Mamengni/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this year, the Italian newspaper La Nazione reported local investigations into one of the stations had not unearthed any illegal activity. Il Foglio quoted police chiefs as saying recently that the stations did not present any particular concern as they appeared to be merely bureaucratic.\n\nItaly’s foreign and interior ministries did not reply to questions from CNN.\n\nChina also struck similar joint police patrol agreements with Croatia and Serbia between 2018 and 2019 as part of the nation’s increasing strategic footprint along the path of Xi’s defining foreign policy, dubbed the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nChinese officers were seen on a joint patrol with their Croatian counterparts on the streets of the capital Zagreb as recently as July of this year, Chinese media reported.\n\nA Zagreb police official interviewed by Xinhua said the patrols were essential for “protecting and attracting foreign tourists.”\n\nA 2019 report from Reuters said Chinese officers had joined Serbian officers on patrol in Belgrade to help address the influx of Chinese tourists. One Serbian officer noted the Chinese didn’t have the power to make arrests.\n\nSafeguard Defenders also says Chinese stations were able to get a toehold in South Africa, and in nearby nations thanks to a similar accord with Pretoria, in place for years.\n\nChina began laying the foundations for closer policing ties with South Africa’s law enforcement agencies almost two decades ago, later setting up a network of what are officially called “Overseas Chinese Service Centers” in cooperation with the government of South Africa thanks to successive bilateral security agreements.\n\nChina’s consulate in Cape Town has said the plan “unites all the communities, both South Africans and foreign citizens in South Africa.”\n\nSince its establishment, the framework “has been actively preventing crimes against the community and reducing the number of cases significantly,” the consulate has said while noting that the centers are non-profit associations with no “law enforcement authority.”\n\nSouth African government officials have frequently been featured by Chinese media expressing support for the centers and saying their work has helped police deepen their relationship with Chinese expatriates who live there, according to a 2019 report from the Jamestown China Brief.\n\nCNN reached out to the South African Police Service, but it has not yet received comment.\n\nChina tries to return people against their will\n\nSafeguard Defenders stumbled on the police networks while trying to assess the scale of China’s efforts to persuade some of its people to return to China even against their will, which, based on official Chinese data, could number almost a quarter of a million people around the world during the time Xi has been in power.\n\n“What we see coming from China is increasing attempts to crack down on dissent everywhere in the world, to threaten people, harass people, make sure that they are fearful enough so that they remain silent or else face being returned to China against their will,” said Safeguard Defenders Campaign director Laura Harth.\n\n“It will start with phone calls. They might start to intimidate your relatives back in China, to threaten you, do everything really to coax the targets abroad to come back. If that doesn’t work, they will use covert agents abroad. They will send them from Beijing and use methods such as luring and entrapment,” Harth said.\n\nThe French interior ministry declined to comment on the allegation that a Chinese citizen was coerced into returning home by a Chinese police station in a Paris suburb.\n\nReports spark anger and investigations\n\nThe revelations have prompted vocal outrage in some countries and a conspicuous silence in others.\n\nLast month, FBI Director Christopher Wray told a Homeland Security Committee he was deeply concerned about the revelations. “It is outrageous to think that the Chinese police would attempt to set up shop, you know, in New York, let’s say, without proper coordination. It violates sovereignty and circumvents standard judicial and law enforcement cooperation processes,” he said.\n\nIreland has shut down the Chinese police station found on its territory, while the Netherlands, which has taken similar measures, has a probe underway, as does Spain.\n\nHarth told CNN the organization will likely find more stations in the future. “It’s the tip of the iceberg,” she said.\n\n“China is not hiding what it is doing. They expressly say that they are going to expand these operations so let’s take that seriously.\n\n“This is a moment when countries have to consider that it’s a question of upholding the rule of law and human rights in their countries as much for people from China, as for everyone else around the world,” she said.", "authors": ["Nina Dos Santos"], "publish_date": "2022/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/world/thwaites-doomsday-glacier-sea-level-climate/index.html", "title": "Thwaites 'doomsday glacier' is holding on 'by its fingernails ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAntarctica’s so-called “doomsday glacier” – nicknamed because of its high risk of collapse and threat to global sea level – has the potential to rapidly retreat in the coming years, scientists say, amplifying concerns over the extreme sea level rise that would accompany its potential demise.\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier, capable of raising sea level by several feet, is eroding along its underwater base as the planet warms. In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, scientists mapped the glacier’s historical retreat, hoping to learn from its past what the glacier will likely do in the future.\n\nThey found that at some point in the past two centuries, the base of the glacier dislodged from the seabed and retreated at a rate of 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) per year. That’s twice the rate that scientists have observed in the past decade or so.\n\nThat swift disintegration possibly occurred “as recently as the mid-20th century,” Alastair Graham, the study’s lead author and a marine geophysicist at the University of South Florida, said in a news release.\n\nThe floating ice edge at Thwaites Glacier margin in 2019.

Alexandra Mazur/University of Gothenburg\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier, located in West Antarctica, is one of the widest on Earth and is larger than the state of Florida. But it’s just a faction of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which holds enough ice to raise sea level by up to 16 feet, according to NASA.\n\nAs the climate crisis has accelerated, this region has been closely monitored because of its rapid melting and its capacity for widespread coastal destruction.\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier itself has concerned scientists for decades. As early as 1973, researchers questioned whether it was at high risk of collapse. Nearly a decade later, they found that – because the glacier is grounded to a seabed, rather than to dry land – warm ocean currents could melt the glacier from underneath, causing it to destabilize from below.\n\nIt was because of that research that scientists began calling the region around the Thwaites the “weak underbelly of the West Antarctic ice sheet.”\n\nA workboat recovering the Rán autonomous vehicle in one of the fjords of the Antarctic Peninsula during the expedition to Thwaites Glacier in 2019. Alexandra Mazur/University of Gothenburg\n\nIn the 21st century, researchers began documenting the Thwaites’ rapid retreat in an alarming series of studies.\n\nIn 2001, satellite data showed the grounding line was receding by around 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) per year. In 2020, scientists found evidence that warm water was indeed flowing across the base of the glacier, melting it from underneath.\n\nAnd then in 2021, a study showed the Thwaites Ice Shelf, which helps to stabilize the glacier and hold the ice back from flowing freely into the ocean, could shatter within five years.\n\n“From the satellite data, we’re seeing these big fractures spreading across the ice shelf surface, essentially weakening the fabric of the ice; kind of a bit like a windscreen crack,” Peter Davis, an oceanographer with the British Antarctic Survey, told CNN in 2021. “It’s slowly spreading across the ice shelf and eventually it’s going to fracture into lots of different pieces.”\n\nMonday’s findings, which suggest the Thwaites is capable of receding at a much faster pace than recently thought, were documented on a 20-hour mission in extreme conditions that mapped an underwater area the size of Houston, according to a news release.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See Bill Nye's warning about 'doomsday' glacier (2021) 02:30 - Source: CNN\n\nGraham said that this research “was truly a once in a lifetime mission,” but that the team hopes to return soon to gather samples from the seabed so they can determine when the previous rapid retreats occurred. That could help scientists predict future changes to the “doomsday glacier,” which scientists had previously assumed would be slow to undergo change – something Graham said this study disproves.\n\n“Just a small kick to the Thwaites could lead to a big response,” Graham said.", "authors": ["Angela Fritz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}]}

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Tuesday, July 9th, 2024. This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday, a NATO summit kicks off in a crucial week for Biden. Plus, what a Republican platform says about the party's stance on abortion rights. And a study finds a winner between two major weight loss drugs.\n\n♦\n\nWith his reelection campaign in crisis, President Joe Biden is hosting a pivotal NATO Summit beginning today in Washington, and the meetings have become all the more significant after Russia blasted a children's hospital in Kyiv yesterday and sent missiles in other cities across Ukraine, killing at least 41 civilians. I caught up with USA TODAY White House correspondent Francesca Chambers for more. Hello, Francesca.\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nHi. Thanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThanks for hopping on. So let's just start with this. What is this week's NATO Summit? Can you put it in context for us?\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nWell, this Washington Summit will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the NATO Alliance, and it was founded in Washington, DC. So it's fitting that it's back in Washington, DC this year. And they're facing some really challenging questions as an alliance about what they want the future of NATO to look like.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah, NATO members are meeting the same week that Russia struck a children's hospital in Kyiv killing dozens of people. How do we expect leaders at this summit to address Russia's renewed offensive in that part of Ukraine?\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nThe Speaker of Ukraine's parliament told USA TODAY in an interview on Monday that this was a premeditated and targeted attack on the children's hospital. And he said that if they had had better air defenses, then this may not have happened. And that is one of the key things that the Ukrainians are asking NATO allies for this week, more air defense capabilities as well as ammunition.\n\nAnother thing that they're hoping to get out of allies is language that puts them closer to membership in NATO. Now, that is something that the US says cannot happen until the war with Russia ends. And the US also has concerns about anti-corruption measures that they would like to see Ukraine take. That said, allies were in final negotiations over language that would say that it is irreversible, that Ukraine eventually becomes a member of NATO, provided that they make the necessary reforms.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. So Francesca, are there any other major NATO issues outside Ukraine that are being addressed this week?\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nWell, Ukraine will be the major focus of the NATO alliance, but they'll also address questions about the Indo-Pacific and China's aggression in the South China Sea and whether or not they believe that NATO has a role to play in that theater.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Francesca, following his debate disaster last month, Biden is under major pressure this week to really show some level of competence and coherence as he meets with NATO allies. How crucial is this aspect of the meetings for him?\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nWell, it absolutely is for the American public, but the experts we talked to pointed out that this has been an arena where Biden typically does well. That being said, those same experts pointed out that since his remarks will largely take place behind closed doors or when they're public, they'll be scripted, this is not an area where you would expect him to falter. He will have a press conference on Thursday afternoon, though, where he will take questions from reporters.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Francesca, what's next for Biden the rest of this week as he juggles not just these NATO meetings, but also those with democratic leaders and donors worried about his status in the presidential race?\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nWell, on Monday morning he sent a letter to congressional Democrats saying that he would not be dropping out of the race, Taylor, as he tried to battle the perception that he was politically weakened and couldn't beat former President Donald Trump. In the middle of the week, he'll be meeting with national Union leaders at the AFL-CIO in Washington, DC and then he'll have to turn around and go to the NATO summit, welcome leaders and host a dinner that evening. Then on Friday, he'll turn around and go to Detroit, Michigan for a campaign event. So in addition to hosting the leaders of more than 31 nations in Washington, DC, he has to keep an eye on his political concerns as well.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Francesca Chambers covers the White House for USA TODAY. Thanks as always, Francesca.\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nThanks so much.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nA Republican convention committee endorsed a party platform yesterday that includes a deflection on the issue of abortion rights. While some Republicans wanted to retain language supporting a nationwide ban on abortion, the proposed platform echoes what Donald Trump has said on the campaign trail that states should decide the issue on their own terms. Democrats said the platform and Trump still want to ban abortion by whatever means are available. The platform gives Trump credit for the Supreme Court decision overturning the Roe v. Wade abortion rights ruling, but also reflects the former president's concern that the issue could hurt him and other Republican candidates at the ballot box this fall. The proposed platform reads, \"After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the states and to a vote of the people. We will oppose late term abortion while supporting mothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF.\" You can read more with a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nAmid nationwide workforce challenges, some states have looked to make it easier to work in funeral homes and crematoriums. But after some grizzly incidents, lawmakers in Colorado, Illinois, and Michigan have pushed to tighten control over the industry. One Michigan lawmaker is trying to change state regulations to ensure bodies are refrigerated as they await burial or cremation. The effort follows discoveries of unrefrigerated bodies decomposing in a flint funeral home's garage at a Detroit funeral home storing more than 50 infant and fetal remains without family's permission.\n\nIn Colorado, one law passed in 2022 expands the state's ability to inspect funeral homes and cremator. Another one passed this year requires funeral directors, embalmers, and cremationists to be licensed by the state. They must obtain certain academic degrees or have enough professional experience or certain industry certifications. For nearly half a century, Colorado had some of the nation's most lenient rules for funeral homes. It was previously the only state where a professional license was not required to be a funeral director. You can read more with a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nThe first large head-to-head comparison between next generation weight loss drugs has found a clear advantage to one. I spoke with USA TODAY health reporter Karen Weintraub for more. Karen, good to hear from you as always.\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Karen, what did this study find about the difference in weight loss results between Mounjaro and Ozempic?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nSo this was the first kind of real world study, not a clinical trial. And it found that Mounjaro, which is the Lilly drug, was more effective at weight loss than Ozempic, which is the Novo Nordisk drug with an asterisk applied. And the asterisk is that they only looked at people who were taking it for a diabetes prescription. That didn't necessarily mean the person had diabetes, but it was for diabetes that they received the prescription.\n\nSo this was a real world study, which means that they studied people as they live their lives as opposed to a clinical trial, which a lot of studies are that are very controlled. Those clinical studies, they take certain people, they don't take people with depression for instance. Whereas almost a quarter of the people in this trial had depression. But this study also reflected people who were getting the drug in the real world who tended to be white and female and upper middle class. And so we didn't get as diverse a population as we might get in a clinical trial.\n\nSo it had both the pros and cons of being a real world trial. We see who's getting it in the real world, and we also see who's not getting it, I guess. The people who aren't getting it, as one of my sources pointed out, are in some ways the people who need it the most, the low income people, women of color who have the biggest problem with obesity and with diabetes. And it just shows another example of the disadvantage in this country with medical care.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. So what is the science behind this difference and why might these be the results?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nSo not everybody who took it for diabetes had diabetes. They all had overweight or obesity. And the difference is some people managed to get the prescription even if they didn't have the disease. And those tended to be people who had more advantages, access to doctors who would write prescriptions even if they didn't have the disease, maybe they had some indicators that they were getting sick or something like that. And also the amount of drug that you get is different if you have diabetes or you don't get diabetes for one drug but not the other. So let me explain.\n\nIf you're taking Ozempic, which again is the generic semaglutide and it's the Novo Nordisk drug, semaglutide has different doses for obesity or diabetes. It's a higher dose if you're taking it for weight loss than if you're taking it for diabetes. Tirzepatide, which is the Lilly Drug, Mounjaro or Zepbound now for weight loss is the same dose either way for diabetes or weight loss. So they used the dose that people get for diabetes for both drugs. But for the Novo Nordisk drug, you take a higher dose for weight loss. So in a way, they weren't completely comparing apples to apples. They were comparing the weight loss dose of one drug to the diabetes dose for the other.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThat was a good explainer. So did the drug makers themselves respond to this study?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nOne of them did. One of them didn't. The one who was defensive about it did Novo Nordisk made that point that I just made, which is that the dosage wasn't quite an apples to apples comparison. Eli Lilly kept their mouth closed because they came out looking better.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Karen, a lot of people started taking these medications over the past year, a lot of them then stopped taking them. Why might that be? Is this a question of side effects or are there other factors at play?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nA number of reasons. One clearly is side effects. Both of the drugs have similar side effects. A lot of people feel really nauseous, vomit, have gastrointestinal problems on these drugs. Some people have said to me, \"Look, that's a feature, not a bug. That's why it makes you lose weight, is because it upsets your stomach and you don't need as much.\" But it's also a factor of the medical oversight. If you have a doctor or caregiver who's keeping very close tabs on you who's really helping manage those side effects, they can be managed. But if somebody kind of writes you a prescription and says, \"Here you go. Goodbye\" and never pays any attention to you or ramps you up too quickly on these drugs, you really do need to ramp up slowly and carefully. It can lead to a lot of unpleasant side effects, and so people will stop because of that.\n\nAlso, access is a huge issue. These drugs have been in very, very short supply since they were approved. Novo Nordisk has somewhat solved the supply at the highest doses. So people who have started a long time ago who are already at the highest doses may be okay at this point. But starting a new now is very hard. And a Lilly drug, the Tirzepatide, is really very hard to get.\n\nAnd then people with insurance, if you have insurance that pays for it and you don't have to pay out of pocket the thousand dollars or plus a month, that's great. Some people will have coverage if they have type 2 diabetes. They may be able to get coverage, but if it's solely for weight loss, they may not be able to get coverage. Or if their insurance changes, they might have coverage one month and not next. And the problem with these drugs is you really don't want to start them unless you're pretty sure you're going to be able to continue them. It's worse for your health to lose weight and then regain that weight, so called yo-yo dieting is actually more dangerous than being overweight or obese to begin with. So that's kind of a cautionary note for people.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, interesting stuff. Karen Weintraub covers health for USA TODAY.

The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea – in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin’s decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky’s government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-sunday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Ukraine-Russia delegations to meet for talks Monday", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nA Ukrainian delegation will meet with a Russian delegation on Monday for talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border following assurances from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nThe announcement came Sunday as Ukrainian forces engaged in fierce fighting with Russian troops in multiple cities across Ukraine.\n\nRussia is facing universal condemnation and increased sanctions from Western powers over Moscow’s unprovoked assault on Ukraine, now in its fourth day.\n\nUkraine’s Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin said the talks would take place Monday morning local time.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had earlier said he would be willing to hold talks with Russia but not in Belarus, pointing out that Russian military actions are being launched from that country.\n\nOn Sunday, Zelensky said in a brief televised statement that he doesn’t expect much from the meeting.\n\n“I will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus. Belarus is an ally of Russia and has played an important role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelensky’s office said Lukashenko had called his Ukrainian counterpart on Sunday. “The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,” Zelensky’s office said.\n\n“Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, meeting and return.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s deterrence forces – which include nuclear arms – onto their highest state of alert on Sunday.\n\n“Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials.\n\nPutin also said the Western sanctions placed on Russia were unlawful.\n\nA senior US official told CNN that the new development is Putin’s latest attempt to manufacture threats to justify aggression.\n\n“The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons,” said the official. “This is yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step.”\n\nAs the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes and dozens of civilians have been killed, according to UN figures.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing that Putin’s order to put Russian deterrent forces on alert was a “direct threat to us” and an effort to raise pressure on the Ukrainian delegation at Monday’s scheduled talks.\n\nKuleba indicated that Ukrainian officials are willing to “listen to what Russia has to say” but will not give in to pressure. “We will tell them what we think of this,” he said. “And what we are ready to discuss is how to stop the war and the occupation of our territories. Full stop.”\n\nKuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin’s inner circle do not agree with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.”\n\nFighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv\n\nEarlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.\n\nAnd fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. “Do not leave your shelters!” he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.\n\n“Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,” an assessment by the UK’s Ministry of Defence said.\n\nUkrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city – home to about 1.4 million people – for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.\n\nBut despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.\n\nOthers are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations “reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed” in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added.\n\nIn a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: “The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.”\n\nBut Zelensky rejected this, saying: “They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.”\n\nUkraine is “documenting their crimes,” he said, adding: “This is terror.”\n\nRussian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia’s offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and “buses with children” – actions he labeled as “war crimes.”\n\n“The Russian government doesn’t understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,” he added.\n\nRussian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain’s Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize “the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,” another British assessment said Sunday.\n\nRussia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN.\n\nThe US continues to see Russian forces facing “stiff resistance” and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues.\n\nThe official noted that the Russians are having a “little bit more success” in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them.\n\nUkrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nOn Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion.\n\n“Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,” Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. “Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades.”\n\nWithout providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were “considerably lower” than those by Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air.\n\nSo far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine’s border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces – despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion.\n\nA NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems.\n\n“They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,” said the official.\n\nAsked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. “They are way behind schedule,” the official said. “This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful.”\n\nBut the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk “were completely blocked” by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control.\n\nMaj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile regiment surrendered in the Kharkiv region and 471 Ukrainian servicemen were captured.\n\nCNN could not immediately verify those claims.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Sunday that checkpoints would be set up across the country to detect Russian troops and make their movements more difficult.\n\nAccusations of war crimes\n\nConcerns are now growing that Russia may look to deploy indiscriminate battlefield weaponry in civilian areas in an attempt to decisively crush Ukrainian forces.\n\nA CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThermobaric weapons have been used in Chechnya, with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch, and their use has been condemned by number of non-governmental organizations.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russia moves in heavy flamethrower weapon 01:02 - Source: CNN\n\nAlthough Russia has claimed it is not targeting civilian infrastructure, an increasing body of evidence on the ground suggests otherwise.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said Sunday that nine civilians, including one child, had been killed in Kyiv since the invasion began, as well as 18 military and territorial defense personnel. There are currently no Russian troops in the capital, he added. The mayor extended a strict curfew across the city until Monday morning.\n\nAccording to a local hospital, a six-year-old boy died in heavy gunfire in a western district of Kyiv on Saturday evening.\n\nA woman was killed after a nine-story residential building in the eastern city of Kharkiv was hit by “enemy artillery” on Saturday night, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.\n\nPolish officials said Sunday that 187,000 people had entered Poland from Ukraine since the invasion began on Thursday.\n\nA defiant Ukraine\n\nAs the battle continues, a defiant Zelensky has released a series of videos from the streets of Kyiv urging citizens to defend their country.\n\nOfficials armed reservists with 18,000 guns and ammunition in Kyiv alone, and Ukrainian TV has broadcast instructions for making Molotov cocktails. Ukrainian males ages 18 to 60 are banned from leaving the country.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Molotov cocktails and personal arms.

This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,” he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military on Sunday claimed successful attacks by its Turkish-made force of drones against Russian forces. The Armed Forces of Ukraine released footage showing the destruction of armor by a drone and said that it was carried out against a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile system.\n\nValerii Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, said the drone attack took place near the town of Malyn, about 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) northwest of Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian government began receiving the Bayraktar TB2 drones from Turkey last year.\n\nWestern powers have imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia since Thursday, with more under consideration. On Saturday, the United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and “paralyze” the assets of Russia’s central bank.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russian state TV is covering the war very differently 02:24 - Source: CNN\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed Sunday that “very soon the Russian leadership will feel what a high price they will have to pay” for the invasion of Ukraine, as he announced he would raise German military funding during a special session with lawmakers.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed Sunday that the European Union is shutting down its airspace to Russia.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered and Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the European Union.

Hours later, Russia warned the United States that it would fire on weapon shipments to Ukraine, raising the risk of direct confrontation between Moscow and a NATO country.\n\nA number of major cities are under pressure as Russian strikes hit civilian structures. Smoke rose east of the river in Dnipro early on Saturday where CNN journalists felt at least two explosions and saw the cloudy remnants of what looked like anti-aircraft fire.\n\nA large swath of Makariv, a village 30 miles west of Kyiv, has sustained significant damage from apparent Russian airstrikes.\n\nCNN geolocated and verified the authenticity of photos, posted to social media Saturday, which show major damage to apartment complexes, schools and a medical facility. One of the more stark images from Makariv shows a large hole in the northern wall of an apartment building from a military strike. Many of the buildings in the photos have sustained damage on their northern facades, evidence that points to military strikes that hit them as being Russian.\n\nIn Chernihiv, some 100 kilometers north of Kyiv, local landmark Hotel Ukraine was hit overnight. “I am here now. There is no hotel anymore,” Vyacheslav Chaus, head of Chernihiv region administration, said Saturday.\n\nThe northern city, which is close to the Belarus border, has been surrounded by Russian forces for more than a week and video from the city showed the collapsed floors of the hotel as well as widespread damage from missiles and airstrikes.\n\nChaus said civilians were dying from the strikes, which brought down the city’s electricity network. “Many people are being injured. The enemy shells civilian infrastructure, where there is no military,” he said, saying the city has “no electricity, almost no water, gas, and heat.”\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has repeatedly claimed that Russian forces are not targeting civilians.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Saturday address the whole country was now a front line. “A few small towns just don’t exist anymore. And this is a tragedy. They are just gone. And people are also gone.”\n\nZelensky said negotiations to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “must begin with a ceasefire,” adding that Ukraine has lost about 1,300 troops as of Saturday. CNN has been unable to independently verify these numbers.\n\nLater Saturday, Zelensky said that he was grateful for international support but urged allies to provide more aid.\n\n“I keep reiterating to our allies and friends abroad; they have to keep doing more for our country, for Ukrainians and Ukraine. Because it is not only for Ukraine, but it is for all of Europe,” he said. “The evil which purposefully targets peaceful cities and ambulance vans and explodes hospitals will not stop with just one country if they have the strength to keep going.”\n\nThe US and NATO say they’re taking steps to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian troops, and they have continued to provide Ukraine with security assistance, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons. But the US and NATO have also tried to avoid being drawn into an outright conflict with Russia. US President Joe Biden emphasized that point on Friday, that the US will not send ground troops into Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO.\n\n“We will not fight the third world war in Ukraine,” Biden said after reiterating the US’ full support to its NATO allies and promising that the US will defend “every inch” of NATO territory.\n\n“I want to be clear though, we are going to make sure that Ukraine has the weapons to defend themselves from an invading Russian force. And we will send money and food aid to save Ukrainians’ lives,” he added.\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on Saturday warned the US against transferring weapons to Ukraine, saying convoys with foreign weapons would be considered “legitimate targets.”\n\n“We warned the United States that pumping Ukraine with weapons from a number of countries orchestrated by them is not just a dangerous move, but these are actions that turn the corresponding convoys into legitimate targets,” Ryabkov said Saturday on the Russian state-run Channel One, according to state-owned RIA Novosti news agency.\n\nDetermined resistance\n\nIn Ukraine, Russia has faced defiance from the public in the past two weeks. On Saturday, several hundred people swarmed the city hall in the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol following the detention of its mayor, Ivan Fedorov, by armed men the day before.\n\nShortly after Fedorov’s detention, the Russian-backed Luhansk regional prosecutor claimed Fedorov had committed terrorism offenses, allegations that Zelensky called a “crime against democracy” on Saturday.\n\nThe Zaporozhye regional administration said Saturday a new mayor had been installed. Galina Danilchenko, a former member of the Melitopol city council, was introduced as the acting mayor on local TV, according to a statement from the regional administration posted on Telegram. In her televised statement, Danilchenko said that her “main task is to take all necessary steps to get the city back to normal.”\n\nShe claimed there were people still in Melitopol who would try to destabilize “the situation and provoke a reaction of bad behavior.”\n\n“I ask you to keep your wits about you and not to give in to these provocations,” she said. “I appeal to the deputies, elected by the people, on all levels. Since you were elected by the people, it is your duty to care about the well-being of your citizens.”\n\nIn Kyiv, Russia’s advance has faced stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces. On Saturday, the UK’s Ministry of Defence’s latest intelligence assessment said the bulk of Russian ground forces were about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the center of the Ukrainian capital.\n\nIn Berestyanka -- 10 miles west of the airbase -- a number of fuel trucks and what Maxar says appear to be multiple rocket launchers are seen positioned in a field near trees. Maxar Technologies\n\nMaxar satellite imagery taken on Thursday showed that the 40-mile Russian column northwest of Kyiv had largely dispersed and regrouped. But the intelligence assessment warned, “this is likely to support a Russian attempt to encircle the city. It could also be an attempt by Russia to reduce its vulnerability to Ukrainian counter attacks, which have taken a significant toll on Russian forces.”\n\nThe north and northeastern cities of Chernihiv and Sumy, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and Mariupol in the south, remain encircled by Russian forces, the ministry added.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official in the southern region of Kherson, now in Russian control, has said that the “occupiers” are pressing the regional council to agree to a referendum on the area’s “independence” from Ukraine. There’s been no word from the Russian side about any referendum plans.\n\nSimilar referendums were held after Russian-backed separatists took control in 2014 of parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. People’s Republics were later declared in both regions.\n\nUkraine’s state-operated nuclear energy company said Saturday that Russian officials had arrived at Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhya, demanding to take control of the facility.\n\nZaporizhzhya has been occupied by Russian forces for more than a week now, with Energoatom previously claiming its employees had been forced to work at “gunpoint.” Chernobyl nuclear power plant is also under the control of Russian forces.\n\nDespite the onslaught, Zelensky claimed on Saturday that Ukrainian forces are inflicting the “biggest blow to Russia’s army in decades,” saying that 31 Russian tactical battalion groups had lost capability, and more than 360 Russian tanks have been lost.\n\nZelensky added that groups of Russian troops were surrendering to Ukrainian forces, but that Russia is now recruiting fighters, reservists, conscripts, and mercenaries to “outnumber” Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia’s losses include Major General Andriy Kolesnikov, the third Russian general to have been killed by Ukrainian forces, a Western defense official confirmed on Friday. He was commander of the Eastern Military District, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense’s website, and the Western official noted for context that three Russian general staff officers were killed during the whole Syrian conflict.\n\nDeteriorating conditions\n\nAs Russia sustains losses, its bombardment of the country continues to degrade living conditions in several areas. Officials are now racing to send aid and evacuate citizens from encircled cities.\n\nUkrainian officials announced a fresh attempt to secure at least 13 evacuation corridors from different cities, despite reporting that only a few civilians could leave the previous day.\n\nAddressing the besieged city of Mariupol, Zelensky said Saturday that Ukrainian forces would guarantee a ceasefire along an evacuation corridor so supplies could enter, and civilians can leave.\n\nUkrainian emergency employees and volunteers carry an injured pregnant woman from a maternity hospital that was damaged by shelling in Mariupol, Ukraine, Wednesday, March 9, 2022.

Smoke appeared to be rising from an apartment complex across the street. The roofs of warehouses down the street also appeared to have large holes from military strikes.\n\nWithin the apartment complex, several buildings seemed to have sustained significant damage. A debris field was seen surrounding some of the buildings with a large smoke plume.\n\nJust northwest of the gas station, an additional satellite image showed impact craters dotting a snow-covered field. Vehicle tread marks were also seen. Just more than a mile south, in an industrial area in the Primorskyi neighborhood, a large fire was seen raging.\n\nThere was some good news amid the destruction.

And it’s so cold there right now so they can’t get warm,” Liubchenko said.\n\nThe fighting has displaced around 2 million Ukrainians in the country, the UN said Friday, and 2.5 million people have fled its borders.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Olga Voitovych Tara John", "Tim Lister", "Olga Voitovych", "Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/oldest-black-church-excavation-project-reaj/index.html", "title": "Colonial Williamsburg tells the story of early American settlers. But in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBeneath the asphalt parking lot of America’s largest living history museum, gravesites linked to one of the nation’s oldest Black churches remained hidden for decades until last year.\n\nArchaeologists in Williamsburg, Virginia, are now excavating three burials at the original location of the historic 18th century First Baptist Church, launching a monthslong process to unearth information about who was buried there and what kind of lives they led.\n\nLast month, the archaeology team fully excavated the first burial of an individual in a wooden coffin and extracted bone for a DNA sample to be analyzed alongside analysis of the skeletal remains. The archaeology team is now working to prepare the second grave for excavation.\n\nFor the Black descendants of residents in Williamsburg, this effort is long overdue. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Black residents made up more than half the town’s population and members of the church included abolitionists, teachers and farmers.\n\nSince 1956, the church’s foundation has been covered by a parking lot owned by Colonial Williamsburg after the museum bought and demolished the structure.\n\nAnd it was largely forgotten. Throughout the years, visitors to Colonial Williamsburg parked their cars and walked over the foundation. Children would exit school buses on field trips to the 301 acre site dedicated to preserving the history of the Virginia town as it existed in the 18th century to “feed the human spirit by sharing America’s enduring story.”\n\nBut that history was not inclusive, historians and residents said.\n\nThe experiences of Black community members in the colonial era have often been left out, said Connie Harshaw, the president of the Let Freedom Ring Foundation, dedicated to preserving the church’s history. First Baptist Church being buried all these years is a testament to this erasure of history, she said.\n\n“It was an asphalt parking lot for more than 60 years with no regard to the people who lived there and who died and were buried there, whose names we don’t even know,” Harshaw said.\n\nThe journey to uncover First Baptist Church’s history began in 2020 with a partnership between Colonial Williamsburg and the non-profit foundation. Talks began in the spring of 2020, and digging began in the summer of 2020, Harshaw said.\n\n‘A lot of reckoning to do’\n\nThe 1856 First Baptist Church structure in Williamsburg, Virginia, during the 20th century. courtesy Colonial Williamsburg\n\nAlvene Conyers remembers spending nearly every Sunday at First Baptist Church as a little girl.\n\nThe 75-year-old Williamsburg native and member of the church’s descendant community said knowing the church’s foundation was covered by a parking lot was painful. Her mother, a seamstress, would knit her only the best attire to wear to First Baptist Church, with outfits including corduroy jumpers and ruffle-collared blouses to wear with patent leather shoes.\n\n“I felt devalued and dismissed and just unappreciated as a human being,” Conyers said. “Colonial Williamsburg has a lot of reckoning to do.”\n\nThe excavation project is the flagship initiative in Colonial Williamsburg’s efforts to better tell and represent the stories of Black Americans living in Williamsburg in the colonial era, said Jack Gary, Colonial Williamsburg’s director of archaeology. He said the fact that the church was covered by a parking lot is a tragic part of the project’s journey, but hopes the excavation begins to remedy some harm.\n\n“We’ve ripped up that parking lot and it will never go back,” Gary said.\n\nFirst Baptist Church was founded in 1776 by free and enslaved Black people in Williamsburg, Virginia’s colonial capital. Members secretly gathered under trees at a plantation to engage in song and prayer, defying state laws that prohibited Black people from congregating in large groups.\n\nBy 1818 there was a building on the lot, referred to on a tax document as the Baptist Meeting House.\n\nThe original structure of First Baptist Church was destroyed by a tornado in 1834. Over two decades later, in 1856, a new brick church on the site of the first building was constructed and remained there until 1956, when Colonial Williamsburg bought and demolished the church as part of an expansion project, placing a parking lot over the historic location. Payment for the property was used to construct the congregation’s current church that sits about a mile away from the original site.\n\nToday, the church remains active and is on the US National Register of Historic Places. Harshaw said people travel from all over to visit the church, with visitors coming as far as Beirut and Kenya.\n\n“It’s no longer simply a community church. It’s a national treasure and everybody’s coming to see it,” Harshaw said.\n\nFrom demolition to dedication\n\nColonial Williamsburg archaeological field technician DéShondra Dandridge works at the excavation site of First Baptist Church's original permanent location in September 2020. courtesy Colonial Williamsburg\n\nFollowing a change in leadership, Harshaw said the current president of Colonial Williamsburg reached out to her in March 2020 after she previously met with former Colonial Williamsburg leadership and criticized the museum for failing to highlight the stories of the Black residents.\n\nAfter having conversations with the president about telling a more complete story about Williamsburg history that centered on the Black experience and the church’s cultural and historical significance, Harshaw said the excavation project commenced soon after when the parking lot was ripped up in August 2020.\n\nLast year, following about a year of excavating the site, archaeologists discovered the church’s original permanent structure, a 16- by 20-foot brick foundation atop a layer of soil that dates back to the early 1800s, according to the museum. Archaeologists also identified multiple gravesites.\n\nAlthough Harshaw said she had no idea there were intact burials on the site, she said some other members of the descendant community were ultimately not surprised when the plots were discovered last year. Older members of the church long spoke about their ancestors being buried at the church based on oral histories passed down generations.\n\nJohnette Weaver, a Williamsburg native and member of the church’s descendent community, said she recalls hearing stories from a church elder about their great grandfather being buried at the original church site.\n\n“For Black people, a lot of our history is oral,” Weaver said. “It doesn’t mean that it’s untrue, it just means it wasn’t written anywhere or inscribed anywhere.”\n\nTo date, the Colonial Williamsburg archaeology team has identified a total of 41 burial shafts. Of these burials, only one is marked, by an upside down wine bottle at the foot of the grave. Gary speculates that this grave may have belonged to a church leader or someone of prominence in Williamsburg’s colonial community.\n\nThis marked grave will be the last of the three graves to be excavated and analyzed as part of the project.\n\nWilliamsburg's historic First Baptist Church, present day. courtesy First Baptist Church\n\nAnthony Pinn, a humanities professor at Rice University, said the discovery of the burials is significant given that under White supremacy in the Antebellum South, Black people were exploited and reduced to their physical bodies’ ability to provide labor. White supremacy also worked to deny Black people family connections and social ties under slavery, Pinn added.\n\n“Burial within the context of the Black church was not simply a recognition of death, but it was a recognition of life, that this person was substantive, had impact on the world, and that they had to be recognized and celebrated for who they were in a much fuller sense,” Pinn said.\n\nGary said accurately telling the story of one of the nation’s oldest Black churches is at the heart of the project. Following the excavation of each burial, he said the next step is to conduct both DNA and osteological analysis on the skeletal remains to gain more insight into who was buried at the church.\n\nThe DNA analysis, to be conducted by the University of Connecticut, is anticipated to uncover information about the three individuals’ skin tone, eye color and even their propensity for certain diseases. The analysis of the bones, to be performed at the College of William & Mary’s Institute for Historical Biology, is expected to show how old these individuals were when they died as well as their place of origin, sex, quality of life and more.\n\nMembers of the church’s descendant community eventually hope to submit their DNA to assess biological kinship to those buried at the church. At the conclusion of the project, the remains will be reinterred.\n\nGary said he expects this phase of the excavation project to take about a year, between the actual act of excavating the graves as well as analyzing and reinterring them. He said Colonial Williamsburg also hopes to reconstruct the church with historically accurate dimensions and furnishings to replicate how the church looked in the colonial era by 2026, the 250th anniversary of the church.\n\n“We’re going to put it back exactly where it was,” Gary said. “It’ll be sitting in its exact footprint, as it was the day the congregation built it in the early 1800s.”\n\nGary also said the input of the descendant community will be at the center of how Colonial Williamsburg proceeds with the project, including how to commemorate the site on a long-term basis and how they would like to see the remains reinterred.\n\nHarshaw said she hopes the project signals the importance of telling complete and accurate histories that reflect a diverse set of experiences.\n\n“We are really hoping that we will be an example for the nation,” Harshaw said. “If we can do it in the Commonwealth of Virginia, where you can drive up down I-95 on any given day and see Confederate flags, we are hoping that the rest of the nation will look to see what we’re doing and say ‘you know what, we probably need to do something about the fact that this place looked very different, or there’s a very different and more important and significant story,’ because the bottom line is this: We have a shared history.”", "authors": ["Jacquelyne Germain"], "publish_date": "2022/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-thursday-intl/index.html", "title": "Peace in Europe 'shattered' as Russia invades Ukraine | CNN", "text": "Moscow and Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nRussia has launched an unprecedented military assault on Ukraine by land, air and sea that has already left dozens dead, prompting Western leaders to condemn Moscow and vow unity with Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian ministers said the Kremlin had begun a “full-scale invasion” of their country, and the fighting appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s.

He went on to establish a PR firm and also ran an educational publisher, Hotcourses, which “puts prospective students in contact with universities, colleges and other educational institutions”, said the BBC.\n\nIn 2005 he was elected as Conservative MP for the safe seat of South West Surrey, replacing former cabinet minister Virginia Bottomley. He served as shadow disabilities minister and shadow culture secretary.\n\nOnce the Tories were in office, he was named culture secretary and then later promoted to health secretary.\n\n‘Most unpopular’ health secretary\n\nHis six years in the post made him the longest-running health secretary – outlasting even the NHS founder, Aneurin Bevan. He was also “very possibly” the “most unpopular” health secretary, said The Times.\n\nIndeed, noted The Guardian, his longevity in the post was “all the more remarkable” given that his reign was “marked by a long battle with junior doctors, widespread cuts and parliamentary backlash over misleading pledges on NHS funding”.\n\nHunt told the BBC’s Sunday Morning show in May that in his new;y published book - Zero: Eliminating Unnecessary Deaths in a Post-Pandemic NHS - he has “tried to be honest about the things I succeeded in doing and the things I wasn’t successful in”. He denied that the NHS was on the brink of collapse, but said the situation then was “very, very serious” with doctors and nurses “run ragged by the intensity of work”.\n\nHowever, healthcare staff accused Hunt of ignoring serious NHS staff shortages as health secretary and driving medics out of the profession.\n\nThey said Hunt failed to take sufficient action to boost recruitment while in the job between 2012 and 2018. “For years, Jeremy Hunt and other ministers ignored the staffing crisis,” Sara Gorton, the head of health at Unison, the UK’s largest health union, told The Guardian.\n\nSecond time unlucky\n\nAfter a stint as foreign secretary, Hunt ran for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 2019 when Theresa May stepped down. However, he was beaten comfortably by Boris Johnson, who won with 92,153 votes to Hunt’s 46,656.\n\nIn the wake of his defeat, Hunt said the fact he had voted Remain in the European Union referendum was “a hurdle” he was “never able to overcome” in his leadership bid.\n\nAs a backbencher under Johnson, he was elected as the new chair of the health and social care select committee in January 2020, succeeding Sarah Wollaston. This position offered him the chance to rebuild his public profile and popularity.\n\nBefore the leadership race got underway following Johnson’s resignation in July, Hunt had dropped a series of hints that he could run for the Tory Party’s top job again before the 2024 election. He was ultimately knocked out in the first round of this summer’s leadership race and became a vocal backer of Sunak.\n\nTeam Truss\n\nWith Truss’s premiership still only a few weeks old, Kwarteng’s dismissal was described by the BBC’s political editor Chris Mason as “genuinely astonishing”.\n\nSome Conservative ministers had argued that Truss’s second chancellor should have “instant credibility, to steady the markets”, Mason continued. With “substantial government experience”, said The New Statesman, “and pedigree in the world of business”, could Hunt be “the Tory saviour?”\n\nWith the prime minister “desperately clinging on to her role”, said the Mirror, what’s certain is Hunt will be “thrown in at the deep end”.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Peter Weber", "Harriet Marsden", "Richard Windsor", "Sorcha Bradley"], "publish_date": "2022/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/uk/boris-johnson-replacement-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Conservative leadership race: Who might replace Boris Johnson as ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nThe race to replace British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ramping up, with 11 candidates declaring their intention to run, many on platforms of lowering taxes and promises to clean up government following Johnson’s crisis-plagued leadership.\n\nSir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative party backbenchers announced on Monday that a new leader would be announced on September 5, the same day that the British parliament returns from its summer recess. He also said that the candidate list would close on Monday, before a first round of voting on Wednesday. The list will then be whittled down to two, and the party’s grassroot members will be given the final say.\n\nJohnson announced on Thursday he would step down, after nearly 60 lawmakers and government officials resigned over his handling of a series of scandals, including illegal gatherings held at his Downing Street office in defiance of coronavirus lockdown rules and his failure to act on sexual misconduct allegations against his deputy chief whip.\n\nNow, with the government in tatters, bookmakers and much of Britain are speculating about his likely successor. A slew of contenders have thrown their hat into the ring – from household names to lesser-known Conservative members of parliament.\n\nAmong those to announce their candidacy are an Iraqi Kurdish refugee, the children of Indian and Pakistani immigrants and several women – reflecting efforts by the Conservative Party to field more ethnically diverse candidates for Parliament in recent years.\n\nAny candidates who run for the leadership will go through rounds of voting by Conservative lawmakers until only two remain – at which point Conservative Party members nationwide will vote. The winner will be the new party leader – and prime minister.\n\nHere’s a look at the possible contenders.\n\nShow More - (Show Less)\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nBritain's former Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/Reuters\n\nThe former chancellor formally announced he was standing to succeed Johnson in a campaign video on Friday, which began with the story of his Indian parents, who both emigrated to the UK from East Africa. “It was Britain, our country, that gave them and millions like them the chance of a better future,” he said. “I want to lead this country in the right direction.”\n\nSunak was Johnson’s presumed successor for several months after he won praise for overseeing Britain’s initial financial response to the Covid-19 pandemic. But he has suffered several of his own scandals while in government.\n\nHis stock sank earlier this year after revelations that he broke Covid regulations to attend the prime minister’s birthday party on June 19, 2020, for which he later apologized “unreservedly.”\n\nHis financial and legal affairs came under scrutiny this spring following reports his wife had non-domicile status in the UK – meaning she was not liable to pay tax on overseas income – and that he held a US green card while serving as minister.\n\nHis popularity has also taken a beating in recent weeks as Britain has suffered the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. Sunak has struggled to keep down spiraling inflation and has been criticized by opposition parties for what they call a slow and inadequate series of financial measures. Among the economic woes facing Britons after Sunak’s time as the UK’s chief financial minister: real wages dropping to their lowest levels in more than 21 years and inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in May.\n\nBut he is still among the bookmakers’ odds-on favorites to take Johnson’s job.\n\nSajid Javid\n\nFormer Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThe former health secretary, whose resignation set off a wave of departures from Johnson’s government, officially announced his candidacy on Sunday.\n\n“Whether it’s the cost of living or it’s low levels of growth, for me, that’s our most immediate challenge… You need someone with an economic plan from day one,” he said, adding that his economic plan would have two prongs: short-term measures to help people meet cost-of-living challenges and a longer-term plan for tax reform.\n\nPosting on Twitter on Sunday, Javid said: “The next Prime Minister needs integrity, experience, and a tax-cutting plan for economic growth. That’s why I’m standing.”\n\nThe statement echoed Javid’s resignation speech in the House of Commons in which he said that something was “fundamentally wrong” with government.\n\nThose who support Javid’s candidacy hope that he will be credited for triggering Johnson’s ultimate ouster, having been the first cabinet minister to resign – though Sunak followed him minutes later.\n\nThe MP has twice run for party leadership in the past – in 2016, after the Brexit referendum, and in 2019, when Johnson was ultimately elected. He served as chancellor from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHis family immigrated from Pakistan to the UK in the 1960s, and his father worked as a bus driver.\n\nLiz Truss\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe foreign secretary made her leadership ambitions known in The Telegraph on Sunday. At the heart of her leadership bid is a pledge to cut taxes “from day one,” to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nLiz Truss became the chief negotiator with the European Union on the UK’s Brexit deal in December 2021 and has held multiple cabinet positions. Since voting Remain in 2016, she has since become one of the loudest Euroskeptic voices in the government, which many have chalked up to her desire for the top job.\n\nShe has a formidable and dedicated team around her – some of whom previously worked in Number 10 – which has been producing slick videos and photos of her looking thoroughly statesmanlike. She has apparently attempted to channel former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, wearing a headscarf while driving a tank, and her role in fronting the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also heightened her public profile.\n\nIn her comment piece in The Telegraph, she highlighted her foreign policy expertise, writing: “As Foreign Secretary, I have helped to lead the international response to Putin’s war in Ukraine and delivered a tough sanctions package that has led the world, by imposing real pain on Putin and the Kremlin.”\n\nTruss is popular among Conservative members, who would pick the eventual winner of a contest. But Johnson’s downfall could simultaneously tarnish anyone in his cabinet, meaning Conservative voters could turn to a backbencher to take the mantle.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nBritain's Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt. Aaron Chown/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nThe trade minister, one of the bookmakers’ favorites to replace Johnson, announced her bid for the leadership on Sunday. A poll of party members published July 4 by website Conservative Home put her as the second favorite choice, behind the current defense secretary Ben Wallace, who has ruled himself out of the race.\n\nPenny Mordaunt first entered parliament in 2010 and later joined the cabinet under Theresa May, serving as international development and defense secretary.\n\nAfter last month’s confidence vote, Mordaunt declined to comment on whether she backed Johnson, raising eyebrows among Westminster observers when she said: “I didn’t choose this prime minister.”\n\nAnnouncing her interest in the top job, she said the party “leadership needs to become a little less about the leader and a lot more about the ship.”\n\nMordaunt, who in 2019 became the first woman to serve as defense minister, invoked Thatcher in her statement, saying the former Conservative leader “was remarkable for not just what she did but the speed she did it.”\n\n“She had a vision and a plan. So do I,” she added.\n\nTom Tugendhat\n\nCommittee chairman Tom Tugendhat. Niall Carson/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nA former British military officer who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat has been one of Johnson’s most robust critics and has called for the Conservative Party to drop its focus on “divisive politics.”\n\nLaunching his leadership bid on Thursday in The Telegraph newspaper, Tugendhat wrote: “I have served before – in the military, and now in Parliament. Now I hope to answer the call once again as prime minister. It’s time for a clean start. It’s time for renewal.”\n\nHe outlined his vision for tackling the cost of living crisis, reducing taxes and investing in neglected regions of the UK.\n\nDespite not having any cabinet or shadow cabinet experience, Tugendhat has impressed colleagues with his oratory skills and seriousness, most notably when he spoke about the fall of Afghanistan. He entered parliament in 2015 after serving in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nSome key centrist Conservatives have already been throwing their support behind the relative wildcard, but some worry that his experience is too focused on foreign affairs.\n\nNadhim Zahawi\n\nBritain's newly appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi. Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess than two days after he was appointed by Johnson to the role of chancellor, replacing Sunak, Nadhim Zahawi publicly called on the prime minister to resign and later launched his bid to replace him.\n\nUntil his promotion, Zahawi, who joined the cabinet less than a year ago, was considered an unlikely choice as the next leader of the Conservative Party. But his rise under Johnson has been rapid, making his mark with early success as vaccines minister amid the coronavirus pandemic and then as education secretary.\n\nIn his pitch for leadership, previewed in The Spectator magazine, he promised to lower taxes for individuals, families and business, boost defense spending, and continue with education reforms he started in his previous role.\n\nDespite voting to leave the European Union in 2016, Zahawi is widely admired among the moderates in the party. Crucially, as one Conservative source put it, “he’s not been in government long enough to have any obvious defects and, despite supporting Boris even after the confidence vote, is not too tainted by association.”\n\nZahawi was born in Iraq to Kurdish parents and came to the UK as a child, when his family fled Saddam Hussein’s regime. He is believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons, and helped found the polling company YouGov.\n\n“If a young boy who came here aged 11 without a word of English, can serve at the highest levels of Her Majesty’s Government and run to be the next Prime Minister, anything is possible,” Zahawi is set to say in a speech Monday, an excerpt of which was published by The Spectator.\n\nJeremy Hunt\n\nConservative MP Jeremy Hunt. Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nA former health and foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt lost the 2019 leadership vote to Johnson. He has since styled himself as an antidote to Johnson and is without question the highest profile contender on the moderate, ex-Remain side of the party.\n\nHunt announced his bid to become the next Conservative leader in an interview with British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph, pitching himself as “the only major candidate who has not served in Boris Johnson’s government.”\n\nIn a statement on Twitter ahead of the confidence vote in June, Hunt said: “Anyone who believes our country is stronger, fairer & more prosperous when led by Conservatives should reflect that the consequence of not changing will be to hand the country to others who do not share those values. Today’s decision is change or lose. I will be voting for change.”\n\nTellingly, Hunt’s statement focused mainly on the Conservatives’ chances of electoral success under Johnson, rather than his policies or the partygate scandal – a decision that could be read as a pitch to the Conservative MPs and members who would decide a leadership election. However, he comes with baggage, and sources from the opposition Labour Party have told CNN they are already writing attack lines.\n\n“It can’t be Jeremy. Labour can say he was running healthcare for six years and failed to prepare for a pandemic. They can say when he was culture secretary he chummed up to the Murdochs during the phone hacking scandal. He will get crushed,” a senior Conservative source told CNN.\n\nGrant Shapps\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps. Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nThe transport secretary launched his bid for prime minister this weekend, describing himself as a “problem solver, with a proven record of delivery” in a post on Twitter.\n\nOutlining his vision for the UK in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, Grant Shapps said that within his first 100 days in office he would produce an emergency budget to lower tax for “the most vulnerable” and give state support to firms with high levels of energy consumption.\n\n“We have had two-and-a-half years of tactical government by an often distracted centre. This must end. We must be a strategic government, sober in its analysis, and not chasing the next headline,” the paper quoted Shapps as saying.\n\nThe MP for Welwyn Hatfield was elected in 2005 and has held several ministerial posts. He is also a former co-chair of the Conservative party.\n\nKemi Badenoch\n\nConservative MP Kemi Badenoch. Ben Cawthra/Shutterstock\n\nThe former equalities minister launched her leadership bid in an op-ed published by the Times of London newspaper, saying she wants a “strong but limited government focused on the essentials.”\n\nKemi Badenoch resigned from the government on Wednesday citing “issues” that had “come to light” and the way they had been handled.\n\n“I’m putting myself forward in this leadership election because I want to tell the truth. It’s the truth that will set us free,” she wrote Saturday. Badenoch, who voted in favor of Brexit in 2016, added she would run on a “smart and nimble centre-right vision.”\n\nSuella Braverman\n\nAttorney General Suella Braverman. Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nLast week, the attorney general called for Johnson to quit and said that she would join a leadership race to replace him, telling ITV “it would be the greatest honor.”\n\nLaunching her bid a few days later, Suella Braverman wrote in The Daily Telegraph: “I saw Brexit as the most important political decision of my life. My views are not triangulated or calibrated. They are as much a part of me as my DNA. I now realise that I cannot rely on others to take Conservatism forward.”\n\nBraverman was elected as MP for Fareham in 2015.\n\nRehman Chishti\n\nConservative MP Rehman Chishti. rehmanchishti.com\n\nAmong the biggest outsiders in the race, the newly appointed Foreign Office minister threw his hat into the ring on Sunday.\n\nBorn in Pakistan, Rehman Chishti moved to the UK at the age of six, learning English at school in Gillingham, Kent, the area of southeastern England that he has represented as an MP since 2010. He went on to become the first in his family to go to university and received his law degree.\n\n“It’s important to ensure that everyone who works hard, who’s determined, who perseveres, that they have a government that is on their side,” he said in a Facebook video announcing his candidacy, adding that he would ensure lower taxes and fresh ideas to improve people’s lives.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh Luke Mcgee", "Eliza Mackintosh", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/960173/who-will-win-next-general-election-polls-odds", "title": "General election 2024: who will win?

In contrast, in 1997 Tony Blair \"boogied down Downing Street to 'Things Can Only Get Better' with a net satisfaction of +22, with just 29% of voters saying they did not like him\".\n\nIndeed, all evidence suggests Labour's lead is something of a smokescreen, a result of widespread voter disillusionment with the Tories rather than enthusiasm for Starmer's vision. A Financial Times analysis of pre-election polls found that both parties are \"on course to register their lowest combined vote share in a century\", with large gains expected for third parties, notably the Lib Dems and Reform.\n\n\"The UK electoral landscape has fragmented dramatically, reflecting rising dissatisfaction with the established parties,\" Patrick Diamond, professor of public policy at Queen Mary University of London, told the newspaper.\n\nThe latest polls and odds\n\nThere's quite a lot of variation between the polls but they all agree that Labour has a big lead over the Conservatives, said the BBC.\n\nThe BBC's poll tracker gives Labour an average national vote share of 40%, a 20-point lead over the Conservatives on 21%, with Reform UK on 16% and the Lib Dems on 11%. Politico said that Labour is on the cusp of entering government with a \"landslide of historic proportions\".\n\nThis roughly aligns with The New Statesman's Britain Predicts model, last updated on 29 June, which predicts Labour could end up with 436 MPs, with the Tories on just 90. Dropping into double figures is one of the benchmarks that might signal an extinction-level event for one of the most successful political parties in history.\n\nA new MRP poll by Survation predicts an even more dire outcome. The survey of 34,558 people suggests Labour are on track to win 484 seats – giving them a majority of 159 – with the Tories only just squeaking into the role of official opposition with 64 seats to the Lib Dems' 61. Reform would take seven seats, \"despite the party winning more votes nationwide than any other except Labour and the Conservatives\", said The Telegraph.\n\nBookmakers overwhelmingly favour Labour too. William Hill has Keir Starmer at 1/100 to be the next prime minister, while a Rishi Sunak victory is priced at 33/1, with Farage just behind on 40/1, according to Oddschecker.\n\nWhat policies are popular… and which are not?\n\nThe latest Ipsos Issue Index for June continued to show that the NHS is the top priority for voters, followed by the economy, immigration, inflation, cost of living, and housing.\n\nYouGov polling on public attitudes to specific proposals put forward by the main parties shows that while Britons tend to back both Labour and Conservative pledges not to increase National Insurance, VAT or income tax, they are more divided on other areas.\n\nThe Conservatives' triple lock plus pensions pledge has proved popular with the British public, with three-quarters (73%) backing the plan to raise the amount pensioners can receive before having to pay income tax in line with the annual increase in the state pension.\n\nThe party's much-discussed national service pledge enjoys less support, with around half (52%) opposed to the proposal that 18-year-olds serve a year in the armed forces, or commit to one weekend of volunteering per month for a year, compared to 39% who support it.\n\nLabour's manifesto fleshed out the six key policies unveiled by Starmer in May. These include promises on the economy, energy, crime, education, the NHS and immigration.\n\nYouGov found Labour plans to introduce VAT on private schools is welcomed by 61% of Britons, and supported by those who voted Conservative in 2019 by 49% to 36%.\n\nLabour's flagship policy of creating a publicly owned renewable energy provider is backed by three-quarters (74%) of voters.

Here are the highs and lows of his tumultuous premiership:\n\n24 July 2019: Johnson assumes office\n\nAfter becoming prime minister just over three years ago, Johnson promised to defy “the doubters, the doomsters and the gloomsters” by delivering Brexit within 99 days.\n\nIn a speech outside 10 Downing Street that was “infused with patriotic pronouncements”, said The Guardian, Johnson declared that “people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts”. Following three years of “unfounded self-doubt”, the PM said, it was “time to change the record”.\n\nBrexit “broke” Theresa May, wrote Alan McGuinness for Sky News, but Johnson’s “unique blend of rhetoric and optimism” was “the perfect tonic for a party that wants to feel good about itself again”.\n\n3 September 2019: he loses his majority\n\nJohnson faced a major showdown with his own MPs as they sought to block the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe “opening gambit” in an “acrimonious” debate was the defection of Phillip Lee, a Conservative MP who crossed the floor to join the benches of the Liberal Democrats as the prime minister addressed the Commons, reported Politico. He accused the government of using “political manipulation, bullying and lies” to push through its plans on Brexit.\n\nJohnson later removed the whip from 21 rebel Tories for voting against the government. The rebels included Ken Clarke, an MP since 1970, and Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill.\n\n13 December 2019: a general election victory\n\nAfter forcing an election over the Commons stalemate on Brexit, Johnson secured a “crushing victory” as voters backed his pledge to “get Brexit done”, reported The Guardian.\n\nThe Conservatives won 364 of the 650 seats up for grabs, in what the paper noted was “the party’s best showing in a parliamentary election since Margaret Thatcher triumphed in 1987”.\n\nEqually “astonishing” were the crushing defeats in the historic Labour heartlands, said the BBC’s political correspondent Nick Eardley. “Labour, by contrast, could hardly be in a worse position,” Eardley wrote.\n\n7 April 2020: Johnson is admitted to intensive care with Covid-19\n\nJust four months after his election victory high, in what The New York Times described as a “cruel reversal” of fortunes, the PM was admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 – the first major world leader reported to have contracted the virus.\n\nThe then foreign secretary Dominic Raab deputised throughout Johnson’s illness, which briefly “plunged the country back into the uncertainty Britons thought they had left behind” after so recently emerging from the “paralysis and polarisation” of Brexit, said the paper.\n\nIn an interview with The Sun on Sunday, the PM later revealed that he needed “litres and litres” of oxygen during his three-day stay in St Thomas’ intensive care unit in London, and that it was “50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe”.\n\n13 November 2020: Dominic Cummings resigns\n\nDominic Cummings “was seen leaving No. 10 a short while ago carrying a box”, reported the BBC, as Johnson’s closest adviser and key ally quit following a dispute that also triggered the resignation of communications director Lee Cain.\n\nTheir departures would “mark the end of the Vote Leave clique’s iron grip on government”, said the Daily Mail. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg described Cummings’ exit as “a political explosion”.\n\nAlthough Cummings would frame his departure as part of a long-term master plan, insiders told the BBC’s political editor that he “jumped because otherwise he would be pushed soon”. Johnson had recently come to see that his former aide’s band of “Brexit Boys” were just “in it for themselves”, the source claimed.\n\n8 December 2020: vaccination programme begins to roll out\n\nOne of the biggest successes for Johnson and his government was the UK’s Covid-19 vaccination programme. Indeed, “Britain soared ahead of every comparable country in the weeks after the vaccines became available, with the one exception being Israel”, said Hugo Gye of the i news site.\n\nBut criticism was not far behind. “Global leadership is an unaccustomed status for a country with one of the highest rates of excess deaths in western Europe,” said the Financial Times. “Multiple missteps”, such as the much-maligned NHS Track and Trace system, meant that “cynicism” remained over the government’s handling of the pandemic, the paper reported.\n\n21 December 2020: Christmas is ‘cancelled’\n\nThe hopes of a Christmas with loved ones were “dashed” for almost 20 million people after Johnson placed London and large parts of the southeast under “draconian” Tier-4 coronavirus restrictions, said PoliticsHome.\n\nJohnson had previously promised that Britons would be allowed to form “bubbles” with two other households over the Christmas period.\n\n“I want to be clear, we don’t want to ban Christmas,” Johnson told a press conference on 16 December. “And I think that would be frankly inhuman and against the instincts of many people in this country.”\n\nBut a few days later, families were told they could not mix after all.\n\n29 May 2021: Johnson marries fiancée Carrie Symonds\n\nAfter a turbulent year, Johnson married Carrie Symonds in a secretly planned Catholic ceremony at Westminster Cathedral.\n\nOnly 30 people attended the Covid-compliant wedding, as Johnson became the first PM to marry in office for “nearly 200 years”, the BBC reported.\n\nSome “disgruntled” congregants questioned how “the twice-divorced prime minister was able to marry in a Catholic church”, said The Telegraph.\n\n19 July 2021: England’s ‘Freedom Day’\n\nAs England prepared for all social distancing rules to be lifted on what some newspapers dubbed “Freedom Day”, both Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were accused of trying to “dodge” self-isolation rules, after being in close contact with health secretary Sajid Javid, who had tested positive for coronavirus, reported the BBC.\n\nNo. 10 initially said that Johnson and Sunak would not isolate as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involved daily testing. But the duo were forced to “perform a full reversal little more than two-and-a-half hours” later, amid widespread anger as opposition parties suggested there was “one rule for them and one for the rest of us”, reported Sky News.\n\n30 November 2021: Partygate allegations\n\nThe first allegations that Boris Johnson and Downing Street staff might have broken the government’s own Covid rules by holding parties and events during the 2020 Christmas holidays were reported by the Mirror.\n\nThe paper said that at least two parties had taken place. The PM was reported to have given a speech at a “packed leaving do” for a senior aide. And at a second event, while the rest of the country was locked down at home, officials were said to have “knocked back glasses of wine during a Christmas quiz and a Secret Santa”.\n\nDowning Street did not deny that the events had taken place, but a spokesperson insisted that “Covid rules have been followed at all times”.\n\nHowever, in a hint that further damaging revelations were to follow, a source told the Mirror that there had been “many social gatherings” in Downing Street over the holiday season.\n\n25 January 2022: Scotland Yard launches probe\n\nThe Metropolitan Police launched an official investigation into alleged Covid rule-breaking by lawmakers and officials, following a string of damaging revelations in the press and an internal government investigation conducted by top civil servant Sue Gray.\n\nNamed Operation Hillman, the police probe focused on 12 alleged incidents on eight dates between May 2020 and April 2021, and examined more than 500 documents and 300 photographs gathered by the Gray investigation.\n\nThe force sent more than 100 questionnaires to those suspected of attending parties at Downing Street and Whitehall, including Johnson, that asked for “an account and explanation of the recipient’s participation”. According to the Mirror, Johnson was thought to have attended at least seven of the parties investigated by the Met.\n\n9 April 2022: Johnson visits Ukraine\n\nIn what No. 10 called a “show of solidarity” with Ukraine amid the Russian invasion, Johnson made an unannounced visit to Kyiv for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nJohnson paid tribute to “Zelenskyy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people”, adding that “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv”.\n\n“I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run,” the PM said. “We are stepping up our own military and economic support and convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end, and ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation.”\n\nJohnson pledged new lethal aid to Ukraine in the form of “120 armoured vehicles and anti-ship missile systems”, as well as further economic support for the embattled nation, “taking total UK loan guarantees to £770m”, the BBC reported.\n\nIn a televised statement, he said that Ukrainians had shown “the courage of a lion” and that their president had “given the roar of that lion”.\n\n12 April 2022: fined over lockdown parties\n\nJohnson became “the first sitting prime minister to be criminally sanctioned” after the Met issued him with a £50 fixed penalty notice for attending a party for his birthday at No. 10 in June 2020, reported The Guardian.\n\nHis wife was also fined for attending the surprise birthday party, as was Rishi Sunak.\n\nAfter Gray’s long-awaited report was published in May, pressure from within the Conservative Party grew on Johnson, with a “drip feed of no confidence letters” being sent to Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 committee, along with senior Tory MPs publicly calling for the PM to go.\n\n“Veteran Tory” Bob Neill, chairman of the Commons Justice Committee, added his name to that list, “saying he did not regard the PM’s explanations as ‘credible’”, reported Sky News.\n\n6 June 2022: narrowly wins confidence vote\n\nMounting dissatisfaction with Johnson finally boiled over in June when the necessary threshold of Tory MPs submitted letters to the 1922 committee withdrawing their support for the prime minister, triggering a confidence vote.\n\nIn the end, a majority of Tory MPs backed the prime minister. But the margin of victory – 211 votes for to 148 against – was much closer than many had expected.\n\nDespite Johnson describing the vote win as “decisive” and “an opportunity to put behind us all the stuff that the media goes on about”, the BBC said: “The scale of the rebellion against him showed his authority had been weakened.”\n\nNoting the vote share in support of Johnson was lower than the 63% received by former prime minister Theresa May when she won a party confidence vote in 2018 before resigning six months later over a Brexit deadlock, the BBC’s political editor Chris Mason said: “The simple truth is when more than four in ten of your own MPs think the country would be better off without you, you have a problem.”\n\nNevertheless, under existing Tory party rules, the win meant Johnson was immune from a Conservative leadership challenge for a year.\n\n15 June 2022: ethics adviser quits\n\nA week after the confidence vote, Lord Geidt, Johnson’s ethics adviser, quit, saying he had been put in an “impossible and odious position”.\n\nGeidt had threatened to quit the previous month after concluding that there were “legitimate” questions about whether the prime minister broke the ministerial code over the lockdown parties scandal in Downing Street.\n\n30 June: the Chris Pincher affair\n\nWhat started off as a sexual harassment story featuring yet another Tory MP in the end proved to be the final nail in the coffin of Johnson’s political career.\n\nChris Pincher, the MP for Tamworth and the deputy chief whip, resigned from the government on 1 July and was suspended from the Conservative Party a day later in the wake of allegations that he groped two men in the private members’ Carlton Club.\n\nYet as more historic allegations emerged, Johnson was accused of ignoring warnings of inappropriate behaviour by Pincher before appointing him to the role of deputy chief whip in February 2022.\n\n“Under mounting pressure to reveal what he knew” before appointing him to the whips’ office, which oversees discipline within the party, Johnson and his aides repeatedly obfuscated and changed their story, said the BBC.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News’ Kay Burley, education minister Will Quince said he had been given “categorical assurance” from No. 10 that Johnson was “not aware of any serious specific allegations” against Pincher when he was appointed. But within hours, the prime minister’s official spokesman admitted that Johnson had been “aware of media reports that others had seen over the years”.\n\nIn an attempt to put an end to the growing furore Johnson issued a full apology in an interview with the BBC’s Chris Mason but it was too late, with senior cabinet ministers Javid and Sunak announcing their resignations as the interview aired.\n\n7 July: he announces his resignation\n\nJavid’s decision to quit as health secretary on 5 July triggered the deluge of resignations that ultimately toppled Johnson.\n\nIn a seismic 48 hours in Westminster, more than 50 ministers followed Javid in protest at Johnson’s decision to remain in Downing Street.\n\nHaving initially sought to stem the tide by quickly appointing replacements to the cabinet, by the morning of 7 July the game was up after it became clear he had lost the support of almost all his MPs and a flurry of junior ministerial resignations left his government struggling to function.\n\nAnnouncing his resignation outside No. 10 surrounded by his family and closest aides, Johnson delivered what politics lecturer Paula Keaveney described on The Conversation as “a bitter resignation speech” that “was followed by objections over its tone and led to calls for him to depart straight away rather than staying on until his successor is appointed”.\n\n6 September: he finally stands down as PM\n\nHaving taken the dramatic step of calling – and winning - a confidence vote in his own government in the days after his resignation announcement Johnson was able to stay on in No. 10 while a new leader was chosen.\n\nDespite the UK being in the grips of a cost-of-living crisis, the outgoing prime minister was accused of shirking his responsibilities and leading a “zombie government” by his critics, a view not helped by his decision to take numerous holidays abroad over the summer.\n\nHe departed Downing Street with the threat of an ongoing Commons inquiry into whether he deliberately misled Parliament still hanging over him.\n\nYet even with the threat of losing his Uxbridge seat and the unceremonious way he was thrown out by his own MPs, many, including perhaps Johnson himself, see this not as the end but merely a prelude to a second act.\n\n“When it comes to Johnson’s numerous misdemeanours, Conservatives seem eager to forgive and forget as soon as possible, with many not seeming to think there is anything to forgive,” said Prospect.\n\nJohnson suggested as much with his final PMQs, signing off with the phrase “Hasta la vista, baby”.\n\nGiven his extraordinary political career it would be foolish to write off such a dramatic return completely.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Rebekah Evans", "Justin Klawans", "Peter Weber", "Mark Gimein", "Theunis Bates"], "publish_date": "2021/07/23"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/958166/will-keir-starmer-be-prime-minister", "title": "Keir Starmer: preparing to be prime minister? | The Week", "text": "Keir Starmer is putting Labour on an “election footing” with critical changes to his top team after telling party staff that the “government’s collapse has given us a huge chance”.\n\nThe Labour leader reportedly said that “this is not time for complacency or caution” as he announced the sacking of his chief-of-staff Sam White. A spokesperson added that the “long-planned” structural changes had been “brought forward in light of the Conservative Party implosion”.\n\nWhite has been blamed for several “strategic missteps that enraged the shadow cabinet”, said The Times. Critics within the party “said his style was defined by an excess of caution that too often prevented Starmer from seizing the initiative”, according to the paper.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

As the politician has repeatedly pointed out, his father, Rod Starmer, was a toolmaker, and his mother, Josephine Baker, was a nurse.\n\nStarmer told BBC Radio 5 Live last month that he didn’t grow up in “great poverty”, but “said he could relate to those currently facing difficulties as the cost-of-living crisis hits households”, Sky News reported.\n\n“I actually know what it is like to sit around the kitchen table not being able to pay your bills,” Starmer said.\n\nWhen he was 11, his mother was diagnosed with Still’s disease, a rare and incurable form of inflammatory arthritis that meant she “could barely walk for most of her life”, Starmer told Politico’s London Playbook in 2019.\n\nThe impact of her illness was “really difficult” but “formative”, he said, adding that his mother would “never ever, ever go to private health”. She died two weeks before Starmer was first elected as a member of Parliament, for Holborn and St Pancras in north London in 2015.\n\nAs a schoolboy, Starmer attended Redhill Grammar, where fellow pupils included Fat Boy Slim. Starmer told Channel 4 News’s Cathy Newman earlier this year that he “did violin lessons” with the now music star, real name Norman Cook, “back in the day”.\n\nStarmer also became a member of East Surrey Young Socialists as a teenager, before going on to study law at the University of Leeds followed by a Master’s at Oxford.\n\nAppearing on Piers Morgan’s ITV show Life Stories last year, he recalled: “I spent my university days in the library, studying”. When Morgan launched into what The Tab described as “an interrogation” about whether he took drugs as a student, Starmer denied the suggestion, but added: “We worked hard and played hard.”\n\nHe has been married to Victoria Alexander, a former solicitor-turned-NHS occupational health worker, since 2007, and the couple have two children.\n\nWhat did Starmer do before entering politics?\n\nStarmer had a long career as a lawyer before first being elected as an MP in May 2015, at the age of 52.\n\nHe started out as a defence barrister focusing on human rights, and won a number of high-profile cases including overturning death row sentences and assisting in the years-long “McLibel” case. His first mention in The Lawyer was in 1995, and he went on to get “regular name-checks” in lists of “ones to watch”, said the industry magazine.\n\nStarmer became Queen’s Counsel in 2002, before being appointed director of public prosecutions and head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) six years later.\n\nHe received a knighthood in 2014 for his services to criminal justice, and “‘invited his parents to Buckingham Palace for the event, who in turn brought along the family dog”, said Labour.org.uk.\n\nAt the CPS, he “is remembered for his focus on standards and best practices”, biographer Oliver Eagleton told The Guardian’s First Edition newsletter editor Archie Bland earlier this year. And his credentials as a former director of public prosecutions put Starmer “a cut above the rest of Labour’s frontbench in the eyes of many Conservatives”, said Politico.\n\nKeir Starmer served as head of the Crown Prosecution Service from 2008 to 2013 (Image credit: John Stillwell/WPA Pool/Getty Images)\n\nAfter becoming an MP, Starmer served as shadow minister for immigration. In 2016, he was appointed shadow Brexit secretary under Corbyn, sitting “at the heart of Labour’s frontbench during the tumultuous years of the UK’s exit from the European Union”, said Politics.co.uk. Starmer was “the key figure in steering” Labour to back a second referendum in the 2019 election, said Politico, but has “had to make peace” with Brexit.\n\nIn 2020, Starmer beat Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy to succeed Coryn as party leader, securing 56.2% of the vote. “But the next contest will be the harder one,” said Politico said, which pointed out that following Labour’s losses in the 2019 general election, the party needed to “overturn a Conservative majority of 80 seats” to claim power.\n\nStarmer acknowledged that the party had a “mountain to climb”. But a series of scandals during Boris Johnson’s tenure, and the recent economic crises triggered by Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini budget, appear to have put a Labour victory within reach as the “political pendulum swings”, said The Observer.\n\nIs he popular enough to become PM?\n\nStarmer was “widely written off” as “a grey man in a blue suit” for the first two years of his party leadership, said the Financial Times. He has repeatedly been accused of lacking charisma, with even members of his own party describing him as boring – reportedly prompting Starmer to tell his shadow cabinet that “what’s boring is being in opposition”.\n\nBut public opinion began to shift earlier this year, as the Conservatives faced “a seemingly endless succession of revelations about sleaze and scandal”, the newspaper said.\n\nA poll of 1,712 British adults last month by YouGov and The Times found that 54% would vote for Labour, while 21% would back the Tories. And 44% thought Starmer would make the best prime minister, compared with Truss’s 15%.\n\nIn a separate Ipsos survey of 1,000 people, 51% thought Starmer was likely to become PM, up 23% from January.\n\nThe mood was jubilant at Labour’s party conference last month, with the Tories “close to losing the plot” just weeks into Truss’s premiership, said Andrew Marr in The New Statesman. Starmer delivered a keynote speech that “showed he is a prime minister in waiting”, portraying Labour “as a party of reassurance, serious-minded common sense and patient duty”, Marr wrote.\n\nThe subsequent shake-up of Starmer’s top team shows the Labour leader is “preparing for power”, said Politico’s London Playbook.\n\nAs well as the sacking of White, a former senior special adviser during the premierships of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Labour’s policy and communications teams are set to move from Starmer’s office to party headquarters.\n\nLabour sources told The Guardian’s Jess Elgot that White, who had been Starmer’s chief of staff for a year, was not expected to be replaced immediately and that “the priority for the new role would be leading on transition to government work as well as day-to-day management”.\n\nThe shake-up was announced hours after former shadow minister Sam Tarry was deselected as Labour’s candidate for Ilford South, with local party members voting by 499 to 361 for council leader Jas Athwal to be their representative. The Times said the decision “will have been quietly welcomed by the Labour leadership”, who ousted Tarry earlier this summer after he conducted unapproved media interviews.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Devika Rao", "The Week Us", "Becca Stanek", "The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Peter Weber"], "publish_date": "2022/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/955416/timeline-downing-street-lockdown-party-scandal", "title": "A timeline of the Partygate scandal | The Week", "text": "Boris Johnson deliberately misled Parliament when he denied any knowledge of lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street, according to the long-awaited verdict of the inquiry into his conduct.\n\nThe former prime minister “had knowledge of breaches of the Rules and Guidance that occurred in No 10”, the Commons Privileges Committee has declared.\n\nHis denials over the Partygate scandal were “so disingenuous that they were deliberate attempts to mislead the Committee”, the 30,000-word report concluded.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

People could not leave home without a reasonable excuse and could only meet one person outside while exercising, according to rules at the time.\n\nAn investigation by The Guardian in December 2021 led to the publication of a picture of Johnson, flanked by Carrie Symonds and his then chief adviser Dominic Cummings, drinking wine and eating cheese in the No. 10 garden.\n\nThat day, the health secretary at the time, Matt Hancock, had urged “people to stick to the rules and not take advantage of the good weather over the May weekend to socialise in groups”.\n\nWhen asked about it later, Johnson said: “Those people were at work talking about work.” The event was not investigated by the police.\n\n2. 20 May 2020\n\nOne of the most explosive of the lockdown parties was revealed when an email leaked to ITV News showed more than 100 Downing Street staff were invited for “socially distanced drinks” in the garden of No. 10 to “make the most of the lovely weather”.\n\nSent by Johnson’s principal private secretary Martin Reynolds, the email invited employees including advisers, speech writers and door staff to come over and “bring your own booze”.\n\nJohnson told Prime Minister’s Questions in January 2022 that he attended for around “25 minutes” but thought it was “a work event”.\n\n3. 19 June 2020\n\nITV News reported in January 2022 that a birthday party was held in the Cabinet Room for Johnson with up to 30 people. His then girlfriend Carrie Symonds apparently presented him with a cake and “led staff in a chorus of happy birthday”, said the broadcaster.\n\nJohnson famously claimed he had been “ambushed by cake”, and that he was there for less than 10 minutes.\n\nPolice determined that the event breached the rules, which at the time banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people. Johnson and Symonds both received fixed-penalty notices, as did the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak. The latter claimed to have been “unintentionally present” when the cake was served, while waiting for a meeting.\n\n4. 13 November 2020\n\nIn early November new lockdown restrictions were introduced to deal with rising Covid-19 infections and hospitalisations, banning indoor gatherings and leaving the home for non-essential activities. Two gatherings allegedly took place eight days later, the evening No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings was sacked.\n\nA spokesman for Johnson’s then fiancée denied that these events, reported in The Daily Telegraph, had taken place. According to the police investigation an event on this day did breach the rules in place at the time, but it did not confirm whether it was one or both.\n\n5. 25 November 2020\n\nThe Times revealed in December 2021 that an “impromptu” party was held in late November 2020, to celebrate Sunak’s autumn spending review.\n\nA spokesperson for the Treasury told The Guardian that a “small number” had remained after work to celebrate at their desks. According to The Times, “about two dozen civil servants” took part in the drinks after “wine and beer were brought into the Treasury”. “They’d all been working really hard,” sources told the paper.\n\n6. 27 November 2020\n\nTwo days later, it was alleged that the prime minister attended a leaving event for Cleo Watson, a former Downing Street adviser.\n\nA source told The Guardian “that Johnson personally attended and gave a speech”, mentioning how crowded it was in the room before leaving shortly afterwards to continue working.\n\n7. 10 December 2020\n\nEight days after the second national lockdown was replaced with the tier system and indoor meetings of two or more were banned in London, the Department for Education (DoE) held a Christmas party at which two dozen people drank in the department canteen. Susan Acland-Hood, a senior civil servant, said it had been organised at the request of former education secretary Gavin Williamson, The Guardian reported.\n\nThe DoE confirmed that the party had taken place “to thank staff for their work during the pandemic”.\n\n8. 14 December 2020\n\nShaun Bailey, the Conservative candidate for London mayor, was forced to apologise in December 2021 after the Daily Mirror published a photograph of him at a Christmas party held at the Tories’ campaign headquarters in London, alongside 24 other people, on 14 December. The photo showed the group smiling at the camera, next to catered food.\n\nThe Conservative Party would later admit that an “unauthorised gathering” took place at its Westminster headquarters. Bailey stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crimes committee over the revelations.\n\nPolice said there was insufficient evidence to determine whether rules had been broken, and the event was not included in the eventual report into parties in and around Downing Street by senior civil servant Sue Gray.\n\n9. 15 December 2020\n\nPictures published in the Sunday Mirror in December 2021 showed Johnson hosting an online quiz in Downing Street in December 2020. He was with two members of his team wearing tinsel and a Santa hat. Johnson denied breaking any guidance or rules at this event.\n\nThe image served to “seriously undermine Downing Street’s claims” that “no parties had taken place in No.10”, said the paper.\n\nRules at the time banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless necessary for work purposes, but this event was not investigated by the police.\n\n10. 15 December 2020\n\nPictures published in the Daily Mirror last month showed Johnson hosting an online quiz in Downing Street in December 2020. He was seen with two members of his team wearing tinsel and a Santa hat.​​\n\nA source told the paper “many staff huddled by computers, conferring on questions and knocking back fizz, wine and beer from a local Tesco Metro”. The image serves to “seriously undermine Downing Street’s claims” that “no parties had taken place in No.10”, said the paper.\n\n11. 16-17 December 2020\n\nThe Department for Transport was forced to apologise over allegations that a dozen of Grant Shapps’s team were “boozing and dancing” during a Christmas party on the same day that London had moved to the highest tier of restrictions at the time.\n\nIt was “inappropriate” and an “error of judgement” by staff, the department said.\n\nThe Cabinet Office later confirmed that staff took part in a virtual quiz on 17 December 2020, which was reportedly listed in digital calendars as “Christmas party!” in Cabinet Secretary Simon Case’s office.\n\n“Dozens” of officials from the Cabinet Office’s Covid-19 taskforce also attended a “boozy” leaving party for their boss Kate Josephs, according to The Telegraph. The bash was hosted in the 70 Whitehall office of the government unit while “the country was still under draconian restrictions” drawn up by the taskforce.\n\nPolice determined that an event on these dates breached the rules, but did not confirm which.\n\n12. 18 December 2020\n\nA second Christmas party, also revealed by the Daily Mirror, took place in No. 10.\n\n“Officials knocked back glasses of wine during a Christmas quiz and a Secret Santa while the rest of the country was forced to stay at home,” said the paper. One source described the event as “a Covid nightmare” in which around “40 or 50” were crammed “cheek by jowl” into a medium-sized room in Downing Street.\n\nDowning Street originally denied the report, but ITV would later publish a video of the prime minister’s then press secretary, Allegra Stratton, joking about the party taking place. Police would later rule that the event breached the regulations at the time.\n\n13. 16 April 2021\n\nTwo further leaving events, one for departing director of communications James Slack and a second for a Downing Street photographer, took place on the evening before Prince Philip’s funeral.\n\n“It is alleged that excessive alcohol was drunk, while at points, guests danced,” The Telegraph said. “The gatherings stretched late into the night – well beyond midnight.”\n\nDowning Street would later apologise to Buckingham Palace. Police said that one event on this date breached the rules, but did not say which. BBC News reported that some people at Slack’s leaving party were issued with fines.\n\n14. 30 November 2021\n\nThe then political editor of the Daily Mirror, Pippa Crerar, first broke the story that Downing Street staff had held three parties in November and December 2020, while London was under lockdown restrictions.\n\n“Boris Johnson and his Downing Street staff have been accused of breaking Covid rules by attending parties at Number 10 in the run-up to last Christmas,” began the article that would kickstart more than two years of revelations, reporting and inquiries.\n\nDowning Street said that Covid rules were followed at all times, and denied that any party had taken place.\n\n15. December 2021\n\nA video obtained by ITV News showed Allegra Stratton joking about the party in Downing Street on 18 December 2020. She resigned the following day, after an intense backlash.\n\nJohnson then instructed Simon Case, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, to investigate claims of a Christmas party in Downing Street, telling MPs that he was “furious”. The next day, he announced a Cabinet Office inquiry, but reports emerged that Case was found to have attended one of the parties and he was forced to remove himself from the investigation. He was replaced by experienced civil servant Sue Gray.\n\nPolice later determined that the event did take place, and that it breached the rules at the time.\n\n16. 25 January 2022\n\nThe Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into 12 of the 16 events examined by the Sue Gray inquiry.\n\nMore than 100 people were sent questionnaires as part of Operation Hillman, about alleged Covid law-breaking events that took place between May 2020 and April 2021.\n\nJohnson told the Commons he welcomed the investigation.\n\n17. 12 April 2022\n\nJohnson was issued with a fixed penalty notice by the Metropolitan Police for lockdown breaches during the pandemic, making him the first serving prime minister found to have broken the law while in Downing Street. His wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak also received a fine.\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer said the PM and chancellor had “broken the law and repeatedly lied to the British public” and “must both resign”.\n\n18. 21 April 2022\n\nThe House of Commons passed a motion to refer Johnson to its Privileges Committee, to consider whether he had deliberately misled the Commons when he said no Covid guidance or rules were breached in Downing Street.\n\nThe inquiry was delayed until after the Met Police and Gray investigations.\n\n19. 19 May 2022\n\nThe Met Police concluded its investigation, which had examined evidence from the Gray inquiry as well as records and photographs from the time.\n\nOverall, it made 126 referrals for fixed penalty notices, to 83 people, with 28 people receiving between two and five fines.\n\nThe investigation cost nearly half a million pounds.\n\n20. 25 May 2022\n\nGray published her full report.

At the time he promised to lead a “bold and reforming” government that would “put aside party differences and work hard for the common good”.\n\nAusterity years\n\nWithin a month of coming to power, Cameron described the nation’s economic plight as “even worse than we thought” and warned of “difficult decisions” to come as part of an austerity programme that proved controversial.\n\nLabour accused Cameron of being out of touch when he launched the so-called “bedroom tax”, but he was widely praised for introducing same-sex marriages in England and Wales in 2014.\n\nA coalition led by Britain and France launched strikes against Muammar Gaddafi’s forces in 2011, which led to the Libyan leader’s overthrow.

The PM canvassed for the Remain side during a divisive campaign, while Boris Johnson decided to join the Leave side.\n\nIn 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU by 52% to 48%. Within hours of the result, Cameron announced he would stand down, telling the nation that “fresh leadership” was needed.\n\nEnter Theresa May\n\nAfter six years as home secretary, Theresa May won the party leadership contest on 11 July 2016 after Andrea Leadsom dropped out, leaving May as the sole candidate.\n\nBecoming the nation’s second female prime minister, she promised to fight “burning injustice” in British society and create a union “between all of our citizens”.\n\nHowever, she lost the party’s majority when she called a snap election the following year, leaving her dependent on the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), and suffered a series of humiliations as her Brexit deal was rejected.\n\nMay’s premiership was “dominated by tortuous negotiations in Brussels and vicious infighting within Tory ranks over the terms on which the UK would leave”, said ITV.\n\nJohnson replaces May\n\n“British government is clearly set to experience a very different kind of prime ministerial leadership,” said David Klemperer at the Institute for Government after Boris Johnson was voted in to replace May in July 2019.\n\nHe immediately got to work on Brexit, controversially proroguing parliament and then losing his working majority after Tory MP Phillip Lee crossed the floor and defected to the Liberal Democrats.\n\nJohnson withdrew the party whip from 21 Tory MPs after they defied him in the Commons and eventually pushed MPs into a general election. The move paid off, as he returned to Downing Street in December 2019 with a big majority.\n\nLeading his campaign on a promise to “Get Brexit Done”, Johnson upheld his promise and the UK promptly left the EU.\n\nCovid pandemic hits the UK\n\nAs the Covid-19 pandemic took hold across the world, Johnson’s government was initially criticised for “moving too slowly” and “relying on hopes of herd immunity” as other countries brought in strict measures in response to the crisis, said The Independent.\n\nBut despite reluctance at the top of government, Johnson would eventually put the country under lockdown restrictions in March 2020. During a televised address to the nation, he called Covid-19 “the biggest threat this country has faced for decades”.\n\nIn May, the government launched what it called a “world-beating” track-and-trace system at a cost of £37bn, promising the public it would prevent another national lockdown.\n\nMeg Hillier, Labour chair of the public accounts committee, later criticised the scheme, arguing that despite the “unimaginable resources” the project had received, it could not “point to a measurable difference to the progress of the pandemic”.\n\nThe government fared much better with the roll-out of its vaccination programme, which quickly became “the biggest and fastest in Europe”, said the BBC.\n\nBut its Covid record has since been marred by a series of scandals.\n\nFormer health secretary Matt Hancock resigned after he was found to have broken social distancing rules by kissing a colleague in May 2020, while the prime minister, his wife Carrie Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak have all been fined by the Metropolitan Police for attending law-breaking events during lockdown.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Rebekah Evans", "The Week Uk", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Rebecca Messina", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/05/06"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/961773/next-london-mayor-the-odds-the-polls-the-candidates", "title": "Next London mayor: odds, polls and all the candidates | The Week", "text": "The race to become the next mayor of London has continued to narrow, just a few days before voters in the capital head to the polls, although incumbent Sadiq Khan is still the clear favourite to win on 2 May.\n\nA new poll has \"dramatically stirred up\" the race by suggesting that Khan's lead could actually be as small as 13 points, the London Evening Standard reported. A survey by Savanta for Queen Mary University of London carried out between 8 and 17 April found that 46% of those polled intend to vote for Khan, with 33% opting for the Tory candidate, Susan Hall.

Nevertheless, \"this election is critical for the capital's future\", with the next mayor overseeing the \"root and branch\" reform of the Metropolitan Police, addressing the chronic lack of affordable housing in the capital and trying to secure Transport for London's financial future.\n\nDespite being the overwhelming favourite with pollsters, bookies and political commentators, Khan \"is haunted by the spectre of defeat\", said George Eaton in The New Statesman. Khan and his team are said to fear the vote, which takes place on the same day as local elections, may be \"far closer than most believe\", partly due to the replacement of the supplementary vote system in mayoral elections with first-past-the-post voting. The change was introduced in 2021 by Boris Johnson's government and \"widely interpreted as an attempt to tilt the odds in the Tories’ favour\".\n\nWho is standing?\n\nKhan has said he wants to \"send a message\" to the Tories in seeking to become the first politician to hold the mayor of London office for three terms. He has urged voters not to \"let the Tories do to London what they've done to our country\", as he hit out at the \"hollow, desperate and divisive narrative\" put forward by the party.\n\nHe will face off against the Conservatives' Hall, a London Assembly member and former council leader. She is a vocal supporter of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Donald Trump and is hoping to ride a \"populist (if not yet popular) ticket to City Hall\", said Londonist. Since emerging from a shortlist of relative unknowns last year, Hall has endured a series of media missteps, including what The Mirror described as a \"meltdown\" on LBC when she was forced to admit she did not know the price of a bus fare, just days after criticising a decision to freeze fares in the capital. Her campaign was faced additional criticism for an attack ad in which the capital was presented as a crime-riddled Gotham-like metropolis, using footage which actually showed New York City.\n\nWhile Khan and Hall are the only candidates with a serious chance of winning in May, there are 13 people standing for election. These include the Liberal Democrats' Rob Blackie, an anti-Brexit campaigner and adviser to start-up technology companies, and Reform UK's Howard Cox, a small-business adviser with a track record of campaigning for lower petrol prices. Hackney councillor and NHS inequalities adviser Zoë Garbett will be looking to build on growing support for the Greens in the capital.\n\nIn alphabetical order, here is the full list of candidates:\n\nFemy Amin, Animal Welfare Party\n\nCount Binface, Count Binface Party\n\nRob Blackie, Liberal Democrats\n\nNatalie Campbell, Independent\n\nHoward Cox, Reform UK\n\nAmy Gallagher, Social Democratic Party\n\nZoë Garbett, Green Party\n\nTarun Ghulati, Independent\n\nSusan Hall, Conservative and Unionist Party\n\nSadiq Khan, Labour Party\n\nAndreas Michli, Independent\n\nBrian Rose, London Real Party\n\nNick Scanlon, Britain First\n\nWhat will be the key issues?\n\nKhan is looking to focus on his environmental and council-house-building policies as key achievements of his tenure, as well as the introduction of universal free school meals for primary pupils and freezing single Tube and bus fares until 2025.\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph earlier this month, Hall re-iterated her plans for better policing, a greater focus on women and scrapping the ultra low emission zone (Ulez) – Khan's \"soft underbelly\" since he controversially expanded the charging zone to include outer London in August, said the paper.\n\nBut with both main candidates \"promising to bring better, greener transport to London, crack down on crime, and build more homes, according to their campaign websites\", said the London Evening Standard podcast, \"it appears that the only issue the two disagree on is Ulez\" – which Hall has made one of the centrepieces of her campaign.\n\nWhat do the polls say?\n\nA YouGov poll last week put Khan 19 points ahead of his Conservative rival but the mayor's aides insist that a \"perfect storm\" of factors could oust him from City Hall, said The New Statesman's Eaton.\n\nChief among these is the change to a first-past-the-post voting system, which is seen as the big wildcard in May's election. Forced through by the government, the change in how the mayor is elected is \"expected to improve the Conservative mayoral candidate's chances of winning in a city which has been increasingly Labour-leaning in recent years”, said On London. This is because they will not have to assemble a coalition of more than 50% of the voters; they just need the most votes.\n\nLooking at the last election, in 2021, Khan secured 40% of first preference votes, with his Tory rival Shaun Bailey on 35%. The new system will mean closing the gap should be easier for the Conservatives.\n\nIn a bid to counter this, Khan has warned against voting for other parties, arguing that a vote for the Greens or Liberal Democrats in a first-past-the-post system \"means one less vote for the Tories to get\".\n\nOn top of changes to the electoral system, Khan also faces the \"obstacles of incumbency\" in seeking a third term, said The Guardian, although the latest polls still give him a comfortable lead – albeit one growing less comfortable as election day nears.\n\nSky Bet still has Khan as the strong favourite to win at 1-25, with Hall an outsider at 8-1, so barring some 11th-hour scandal the race looks Khan's to lose.", "authors": ["The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Harriet Marsden", "Rebekah Evans", "The Week Staff", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Rebecca Messina", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/07/27"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/environment/961731/will-sunak-and-starmer-drop-green-policies-to-win-voters", "title": "Will Sunak and Starmer drop green policies to win voters? | The Week", "text": "Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak could water down or even drop much of their green agenda, as both look to prioritise the economy in a bid to win voters ahead of the next general election.\n\nLabour has spent the weekend arguing internally whether the shock loss of the Uxbridge and South Ruislip by-election means it has focused too much on green issues, after the Tories made the vote effectively a referendum on the expansion of the controversial ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) by Labour’s Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.\n\nA senior party figure told Politico’s London Playbook that Uxbridge should be a “wake-up call for those in Labour who think it is possible to ignore public opinion and still win … especially those who are driving anti-car policies and expecting their owners to dig deep into their pockets to pay for them”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

This would give small carmakers more time to adapt to producing electric vehicles. Additional measures under consideration are dropping additional levies on energy bills and a halt to any new low-traffic neighbourhoods.\n\nAs for Labour, earlier this month The Sunday Times reported that Starmer and his allies had become increasingly unhappy that their economic focus was being jeopardised by the party’s eco-warriors. The party’s leader allegedly went as far as saying “I hate tree huggers” – something he has denied.\n\nWhat next?\n\nThere is an argument, said The Spectator’s political editor Katy Balls, that the Uxbridge result “will make it easier for Starmer and his shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves to further tone down the green message” as the party looks to thrash out the details of its next manifesto.\n\nSome Starmer allies also “see it as further reason to clip Ed Miliband’s wings – pointing to the risk of green backfiring if it looks costly” she added. As shadow climate change and net zero secretary, the former Labour leader is driving the party’s green agenda but reports suggest he has fallen out with Starmer and could even be at risk at the next shadow cabinet reshuffle expected in the autumn.\n\nTom Burke, co-founder of the green think tank E3G, predicted that those within Labour who are antagonistic to green measures will look to seize the moment. The Guardian’s environment editor Fiona Harvey pointed, for example, to “some trade unions who have deep reservations about the transition to a low-carbon economy, and some in the party are fearful over Tory attacks on climate policies”.\n\nSensing a small but fertile window of opportunity in the face of dire poll numbers, the Tories have sought to weaponise Labour’s green message as part of a wider culture war. Last week, energy secretary Grant Shapps branded Labour “the political wing of Just Stop Oil” and demanded it pay compensation for damage caused by the group’s protesters.\n\nBut, said Burke, the Labour leadership “should be very careful in generalising from this to climate policy more generally”. It was important, he said, to “communicate far more effectively what the consequences will be of climate policy failure. That’s what’s missing from this debate.”\n\nWith climate change consistently featuring among the top concerns for voters, and amid devastating wildfires in Greece and Switzerland and an extreme heatwave across southern Europe, both party leaders have been warned any attempt to veer away from their green pledges would be “political suicide”.\n\nThe Observer cited “senior figures from business, the scientific community and across the political divide” who said that any watering down of climate policies would be deeply unpopular with voters, set back the international fight to reach net zero and damage Britain’s green reputation.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/07/24"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/961652/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-18-july-2023", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 18 July 2023 | The Week", "text": "1. Migration bill passes Lords\n\nThe Illegal Migration Bill will become law after the government won a final series of votes in the House of Lords. The government defeated a number of amendments by peers, including time limits on child detention and modern slavery protections.

Assault claims at ‘toxic’ McDonald’s\n\nA “toxic culture” of sexual assault, harassment, racism and bullying has been described by more than 100 current and recent McDonald’s staff in the UK, said the BBC. Workers, some as young as 17, are being groped and harassed almost routinely, said the broadcaster, which said it heard 31 allegations related to sexual assault, and 78 related to sexual harassment. There were also claims of racism and homophobia. “There are clearly instances where we have fallen short and for that we deeply apologise,” said McDonald’s UK.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Starmer splits party on benefits\n\nKeir Starmer’s decision not to scrap the two-child benefit cap if Labour wins power has exposed “deep splits” within the party, said The Guardian. Shadow cabinet ministers have argued that if Labour wanted to appear fiscally credible at the next election, it could not make any spending commitments without saying how they would be funded. But a “bad-tempered” meeting of the parliamentary Labour party yesterday saw deputy leader, Angela Rayner, repeatedly quizzed about Starmer’s stance on the two-child benefit limit.\n\nTwo-child benefit cap: a litmus test for Keir Starmer?\n\n4. Kremlin threatens food crisis\n\nThere are fears of a new food supply crisis in the developing world after Russia withdrew from a deal to allow Ukrainian grain exports through the Black Sea. Moscow announced that the agreement, which expired on Monday, had been “terminated” and would only be revived if its demands over western sanctions were met. Western capitals have accused Russia of “coercing” developing countries into siding with its invasion of Ukraine by “dangling the threat of disrupted food supplies, soaring prices and hunger”, said The Times.\n\nTwo dead in Crimea bridge attack as Russia halts Ukraine grain deal\n\n5. ‘Long Boris’ blamed ahead of polls\n\nA Conservative backbencher has blamed “Long Boris” for the party’s expected by-election defeats this week. Steve Brine, who chairs the Commons health and social care committee, said the former PM would be responsible for the Tories losing his old constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip. “It’s another bit of what I call ‘long Boris’, isn’t it?” he told BBC Radio. James Duddridge, who received his knighthood in Johnson’s resignation honours list, called Brine’s remarks “ill-advised”. There will also be by-elections this week in votes in Selby and Ainsty and Somerton and Frome.\n\nThe make-or-break by-elections facing Rishi Sunak\n\n6. Codeine could be restricted\n\nOver-the-counter sales of cough syrup or codeine linctus could be banned because of concerns it is addictive and can lead to serious health problems. The UK medicines safety regulator is receiving rising numbers of reports of drug abuse and dependence to codeine medicines and pharmacists said they are worried about the overdose risk. Codeine linctus is “an effective medicine”, but “as it is an opioid, its misuse and abuse can have major health consequences,” said Dr Alison Cave, chief safety officer of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.\n\n7. Host pulls out of Commonwealth Games\n\nAustralia’s Victoria state has withdrawn as host of the 2026 Commonwealth Games because of a huge increase in the expected cost of staging the event. Local premier Daniel Andrews said his government had agreed to host the next edition of the quadrennial event “but not at any cost”. He had been “slammed” for “shattering” Victoria’s reputation, said the Sydney Morning Herald, as the “debt-laden” state “delivers gold medal satire, but not a Commonwealth Games”.\n\nCommonwealth Games: a ‘modern and edgy’ or ‘uncertain’ future?\n\n8. Underground climate change threatens cities\n\n“Underground climate change” is deforming the ground beneath cities, a study conducted in Chicago has reported. The researchers found that the shifting of land under urban areas could pose a problem for buildings and infrastructure, threatening long-term performance and durability. The phenomenon is the “warming of the ground under our feet”, said CNN. It is caused by heat released by buildings and subterranean transportation such as subway systems. However, it “does not threaten the safety of people and does not threaten to collapse structures and buildings”, said the lead author.\n\n9. Burnham to tackle train firms\n\nTrain companies are facing legal action over their “devastating” plan to close almost every ticket office in the country, said The Mirror. Five regional leaders including Andy Burnham and Tracy Brabin are preparing to launch legal action against the mass closures, arguing that the “shambolic” proposals would punish passengers, including the elderly and disabled. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, has announced plans to close about 1,000 ticket offices across England.\n\nTicket offices: on track for closure?\n\n10. Did Yellen eat magic mushrooms?\n\nThe US Treasury Secretary ate “hallucinogenic” mushrooms during her visit to China last week, according to a post on social media. “Our staff said she loved mushrooms very much,” said the Yi Zuo Yi Wang restaurant. “She ordered four portions of jian shou qing. It was an extremely magical day,” it added. During her visit to the country, Yellen surprised observers by “repeatedly bowing” to her Chinese counterpart, who did not reciprocate, said The Times. The paper wonders if the mushrooms explain her “high diplomacy”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Irenie Forshaw", "The Week Uk", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Richard Windsor", "Harold Maass", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/07/18"}]}

Crews prepare for June 1 liftoff", "text": "The Boeing Starliner is set to launch Saturday afternoon from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nThe mission has been delayed nearly a month due to an oxygen leak on the rocket and then a helium leak on part of the spacecraft.\n\nThe two NASA astronauts flying the commercial crew mission are Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams.\n\nThe highly-anticipated first crewed mission of Boeing’s Starliner appears poised to finally take off on Saturday afternoon as the aeronautics company seeks to prove the spacecraft's capabilities to NASA.\n\nA series of technical issues waylaid the launch of the CST-100 Starliner, which was initially fueled up and ready for liftoff on May 6 before the mission was scrubbed. The Starliner's crew, Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, were even aboard the capsule before they had no choice but to exit and head back to their quarters.\n\nWilmore and Williams, both former Navy pilots before they joined NASA, returned to Houston on May 10 to spend extra time with their families as mission engineers worked to fix the issues ailing Starliner.\n\nThe launch was delayed again later in May as a result of a helium leak from the capsule's propulsion system. But at long last, the spacecraft is apparently ready to head to the International Space Station for about a week before the crew returns to Earth.\n\nHere's what to know about the launch and Starliner, which Boeing hopes will soon compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX capsule for NASA missions to low-Earth orbit.\n\nGraphics:Starliner joins Dragon in expanding American space access\n\nWhy were past launches scrubbed, delayed?\n\nThe mission has been delayed nearly a month due first to an oxygen leak on the rocket and then a helium leak on part of the spacecraft.\n\nThe United Launch Alliance, which manufactured the rocket, said in a statement that trouble with a valve in the rocket's upper stage prompted engineers to scrub the initial launch on May 6. Mission programmers initially requested a delay to May 17 to have time to replace a pressure regulation valve on the rocket's liquid oxygen tank, NASA said.\n\nThe team was able to replace the valve and re-pressurize the system, but then engineers encountered another obstacle: a small helium leak in Starliner's service module. The issue required the launch date to be pushed back once again, according to an update from Boeing.\n\nHelium, which is not combustible or toxic, is used in spacecraft thruster systems to allow the thrusters to fire.\n\nCrews investigated and created a workaround to ensure the safe return of astronauts even in the most extreme scenarios, Florida Today reported.\n\nAs of this week, NASA and the space station both decided to continue with the launch without repairing the helium leak.\n\nWhile the fix would require replacing a patch only roughly the size of a button, it would be a complicated process for a leak that impacts only one of 28 thrusters, reported AFP.\n\n\"We can handle this particular leak if that leak rate were to grow even up to 100 times,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, reported AFP. Instead, teams will simply monitor the leak upon launch.\n\nWhat is the Boeing Starliner?\n\nStarliner is intended to be a vehicle that can ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station as NASA pivots to more partnerships with private industry.\n\nAs part of NASA’s commercial crew program, Boeing was awarded $4.8 billion, while its competitor, SpaceX, was awarded $3.1 billion in 2014 to develop their respective spacecraft, Florida Today reported. Under NASA's more ambitious commercial lunar program, it's also paid SpaceX $2.9 billion to develop the first commercial human lander for the agency's Artemis moon missions and eventually trips to Mars.\n\nSpaceX, whose Dragon spacecraft flew its first human mission in 2020, recently saw its Crew-7 return to Earth after nearly 200 days aboard the International Space Station. The eighth crew comprised of three NASA astronauts and one cosmonaut launched on March 3 and docked on March 5 to await the arrival of Boeing's Starliner capsule.\n\nThe Starliner was designed to accommodate no more than seven passengers for missions to low-Earth orbit. For NASA, the capsule is intended to carry four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the space station.\n\nIf the mission is a success, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station, according to the U.S. space agency.\n\nWho are the NASA astronauts crewing the Starliner?\n\nThe two NASA astronauts flying the commercial crew mission are Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams. Both are Navy test pilots who have flown in space twice, according to Florida Today, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\n◾ Williams, 58, is a former Naval test pilot with experience flying over 30 different aircraft. Selected as an astronaut in 1998, she has logged 322 days in space over two missions since her first flight in 2007.\n\n◾ Wilmore, 61, is a retired Navy captain who completed 21 combat missions during Operation Desert Storm before joining NASA in 200. Since then, he has logged 178 days in space after his first trip to orbit in 2009.\n\nOnce the Starliner launches and reaches the International Space Station, the astronauts are scheduled to spend a little more than a week testing the spacecraft and its subsystems before they board the capsule for a return trip to Earth. The craft will then land in the American Southwest using parachutes that will slow it down to 4 mph before inflating large airbags.\n\nHow to watch the Boeing Starliner launch\n\nBoeing and NASA are targeting 12:25 p.m. EDT Saturday for Starliner's launch from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The capsule will fly to space on top of an Atlas V rocket manufactured by the United Launch Alliance.\n\nNASA will provide live coverage beginning at 8:15 a.m. EDT on NASA+, NASA Television, the NASA app, the agency's YouTube page and its website. A postlaunch news conference is also planned.\n\nExpect more coverage when the Starliner is expected to dock at the forward-facing port of the International Space Station's Harmony module at approximately 1:50 p.m. Sunday.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The first time an Atlas V rocket has lifted astronauts into space. The first launch of humans from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Launch Complex 41.\n\nBut on a day of firsts, there is one thing that's not: the two NASA astronauts flying Starliner to the International Space Station bring with them extensive experience in space and at the orbiting outpost. Astronaut Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, the Starliner pilot, described the mission last week as \"feeling like going home.\"\n\nWilliams and fellow astronaut Butch Wilmore , the mission commander, share Navy test pilot backgrounds and both have flown on two NASA missions to the station. Both have been training years for this flight, as they waited through multiple delays. The Starliner, like SpaceX's Dragon, is being contracted by NASA to ferry crews to-and-from the ISS.\n\n\"Because it is a test flight, we give extra attention ... they are checking out a lot of the systems, the life support, the manual control, all of those things that you want to be checked out,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson at a Friday news conference. \"That's why we put two test pilots onboard.\"\n\nThe Starliner capsule is set to launch atop the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on the Crewed Flight Test mission at 10:34 p.m. Monday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Launch Complex 41. The early weather outlook appears good with a 95 percent chance of acceptable conditions for launch.\n\n\"We’re at peak performance right now and we’re really looking forward to executing this weekend, executing the launch and executing the mission in the same way that we got here,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager for Boeing's Starliner program. \"We’re ready to go.\"\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the mission.\n\nDon't miss the next rocket launch:Is there a launch today? Upcoming rocket launch schedule for SpaceX, ULA, NASA in Florida\n\nWhere will Starliner launch from?\n\nStarliner will launch from Space Force Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral.\n\nThe pad has been the launch site for historic missions beginning with the Titan rockets in 1965. Other notable missions include the New Horizons deep space probe, the Voyager spacecraft and even the Curiosity Mars rover.\n\nWhat has never happened from the pad before: the launch of humans. The Atlas V rocket has launched from the site since 2002, but this will be the first time it carries astronauts to space.\n\nTo prepare for this mission, the launch complex recently saw the addition of a crew access arm.\n\nAnother interesting note: the last crewed launch from this military side of the Cape occurred in 1968 with the launch of Apollo 7. All other crewed launches since have taken place from Kennedy Space Center.\n\nAlso, this will be only the sixth time in history NASA astronauts have flown a new spacecraft. These include: Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Space Shuttle, Dragon, and now Starliner.\n\nRole of Boeing Starliner in NASA's Commercial Crew Program\n\nThe day the Starliner spacecraft was finally mated to the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket for the crew flight test was a long time coming for the team at Boeing.\n\nNASA originally awarded Boeing the contract to fly astronauts in 2014, alongside SpaceX. Boeing received $4.8 billion for Starliner while SpaceX received $3.1 billion for Dragon. Both companies were part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which replaced the space shuttle after its retirement in 2011.\n\nBoth were late to deliver, hoping to launch as soon as 2017 and restore NASA astronauts access to space from American soil (NASA astronauts were hitching rides aboard the Russian Soyuz).\n\nFollowing a successful crewed demo flight in 2020, SpaceX has since flown eight NASA crews and multiple private crews to the ISS.\n\nAfter facing multiple setbacks, including issues found after a successful uncrewed docking with the ISS and landing in 2022, Boeing hopes to prove the capability of its Starliner spacecraft to take on its designated role ferrying NASA crews to the station.\n\nOnce successful, Starliner will fly NASA crews in rotation with SpaceX's Dragon− a needed redundancy to ensure NASA access to low Earth orbit.\n\nGoing beyond this test flight, according to Boeing, NASA has already contracted for six crewed missions on Starliner.\n\nNASA astronaut and former NASA Associate Administrator and former KSC Director Bob Cabana told FLORIDA TODAY that the success of Boeing Starliner is essential to ensure NASA always has a way to access the station.\n\n“We want that dissimilar redundancy,” said Cabana, adding that NASA cannot rely on solely one company.\n\nWith the commercial crew program charged with ensuring access to low Earth orbit, NASA continues to work on its Artemis program, which will fly a crew around the Moon as soon as late 2025. That will mark the first time humans have returned to the Moon since the Apollo missions ended over five decades ago.\n\nNASA's confidence in Starliner\n\nFLORIDA TODAY spoke with Kim Ess, manager of the Integrated Performance Office (IPO) in NASA’s Commercial Crew Program (CCP) at Johnson Space Center. Ess explained that NASA has done demonstration testing alongside Boeing to ensure the safety of the spacecraft.\n\n\"We took more risks when it was just a test flight,\" Ess said on the topic of the second uncrewed flight in 2022. \"Now that our payload, our two crew members, Butch and Suni, we did a lot more research.\"\n\nShe explained that NASA provided Boeing requirements to meet before this crewed flight, and Boeing returned with the necessary results.\n\n\"In many cases, we do an independent verification of those requirements,\" Ess said. She used the example of Boeing demonstrating that they would be able to return the crew safely during a simulation of the landing. NASA ran the same simulation at the organization's Johnson Space Center to compare the data.\n\n\"Any differences, we bring in and we talk with them and see 'okay, did you have an error in your model, or did we have an error in our model, or are these true differences?'\" Ess said.\n\n\"As long as they're along the same lines, we're good. And we have done that extensively for this flight,\" Ess said.\n\nWhat is the Starliner spacecraft?\n\nBoeing calls it the Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner, or simply “Starliner”. Like SpaceX's Crew Dragon, it can carry a mix of crew and cargo or up to seven crew memebers.\n\nWith a total height of 16.5 ft (capsule + service module combined) and a diameter of 15 ft, it is a what Boeing refers to as \"a next-generation space capsule.\"\n\nThis Starliner spacecraft has a name\n\nThe capsule flying Monday was named Calypso by Williams.\n\nWilliams, a lover of the ocean, has stated in the past that she named the spacecraft Calypso after the ship of Jacque Cousteau, which was an ocean explorer in the mid-20th century.\n\nThat ship was remembered for its underwater observation chamber and being equipped with a helicopter and submersibles, assisting in scientific expeditions. Williams mentioned being excited by Cousteau's television show as a young girl and looked forward to watching his expeditions.\n\nWilliams has a special connection to Brevard County\n\nAfter gaining a B.S. in Physical Science from the U.S. Naval Academy, Williams graduated from Florida Tech in 1995 with her M.S. in Engineering Science.\n\nLast year, she gave a commencement speech to the 2023 Florida Tech graduates.\n\nWilliams' first chance to fly to space came when assigned to STS-116. On December 9, 2006, Williams and crew took off onboard Space Shuttle Discovery for a six month stay onboard the ISS.\n\nWilliams returned to the ISS during Expedition 32/33. Launching from Kazakhstan in a Soyuz spacecraft on July 14, 2012, Williams saw another long stay onboard the space station. After that 127-day visit to space, she accumulated a total of 322 days spent off the planet.\n\nNow, she said, she's been waiting a long time for this moment.\n\n\"With each launch that was rescheduled, I've been given perspective I would've never had without those delays,\" Williams said before going on to explain how the crew not only got more time to learn about the spacecraft, but to also help shape the Starliner program.\n\nThe Starliner crew's playlist and ride to the pad\n\nDuring a preflight NASA Q and A, Wilmore and Williams mentioned the new Astro Van. Unlike SpaceX crews, who ride in a Tesla, Boeing astronauts will ride to the rocket in a new van. This ride to the pad is reminiscence of the shuttle days, during which NASA astronauts rode in a similar van.\n\nOf course, there will be music on the way.\n\nAsked what would be on their playlist, Wilmore quipped \"Epic music.\" Smiling, he added, \"It's in a fight scene in Top Gun Maverick, it's on my playlist.\"\n\nGuardians at the Gate and Freedom Fighters are two songs Wilmore has on his list.\n\nWilliams, however, is going for a more relaxing feeling before launch. \"A bit of Country Western and a little bit of Pop. I got a little bit of Kenney Chesney, a little bit of Zac Brown ready to go,\" she said.\n\nHow to watch Boeing Starliner launch\n\nFLORIDA TODAY's Space Team will continue to bring you the latest information on the mission. While the launch is currently set for 10:34 p.m. Monday, various factors can change this.\n\nFollow the FLORIDA TODAY Live Blog on launch day as we await the liftoff of Starliner.\n\nTo received launch alerts and updates, download the free FLORIDA TODAY app and enable push alerts from the app settings.\n\nA night launch is difficult to miss under clear conditions. If you are on the Space Coast, simply look towards the sky above the area south of the Kennedy Space Center.\n\nShould conditions Monday night cause a scrub, the next backup launch opportunity is 10:11 p.m. Tuesday. But so far, weather looks like it will cooperate.\n\nWhat awaits the Starliner crew on the space station\n\nPlans call for Starliner to dock with the station about 26 1/2 hours after launch.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore will be busy testing all aspects of Starliner. Being a test flight, demonstrating that the spacecraft preforms as it should will be the crew's main focus.\n\nEss told FLORIDA TODAY that one of the biggest objectives is the crew's ability to take manual control of Starliner. While Starliner is autonomous, there must be the ability to control the spacecraft manually in case of an emergency situation.\n\n\"Prior to docking to the space station ... we're going to approach and then stop, and the crew is going to go through several flight test objectives for manual control and demonstrate that they can do it,\" said Ess.\n\nEss said the crew also will be monitoring the spacecraft's software performance.\n\nOnce Starliner receives certification to fly NASA crews, it will carry a crew of four on Starliner-1. For this reason, Williams and Wilmore stated during a May 1st press briefing that Crew-8, four astronauts who are currently onboard the ISS, will provide assistance in checking out that the spacecraft can comfortably fit a crew of four in space.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore stated that they plan to give Crew-8 the full Starliner tour.\n\nWhile their stay onboard the ISS is expected to be approximately eight days, there remains the possibly of this stay being extended due to various factors, such as weather at the landing site. As experienced NASA astronauts, Williams and Wilmore have the training needed to jump in and assist on the ISS if needed.\n\nWhere will Starliner land?\n\nAfter spending approximately a week on the International Space Station thoroughly testing every function of the spacecraft, the Starliner crew will return to Earth.\n\nLanding will not be like in the SpaceX Dragon, which lands in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nStarliner, as it did successfully in the uncrewed test flights, will land under a parachute system and airbags in the New Mexico desert. Boeing refers to it as a \"soft landing\".\n\nSpaceX also targeting Monday\n\nThere could be a doubleheader launch Monday.\n\nSpaceX is targeting a Monday morning Starlink mission from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, navigational warnings indicate.\n\nThough SpaceX has not publicly announced this mission, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and Coast Guard maritime safety bulletins show a Starlink launch window will open Monday from 11:34 a.m. to 4:05 p.m. EDT. SpaceX launches Falcon 9 rockets on its Starlink missions deploying satellites into low-Earth orbit.\n\nFor the latest on the launch, go to floridatoday.com/space.\n\nBrooke Edwards is a Space Reporter for Florida Today.

When is it ...", "text": "NASA announced another blastoff delay for the Boeing Starliner after a data review revealed a valve issue.\n\nAround 8:30 p.m. ET, a little over two hours before the scheduled rocket launch at 10:34 p.m., NASA made the decision to delay the launch on May 6 at Kennedy Space Center, NASA Communications Officer, Megan Cruz said during the news conference.\n\nNASA is now eyeing a May 17 at 6:16 p.m. ET launch date after the United Launch Alliance (ULA) initially said that the launch would not be able to take place any earlier than Friday. Mission engineers requested the delay in order to have time to replace a pressure regulation valve on the rocket's liquid oxygen tank, NASA said Wednesday.\n\nAfter completing a data review on Tuesday, the ULA team replaced a pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank on the Atlas V rocket’s Centaur upper stage, NASA’s news release said.\n\nULA rolled the rocket and the Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft back to its Vertical Integration Facility at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on Wednesday. There, the rocket will undergo several checks and replacements to prepare for the next launch, NASA said.\n\nMore on launch:What to know about the Boeing Starliner carrying 2 astronauts\n\nWhy was the launch delayed?\n\nDuring the pre-launch operations, the oxidization behavior of the pressure regulation valve led to the decision to delay the launch on May 6. Crew members and astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams exited out of the Space Launch Complex-41, the new release said.\n\nSpeaking about the delay NASA administrators acknowledged how viewers might feel after the delay announcement.\n\n“I know everybody was eager to see a launch. It would’ve been happening right about now,” Ken Bowersox, associate administrator at NASA space operations missions directive, said during the news conference. “And probably feeling a little disappointed that we didn’t get to see the launch, but all I want to say first is that good things are worth waiting for. And we’ll get a chance to see that rocket and spacecraft lift off the pad here soon.”\n\nAfter the valve history was analyzed to assess the risks of continued use, the ULA team and mission managers agreed that the valve need to be removed and replaced, the new release said.\n\nAlthough they understand how many people might feel the government agency wants to make sure the launch goes off with out a hitch.\n\n“As Suni has told us a couple of times, there’s nothing magical about a certain date to launch on, so we’re taking it one step at a time,” said Steve Stich, manager of NASA’s commercial crew program. “We’re going to launch when we’re ready and fly when its safe to do so.”\n\nBoth astronauts will remain in quarantine at NASA Kennedy Space Center until the next launch.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to NASA for comment but have not heard back yet.\n\nWhat is the Boeing Starliner?\n\nThe Starliner was designed to accommodate no more than seven passengers for missions to low-Earth orbit.\n\nFor NASA, the capsule is intended to carry four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the International Space Station.\n\nWilliams, 58, and Wilmore, 61, were selected for the inaugural crewed flight of the Starliner, which completed two previous flight tests with no one aboard. Both astronauts are Navy veterans who have each ventured to space twice before.\n\nOnce the Starliner launches and reaches the space station, the astronauts are scheduled to spend a little more than a week testing the spacecraft and its subsystems before they board the capsule for a return trip to Earth.

According to the organization, Wimore and Williams could stay at the International Space Station (ISS) until later in the summer.\n\nScientists and engineers are working through testing to better understand and resolve problems that occurred during Starliner's launch and flight last month, including some misfiring thrusters and helium leaks. The testing is expected to conclude by the end of the week.\n\n\"I think we're really working to try to follow the data and see when's the earliest that we could target for undocking and landing,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA’s commercial crew program. \"I think some of the data suggest optimistically maybe it's by the end of July, but we'll just follow the data each step at a time and at the right time figure out when the right undock opportunity is.\"\n\nThough teams are looking to have Wimore and Williams depart from the space station before a crew turnover in mid-August, Starliner has been deemed safe to return to Earth at any time in an emergency.\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams check in from space\n\nSpeaking in a separate news conference Wednesday streaming live from the ISS, Wilmore and Williams said they're \"not complaining\" about spending more time away from Earth.\n\n\"We are having a great time here on ISS,\" Williams said. \"Butch and I have been up here before, and it feels like coming back home. It feels good to float around, it feels good to be in space and work up here with the International Space Station team. It's great to be up here, so I'm not complaining, Butch isn't complaining that we're here for a couple extra weeks.\"\n\nAnd while the idea of being up in space longer than initially planned may sound scary to some, Wilmore and Williams are confident in Starliner, its team and their ability to get back home safely.\n\n\"We're absolutely confident (it'll get us back safe),\" Wilmore said.\n\n'Let's put some fire in this rocket':Crewed Boeing Starliner finally launches from Florida\n\nWhen will the Starliner return to Earth?\n\nStarliner's return to Earth has been repeatedly delayed since its initial planned reentry no later than a week after launch. It was then pushed to no earlier than June 18, then June 22, then June 25.\n\nNow, Starliner and its crew aren't expected back until the end of July at the earliest.\n\nThe changes were partially to better prepare the Starliner crew for the \"long-term goal of having it perform a six-month docked mission at the space station,\" Stich said in an announcement in June. NASA also later mentioned spacewalks, data collection and further testing as reasons for the delay.\n\n“We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process,” Stich said in an update June 21. “We are letting the data drive our decision-making relative to managing the small helium system leaks and thruster performance we observed during rendezvous and docking.\"\n\nWhen it is time for Starliner to return, it will land in New Mexico. Starliner will \"descend under parachutes to land in the desert grounds of White Sands,\" according to Boeing. After the ship slows to about 4 mph, airbags attached to the bottom will deploy and soften its landing.\n\n\"The landing will mark the first time an American capsule has touched down on land with astronauts aboard,\" the company said in the release.\n\n\"I feel confident that if we had to, if there was a problem with ISS, we could get in our spacecraft and we could undock, talk to our team and figure out the best way to come home,\" Williams said in the virtual conference on Wednesday. \"We've practiced a lot, so I have a feeling, I have a real good feeling in my heart that this spacecraft will bring us home no problem.\"\n\nWhat is the Starliner crew doing in space?\n\nWhat have the astronauts been doing all that extra time in space? Quite a lot, actually, starting right from launch.\n\n\"Launch was spectacular, I mean truly amazing,\" said Wilmore, noting that the spacecraft performed \"unbelievably well\" and with \"amazing\" precision.\n\nThe second day after launch, Wilmore said, the loss of function in two RCS jets made handling noticeably different, but the pair had practiced and been certified for manual control. They manually took over the ship for about an hour while teams on the ground troubleshot and got the jets back.\n\nOnce arriving at ISS, the two integrated in with the exiting crew. They are fully certified for all aspects of life aboard the space station, said Wilmore, including spacewalks, operating technology and maintenance, which they have done \"a lot of.\"\n\n\"That's part of living here: You've got to keep that space station going,\" Wilmore said.\n\nThe two have also gotten to participate in a lot of scientific experimentation, according to WIlliams. From gene sequencing to using a 3D-printed moon microscope, they are keeping busy as temporary members of the ISS crew. More testing will be done on Starliner's functions and how to optimize them before, during and after undocking as well.\n\nStarliner launches after delays\n\nWilmore and Williams launched into space on June 5 after several last-minute scrubs delayed the plans.\n\nThe inaugural crewed flight of Boeing's CST-100 Starliner, meant to compete with the likes of Elon Musk's SpaceX spacecraft, was waylaid by a series of technical problems. It began on May 6, the original launch date, when trouble with a valve in the rocket's upper stage forced the mission to be scrubbed.\n\nThe team was able to replace the valve, but then engineers encountered another obstacle: a small helium leak in Starliner's service module. That issue caused additional delays until it finally lifted off.\n\nAdditional helium leaks in the Starliner's propulsion system were found after launch. During a media teleconference in late June, Stich, manager of NASA’s commercial crew program, said five leaks had been discovered since Starliner docked at ISS.\n\nThe valve that malfunctioned during launch also did not come back online when the crew test-fired the spacecraft's thrusters. The crew did not try to test-fire the defective valve and they don't plan to use it during the return flight \"out of an abundance of caution,\" Stich said.\n\nStill, the craft safely navigated to the space station, docking autonomously the next afternoon on the forward-facing port of the station's Harmony module.\n\nContributing: Eric Lagatta, Jonathan Limehouse and Natalie Neysa Alund", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/06/24/boeing-starliner-update-return-delayed-again-astronauts-stuck-iss/74192478007/", "title": "Boeing Starliner return delayed again for spacewalks, study of ...", "text": "Boeing and NASA are once again \"adjusting\" the return home of two astronauts from the International Space Station on the Starliner spacecraft.\n\nSuni Williams and Butch Wilmore were scheduled to stay at the ISS for just a week after docking there June 6. Now they aren't expected to make the trip back to Earth until at least early July, following two scheduled spacewalks and continued assessments of reported issues on the spacecraft, Boeing announced in a June 21 update.\n\nThe space organizations have not announced a new return date after most recently saying the astronuats might come back Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nHere's what we know.\n\nStarliner's return delayed for spacewalks, review of spacecraft issues\n\nMoving the Starliner's undocking and landing from Wednesday deconflicts with \"a series of planned (ISS) spacewalks while allowing mission teams time to review propulsion system data,\" the aerospace company said in the update.\n\nThe spacewalks were scheduled for Monday and July 2, NASA and Boeing said, meaning the astronauts wouldn't return until after those were complete. The spacewalk that was supposed to happen Monday was canceled following a spacesuit issue. NASA has not yet said how that will impact the planned spacewalk schedule or if it will further delay the astronauts' return.\n\nUSA TODAY contacted Boeing, who referred questions to be asked to NASA. USA TODAY contacted NASA on Monday morning but has not yet received a response.\n\nThe crew is also reviewing some issues with the Starliner spacecraft.\n\n“We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process,” Steve Stich, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program manager, said in the update. “We are letting the data drive our decision making relative to managing the small helium system leaks and thruster performance we observed during rendezvous and docking.\"\n\nStitch also said an \"agency-level review\" would be necessary due to the duration of the mission. He compared it to what was done ahead of NASA's SpaceX Demo-2 return after it spent two months in orbit.\n\nUS spacewalk 90 canceled\n\nAlthough NASA and Boeing moved the Starliner's return to accommodate the spacewalks, U.S. spacewalk 90 was scrapped Monday morning due to \"a water leak in the service and cooling umbilical unit on NASA astronaut Tracy C. Dyson’s spacesuit,\" according to NASA.\n\nThe water leak was noticed after Dyson and astronaut Mike Barratt set their suits to battery power Monday morning, NASA said.\n\nThe spacewalk was initially scheduled for June 14, but that attempt was delayed due to a \"spacesuit discomfort issue.\"\n\nThe spacewalk is planned to \"remove a faulty electronics box from a communications antenna on the starboard truss of the space station,\" NASA said. The astronauts also would have collected samples for analysis to \"understand the ability of microorganisms to survive and reproduce on the exterior of the orbiting laboratory,\" according to the government agency.\n\nAre the astronauts stuck in space?\n\nWhile Wilmore and Williams' return home continues to be delayed, Boeing said plenty of supplies remain for the astronauts and the station's schedule is \"relatively open through mid-August.\" In case of an emergency on the ISS, the Starliner is cleared to leave orbit and return to Earth, the company added.\n\nBoeing added the crew is \"not pressed for time to leave\" as the astronauts continue to help with station operations as needed and are completing NASA's add-on in-flight objectives.\n\n“The crew’s feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and they know that every bit of learning we do on the Crew Flight Test will improve and sharpen our experience for future crews,” Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing’s Starliner Program, said in the June 21 release.\n\n“Starliner is performing well in orbit while docked to the space station,” Stich said. “We are strategically using the extra time to clear a path for some critical station activities while completing readiness for Butch and Suni’s return on Starliner and gaining valuable insight into the system upgrades we will want to make for post-certification missions.”\n\nBoeing Starliner issues, including helium leaks\n\nHelium leaks and a malfunctioning thruster valve hampered the Starliner's launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida on June 5. These same issues seem to be still affecting the spacecraft weeks later.\n\nThere's been a series of helium leaks in the Starliner's propulsion system, Stich said during a media teleconference on June 18. So far, five leaks have been found since the Starliner has been docked at the ISS, he added.\n\n\"The path going forward is to continue to look at the helium system to try to understand what's happening, again look at simulations for the remainder of the flight… and then the operational techniques to manage the helium system,\" Stich said.\n\nThe defective thruster valve, which is still offline as of June 15, is another problem but Stich said the crew did not plan to use it during the return flight \"out of an abundance of caution.\" The belief is that the valve went offline due to the extreme heat generated while the thruster system was firing \"in rapid succession\" to keep the Starliner on course with the space station, according to Stich.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/06/20/boeing-starliner-spacecraft-return-land-problems/74157797007/", "title": "Boeing's Starliner return delayed again: How and where it will land", "text": "The return of the Boeing Starliner has been delayed once again with astronauts now slated to return to Earth from the International Space Station no earlier than June 25, Boeing said.\n\nNASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore became the first crew to fly aboard the Starliner on June 5 for its maiden mission. They were initially going to spend just a week at the space station, but have now remained there since they docked the Starliner spacecraft there on June 6.\n\nThe astronauts have been \"testing spacecraft systems and performing tasks aboard the orbiting laboratory\" ever since, according to the release.\n\n\"Mission teams supporting NASA’s Boeing Crew Flight Test continue to review Starliner’s data from the completed test objectives,\" Boeing said.\n\nWhen will the Boeing Starliner return?\n\nThe primary undocking opportunity is now targeting \"no earlier than 10:10 p.m. EDT\" on June 25, Boeing said in the update. The astronauts will tentatively land around 4:51 a.m. on June 26 at the White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico.\n\nBefore the new return date, the Starliner was previously scheduled to be back on Earth by June 22. Before the June 22 return date, the spacecraft was anticipated to land no earlier than June 18.\n\nThe changes in return dates are partially due to the crew staying longer to better prepare the Starliner for the \"long-term goal of having it perform a six-month docked mission at the space station,\" Steve Stich, manager of NASA’s commercial crew program, said in a news release announcing the June 22 return date.\n\nSome ways the crew is preparing the Starliner include performing \"additional hatch operations,\" repeating some \"safe haven\" testing and assessing piloting and thrusting capabilities, according to the release.\n\n“We have an incredible opportunity to spend more time at (the) station and perform more tests which provides invaluable data unique to our position,” Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager for Boeing, said in the release. “As the integrated NASA and Boeing teams have said each step of the way, we have plenty of margin and time on station to maximize the opportunity for all partners to learn – including our crew.”\n\nBoeing Starliner problems, including helium leaks\n\nAmid the Starliner's launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida on June 5, the crew dealt with helium leaks in the spacecraft and a malfunctioning valve on the rocket.\n\nDuring a media teleconference on Tuesday, Stich spoke more about a series of helium leaks in the Starliner's propulsion system and the next steps forward for the spacecraft. So far, five leaks have been discovered since Starliner has been on the space station, he added.\n\n\"The path going forward is to continue to look at the helium system to try to understand what's happening, again look at simulations for the remainder of the flight... and then the operational techniques to manage the helium system,\" Stich said.\n\nThe valve that went faulty during launch also did not come back online when the crew test-fired the spacecraft's thrusters on Saturday. The crew did not try to test-fire the defective valve and they don't plan to use it during the return flight \"out of an abundance of caution,\" according to Stich.\n\nNASA and Boeing believe the thrusters went offline due to the high heat generated while the system was firing \"in rapid succession\" to keep the spacecraft on course with the space station, Stich said.\n\n“We’re taking our extra time given that this is a crewed vehicle, and we want to make sure that we haven’t left any stone unturned,” Stich said. “We also want to look at the systems and potential interaction between the systems, and make sure we haven’t missed something before we return. And we’re getting a lot of great data while we’re at the space station for not only this flight but for the next flight.”\n\nHow will the Boeing Starliner land?\n\nOnce undocked and deorbited, Starliner will \"descend under parachutes to land in the desert grounds of White Sands,\" according to the aerospace company. Airbags attached to the bottom of the spacecraft will soften its landing, Boeing added.\n\n\"The landing will mark the first time an American capsule has touched down on land with astronauts aboard,\" the company said in the release.\n\nNASA and Boeing specialists will pick up the crew after they land successfully, according to Boeing.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/07/boeing-starliner-scrubbed-new-launch-time/73596684007/", "title": "Boeing's Starliner mission was scrubbed Monday.

The United Launch Alliance, which manufactured the rocket, said in a statement that the cancellation was \"out of an abundance of caution for the safety of the flight and pad crew.\"\n\nTrouble with a valve in the rocket's upper stage prompted engineers to make the call to delay the long-awaited launch – a critical demonstration of Boeing's spacecraft as it seeks to win approval from NASA to make routine orbital trips on the space agency's behalf.\n\nNASA is now eyeing a May 17 launch date after the United Launch Alliance initially said that the launch would not be able to take place any earlier than Friday.

The United Launch Alliance said the decision came after an anomaly was detected on the pressure regulation valve in the liquid oxygen tank of the rocket's upper stage.\n\nNASA and Boeing also confirmed the postponement. The two-person crew of Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams safely exited Starliner and returned to their quarters, Boeing said on its website.\n\n\"The team needs additional time to complete a full assessment,\" the United Launch Alliance said in a statement.\n\nWhen will the Boeing Starliner launch now?\n\nAfter the mission was canceled, the United Launch Alliance initially said that it would target another launch attempt no earlier than Friday.\n\nHowever, engineers who have since analyzed the data to fully understand the issue have determined that more time is needed. Now, NASA is saying that the next attempt will take place no earlier than 6:16 p.m. May 17.\n\nWhat is the Boeing Starliner?\n\nThe Starliner was designed to accommodate no more than seven passengers for missions to low-Earth orbit.\n\nFor NASA, the capsule is intended to carry four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the International Space Station.\n\nWilliams, 58, and Wilmore, 61, were selected for the inaugural crewed flight of the Starliner, which completed two previous flight tests with no one aboard. Both astronauts are Navy veterans who have each ventured to space twice before.\n\nOnce the Starliner launches and reaches the space station, the astronauts are scheduled to spend a little more than a week testing the spacecraft and its subsystems before they board the capsule for a return trip to Earth. The craft will land in the American Southwest using parachutes that will slow it down to 4 mph before inflating large airbags.\n\nWhy is NASA contracting with Boeing?\n\nBoeing hopes to join Elon Musk's SpaceX as one of two companies contracted by NASA for routine missions to the space station and low-Earth orbit.\n\nAs part of NASA’s commercial crew program, Boeing was awarded $4.8 billion and SpaceX was awarded $3.1 billion in 2014 to develop their respective spacecraft, Florida Today reported.\n\nUnder NASA's more ambitious commercial lunar program, it's also paid SpaceX $2.9 billion to develop the first commercial human lander for the agency's Artemis moon missions and eventually trips to Mars.\n\nSpaceX, whose Dragon spacecraft flew its first human mission in 2020, recently saw its Crew-7 return to Earth after nearly 200 days aboard the International Space Station. The eighth crew comprised of three NASA astronauts and one cosmonaut launched on March 3 and docked on March 5 to await the arrival of Boeing's Starliner capsule.\n\nIf the mission is a success, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station, according to NASA.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The Crew-7 members spent their stint in low-Earth orbit contributing to a variety of science experiments, some of which were to help prepare NASA for future crewed lunar missions under its Artemis program as it sets the stage for expeditions to Mars.\n\nOne of the crew's members, NASA astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli, was even part of a rare all-female spacewalk.\n\nTotal solar eclipse:With one month to go, here's everything to know about the total solar eclipse on April 8\n\nWho was part of SpaceX Crew-7?\n\nMoghbeli was the sole American who was part of the four-member Crew-7 who launched Aug. 26 from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nAlso part of the crew were Roscosmos cosmonaut Konstantin Borisov, Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen with the European Space Agency, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Satoshi Furukawa.\n\nIt took the crew about 30 hours after lift-off to dock to the International Space Station's Harmony module’s port.\n\nDuring the course of their stay, the four spacefarers traveled more than 84.4 million miles, completing 3,184 orbits around Earth, NASA said. While Mogensen has now logged 209 days in space in two flights and Furukawa has logged 366 days, the mission marked the first spaceflight for Moghbeli and Borisov.\n\nThe Crew-7 flight was part of NASA’s commercial crew program in which the space agency is partnering with private companies like SpaceX to ferry trained astronauts to the space station for scientific missions. The eighth crew comprised of three NASA astronauts and one cosmonaut launched March 3 and docked March 5 just days before their predecessors prepared to depart on Monday.\n\nThe partnership with private industry is meant to free up NASA to focus on building spacecrafts and rockets for deep space missions.\n\n\"This international crew showed that space unites us all,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. \"It’s clear that we can do more – we can learn more – when we work together.\"\n\nWhat did the crew do aboard the International Space Station?\n\nThe crew were able to conduct hundreds of experiments during the science and research mission, including the first study of the human response to different spaceflight durations.\n\nThey also experimented with growing food on the space station, a critical capability needed for future deep-space flights and long-term crewed missions, NASA said.\n\nIn November, Moghbeli conducted a spacewalk with fellow NASA astronaut Loral O’Hara, making for a rare moment when two women exited the station to complete maintenance activities in the void of space. Together, the astronauts replaced one of the 12 trundle bearing assemblies on a solar alpha rotary joint, which allows them to rotate properly and generate electricity to power the orbital complex.\n\nAs NASA eyes future crewed missions to the moon and beyond, Nelson said the experiments will contribute to the knowledge needed to send humans into the cosmos.\n\nIf NASA is able to launch its delayed Artemis II mission to circumnavigate the moon by the projected end of 2025, it would make for the first crewed lunar mission since the space agency's Apollo program came to an end in 1972. Ultimately, the U.S. agency hopes to send astronauts back to the lunar surface itself in 2026 for Artemis III to establish a base of operations ahead of trips to Mars.\n\n\"The science experiments conducted during their time in space will help prepare for NASA’s bold missions at the moon, Mars, and beyond,\" Nelson said, \"all while benefitting humanity here on Earth.”\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Previous coverage below:\n\n⋯\n\nHurricane Lee roared to Category 5 intensity Thursday far out in the Atlantic Ocean, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nLee's winds reached 160 mph by 11 p.m. Thursday, doubling its wind speeds over 24 hours. The powerful hurricane is forecast to strengthen further, reaching winds of 180 mph by Friday morning.\n\nThough still far out at sea, the hurricane center warned that \"dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along most of the U.S. East Coast beginning Sunday.\"\n\nWhether Lee will make landfall or blow out to sea remains a key question.\n\nMeanwhile, the season's 13th named storm – Margot – formed in the Atlantic on Thursday. Just 290 miles west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands, it's forecast to become a hurricane over the weekend as it moves north in the Atlantic far away from land.\n\nRapid intensification to continue\n\nLee is the fourth hurricane of the 2023 Atlantic season.\n\nForecasters from the hurricane center, AccuWeather and others accurately predicted Lee would rapidly intensify to a Category 5 strength on Thursday, but its top winds now are expected to peak as much as 15 mph higher than originally forecast earlier in the day.\n\nLee was one of two Category 5 strength hurricanes being watched by the hurricane center. Hurricane Jova is spinning over the open Pacific Ocean, far from land.\n\nWhere is Lee now?\n\nAs of 11 p.m. Thursday, Lee was about 700 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands in the northeastern Caribbean, moving to the west-northwest at 14 mph.\n\n\"Additional strengthening appears likely, as Lee remains in a low-shear environment and over very warm waters,\" the center's discussion said.\n\nLong-range forecasts suggest Lee will likely curve north next week before reaching Florida. Potential impacts from Lee along the rest of the U.S. East Coast remain uncertain.\n\nSince 2016, the Atlantic has had 7 Category 5 hurricanes: Matthew in 2016, Irma in 2017, Maria in 2017, Michael in 2018, Dorian in 2019, and Ian in 2022, reported Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach on X.\n\nWilma holds the record for rapid intensification\n\nDespite its rapid ascent into such high wind speeds, Lee isn’t the storm to do so fastest in the Atlantic. That record belongs to Hurricane Wilma.\n\nIn October 2005, Wilma rocketed from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in 24 hours, according to the hurricane center’s post-storm report. Wilma also holds the record for the lowest barometric pressure in an Atlantic storm, reaching a low of 882 millibars.\n\nWhere is Lee headed? Will it reach the East Coast?\n\nLee is forecast to move northwest over the open Atlantic Ocean over the next few days.\n\nBeyond that, all major hurricane models that meteorologists use to forecast storms indicate that Lee will curve away from Florida. Looking even further ahead, the latest forecasts suggest Lee's path could vary across a wide swath spanning from the U.S. East Coast northward to eastern Canada, or skirt away from the coast entirely.\n\n\"An eventual landfall in the Canadian Maritime provinces or the U.S. East Coast north of Florida is possible after Lee passes Bermuda, as is a recurvature to the northeast, out to sea,\" said meteorologist Jeff Masters of Yale Climate Connections.\n\nAccuWeather meteorologist Bernie Rayno said, \"Right now, the area in the United States that really needs to pay attention includes locations from the Outer Banks of North Carolina up to the Northeast.\"\n\nWhatever happens, most of the beaches along the eastern United States are likely to see stronger surf and dangerous rip currents next week.\n\nHurricane center's forecast track for Lee\n\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nSwells expected to reach the Caribbean\n\n\"Swells generated by Lee are expected to reach portions of the Lesser Antilles on Friday, and reach the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda this weekend,\" the hurricane center said. \"These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\"\n\nHow is the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season stacking up?\n\nLee was the 12th named storm to form this season. It's the season's fourth hurricane.\n\nLee is also the third Category 4 storm this year, following Franklin and Idalia.\n\nAn average hurricane season produces 14 named storms and seven hurricanes. Even before the season started, forecasters said 2023 was likely to be a busier-than-normal season, but in August they bumped up their predictions, calling for 14-21 named storms.\n\nSpaghetti models for Hurricane Lee\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest-performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nHurricane Jova already a Category 5 storm\n\nIn the Pacific, Hurricane Jova churned through open waters far from Mexico’s southwest coast as a Category 5 storm. It posed no threat to land.\n\nIt was located some 535 miles southwest of the southern tip of Baja California and moving west-northwest at 16 mph with winds up to 160 mph.\n\nJova underwent rapid intensification over the past day, as the storm's winds increased by a whopping 86 mph in 24 hours from Wednesday to Thursday, AccuWeather reported.\n\nThe storm is expected to weaken starting late Thursday.\n\nContributing: Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY Network; USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/06/29/hurricane-beryl-record-hot-oceans/74255415007/", "title": "Record hot oceans driving Hurricane Beryl", "text": "Hurricane experts and meteorologists watched in shock over the weekend as Tropical Storm Beryl continued to strengthen quickly in the tropical Atlantic Ocean far earlier than storms typically do, with record-warm ocean temperatures helping it make history.\n\nWithin 24 hours after forming as a tropical depression, Beryl's winds had reached hurricane strength – 75 mph – by 5 p.m. Saturday, with an impressive form on satellite images.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center forecast projected Saturday afternoon that favorable conditions would help Beryl rapidly intensify to a major hurricane – with wind speeds up to 115 mph – as it reached Barbados and the fringe of islands that border the eastern Caribbean on Monday morning. Beryl exceeded their expectations, by a lot.\n\nBy 11:30 a.m. Sunday, Beryl had become a Category 4 hurricane, with winds of 130 mph. That's a gain of 95 mph in just 42.5 hours.\n\nOnce it moves into the Caribbean later Monday it will encounter another body of water historically warm for this early in the summer. The hurricane center expects it to remain a hurricane as it reaches Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday.\n\n\"If you asked the water in the Caribbean Sea what day it was, it would guess September 10,” said Brian McNoldy, a senior research scientist at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School, in a post on X Saturday morning.\n\nThe warm ocean temperatures continue a record-breaking trend that began in May 2023. Like many scientists, McNoldy has been riveted by the exceedingly warm temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. In June, he called the water temperatures in the region where hurricanes typically develop in the Atlantic “absolutely stunning.”\n\nOn Saturday, he posted on X: “You'd think the shock value of this would wear off, but it's becoming MORE shocking!”\n\nSo far in 2024, ocean heat content has been even hotter on most days than the records set last summer. That's dangerous for hurricane season because warm water is like a big, juicy energy drink for hurricanes, supplying warm moisture that helps fuel the inner core structure that makes storms stronger.\n\nSeasonal forecasters warned in the spring that these hotter-than-normal ocean temperatures could play a major role in storm development this hurricane season. It’s the reason that all major outlooks called for a busier-than-normal season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Colorado State University both predicted more named storms this year than they’d ever predicted before.\n\nStill, hurricane experts are reeling at the news that Beryl became a major hurricane by June 30, while still east of the Windward Islands.\n\nHow unusual is it to have an early hurricane?\n\nOn Saturday, Beryl became the strongest storm ever to form in the tropical Atlantic so far east of the Windward Islands in June, said Phil Klotzbach, a meteorologist and research scientist at Colorado State, in a post on X Saturday. However, it's worth noting, he said, that storm intensities so far out in the Atlantic may have been underestimated before the satellite era that began in 1966.\n\nBy Sunday morning, Beryl had become the third earliest major hurricane on record in the entire Atlantic region, trailing only Alma on June 8, 1966, and Audrey on June 27, 1957, Klotzbach said.\n\nSince 1851, only two previous hurricanes on record have been within 100 miles of Barbados prior to August 1: Emily in 2005 and Elsa in 2021.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, only five major hurricanes, with winds of more than 111 mph, have been reported in the Atlantic Ocean before the first week of July, said Michael Lowry, a hurricane specialist at WPLG Local 10 News in Miami, in a post on X.\n\n\"It's astonishing to see a forecast for a major (Category 3+) hurricane in June anywhere in the Atlantic, let alone this far east in the deep tropics, \" wrote Lowry, a former National Hurricane Center specialist.\n\nHurricane categories are set based on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, the lowest being a Category 1, with winds of 74-93 mph and the highest Category 5, with wind speeds of 157 mph or higher. Lowry said there's never been a Category 4 or Category 5 observed before July 8 when Hurricane Dennis reached that status in 2005.\n\nWhat is rapid intensification?\n\nIt's a phenomenon that occurs when a storm strengthens by at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period. Beryl's winds increased by 40 mph in 24 hours after forming on Friday afternoon.\n\nBeryl's winds increased by another 45 miles per hour in the 18 hours after the center's 5 p.m. forecast on Saturday.\n\nRapid intensification has been one of the biggest frustrations for hurricane forecasters. All four of the most destructive, Category 5 hurricanes to make landfall on the mainland U.S. over the past 100 years rapidly intensified.\n\nFor years, hurricanes would rapidly intensify with little to no warning, but today the technology for observing the environment around a hurricane and the ability to discern what may happen are better than ever, though still not perfect.\n\nScientists still aren't sure why some storms rapidly intensify, but they know it takes near-perfect atmospheric conditions inside and outside the storm.\n\nHow do hurricanes form?A USA TODAY visual story on the birth and power of ferocious storms\n\nWhat's the forecast for Beryl in Haiti and Jamaica?\n\nBeryl is forecast to move west-northwestward, passing near or over Haiti, Jamaica and Grand Cayman on Tuesday evening and Wednesday. Although it initially appeared that Beryl might lose strength quickly in the Caribbean, it's expected to remain a major hurricane through Wednesday.\n\nIts wind speeds are forecast to decline as it moves through the Caribbean, thanks to windier conditions that are less conducive to helping Beryl maintain its strength. Winds can shear off or disrupt cloud tops in hurricanes, breaking up the powerful inner core that helps a hurricane reach the higher echelon of wind speeds.\n\nHurricane tracker: Updates on the path of every storm\n\nHowever, the hurricane center warns there's large uncertainty in the forecast four and five days out, and residents and tourists in the central and western Caribbean should monitor Beryl's progress.\n\nWhy are water temperatures so warm?\n\nClimate change driven by fossil fuel emissions has had a steady impact on the oceans, which have absorbed much of the excess warming for decades, scientists say.\n\nThis spring, weak trade winds helped reinforce the warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic, Klotzbach said.\n\nBut the experts remain somewhat baffled by last year's sudden spike in temperatures and the ocean heat that continues to break records more than a year later. Their research continues.\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver covers climate and the environment for USA TODAY.

(More on another Tropical Storm Alberto below.)\n\nThere were 19 named storms, and 10 of those strengthened into hurricanes: Hurricane Chris, Hurricane Ernesto, Hurricane Gordon, Hurricane Isaac, Hurricane Kirk, Hurricane Leslie, Hurricane Michael, Hurricane Nadine, Hurricane Rafael, and Hurricane Sandy.\n\nThere were two major hurricanes in 2012, including Hurricane Michael, a category 3; and Hurricane Sandy, a Category 3. (Scroll down for info about the Category 5 Hurricane Michael.)\n\nIn 2012, Hurricane Sandy, aka Super Storm Sandy, was the season's deadliest Atlantic storm, causing almost $68 billion in damage, with 286 deaths attributed to the storm. Sandy was officially retired from the hurricane names list for the deaths and destruction it caused.\n\nTropical outlooks have begun.National Hurricane Center tracks its first tropical wave of 2023 season\n\nIs your name on the list?Retired hurricane names.

Pros weigh in\n\n2013 hurricane season\n\nThe 2013 Atlantic hurricane season did not start early. The first system that formed was Tropical Storm Andrea on June 5, 2013. Of the 14 named storms, two strengthened into hurricane status. There were no major hurricanes − a Category 3 or more − for 2013. However, that year was an active season, with total damage estimated to be about $1.5 billion and 56 deaths attributed to the storms that year.\n\n2014 hurricane season\n\nWhile this story is a roundup of when hurricane season started early, the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season didn't see a system form until July 1, a month after the official start. Of the eight named storms, six reached hurricane status, and two were considered major. The major hurricanes of 2014 were Hurricane Edouard, a Category 3, and Hurricane Gonzalo, a Category 4. Total damages from the 2014 hurricane season estimated to be about $372 million with 21 deaths attributed to the storms that year.\n\n2015 hurricane season\n\nThe 2015 Atlantic hurricane season (officially) kicked off May 8 with Tropical Storm Ana. The previous day, Ana had formed as a subtropical storm. Tropical Storm Ana made landfall May 10 near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. According to the Weather Channel, Tropical Storm Ana was the second earliest U.S. tropical cyclone landfall on record, with the first an unnamed tropical storm in February 1952 in Southern Florida. (More on another Tropical Storm Ana below.)\n\nThere were 11 named storms and one tropical depression. Four of those named storms strengthened into hurricanes: Hurricane Danny, Hurricane Fred, Hurricane Joaquin and Hurricane Kate.\n\nCelebrity sighting!NBC's Lester Holt returns to Florida for a Hurricane Ian series\n\nGood downloads:Stay prepared for the 2023 hurricane season with one of these five hurricane tracker apps\n\n2016 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe 2016 Atlantic hurricane season kicked off Jan. 12 with Hurricane Alex. According to the Weather Channel, Alex was the second Atlantic hurricane on record to start in January (Hurricane Alice formed on New Year's Eve 1954).\n\nThere were 15 named storms in 2016. Seven of those storms strengthened into hurricanes: Hurricane Alex, Hurricane Earl, Hurricane Gaston, Hurricane Hermine, Hurricane Matthew, Hurricane Nicole and Hurricane Otto. Fun fact: Hurricane Otto formed on a holiday, Thanksgiving 2016.\n\nThere were four major hurricanes of 2016: Hurricane Gaston, a Category 3; Hurricane Matthew, a Category 4; Hurricane Nicole, a Category 4; and Hurricane Otto, a Category 3. Hurricane Matthew devastated Haiti, with the death toll there at 546. At least 603 deaths were attributed to Hurricane Matthew. In Florida, Matthew left its mark in the First Coast and the Space Coast, causing at least $16.5 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2016, Hurricane Matthew, the season's deadliest Atlantic storm, was officially retired from the hurricane names list.\n\n2017 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe 2017 Atlantic hurricane season kicked off April 19 with Tropical Storm Arlene.\n\nThere were 17 named storms in 2017. Ten of those storms strengthened into hurricanes: Hurricane Franklin, Hurricane Gert, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Jose, Hurricane Katia, Hurricane Lee, Hurricane Maria, Hurricane Nate and Hurricane Ophelia.\n\nThe major hurricanes of 2017 were Hurricane Harvey as a category 4, Hurricane Irma as a category 5, Hurricane Jose as a category 4, Hurricane Maria as a category 5 and Hurricane Nate as a category 1 (at least 50 deaths were attributed to Nate).\n\nIn 2017, four storm names were retired from the hurricane names list because of the deaths and devastation caused: Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate.\n\nIan hit Southwest Florida beaches hard.What are they like after that monster hurricane?

Eight of those storms strengthened into hurricanes: Hurricane Beryl, Hurricane Chris, Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Helene, Hurricane Isaac, Hurricane Leslie, Hurricane Michael and Hurricane Oscar.\n\nThe major hurricanes of 2018 were Hurricane Michael, which made landfall in Mexico Beach as a category 5, and caused about $25 billion in damage. At least 64 deaths were attributed to Hurricane Michael. Hurricane Florence, which devastated parts of North Carolina and South Carolina as a category 4, caused $24 billion in damage. At least 54 deaths were attributed to Hurricane Florence.\n\nIn 2018, two storm names were retired from the hurricane names list because of the deaths and devastation caused: Florence and Michael.\n\n2019 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe 2019 Atlantic hurricane season kicked off May 20 with Subtropical Storm Andrea.\n\nThere were 18 named storms in 2019. Six of those storms strengthened into hurricanes: Hurricane Barry, Hurricane Dorian, Hurricane Humberto, Hurricane Jerry, Hurricane Lorenzo and Hurricane Pablo.\n\nThe major hurricanes of 2019 were Hurricane Dorian, a category 5; Hurricane Humberto, a category 3; and Hurricane Lorenzo, a category 5. At least 70 deaths were attributed to Hurricane Dorian, which caused about $3.4 billion in damage.\n\n2020 hurricane season\n\nThe 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was one active season. Not only did it break records with the number of storms during the season with 31 tropical depressions, but the world was also transformed by the coronavirus pandemic. There were so many systems, the Greek alphabet had to be used to name storms. From the Greek Alphabet, 2020 saw Subtropical Storm Alpha, Tropical Storm Beta, Hurricane Gamma, Hurricane Delta, Hurricane Epsilon, Hurricane Zeta, Tropical Storm Theta and Hurricane Iota. However, after the 2020 hurricane season, the use of the Greek alphabet for hurricane names was retired. The only other year the Greek alphabet was used during hurricane season was 2005.\n\nThe 2020 hurricane season kicked off May 16 with Tropical Storm Arthur.\n\nThere were 30 named storms in 2020, and 14 of those storms strengthened into hurricanes: Hurricane Hanna, Hurricane Isaias, Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Marco, Hurricane Nana, Hurricane Paulette, Hurricane Sally, Hurricane Teddy, Hurricane Gamma, Hurricane Delta, Hurricane Zeta, Hurricane Eta and Hurricane Iota.\n\nThere were seven major hurricanes of 2020 including Hurricane Laura, a Category 4; Hurricane Teddy, a Category 4; Hurricane Delta, a Category 4; Hurricane Epsilon, a Category 3; Hurricane Zeta, a Category 3; Hurricane Eta, a Category 4; and Hurricane Iota, a Category 4.\n\nIn 2020, three storm names were retired from the hurricane names list because of the deaths and devastation caused: Laura, Eta and Iota. Of course, the Greek names would permanently be retired from hurricane name lists after 2020.\n\n2021 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe 2021 Atlantic hurricane season kicked off May 22 with Tropical Storm Ana. Coincidentally, this is the second time an Atlantic hurricane season started with the name Ana, and it's the second time a hurricane season started before June 1. The 2015 Atlantic hurricane season kicked off May 8 with Tropical Storm Ana (scroll above for a recap).\n\nThere were 21 named storms in 2021. Seven of those storms strengthened into hurricanes: Hurricane Elsa, Hurricane Grace, Hurricane Henri, Hurricane Ida, Hurricane Larry, Hurricane Nicholas and Hurricane Sam.\n\nThere were four major hurricanes of 2021 including Hurricane Grace, a Category 3; Hurricane Ida, a Category 4; Hurricane Larry, a Category 3; and Hurricane Sam, a Category 4. Hurricane Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, causing extensive damage totaling about $55 billion for that state. The remnants of Hurricane Ida spawned several destructive tornadoes in New Jersey and New York. At least $75 billion in damage and 87 deaths were attributed to Hurricane Ida.\n\nIn 2021, only one storm name was retired from the hurricane names list because of the deaths and devastation caused: Ida.\n\nHurricane Nicole was a late one.Storm's impact in this Florida area saw a lot of damage\n\n2022 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe 2022 Atlantic hurricane season did not start before June 1. So the streak of \"early start to hurricane seasons\" lasted for seven years, from 2015 to 2022. However, the 2022 hurricane season did start June 5 with Tropical Storm Alex (see above for a recap on Hurricane Alex of 2016). Fun fact: Hurricane Lisa, a category 1, formed on Oct. 31, 2022, aka Halloween.\n\nThere were 14 named storms in 2022. Eight of those storms strengthened into hurricanes: Hurricane Danielle, Hurricane Earl, Hurricane Fiona, Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Julia, Hurricane Lisa, Hurricane Martin and Hurricane Nicole.\n\nThe major hurricanes of 2022 were Hurricane Fiona, a category 4, and Hurricane Ian, a category 5.\n\nIn 2022, only one storm name was retired from the hurricane names list because of the deaths and devastation caused: Ian.\n\nSangalang is a lead digital producer for USA TODAY Network-Florida.

And that's a conservative estimate, forecasters said.\n\nA major hurricane is one where maximum sustained winds are at least 111 mph, the minimum to be classified as a Category 3 hurricane. Major hurricanes are Category 3, 4 and 5 storms.\n\n\"By early next week, this system is forecast to move over near record warm sea-surface temperatures for the region in light (wind) shear conditions.\n\n\"It probably sounds like a broken record at this point in the season, but rapid intensification is a significant possibility,\" NHC forecasters said.\n\n\"With the next storm potentially tracking over deep warm water, it's not out of the question it can become another major hurricane and perhaps even a Category 5 storm,\" AccuWeather Hurricane Expert Dan Kottlowski said.\n\nForecast path: Where is Tropical Depression 15 and where is it going?\n\nSpecial note on the NHC cone: The forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nLocation: 1,150 miles east of the Lesser Antilles\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 35 mph\n\nMovement: northwest at 13 mph\n\nAt 5 p.m., the center of Tropical Depression 15 was located near latitude 15.4 North, longitude 44.0 West. The depression is moving toward the northwest near 13 mph, and this general motion is expected to continue for the next few days.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 35 mph, with higher gusts.\n\nGradual strengthening is forecast, but a faster rate of intensification is predicted later this weekend and early next week. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm Saturday and could become a hurricane late this weekend or early next week.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb.\n\nSpaghetti models for Tropical Depression 15\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nTropical Depression 15 could become Category 3 storm in 4 days\n\nRapid intensification is a significant possibility, and the official forecast could be conservative, NHC forecasters said.\n\n12 hours: 35 mph\n\n24 hours: 45 mph (tropical storm)\n\n36 hours: 60 mph\n\n48 hours: 70 mph\n\n60 hours: 80 mph (Category 1)\n\n72 hours: 100 mph (Category 2)\n\n96 hours: 115 mph (Category 3)\n\n120 hours: 115 mph\n\nWhat could affect where Tropical Depression 15 goes?\n\nThere is still some long-range uncertainty in how far west this system will go, which partially depends on the strength of a subtropical ridge in the wake of Tropical Storm Margot.\n\n“This next system is one to watch as a potential threat to the East Coast of the United States given how strong the Bermuda high-pressure area will be as it builds westward across the Atlantic,\" said Kottlowski.\n\n\"With that and the upper-level wind pattern factored in, we could see this storm coming toward the United States.\"\n\nThe location of a system of high pressure over the open northern Atlantic helped determine where Lee went this week, and the same will be the case for the next storm. Another determining factor will be any potential cold fronts moving off the coast of the eastern United States, AccuWeather forecasters explained.\n\nThere appear to be two possible scenarios later next week for what may become Nigel: a track more out to sea or one toward the East Coast.\n\nIf the area of high pressure is stronger and builds more toward the northeastern U.S., steering winds can pull the storm closer to the East Coast.\n\nIf the high doesn’t build toward the Northeast and is weaker, the storm will tend to steer close to Bermuda or perhaps even farther to the east and out to sea, according to AccuWeather.\n\nImpacts expected: Who should keep an eye on Tropical Depression 15?\n\nBecause the expected path of the new storm and its risk for strengthening could mirror Lee, residents along the East Coast of the U.S., Bermuda and southeastern Canada should monitor it closely, AccuWeather forecasters said.\n\n\"Direct or indirect impacts could begin as early as the middle of next week.\"\n\nRegardless of the final destination with the next storm, indirect impacts may be felt from the Bahamas to Bermuda and along the entire U.S. East Coast into Atlantic Canada.\n\nResidents could see dangerous waves and rip currents.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/06/tropical-storm-beryl-hurricane-texas-live-updates/74316030007/", "title": "Beryl live updates: Storm likely to make Texas landfall as hurricane", "text": "Editor's note: Read USA TODAY's live coverage of Beryl for Sunday, July 7, including the storm's track as it heads toward Texas.\n\nBeryl, once a hurricane and now a tropical storm, is expected to regain hurricane strength before it hits the south Texas coast late Sunday or early Monday, the National Hurricane Center said Saturday.\n\nThe storm weakened after making landfall on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula Friday morning, after it plowed through the Caribbean and Jamaica earlier this week killing at least 11 people.\n\n“This is a determined storm that is still strong,” Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said at a news briefing on Friday.\n\nAt 4 p.m. local time, Beryl was about 385 miles southeast of Corpus Christi in the Gulf of Mexico, traveling west-northwest at 13 mph. It was expected to continue moving northwest into Sunday, then north-northwest by Sunday night, and make landfall on the Texas coast Monday after re-strengthening to a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nOn Saturday, Beryl's winds reached up to 60 mph, with higher gusts.\n\nHurricane, tropical storm and storm surge watches and warnings were issued Saturday along Texas' Gulf Coast, the hurricane center said. Storm surge in Texas could reach as high as 6 feet from Mesquite Bay to Sargent and Matagorda Bay.\n\nTornadoes are possible Sunday, and rainfall totals were forecast between 5 to 10 inches, with as much as 15 inches in some locations.\n\n\"This rainfall will likely produce areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally considerable,\" the hurricane center said. \"Minor to isolated moderate river flooding is also possible.\"\n\nBeryl tracker:See projected path, spaghetti models of path toward Texas\n\nA stunning storm:As Hurricane Beryl tears through the Caribbean, a look at its record-breaking path\n\nKey developments:\n\n∎ At least 11 people were killed in Jamaica, Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and northern Venezuela after Beryl tore through, officials have said. There were no casualties in Mexico.\n\n∎ Beryl, the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season, became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record. With its rapid intensification, Beryl became a hurricane within 24 hours of formation. Within another 24 hours, its winds had increased 55 mph, reaching 130 mph, almost a Category 4 hurricane.\n\n∎ Schools near Texas' coast canceled class activities on Monday, including the Corpus Christi and West Oso school districts.

That's what Raoul Martinez, who owns a hardware store in Corpus Christi, Texas, reminded his customers Saturday as Beryl took a turn toward the city.\n\n\"GET EVERY BATTERY CHARGED in your household,\" Martinez posted from the No Hassle Tools and More Facebook page early Saturday. \"Have a chainsaw on hand to cut away any debris. Cut your grass now so it don’t grow like crazy. Tie down kids playgrounds and animal houses.\"\n\nWorried but calm customers were buying necessities, he told USA TODAY. Martinez vowed his store will be open through the storm as long he can reach it safely.\n\n\"There are people who are going to be in need and we will never know until it happens,\" he said. \"I have tools for everything, and I want to be at people's disposals and it's OK for me.\"\n\nMartinez encouraged people to be prepared and not wait.\n\n\"Beat the rush,\" Martinez said. \"A lot of us small businesses are taking the time out and there are little stores selling water, sand bags, and I'm at least staying open for people.\"\n\nSome Texas residents asked to evacuate ahead of storm conditions\n\nVoluntary evacuations were in place in some counties along the Texas coast.\n\nAransas County urged residents to evacuate but made it voluntary. Emergency officials there said anyone who lives in an RV should evacuate, as well as those in low-lying areas.\n\nMatagorda County warned residents that floodwaters from the storm could trap them in their homes and called for voluntary evacuations in coastal areas of the county.\n\n\"The biggest concern for this situation is the coastal areas of our County. Low lying areas that normally flood are impacted,\" the county said in a news release on Friday.\n\nSandbags were being distributed in the City of Kingsville in Kleberg County as voluntary evacuation was underway in Baffin Bay, Loyola Beach and all low-lying areas of the county.\n\nBeryl's effects could start to be felt Saturday in Texas\n\nAs Beryl strengthens over the Gulf of Mexico, forecasters said Texans will already be feeling its impact Saturday ahead of its arrival.\n\n\"The exact location of Beryl's landfall is uncertain at this point, but what's most important is that heavy rainfall, strong winds and storm surge are expected for much of the state's coastline and portions of the central Gulf Coast beginning tonight into Sunday,\" the Weather Prediction Center said early Saturday.\n\nSwells and \"life-threatening\" surf and rip currents caused by the storm are also not far off.\n\nTropical storm conditions are expected to start hitting Texas' coast on Sunday night.\n\nWhat areas in Texas are in Beryl's path?\n\nMultiple large urban areas in Texas, including Houston, Austin and San Antonio, lie in the storm's broad path of projection, and it's still uncertain exactly where the hurricane will pass through. Most of the state will feel at least some impacts from the storm.\n\nThe weather service in Corpus Christi also said south Texas should prepare for power outages.\n\nAbout 3 to 5 feet of storm surge is likely around areas along the coast, and \"the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves,\" the hurricane center said. The storm surge will impact areas from Baffin Bay to San Luis Pass, Corpus Christi Bay, Matagorda Bay, between the mouth of the Rio Grande to Baffin Bay, San Luis Pass to High Island and Galveston Bay.\n\nHeavy rain and flash flooding are some of the greatest threats, forecasters warned. About 5 to 10 inches of rain and up to 15 inches in some areas will inundate the Texas Gulf Coast and parts of eastern Texas starting late Sunday and into next week. Flooding is likely wherever Beryl passes, Patrick said.\n\nContributing: Cybele Mayes-Osterman, Doyle Rice and Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; Cross Harris and Alexis Simmerman, the Austin American-Statesman; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/03/hurricane-beryl-live-updates/74287151007/", "title": "Hurricane Beryl live updates: Impact on Jamaica may be 'catastrophic'", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects news on Hurricane Beryl from Wednesday, July 3. For the latest news on Hurricane Beryl please follow USA TODAY's live updates on the storm for Thursday, July 4.\n\nHurricane Beryl was retreating from Jamaica late Wednesday and is expected to pass just south of the Cayman Islands overnight as a major hurricane, bringing intense winds and heavy rain, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAs of 2 a.m. ET Thursday, Beryl was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 125 mph and was about 110 miles southeast of Grand Cayman — the largest of the Cayman Islands. After roaring by Jamaica's southern coast, the hurricane was expected to unload \"devastating hurricane-force winds, life-threatening storm surge, and damaging waves\" across the Cayman Islands, according to the hurricane center.\n\nThe Cayman Islands could get up to half a foot of rain through Thursday. Weather officials are also warning about life-threatening surf and rip currents along parts of western Cuba, the Yucatan Peninsula, and the coast of Belize.\n\nBeryl was on track to approach the Cayman Islands on Wednesday night and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula about 24 hours later, still as a hurricane but weakened by expected wind shear.\n\nIn Jamaica, emergency crews evacuated people living in flood-prone communities and nearly 500 people were in shelters by Wednesday afternoon, according to Prime Minister Andrew Holness.\n\n“We’re concerned about widespread damage and potentially catastrophic impacts in Jamaica,” said Bernie Rayno, AccuWeather's chief on-air meteorologist. \"Flooding may last days to even weeks. Widespread power outages are expected. Beryl will likely damage many homes and businesses and cause severe coastal inundation.\"\n\nThe chances of Beryl impacting part of the Texas Gulf Coast have increased with the projected path veering northwest, AccuWeather reported, although it would not bring anywhere near the ferocity of its devastating assault on the southern Windward Islands earlier this week. The current track calls for Beryl to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan and then becomes a hurricane again before making landfall along the coast near the border of Mexico and Texas.\n\nThe storm is projected to drench Jamaica with 4 to 8 inches of rain, and 12 inches are forecast in some places, which could cause \"life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides,\" the NHC said. Holness declared all of Jamaica a \"disaster area\" and imposed an islandwide curfew Wednesday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nOn Monday, Beryl made landfall in Grenada's Carriacou island as a Category 4 hurricane, ravaging the southern Caribbean Islands, flattening hundreds of buildings and causing the deaths of at least seven people. On Monday night, Beryl became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record. Driven by record-hot ocean temperatures, Beryl's rapid strengthening has stunned experts.\n\nAmazing drone footage:As Hurricane Beryl tears through Caribbean, a drone sends back stunning footage\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The death toll from the powerful hurricane rose to at least 10, according to Reuters. But that figure is expected to increase as communications come back online across islands damaged by flooding and intense winds.\n\n∎ The Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston, Jamaica posted on X that a small section of the roof of its passenger boarding pier was damaged by Beryl. \"Once the storm has completely passed, a full assessment of damage will be done,\" the airport stated on X.\n\n∎ The Meteorological Service of Mexico issued a hurricane warning for the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun, a popular tourist destination, according to the NHC. Tropical storm warnings were also issued for other parts of the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\n∎ Venezuela's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, and senior officials in her traveling party were injured by a falling tree Tuesday night while surveying an area near the country's Caribbean coast where the Manzanares River overran its banks after heavy rainfall caused by Beryl.\n\nHurricane Beryl tracker:See projected path of storm\n\nWill Hurricane Beryl hit Texas?\n\nPortions of South Texas are now within the forecast cone of Hurricane Beryl, which meteorologists say could arrive in the state over the weekend or early Monday.\n\nHowever, forecasters remain unsure of what Beryl will do and how strong it will be as it approaches the Gulf Coast after hitting Mexico: \"High uncertainty remains with both the track and intensity of Beryl,\" the National Weather Service said Wednesday.\n\n\"From Panama City, Florida to New Orleans, there is a low risk of direct impacts from Beryl, but from about Corpus Christi to Brownsville, Texas, the risk increases significantly due to the potential for Beryl to have more direct impacts,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Jonathan Porter said. \"That southern portion of the Texas coast is the zone we have to really watch.\"\n\nCoastal threats could begin this weekend, Weather.com warned: \"Well ahead of Beryl, onshore winds could lead to increasing surf, rip currents and coastal flooding along parts of the Gulf Coast from eastern Mexico to Texas and western Louisiana beginning as soon as Saturday, and continuing until just after Beryl's final landfall, Weather.com said. The rip current threat could also even extend farther east along the northern Gulf Coast.\n\nBrennan said Tuesday that \"folks in the Texas coast, as we go into the holiday weekend, you're going to want to make sure you check back on the forecast and make sure you're ready for any potential impact. If we were to see tropical storm conditions affect those areas in the far western Gulf of Mexico, it could be during the day Saturday.\"\n\n– Doyle Rice\n\nMore than 90% of the homes, buildings destroyed\n\nMore than 90% of homes and buildings across at least three islands were destroyed or severely damaged after Beryl tore through the southeast Caribbean, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency reported Wednesday. The agency was assisting with the disaster response in Grenada, St. Vincent, and the Grenadines.\n\nBeryl struck the islands with winds of 150 mph and higher gusts on Monday, causing significant impacts to the islands, according to Elizabeth Riley, the disaster management agency's executive director. In addition to infrastructure damages, some islands have also faced power outages and disruptions to communications.\n\nIn a briefing late Tuesday, Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"total destruction\" on the islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique.\n\n\"There's really nothing that can prepare you to see this level of destruction,\" Mitchell said. \"It is almost Armageddon-like, almost total damage and destruction of all buildings. Complete devastation and destruction of agriculture. Complete and total destruction of the natural environment.\"\n\n— Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nAirlines waive fees for some in Hurricane Beryl's path\n\nSix major U.S. airlines said they're waiving various fees for travelers who have flights booked in Beryl's path. In most cases, flights booked before July 1 are eligible for the changes. The listed flights include departures from or arrivals in airports in Mexico, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and Belize.\n\nAmerican, JetBlue, United, Delta, Southwest, and Spirit Airlines are offering a variety of fee waivers because of the hurricane. Passengers are encouraged to check directly with the airlines on what amended policies apply to them.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation said on its website travelers on international flights may be able to recover expenses from a delayed or canceled flight by filing a claim with the airline.\n\n\"If the claim is denied, you may pursue the matter in court if you believe that the carrier did not take all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the damages caused by the delay,\" the agency said.\n\n− Krystal Nurse\n\nResort manager in Jamaica maintains composure as Hurricane Beryl approaches\n\nThe coming hurricane doesn't scare Tamar Atkinson, the manager of a small resort in Hanover, a community on Jamaica's northwest coast.\n\n\"The way I look at it, I can't stop it,\" she told USA TODAY. \"If the hurricane is going to blow your house down, it's going to blow the house down.\"\n\nAtkinson, 42, who moved back to Hanover a year ago after she lived in the U.S. for 20 years, already has her sea legs in weathering Jamaica's hurricanes. She remembers facing Hurricane Gilbert, a Category 5, as a little girl – the storm blew the roof off her aunt's house, where she sheltered, but left her mother's house in \"perfect condition.\"\n\nWhen Hurricane Ivan hit two decades ago, Atkinson sheltered at a nearby school. Once again, the storm blew out the school's windows but left Atkinson's house untouched. \"I'm not leaving my house, and I'm not going to go crazy like the rest of the people,\" she said, adding that she's told her guests to \"relax their nerves.\"\n\nJamaica closes all international airports as Hurricane Beryl nears island\n\nThe Jamaica Tourist Board announced Wednesday that the Sangster, Norman Manley, and Ian Fleming international airports were closed as Hurricane Beryl approached the island.\n\nJamaica's travel website, VisitJamaica.com, doesn't list a reopening time for the airports and encourages travelers to contact their travel agents and/or airlines for flight updates. The website also encourages travelers to heed any instructions from their hotel or private accommodation on sheltering.\n\n\"We also encourage you to register with your Embassy for country-specific guidance and support,\" the board said on the website.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Jamaica is open on a limited basis and encourages Americans to not visit the embassy for shelter and instead seek a government-run shelter. Citizens in Jamaica are encouraged to call the embassy at (876) 702-6486 if they need assistance.\n\n– Krystal Nurse\n\nAhead of Hurricane Beryl, Jamaicans prepare their homes\n\nDonae Maye stocked up on water, candles, and food earlier this week, before supermarkets across her hometown of Montego Bay, a city on Jamaica's northern Coast, emptied.\n\n\"There was no bread, no essentials that you actually need, no candles, very few tin products,\" she said on Wednesday, after a recent visit to some local grocery stores.\n\nMaye, 27, also prepped her home, where she will shelter with her fiance, her son and his father. \"We cleared away any trees that might be blocking any electrical wires and stuff like that that might fall and break the window,\" she said.\n\nShe's confident that her house, which is made of concrete, will stand up to the storm better than many buildings did to Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago. Back then, more structures were made of board, which didn't fare well in the storm, she said. Today, \"most structures are built to withstand the winds and the hurricane,\" she said.\n\nHumanitarian groups rally relief for impacted countries\n\nGlobal Giving and Americares are among the humanitarian organizations collecting money for those affected by Hurricane Beryl. Both promise donations to support various impacted communities, focusing on those who are disadvantaged and on decimated medical facilities.\n\nCora Nally, international emergency response director of Americares, said the organization focuses on restoring damaged medical facilities and expects to deploy its workers to Jamaica soon after Beryl leaves.\n\n\"That is really going to serve as a home base for them, and we are asking them to do an assessment of all the impacted islands in the Caribbean, and we are going to be keeping an eye on the storm as it moves towards Mexico and the United States,\" she said.\n\nIs Cancun in the path of Hurricane Beryl?\n\nAmong the parts of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and surrounding areas under hurricane warnings were Cancun and the island of Cozumel, two popular tourist destinations packed with luxury resorts and cruise ship ports.\n\nThe hurricane warnings were issued by the Meteorological Service of Mexico as forecasters warned residents and tourists of the projected impact of Hurricane Beryl.\n\nBrennan, the director of the NHC, said in a YouTube livestream on Wednesday that the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, including Cancun, faces 3 to 5 feet of storm surge as well as up to 8 inches of rain.\n\nThe record-breaking hurricane is expected to make landfall along the Yucatan Peninsula on Thursday night or early Friday, NHC said.\n\nIn Jamaica, tourists shelter in hotel ballroom from Hurricane Beryl\n\nCecilia Garcia and her family initially planned to weather the beginning of the hurricane in the bathroom of their hotel room in Ocho Rios, on Jamaica's northern coastline. \"We do have windows in our room, so I think the safest option would probably be to go in our restroom,\" she said.\n\nMoon Palace Jamaica, where Garcia, 25, is staying with her parents, brother, sister and two kids, told hotel guests to evacuate to a ballroom. When Garcia and her family first visited the shelter, they found it too chaotic. \"We ended up back in our room because it was very crowded,\" she said. \"It was very hot in there.\"\n\nBut later on Wednesday morning, as the winds picked up, the family returned to the packed ballroom, where thin cots were arranged in rows, according to a video Garcia shared with USA TODAY.\n\nGarcia and her family's flight back to their home of Houston, Texas, isn't until Saturday – the hurricane will strike at the midpoint of their week-long vacation. Garcia said if they chose to end their stay earlier, they wouldn't get a refund.\n\nLooking out at skies still partially clear on Wednesday morning, Garcia said the family was keeping calm ahead of the storm. \"We're kind of used to bad weather and floods like that in Houston,\" she said. \"But again, it's different when you're not at home, so that's the only scary part.\"\n\nHurricane Beryl spoiling graduation trip\n\nMona Parhar, 23, and Arezoo Rafkhani, 24, didn't start searching for early return flights from their vacation to Jamaica until Tuesday night, less than 24 hours before Hurricane Beryl was expected to sweep across the island. By then, they learned airports had closed.\n\n\"We really have no choice but to stick it out,\" Parhar said Wednesday from their hotel room at the Hotel Riu in Montego Bay on the island's northern side.\n\nThe two Toronto natives booked their trip to celebrate their recent graduations – Rafkhani from Toronto Metropolitan University and Parhar from York University. \"We've never experienced something like this as Canadians,\" Rafkhani said. \"It's kind of nerve-wracking.\"\n\nThe pair were comforted by the hotel staff, who kept guests informed and safe. \"Since last night, they've been sending us messages about how to get prepared, what they're doing and will be doing this morning,\" Rafkhani said. \"They've been keeping us calm,\" Parhar said.\n\nJamaica braces for Hurricane Beryl\n\nJamaican officials warned residents to stock up on food, batteries, candles, and drinking water. Residents in flood-prone areas were also advised to prepare for evacuation.\n\n\"Secure your critical documents and remove any trees or items that could endanger your property,\" the Office of the Prime Minister in Jamaica said on X on Tuesday. \"Everyone, including those living alone, should take these necessary steps now.\"\n\nAs a precaution, Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness said Tuesday night that electricity and water services will likely be shut off \"if the storm reaches a serious threshold\" to prevent fires and protect equipment.\n\n\"Only one hurricane has ever affected Jamaica during July,\" according to AccuWeather meteorologist Jesse Ferrell. \"Category 4 Hurricane Dennis in 2005 did not make landfall but killed one person and caused a lot of damage.\"\n\nRecord-breaking path:Hurricane Beryl tears through the Caribbean\n\nHurricane Beryl breaks records\n\nForecasters have projected 2024 to be one of the busiest hurricane seasons on record. Beryl has already surprised forecasters and broken records since it formed, including becoming the earliest Category 4 or 5 storm on record.\n\nBeryl broke the previous record set by Hurricane Emily on July 17, 2005, for the strongest Category 5 hurricane. Beryl rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a major hurricane in about 48 hours.\n\nThe storm is also the earliest Category 4 or larger storm by more than a week, breaking the record set by Hurricane Dennis, a Category 4 storm on July 8, 2005.\n\nIt was fueled by much warmer than normal ocean temperatures in the Atlantic and aided in that development by light winds that allowed it to build a strong inner core.\n\n— Jennifer Borresen, Dinah Voyles Pulver and Ramon Padilla\n\nHurricane Beryl tracker:See projected path of Category 5 storm\n\nSmaller islands hit hard by Beryl\n\nBeryl hit St. Vincent and the Grenadines especially hard, according to Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves.\n\n\"The hurricane has come and gone, and it has left in its wake immense destruction,\" he said, adding that Union Island had 90% of homes \"severely damaged or destroyed.\"\n\nAfter making landfall in Grenada's Carriacou Island on Monday, strong winds and high water levels smashed fishing boats in Barbados, downed power lines in Grenada and St. Vincent, and knocked out drinking water in St. Lucia, according to officials.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell noted on Tuesday that the islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique were significantly impacted by the hurricane. In addition to downed power lines, roads remained impassable and fuel stations were destroyed.\n\n\"The situation is grim. There is no power. There is almost complete destruction of homes and buildings,\" Mitchell said.\n\nContributing: Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY Network-Florida; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/hurricanes/2024/05/23/noaa-hurricane-forecast-2024-season-outlook-texas-storm-tracker-atlanctic-ocean/73817894007/", "title": "NOAA predicts up to 13 hurricanes in 2024.

Forecasters also expect between four and seven major hurricanes, classified as Category 3, 4 or 5, with winds of 111 mph or higher.\n\n\"The upcoming Atlantic hurricane season is expected to have above-normal activity due to a confluence of factors, including near-record warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, development of La Nina conditions in the Pacific, reduced Atlantic trade winds and less wind shear, all of which tend to favor tropical storm formation,\" NOAA said in its outlook.\n\nWhat is rapid intensification in hurricanes?\n\nAccording to forecasters from Colorado State University, record-setting sea surface temperatures alone do not ensure a busy hurricane season, but they significantly affect it.\n\nThis could mean more powerful hurricanes, which are known for rapid intensification.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center defines rapid intensification as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone by at least 35 mph within a 24-hour period. This rapid change can transform a relatively weak storm into a major hurricane, leading to increased threats to life and property due to stronger winds, higher storm surges and more intense rainfall.\n\nHurricanes derive their energy from warm ocean waters. Higher sea surface temperatures can provide more energy to fuel a storm's growth.\n\nWhat are water temperatures right now around Texas?\n\nAccording to Yale Climate Connections, sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic Ocean are now hotter than in any previous late May on record. The extent of marine heat surpasses the previous late May record set in 2005, a year known for one of the most active and destructive hurricane seasons in modern history.\n\nIn 2005, Hurricane Rita reached Category 5 strength before eventually weakening to a Category 3 storm as it made landfall on the Texas-Louisiana border.

That tied the Labor Day hurricane of 1935, which tore through the Florida Keys, killing more than 400 people in the days before hurricanes were given names.\n\nDorian made landfall in Elbow Cay in the Abaco Islands in the northern Bahamas on Sunday afternoon, then made a second landfall near Marsh Harbor on Great Abaco at 2 p.m.\n\nThe raging winds tore off roofs, downed power lines and terrified islanders who sought shelter in schools, churches and other shelters. The few videos that have emerged from the northern islands show floodwaters streaming over roads and into homes, as residents plead for help in the middle of the slow-moving storm.\n\nBahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis urged his residents to flee ahead of Dorian's landfall, with officials hiring boats to ferry people to islands farther south. Samuel Butler, the assistant commissioner of the Royal Bahamas Police Force, put it bluntly when talking about those who decided to ride out the storm.\n\n\"The end could be fatal,\" Butler said. \"We ask you, we beg you, we plead with you to get to a place of safety.\"\n\nFlights:600 cancellations and counting\n\nCruises:Extended vacation for some; delays and cancellations trips for others\n\nFlorida arrival\n\nDorian's slow crawl, estimated at about 1 mph as of early Monday morning, placed it within 115 miles of West Palm Beach, Florida. But forecasters remained unsure of whether, or where, it might make landfall in the U.S. after it makes an expected turn to the north.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warned that life-threatening storm surges and dangerous hurricane-force winds were expected along the east coast of Florida through mid-week.\n\n\"Only a slight deviation to the left of the official forecast would bring the core of Dorian near or over the Florida east coast. Residents in these areas should continue to monitor the progress of Dorian and listen to advice given by local emergency officials,\" it said in a statement at 11:00 p.m. ET on Sunday evening.\n\nMillions of people from South Florida to North Carolina are now on alert and preparing for the worst.\n\nEven if Dorian does not make landfall, the effects will be felt beginning around Monday evening when Florida's Melbourne and Palm Bay areas can expect tropical storm winds, said Ed Rappaport, deputy director at the National Hurricane Center in Miami on Sunday evening.\n\nTropical storm winds range from 60 to 73 miles per hour with gusts of up to 95 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nTuesday is when Florida residents on the east coast can expect the worst impacts, Rappaport said.\n\nAreas under a hurricane warning, which on Sunday was from Palm Beach to as far north as Daytona Beach, could still see hurricane-force winds within 36 hours, likely Tuesday, even if the hurricane remains offshore, he said.\n\nConditions along coastal areas in the southern part of Florida will probably be at their worst on Tuesday, he said.\n\n\"As this storm progresses northward, it's quite likely these watches and warnings will have to be extended northward as well,\" he said Sunday evening.\n\nEvacuations underway\n\nFive Florida counties began evacuations of barrier islands and low-lying areas on Sunday. An additional three are expected to issue evacuation orders on Monday, the state's Division of Emergency Management Director Jared Moskowitz said Sunday night.\n\n“Hurricane Dorian is the strongest storm to ever threaten the state of Florida on the East Coast,” said Moskowitz. “No matter what path this storm takes, our state will be impacted. We will continue to work around the clock to prepare.”\n\nThe state is suspending tolls on multiple turnpikes and toll roads in the areas expected to be affected by the hurricane and the evacuations.\n\nForty-five of Florida's 67 counties announced their school districts would be closed on Tuesday.\n\nFlorida Highway Patrol cars will be escorting fuel trucks to ensure that fuel reaches affected areas quickly. Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia are all waiving hours of service and truck weight for fuel trucks to ensure there will be enough gas available.\n\nAcross Florida's border in Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp on Sunday evening ordered evacuations in six coastal counties east of Interstate 95, the main north-south coastal highway, beginning at noon on Monday.\n\nStill further north, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster ordered evacuations of more than 800,000 people starting Monday.\n\n\"Every indication that we have has the turn (north) somewhere, it's just a matter of where it's going to be,\" said Ken Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. \"But again, with these systems, sometimes they've got a mind of their own.\"\n\nIn Pahokee, Florida, on the east shore of Lake Okeechobee, residents rely on God, shutters and rope to prepare for hurricanes.

I'm freaking out.\"\n\nStay updated on Hurricane Dorian:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\nThe storm was forecast to continue across Grand Bahama Island on Sunday night and Monday. Storm surge in some areas of the Bahamas was expected to exceed 10 feet, posing \"serious threat to both life and property across much of the northern Bahamas,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Brandon Buckingham said.\n\nThe slow pace of the storm meant some areas could be drenched by up to two feet of rain, adding to the damage, Buckingham said. The Bahamas Labour Ministry warned businesses that \"laws regarding price gouging and price hoarding will be scrupulously enforced\" over the next several days.\n\nHurricane Andrew in 1992 is the only Category 5 hurricane ever to pass through the Bahamas, AccuWeather said. \"Right now, it's the strongest storm that we've ever recorded in history in modern times in the Bahamas area, so this is a very dangerous situation,\" Graham said.\n\nFlorida Power & Light CEO Eric Silagy warned that \"significant power outages\" were likely in parts of the state and that \"parts of the system will need to be rebuilt.\"\n\nRick Knabb, a hurricane expert at The Weather Channel, said the storm is likely to hammer much of the East Coast even if it never makes landfall in the U.S.\n\n\"Regardless of the track relative to Florida, the life-threatening winds and water of the hurricane could reach portions of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina later this week,\" Knabb said.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Sunday that the storm will bring heavy rains, capable of producing life-threatening flash floods over coastal sections of the southeast and lower mid-Atlantic regions through late this week.\n\nNothing stronger\n\nCategory 5 is the strongest rating and includes only hurricanes with sustained winds of at least 157 mph. Meteorologist Ryan Maue tweeted that, if the scale was extrapolated, Category 6 should start at 182 mph.\n\nForecasters say Dorian's sustained hurricane winds rank it among the most powerful storms ever recorded in the Atlantic. And it's still strengthening. Philip Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and meteorologist at Colorado State University, said Dorian has the strongest winds this far north in the Atlantic east of Florida on record.\n\nDorian is powerful but compact. Satellite images portray the hurricane as a relatively small feature, with hurricane-force winds \"only\" extending out from the center by about 30 miles, while tropical storm-force winds extend outward from the center of the hurricane by about 105 miles, AccuWeather said. That's only about half of what is average for a hurricane.\n\nMore:5 things that make Dorian a dangerous hurricane\n\nMore:Dorian is a 'major' hurricane.

However, a provisional picture is emerging of a storm that stands toe-to-toe with the biggest names in hurricane history, yet due to its precise track, narrowly avoided the absolute worst-case scenario in terms of surge impacts.\n\nUnfortunately, with around 75% of hurricane season activity still ahead, Laura is unlikely to be the final major hurricane threat of 2020. Two tropical waves in the central Atlantic will need to be watched carefully over the next seven to 10 days, particularly in light of a risky steering current regime.\n\nA blow-by-blow account:Hurricane Laura first Category 4 hurricane to make landfall in Western Louisiana | WeatherTiger liveblog\n\nA storm for the record books\n\nBut first, let’s put Hurricane Laura into a broader historical context. While much remains to be figured out, here are some preliminary facts:\n\nLaura was the strongest hurricane to strike between Grand Isle, Louisiana, and western Galveston Bay, Texas, reaching back to the beginning of historical records in 1851. Over these 170 years, Laura is the fourth Category 4 hurricane anywhere in Louisiana, and is tied with the 1856 Last Island hurricane for strongest landfall in the state.\n\nLaura’s maximum sustained winds of 150 mph at landfall are just over 5 mph shy of Category 5 intensity and are tied for the fifth-strongest on the continental U.S. coastline. This is also the second-highest maximum U.S. landfall wind of the 21st century, after 2018’s Hurricane Michael and tied with 2004’s Hurricane Charley.\n\nBetween the evenings of August 25 and 26, Laura strengthened from a 75-knot Category 1 hurricane to a 130-knot Category 4 hurricane. This one-day rapid intensification of 55 knots is also among the steepest in the Atlantic historical record.\n\nThese numbers are early estimates.\n\nOver the upcoming weeks, National Weather Service personnel will be performing an exhaustive survey of the damage along the Louisiana and Texas coastlines, as well as hard-hit inland communities.\n\nThis investigation will review all reconnaissance aircraft data, like the Hurricane Hunter plane reports of winds in the eastern eyewall exceeding 160 mph just above the surface in the hour prior to landfall.\n\nIt will also consider ocean and ground-based observations, including the wind gust of 133 mph in Lake Charles that destroyed the airport’s weather radar and instruments. (There is a private weather station report from Lake Charles of sustained winds to 102 mph with a top gust of 137 mph, pending validation).\n\nSuch data will inform an official National Hurricane Center report that will be the final word on Laura’s track and intensity, likely to be released next spring. While I wouldn’t be surprised if peak intensity was nudged a little higher in this report, I doubt that an upgrade to Category 5 strength is forthcoming, given what I have personally seen.\n\nA suppressed surge\n\nWhile Laura was a destructive inland wind event without precedent across Southwest Louisiana, likely producing winds equivalent to an EF-2 or low-end EF-3 tornado across most of Cameron, Calcasieu and Beauregard Parishes, one aspect of the storm that was marginally less apocalyptic than feared in heavily populated areas was surge.\n\nIt is important to remember that NHC surge forecasts are for a “reasonable worst case” scenario, or a level of inundation which will be exceeded about 10% of the time. So while NHC forecasts highlighted the widespread potential for 15 to 20 feet of peak surge, in reality such values were only going to be observed near where the strongest southerly winds of the eastern eyewall crossed the coast.\n\nWith a landfall near Cameron and Laura tracking north, the devastating winds in Lake Charles blew from due east. For the most part, this wind direction did not drive water north from the Gulf and into the city. An Army Corps of Engineers gauge at Grand Chenier in east-central Cameron Parish recorded over 15 feet of surge in the eastern eyewall, pending validation.\n\nData points are few at this early stage, but it appears the expected surge values did occur, just south and east of the more populous Lake Charles area.\n\nAnd so, Laura goes into the history books as one of the most brutal hurricanes of all time, and the 2020 hurricane season rolls into its second quarter following a record-breaking seven U.S. tropical storm and three hurricane landfalls.\n\nFor the immediate future, that record is unlikely to be padded. However, upper-level winds and warm sea-surface temperatures remain supportive for tropical storm formation, and the next four weeks are the most historically active in the Atlantic’s climatological record.\n\nFour weeks of tropical turbulence ahead\n\n\"Currently, the Atlantic is reloading, with no named storms but five candidates for tropical development over the next five to seven days. The two disturbances most likely to become Tropical Storms Nana and Omar this week are located over the eastern Caribbean Sea and to the south of the Carolinas. The disturbance in the eastern Caribbean, Invest 99L, has a good chance of becoming a depression in the next couple of days, but will likely continue westward into Central America by the end of the week. The disturbance off the Southeast also has better-than-even odds at development by midweek, but will move northeast and generally away from the U.S. coastline.\n\nThree more tropical waves in the Atlantic’s Main Development Region are also candidates for slow organization over the next five to seven days. While there is no specific threat to the U.S. at this time, a strong steering ridge of high pressure over the western Atlantic will reduce the chances of storms turning harmlessly north into the open Atlantic over the next week or two.\"\n\nIn short, Laura was devastating and exhausting, but the peak weeks of hurricane season are just beginning. Keep your guard up and keep watching the skies.\n\nDr. Ryan Truchelut is chief meteorologist at WeatherTiger, a Tallahassee start-up providing advanced weather and climate analytics, forensic meteorology and expert witness consulting, and agricultural and hurricane forecasting subscription services.

CNN —\n\nWhen Vice President Kamala Harris enters the famed Hotel Bayerischer Hof on Friday in Munich, she’ll do so under the largest international gaze of her career.\n\nShe leads the American delegation to the Munich Security Conference on Friday as Russia creeps closer to mounting what US officials have warned would be a devastating and costly invasion into Ukraine. President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday he believed an attack could begin “in the next several days,” just hours after Harris departed.\n\nAnd during a tense United Nations Security Council meeting the same day, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia was laying the groundwork to justify starting a war and preparing to launch an attack on Ukraine.\n\nThe rapidly intensifying stakes make Harris’ trip to the annual gathering all the more important, allies say. She will find herself in the centers of the action, under pressure to perform the tasks of an American diplomat at this heightened moment while allies and foes alike closely analyze every word she says and every meeting she takes, trying to assess the US posture.\n\nStill, she won’t be entirely on her own – Blinken, who has been one of Biden’s closest aides for more than a decade, will be attending the conference, too. His presence there will be a useful backstop in case anything goes awry, one US official noted, because – unlike Harris –he is a known entity to the dozens of world leaders and diplomats who will be in Munich throughout the weekend.\n\n“The goal of the Munich Security Conference will be for our NATO allies to speak in one voice in support of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty. And that leading voice will be Vice President Harris,” Halie Soifer, a former national security adviser to then- Sen. Harris, told CNN in an interview on Thursday. “She has a critically important role to play, especially at this time of crisis for the world.”\n\nBut any misstep could carry outsized implications, not only for Harris’ political future but also the international community writ large.\n\n“We don’t know what will happen in the next few days. It’s completely conceivable that we could see Russia begin an invasion anytime.” said Charles Kupchan, the senior director for European affairs at the National Security Council under former President Barack Obama. “Part of the vice president’s mission is to show up.”\n\nFor Harris, a senior administration official described her key objective in Munich as three-pronged: Focus on the “fast-changing” situation on the ground, maintain full alignment with partners and send a clear message to Russia that the US prefers diplomacy but is ready in case of Russian aggression.\n\nDuring her first bilateral meeting of the trip with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Harris made sure to sent that message.\n\n“We remain, of course, open to and desire diplomacy as it relates to the dialogue and the discussions we’ve had with Russia. But we are also committed – if Russia takes aggressive action – to ensuring there will be severe consequences in terms of the economic sanctions we have discussed,” Harris said.\n\nShe added, “I am here to ensure that through our discussions, and the discussions I will have with other of our allies, that we continue as these hours and days progress to stay in close contact. We understand this is a dynamic moment in time. So the work we are doing on a daily basis and sometimes on an hourly basis to strengthen the relationship, to check in, in terms of our strategic imperative, is critically important and it’s one of the reasons I’m here.”\n\nHarris will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky while at the conference, her first meeting with the Ukrainian leader, as well as give a keynote speech on Saturday. The vice president will maintain a “very intense” schedule when she is in Munich, senior administration officials said. The meeting with Zelensky will be one of several high-level meetings she’ll hold.\n\n“I think that this is an important opportunity for her, where she can play a role that a vice president is uniquely able to play and that is to make a visible presentation of the ideals of administration,” Joel Goldstein, a vice presidential historian, told CNN in an interview on Thursday.\n\n“A great platform”\n\nKupchan referred to the Munich conference as the “Davos,” of international security, a nod to the famed World Economic Forum in Switzerland that draws the upper echelon on foreign leaders.\n\n“The advantages are not just symbolic (for Harris). It’s also a great platform. Her speech will be covered globally,” Kupchan told CNN in an interview on Thursday. “The Munich Security Conference affords what you might call ‘one-stop’ shopping in the sense that the key players will be there.”\n\nOn Friday, Harris met with Stoltenberg and held a multilateral meeting with the leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. She also held a separate meeting with US congressional leaders who are attending the conference. Biden called in to that meeting, according to a person in the room, and reiterated the work the US and allies have been doing to try to prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine. He also updated the members on the situation at Ukraine’s borders.\n\nAnd on Saturday, Harris will deliver her keynote speech. She’s expected to focus on addressing the situation on Ukraine’s border, the threat of Russian aggression and the latest state of play, per senior administration officials. She’ll likely tout the unity among US allies that the administration says they’ve maintained, as well as make the case that any invasion will leave Russia weaker while reassuring allies of the US’ commitment to NATO and partners broadly.\n\nAfter her speech, she’s expected to meet with Zelensky and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the margins of the conference, the senior administration official added, in addition to other foreign leaders who were not immediately named.\n\nWhile Harris’ attendance can be seen, allies say, as a clear sign of the trust Biden has placed in his vice president, Kupchan said it also signifies the importance Biden places in the conference.\n\n“Biden is an Atlanticist. His concern about the transatlantic relationship and European security is in his DNA. And he’s been working on these issues for decades,” Kupchan told CNN. “Transatlantic solidarity has continued when it comes to Russia right through the Trump era, which speaks to the stickiness of the relationship, because Trump tested it. And I think that Vice President Harris’ trip to Munich is an investment in ensuring that that solidarity continues.”\n\nStill, with grave warnings growing grimmer by the day from US officials, there’s a distinct possibility that Russia could invade Ukraine while Harris remains on foreign soil. New estimates from US officials provided Thursday would place the number of Russian forces north of the 150,000 figure Biden cited in a televised address earlier this week, despite Russian claims of withdrawal.\n\nIf Russia does attack while the conference is ongoing, Kupchan said, “The conversation then becomes much more urgent.”\n\n“Obviously, the vice president and her delegation would need to maintain closer contact with Washington because, you know, developments would be emerging on a minute-by-minute basis. But her message and her task doesn’t really change, in the sense that so much of the homework has already been completed,” Kupchan added.\n\n‘Part of a progression of her of her vice presidency’\n\nThe vice president’s foray into Western Europe will serve as her fifth trip abroad during her tenure. Her performance on the international stage has not been spotless, with moments amplified by the right and criticized from the left over her “do not come” message to migrants looking to come north to the US’ southern border during her first trip to Guatemala and Mexico.\n\nA subsequent trip to Southeast Asia, though Harris’ individual performance raised no issues, was overshadowed by the tumultuous fallout of the US’ bungled withdrawal from Afghanistan, leaving Harris to project competence in a moment of doubt from allies. Subsequent trips to Paris and Honduras, though months apart, brought the vice president praise for completing both trips gaffe-free.\n\nGoldstein views Harris’ current high stakes trip as the next step.\n\n“It’s part of a progression of her vice presidency,” Goldstein told CNN in an interview. “Vice presidents have taken on important missions in the past, and I think this is certainly the most significant mission yet of her vice presidency.”\n\nAt the start of her tenure, those close to Harris told CNN that foreign policy and national security were key areas she wants to develop in her portfolio. Harris’ foreign policy experience is less than her recent predecessors as she had only been working in Washington for four years before taking this new job. Harris began private lunches with Blinken – ones that White House official say still continue – and the pair share a good relationship, speaking frequently. Harris has also spent much of the Biden administration’s first year in power meeting with dozens of foreign leaders who come to the White House.\n\nAllies say Harris’ trip to Munich fits well into her wheelhouse because of her work as a freshman on the high-profile Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nSoifer, an adviser for Harris at the time, said she played a leading role on the committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\n“She got a crash course in terms of (Russian President) Vladimir Putin’s intentions and his strategy. While much of that experience was acquired behind the scenes, it did provide deep experience in terms of the threats that the United States and the global world order face from Russia in this moment,” Soifer said.\n\nBiden has flexed his decades of experience in dealing with international matters during the latest spike of Russian-Ukrainian tensions, specifically the years he spent as the US frontman on the issue during his last stint in the White House.\n\nWhile aware he cannot read Putin’s mind, Biden has spent long stretches trying to explain the enigmatic Russian leader to his aides, according to people present for the conversations.\n\nThose conversations have likely served as a valuable resource to Harris in her preparations for this critical trip.\n\n“I think the best preparation that she can possibly do, which I know she is doing, is her frequent conversations and meetings with President Biden,” Soifer told CNN.\n\nSoifer added that Harris is a thorough and meticulous preparer for moments like this.\n\n“Their conversations about this crisis will inform her approach in Munich. She is there speaking for the President and having spoken with him so many times in the lead up to this conference, it’s clear that she is representing his views and those of the administration,” she said.\n\nThe senior administration official told reporters that Harris and Biden have been repeatedly engaging with each other on the issue. Biden has attended this conference on multiple occasions, both when he was vice president and as a senator.\n\n“The vice president and the President see each other often, multiple times a day. They are closely engaged on every aspect of the governing agenda,” the senior official said, noting Harris’ attendance at the President’s daily intelligence briefings in the Oval Office “multiple times a week,” and at a range of other meetings on Russia and Ukraine, while at the President’s side.", "authors": ["Jasmine Wright Natasha Bertrand", "Jasmine Wright", "Natasha Bertrand"], "publish_date": "2022/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/politics/joe-biden-united-nations-general-assembly/index.html", "title": "Biden tells the United Nations that Putin's attempts to 'extinguish ...", "text": "United Nations CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday declared Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a violation of the global order, sharpening his rebukes of President Vladimir Putin as the war entered a tense new moment.\n\nBiden’s speech at the United Nations General Assembly came hours after Putin announced an expansion of his war effort, lending the annual address Cold War-style gravity as Biden sought to rally nations behind his effort to isolate and punish Russia.\n\n“This war is about extinguishing Ukraine’s right to exist as a state and Ukrainians’ right to exist as a people,” Biden told the international body. “That should make your blood run cold.”\n\nSpeaking inside the soaring General Assembly hall, Biden called the seven-month-old invasion a “brutal, needless war” that amounts to a “shameless violation” of the United Nations charter.\n\n“Putin claims he had to act because Russia was threatened, but no one threatened Russia and no one other than Russia sought conflict,” Biden said in his speech.\n\nBiden returned to the green-marbled United Nations stage Wednesday hours after Russia’s president delivered his provocative speech, setting up a rhetorical showdown between the two leaders on the international stage.\n\nPutin’s speech dramatically illustrated the challenges that lie ahead in Biden’s efforts to sustain Ukraine and punish Moscow. The combined effects of the prolonged conflict and economic uncertainty have created a dark mood among world leaders gathering in New York this week for the annual high-level UN meetings.\n\nBiden had already planned to make the Ukraine war a centerpiece of his yearly UN address, with aides previewing a harsh message for Moscow. But Putin’s announcement that he was ordering a “partial mobilization” of Russian citizens in the Ukraine war and again raising the specter of using nuclear weapons dramatically increased the stakes for Biden’s address.\n\nBiden accused Putin of making “irresponsible nuclear threats” in his speech, and declared “a nuclear war cannot be won, and must never be fought.”\n\n“Let us speak plainly: A permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded its neighbor, attempted to erase the sovereign state from the map,” he said.\n\nHours earlier, in his 20-minute speech, Putin warned he would use “all the means at our disposal” if he deemed the “territorial integrity” of Russia to be jeopardized. The mobilization means citizens who are in the reserve could be called up, and those with military experience would be subject to conscription, Putin said, adding that the necessary decree had already been signed and took effect on Wednesday.\n\nIn response, Biden said Putin was waging a war meant to demolish the Ukrainian nation.\n\n“We will stand in solidarity against Russia’s aggression, period,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video: Putin's threats and military escalation explained 02:25 - Source: CNN\n\nBiden warned that the basis of the United Nations’ charter is “under attack” amid Russia’s war in Ukraine, which he cast as a “shameless” violation of the body’s founding document.\n\n“As we meet today, the UN charter’s very basis of a stable and just rule-based order is under attack by those who wish to tear it down or distort it for their own political advantage,” Biden said, noting that the 1945 charter was negotiated by citizens “united in their commitment to work for peace.”\n\nPutin’s escalation came after stunning Russian setbacks in the war, which has dragged on for more than six months. Biden, who has led efforts to isolate Russia and supply Ukraine with advanced weaponry, had already been planning to underscore those efforts in Wednesday’s speech.\n\nPutin’s national address, which occurred after Biden had arrived in New York late Tuesday, caused White House aides to update some of the language in Biden’s speech, according to an official. But a total rewrite wasn’t necessary because White House officials had anticipated some of what Putin would say.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also planned to address the UN later on Wednesday.\n\nAfter making his debut UN address last year under the cloud of a messy Afghanistan withdrawal and stalled domestic ambitions, Biden’s aides believed he entered his sophomore outing with a stronger hand.\n\n“We believe that the President heads to New York with the wind at his back,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, citing a mostly-united western alliance and recent wins on the domestic front, including a historic investment in fighting climate change.\n\nQuestions about US leadership\n\nEven as Biden proclaimed renewed US leadership Wednesday, deeper questions persist over his ability to maintain that position in the years ahead, as fears of a global recession looms and threats to American democracy fester.\n\nBiden has spent ample time underscoring those threats in recent weeks, primarily for a domestic audience but with foreign capitals also listening intently. He has recounted in recent speeches sitting around a table at last year’s Group of 7 summit in Cornwall, England, telling fellow leaders that “America is back.”\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, Biden has told audiences, asked him: “For how long?”\n\nThat question still hangs over Biden’s efforts on the world stage, even a year-and-a-half into his term, as his predecessor continues to wield influence over the Republican Party and prepares to mount another run for the White House. Biden himself said in an interview that aired Sunday that while he intends to run for reelection, a final decision “remains to be seen.”\n\nOne of the issues currently at the forefront of global affairs – the pained negotiations to restart the Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew – only underscores the effects of pendulum swings in American leadership.\n\nIn his speech, Biden reiterated his stance that the US will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon as negotiations to revive a nuclear deal have failed to make significant progress in recent months.\n\n“While the United States is prepared for a mutual return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action if Iran steps up to its obligations, the United States is clear: We will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon,” Biden said.\n\nFor Biden, the yearly UN speech was another stab at explaining to the world how he has steered the United States back into a position of leadership after the “America First” years of Donald Trump.\n\nHe called for expanding the United Nations Security Council, saying countries should refrain from using their veto powers except in rare circumstances.\n\n“The United States supports increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent” Security Council members, Biden said in his speech.\n\nHe said constant vetoes from countries on the Council were harming its effectiveness, and said only using vetoes in “rare, extraordinary situations” would ensure the council “remains credible and effective.” Russia has consistently vetoed resolutions at the Security Council that have blocked action on Ukraine and other areas.\n\nIn his speech, Biden also announced $2.9 billion in US assistance to help address global food insecurity. The $2.9 billion investment, the White House said in a fact sheet, is aimed at shoring up food supply amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, widespread inflation and other supply chain issues, and builds on $6.9 billion already committed by the US this year.\n\nIt includes $2 billion in global humanitarian assistance through USAID, the US Agency for International Development.\n\nLater Wednesday morning, Biden will host a pledging session for the Global Fund to Fight HIV, AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In the evening, Biden and the first lady will host a leaders’ reception at the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nSpeech drafted over weeks\n\nBiden and his aides have been drafting the address for several weeks, a period that coincided with Ukraine’s successful counteroffensive taking back some Russian-held territory after months of occupation. The initiative had been coordinated with American officials, including through enhanced information and intelligence sharing, and sustained by weaponry provided by the US and its allies.\n\nUS officials have cautioned Ukraine’s current gains don’t necessarily signal a wider change in the outlook of the war, which remains likely to be a prolonged conflict. A day ahead of Biden’s speech, two Russian-controlled regions in eastern Ukraine announced plans for referendums on officially joining Russia, votes the US has previously warned would be “shams.”\n\nOne of Biden’s objectives in his speech Wednesday was stressing the importance of maintaining unity among western allies in supporting Ukraine in the uncertain months ahead.\n\nThat effort is made more difficult by a looming energy crisis as Russia withholds supplies of natural gas to Europe as winter sets in. Higher costs spurred in part by withering western sanctions on Moscow have led to an economic calamity that is causing political turmoil for many leaders in Biden’s coalition, including himself.\n\nMeeting new British leader\n\nThe President meets with one of those leaders, British Prime Minister Liz Truss, later Wednesday. It will be their first formal in-person talks since Truss entered office earlier this month following the decision of her predecessor, Boris Johnson, to step down.\n\nShe inherited a deep economic crisis, fueled by high inflation and soaring energy costs, that has led to fears the UK could soon enter a prolonged recession. While few in the Biden administration shed tears at Johnson’s resignation – Biden once described him as the “physical and emotional clone” of Trump – the US and the UK were deeply aligned in their approach to Russia under his leadership.\n\nWhite House officials expect that cooperation will continue under Truss, even as she comes under pressure to ease economic pressures at home.\n\nLess certain, however, is whether Truss’s hardline approach to Brexit will sour relations with Biden. The President has taken a personal interest in the particular issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a post-Brexit arrangement that requires extra checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nThe rules were designed to keep the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland open and avoid a return to sectarian violence. But Truss has moved to rewrite those rules, causing deep anxiety in both Brussels and Washington.\n\nBiden’s message for China\n\nPutin is not attending this year’s general assembly, though his foreign minister Sergey Lavrov was in New York for the event. Chinese President Xi Jinping also did not attend the UN in person this year.\n\nThe two autocratic leaders, who met in-person last week, have deepened ties between their countries as relations with the west deteriorate. Biden has warned Xi against supporting Putin in his invasion of Ukraine, a theme he’s expected to reiterate in Wednesday’s speech.\n\nBiden said in his speech the US was not seeking “conflict” with China or other nations.\n\n“We do not seek a cold war. We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partners,” Biden said.\n\nThis story has been updated with further developments on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2024/04/10/biden-white-house-japan-state-dinner-diplomacy/73244849007/", "title": "Biden hosts Japan PM, continues White House tradition of state ...", "text": "Stewart D. McLaurin\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nWednesday evening, President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden were joined in the White House’s East Room by more than 200 government dignitaries, cultural figures and other guests for a White House state dinner to honor Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Mrs. Yuko Kishida of Japan.\n\nIt’s the latest in a series of more than 300 dinners that have become a key part of White House history − and an important tool of American diplomacy.\n\nThese dinners, where the president and first lady honor a visiting head of state and their spouse, are more than living expressions of goodwill and hospitality. Leaders can build friendships as they break bread together, and alliances can grow stronger. Global power and influence are on display − and carefully crafted toasts are often part of diplomatic conversations also playing out in meetings and across oceans.\n\nWhat are 'state dinners' and how did they get started?\n\nIn the strictest sense, “state dinners” now refer to formal affairs for a visiting head of state. But when Washington’s political society was smaller and evolving, the term was used to describe smaller winter social gatherings to honor members of Congress and the Supreme Court (and sometimes diplomats or visiting royalty).\n\nAlthough the new nation was more populist and rough-hewn than its European forebears, these dinners borrowed old-world rank and protocol, with guests marching in unison to seats arranged by diplomatic rank. The president was served first − and no one could rise to leave the table before he did. (When the German ambassador suggested that the brother of the Kaiser walk first into a 1902 dinner held in his honor, President Theodore Roosevelt rebuffed him: “No person living precedes the president of the United States in the White House.”)\n\nHarris is the first femalevice president, but women have a long history at the White House\n\nThe first state dinner to honor a foreign head of state was held by President Ulysses Grant in 1874 for King David Kalakaua, monarch of the Hawaiian Kingdom, who was visiting to secure a tariff treaty.\n\nJoined by the speaker of the House, the chief justice and several Cabinet members, the king had royal food testers sample each of the 20-plus courses.\n\nIn the 19th century, White House formal dinners in the State Dining Room could only hold 50 people at a long I-shaped table flanked by fireplaces. Theodore Roosevelt transformed the room, removing a staircase and installing oak woodwork carved with moose, elk and buffalo heads, pedestal tables supported by eagles, and a silver-plate chandelier that all remain to this day.\n\nFranklin Roosevelt takes the dinners to a new level\n\nFranklin Roosevelt was the first president to host numerous state dinners. When King George VI visited Canada in 1939, Roosevelt invited the monarch to a formal White House dinner, part of the president’s careful campaign to build American support for Britain on the eve of World War II. The king and queen came to the White House in a parade witnessed by half a million people.\n\n“Neither of us fears aggression on the part of the other,” said the president in his formal toast. If this example “could only be universally followed,” he pointedly concluded, “men and women everywhere could once more look upon a happy, prosperous and a peaceful world.”\n\nRoosevelt built more domestic attention and support for Britain with a very American touch. At a picnic lunch at the Roosevelts' home in Hyde Park, New York − on a porch, with the president’s personal staff and their children – the king and queen were offered their first-ever hot dogs on a silver tray, topped off with strawberry shortcake and beer.\n\nThe president’s mother was not pleased, but The New York Times was: King Tries Hot Dog And Asks For More, ran the headline.\n\nAmerica's global rise brought it a great need for hosting foreign leaders\n\nOther presidents have hosted state dinners away from the White House. President Harry Truman used local hotels when the White House was being renovated. The Kennedys feted the president of Pakistan on the east lawn at Mount Vernon, bringing the food to George Washington’s home in refrigerated and heated army trucks. The Reagans hosted Queen Elizabeth II at the M.H. de Young Museum in San Francisco.\n\nHow Black people havechallenged US presidents to deliver on America's promises\n\nAs America rose to global leadership, and jet travel brought more foreign leaders to Washington, D.C., state dinners became a staple of statecraft.\n\nSome helped cultivate and foster relations with former wartime enemies like West Germany, Japan and Italy, which became critical allies during the Cold War. Others helped build ties with neutral powers like India and Brazil, or thaw relations with communist-bloc nations like China and the Soviet Union.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan hosted 59 state dinners, the most of any presidency. Traditional allies have been welcomed most often − Great Britain two dozen times, along with Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, France, Israel and Canada.\n\nPreparing for the event takes precise planning\n\nPreparations can begin at least six months before, led by the first lady and her staff, principally the social secretary and chief usher, in collaboration with the president’s staff and the State Department. Every detail is mapped out in advance, keeping the customs of the guest leader in mind.\n\nDeciding whom to invite to one of the most coveted events in political life is not simple. The social secretary gathers ideas from the president and first lady, the White House staff, the head of state’s entourage, and congressional and military leaders − then works to diversify the list with cultural and academic figures, athletes, entertainers and others.\n\nAs Mary Mel French, President Bill Clinton’s chief of protocol, put it, “The dinner showcases America. Not only from the diplomatic viewpoint, but artists and writers and actors and scholars and other people in America that all have a part in the country.”\n\nGuests at the last state dinner honoring a Japanese leader included CBS news anchor Bob Schieffer, television producer Shonda Rhimes and Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson.\n\nOn the evening of the dinner, military social aides escort guests to their seats (Jacqueline Kennedy switched to round tables to facilitate conversation), decked with flowers and set for multiple courses. The president wears a tuxedo − alternating between white tie and black tie over the years − while the first lady often wears the work of a U.S. fashion designer.\n\nThe White House kitchen staff has been busy for weeks preparing an imaginative menu showing off the best of U.S. foods (and wines), and connecting to the culture of the visiting delegation. A 2011 dinner for German Chancellor Angela Merkel began with a “White House Garden Chopped Salad” (made with vegetables from first lady Michelle Obama’s Kitchen Garden), followed by Maryland crab ravioli and apple strudel.\n\nState dinner desserts have a history in themselves. For a 1980 dinner for Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, the White House pastry chef borrowed an ice cream machine from a nearby restaurant to make kosher orange sorbet for a cake. Pomegranate-raspberry sorbet for the Chinese premier was held in a junk-style boat crafted from sugar. For Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife, White House Executive Pastry Chef Roland Mesnier created sugar baskets with a chocolate base patterned on the Kremlin’s parquet floor − with vanilla ice cream topped by chocolate candies shaped into Russian onion domes.\n\nThe evening’s entertainment begins with “The President’s Own,” the Marine Band. Their selections showcase American music and honor the heritage of the president’s guests. A-list guest performers have ranged from Mstislav Rostropovich, Frank Sinatra and Lionel Hampton to Mary J. Blige, Jon Batiste and the cast of \"Jersey Boys.\"\n\nThe political importance of the dinners can't be overstated\n\nHow important are these dinners? Lyndon Johnson’s chronicler Robert Caro devotes 10 pages to Johnson’s first state dinner in December 1963, held barely a month after President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, for West German Chancellor Ludwig Erhard. It was one of the most unusual and effective state dinners in White House history − and a master class in personal diplomacy.\n\nJohnson brought Erhad to his ranch in Texas hill country, where the state dinner was held at a local high school gymnasium. The gym’s walls were trimmed with bunting in Germany’s yellow, red and black. Cutouts of German eagles were affixed to the basketball backboards − next to bales of Texas ha, and a corral fence that was dressed with a saddle, a banjo, coiled lariats and boots with spurs.\n\nBarbecue and German potato salad were served from a Texas chuck wagon parked outside, with German chocolate cake for dessert. Guitars strummed, a Mexican mariachi band played and a cowgirl choir sang German carols –finishing with “Deep in the Heart of Texas” in German.\n\nLocals from nearby Fredericksburg, which was settled by Germans, chatted in German with the dignitaries (whom the president called up to the stage to be fitted with gray 10-gallon Stetson hats).\n\nAt a critical Cold War moment, personal diplomacy helped cement a key relationship. “I feel at home with you,” Erhard told first lady Lady Bird Johnson.\n\n“We have been able to state full agreement and full unity of views,” he said afterward. “This is not just a diplomatic statement; it is just the truth I feel.”\n\nWhen the chancellor returned home from what Newsweek magazine dubbed the “Sparerib Summit,” he told reporters that he and Johnson had established a personal relationship “that I think you can call friendship.”\n\nWhite House state dinners bring together high diplomacy, old-world pomp and American energy − fused with the ancient value of breaking bread together.

He canceled stops in Papua New Guinea and Australia and departed a dinner on Friday before other G-7 leaders to receive a briefing on the budget negotiations.\n\nBecause of his canceled trip to Australia, the White House said Biden will meet with other members of the so-called Quad security pact − Australia, Japan and India − on Saturday evening while he is in Hiroshima. Biden will also sit down with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese earlier in the day at a separate function.\n\nJapan is about 5,000 miles from Ukraine. Zelenskyy traveled a similar distance to Washington, D.C. in December last year. The war in Ukraine is one of the top items on the agenda in Hiroshima. Zelenskyy's attendance will come as G-7 countries − the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan − unveiled fresh sanctions on Russia over its invasion.\n\nOver the last week, Ukraine's leader has undertaken a diplomatic blitz of Europe, visiting Germany, France, Italy and the U.K. to drum up military and financial support as Ukraine hopes to turn the tide of the war with a heavily signaled impending counteroffensive against Russian forces. Zelenskyy's trip to Japan also comes as peace initiatives led by China and some African countries have been met with skepticism in Kyiv and western capitals.\n\n\"Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainian people.

It also introduced sanctions on foreign nationals aiding Russia's intelligence and military divisions and Russian officials accused of helping to facilitate the forced deportation and adoption of Ukrainian children.\n\n“Our collective efforts have cut Russia off from key inputs it needs to equip its military and is drastically limiting the revenue the Kremlin receives to fund its war machine,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.\n\nPutin wields a nuclear threat:Is it an empty one?\n\nBritain unveiled punitive measures that will block imports of Russian copper, aluminum and nickel. It also banned imports from Russia's lucrative diamond industry.\n\nAustralia said it would target Russian companies involved in nuclear research and weapons manufacturing.

There was also the lukewarm political support his slightly younger predecessor, Donald Trump, received when he announced his recent decision to run for president in 2024.\n\nBut Biden has not been able to shake voters’ apprehensions about his age, with rhetorical gaffes and literal stumbles at times reinforcing concerns about his health and mental acuity.\n\nBiden would be an unprecedented 86 years old by the end of his second term if he were to run and win his reelection. By comparison, some of the oldest past living presidents still had years on Biden – Trump left office at the age of 74 and Ronald Reagan left office after his two terms at 77 years old.\n\nThe president, for his part, maintains that voters concerned about his age should see his record of accomplishments since taking office.\n\n“Well, they’re concerned about whether or not I can get anything done. Look what I’ve gotten done,” Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper in October. “Name me a president in recent history that’s gotten done as much as I have in their first two years.”\n\nBiden said last month that while he has not made a formal decision about running for reelection in 2024, it is his “intention” to do so. But he’s long said it’s a decision both he and his family will decide on together. And Saturday’s wedding marks a kickoff of sorts for the tight-knit Bidens to begin earnest discussions over whether their patriarch should seek a second term.\n\nAnd the president isn’t the only Washington power reckoning with pressures to bow out. On the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, Nancy Pelosi, 82, recently announced plans to step down as House speaker, celebrating Democrats ushering in a new generation of leadership.

Biden wouldn’t invite Zelensky to Washington – and endure a risky trip outside Ukraine for the first time since the war began – if he did not believe something real could be accomplished meeting face-to-face instead of over the phone.\n\nEmerging from their talks, both men made clear they see the war entering a new phase. As Russia sends more troops to the frontlines and wages a brutal air campaign against civilian targets, fears of a stalemate are growing.\n\nYet as Zelensky departed Washington for a lengthy and similarly risky return trip to Ukraine, it wasn’t clear that a pathway to ending the conflict was any clearer.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky addresses Congress as Rep.

NA/Ukrainian Presidency In pictures: Zelensky's wartime visit to US Prev Next\n\nBiden and Zelensky try to figure out how the war ends\n\nGaining clarity on where Zelensky stands when it comes to ending the war was among the prerogatives in bringing him to the White House. The Ukrainian leader had previously expressed a desire for a “just peace” that would end the conflict – a point that US officials said would be at the center of their talks Wednesday.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Zelensky used bellicose rhetoric that suggested such a peace was not close, saying the road to ending the war would not involve making concessions to Russia.\n\n“For me as a president, ‘just peace’ is no compromises,” he said, indicating he doesn’t see any road to peace that involves Ukraine giving up territory or sovereignty.\n\nLater, in his address to Congress, Zelensky said he’d presented a 10-point peace formula to Biden – though US officials said afterward it was the same plan he offered to world leaders at the Group of 20 summit last month.\n\nAmong the Western nations that have rallied in support behind Zelensky, there have been lingering concerns about what Zelensky’s long-term plan might be.\n\nFor his part, Biden said it was up to Zelensky to “decide how he wants to the war to end,” a long-held view that leaves plenty of questions unanswered.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch Zelensky's historic speech to Congress 26:43 - Source: CNN\n\nZelensky shows he knows his audience – and displays his showmanship\n\nZelensky peppered his address to lawmakers with references to American history, from the critical Battle of Saratoga during the American Revolutionary War to the Battle of the Bulge in World War II.\n\nHe delivered his address in English, a purposeful choice he telegraphed ahead of the speech. Even his attire – the now-familiar Army green shirt, cargo pants and boots – seemed designed to remind his audience they were in the presence of a wartime leader.\n\nOver the course of the conflict, Zelensky has demonstrated an acute ability to appeal to his audience, be they national legislatures or the audience of the Grammys.\n\nOn Wednesday, he sought to harness Americans’ emotional response to his country’s suffering, evoking dark winter nights as Russia seeks to interrupt Ukraine’s power supply.\n\n“In two days we will celebrate Christmas. Maybe candlelit. Not because it’s more romantic, no, but because there will not be – there will be no electricity,” he said.\n\nBut he also seemed aware that many Americans – including some Republicans in Congress – have wondered aloud why billions of US dollars are needed for a conflict thousands of miles away. He sought to make the cause about more than his own homeland.\n\n“The battle is not only for life, freedom, and security of Ukrainians or any other nation which Russia attempts to conquer,” he said. “The struggle will define in what world our children and grandchildren will live in.”\n\nHe added, “Your money is not charity. It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch Zelensky unveil flag during historic speech to Congress 01:59 - Source: CNN\n\nZelensky finally accepts the ride he was offered – and gets the ammo too\n\nAt the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine, Zelensky turned down an American offer to evacuate him from Kyiv.\n\n“I need ammunition, not a ride,” Zelensky told the US.\n\nTen months later, he got both. When Zelensky touched down outside Washington in a US military plane Wednesday, his arrival capped a 10-day sprint by American and Ukrainian officials to arrange a risky wartime visit meant to rally support for Ukraine’s ongoing resistance to Russia’s invasion.\n\nJust ahead of Zelensky’s arrival, the Biden administration announced it is sending nearly $2 billion in additional security assistance to Ukraine – including a sophisticated new Patriot air defense system that Zelensky has been requesting for months.\n\nIn weighing a visit, Zelensky suggested to advisers he did not want to travel to Washington had there not been a significant development in the bilateral relationship with the United States, according to a source familiar with the matter. Zelensky viewed the US decision to send a Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine as a major shift in the relationship between the two allies.\n\nYet standing alongside Biden, he was frank that he did not view the single Patriot system as enough.\n\n“We would like to get more Patriots,” he said as Biden laughed. “I’m sorry but we are in war.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'This is Vladimir Putin's worst nightmare': Tapper reacts to Zelensky's speech 01:19 - Source: CNN\n\nA united front in one of the world’s most complicated relationships\n\nSpeaking later to Congress, Zelensky was again up front that he did not believe the American support was sufficient.\n\n“Is it enough? Honestly, not really,” he said of the artillery that the US has so far provided.\n\nZelensky’s candid request for more Patriots – and Biden’s lighthearted response – amounted to a window into one of the world’s most complicated relationships.\n\nOn the surface, Biden and Zelensky have maintained a stalwart partnership. And Zelensky was effusive in his praise of Biden as he went from the Oval Office to the East Room to Capitol Hill.\n\nYet it doesn’t take much to see tensions just beneath the surface. Zelensky has consistently agitated for additional US support, despite the tens of billions of dollars in military assistance that Biden has directed to his country.\n\nThat hasn’t always sat well with Biden or his team. But as he has with a host of other foreign leaders, Biden appeared intent Wednesday on translating physical proximity into a better understanding of his counterpart.\n\n“It is all about looking someone in the eye. I mean it sincerely. I don’t think there is any substitute for sitting down face to face with a friend or a foe and looking them in the eye,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Listen to Zelensky's message to Americans from Oval Office 06:00 - Source: CNN\n\nA visit that symbolizes a ‘new phase’ in the war\n\nBiden invited Zelensky to Washington this week because he believes the war in Ukraine is entering a “new phase,” officials said ahead of the visit. As winter sets in and Russia continues targeting civilian infrastructure, the moment seemed ripe for Zelensky to make a dramatic public appeal for continued international support.\n\nYet the new phase isn’t only on the battlefield. Around the world, leaders are confronting the bitter fallout of Russia’s invasion. Higher energy and food prices, in part generated by tough sanctions on Moscow, have caused trouble for politicians in Europe and the United States.\n\nIn Washington, Republicans poised to take control of Congress have made clear they won’t rubber stamp each of Biden’s requests for Ukraine assistance – though fears funding will dry up completely appear unfounded. Congress is on the verge of approving almost $50 billion in additional security and economic assistance.\n\nSpeaking to lawmakers, Zelensky repeatedly referred to members of “both parties,” seeking to frame his cause as a bipartisan one.\n\nStill, some Republicans refused to attend Zelensky’s address to Congress, a protest of what they claim are unrestrained dollars heading out of the US.\n\nIt was against that backdrop Biden insisted US support would continue for months.\n\nHe said it was “important for the American people, and for the world, to hear directly from you, Mr. President, about Ukraine’s fight, and the need to continue to stand together through 2023.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/01/politics/transcript-joe-biden-white-house-correspondents-dinner/index.html", "title": "TRANSCRIPT: Joe Biden's full White House Correspondents' dinner ...", "text": "Washington, DC CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden spoke Saturday at the White House Correspondent’s Dinner, marking his first appearance at the widely attended Washington event since taking office and the first time a US president has attended the dinner in six years.\n\nRead his remarks as released by the White House, lightly edited for style:\n\nThank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, Steve, for that introduction. And a special thanks to the 42% of you who actually applauded.\n\nI’m really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans with a lower approval rating than I have. That’s hard to say after what we just saw.\n\nThis is the first time a president attended this dinner in six years. It’s understandable. We had a horrible plague followed by two years of Covid.\n\nJust imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year. Now, that would really have been a real coup if that occurred. A little tough, huh?\n\nBut I’m honored to be here at such an event with so much history.\n\nAs already referenced, the very first president to attend the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was Calvin Coolidge in 1924. I had just been elected to the United States Senate. And I reme – I remember telling him, “Cal, just be yourself. Get up there and speak from the heart. You’re going to be great, kid. You’re going to do it well.”\n\nOf course, Jill is with me tonight. Jilly, how are you, kid? I think – I think she’s doing an incredible job as first lady. The first lady to continue working full-time, and she does as a professor.\n\nShe doesn’t pay much attention to the polls, though she did say the other day: Instead of introducing myself as Jill Biden’s husband, maybe I should introduce myself as her roommate.\n\nI’ve attended this dinner many times, but this is my first time as president. And the organizers had – had it hard – made it pretty hard for me tonight. Although the good news is, if all goes well, I have a real shot at replacing James Corden.\n\nIt was great having him over at the White House the other day, just as he announced he’s leaving the show. A great performer is going out on top after eight years in the job. Sounds just about right to me.\n\nAnd it’s tough to follow pros like James and Billy Eichner. Billy, where are you again? Do you – where is he?\n\nWell, Billy, you’re famous for interviewing – your interviewing skills. Billy, you should know what you’re doing, pal. You know it, you know it well. And you should – I think – you should host “Meet the Press.” Maybe they’ll start to watch it again.\n\nI’ve never had – never had to – I’ve never had to open – I’ll never be – I’ll never be invited to “Meet the Press” again. Anyway.\n\nI’ve never had to open before Trevor Noah. Trevor is great. When I was elected, he did a show and he called me “America’s new dad.” Let me tell you something, pal: I’m flattered anybody would call me a “new” anything. You’re my guy.\n\nAnd, folks, it’s been a tough few years for the country. That’s one reason why it’s great to be here again.\n\nEveryone at the White House is so excited. I told my grandkids and Pete Buttigieg they could stay up late and watch this show tonight.\n\nTonight – tonight we come here and answer a very important question on everybody’s mind: Why in the hell are we still doing this?\n\nI know there are – I know there are questions about whether we should gather here tonight because of Covid. Well, we’re here to show the country that we’re getting through this pandemic. Plus, everyone had to prove they were fully vaccinated and boosted.\n\nSo, if you’re at home watching this and you’re wondering how to do that, just contact your favorite Fox News reporter. They’re all here, vaccinated and boosted – all of them.\n\nAnd, look, Fox – Fox News, I’m – I’m really sorry your preferred candidate lost the last election. To make it up to you, I’m happy to give my chief of staff to you all so he can tell Sean Hannity what to say every day.\n\nIn fact, Ron Klain is here at the CBS table, which hired Mick Mulvaney. Mick, on CBS? I was stunned. I figured he’d end up on “The Masked Singer” with Rudy.\n\nAmazing hire, guys. Really quite amazing.\n\nLook, I know this is a tough town. I came to office with an ambitious agenda, and I expected it to face stiff opposition in the Senate. I just hoped it would be from Republicans.\n\nBut I’m not worried about the midterms. I’m not worried about them. We may end up with more partisan gridlock, but I’m confident we can work it out during my remaining six years in the presidency.\n\nAnd, folks, I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style. Besides, there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.\n\nAnd, you know, at the same – at the same time, a lot of people say the Republican Party is too extreme, too divisive, too controlled by one person. They say, “It’s not your father’s Republican Party.”\n\nRonald Reagan said, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear this wall down.” Today’s Republicans say, “Tear down Mickey Mouse’s house.” And pretty soon, they’ll be storming Cinderella’s castle, you can be sure of it.\n\nBut Republicans seem to support one fella – some guy named Brandon. He’s having a really good year, and I’m kind of happy for him.\n\nLet me conclude with a serious word.\n\nWe live in serious times. We’re coming through a devastating pandemic, and we have to stay vigilant. I know Kamala wanted to be here, for example, and thankfully she’s doing well. You should all know she sends her best.\n\nWe’re in a time when what we so long have taken for granted is facing the gravest of threats. And I’m being deadly earnest.\n\nOversear- [sic] – overseas, the liberal world order that laid the foundation for global peace, stability and prosperity since World War II is genuinely, seriously under assault.\n\nAnd at home, a poison is running through our democracy of all – all of this taking place with disinformation massively on the rise, where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth.\n\nWhat’s clear – and I mean this from the bottom of my heart – that you, the free press, matter more than you ever did in the last century. No, I really mean it.\n\nI’ve always believed that good journalism holds up a mirror to ourselves, to reflect on the good, the bad and the true. Tonight, I want to congratulate the awardees and the scholarship winners who carry on that sacred tradition.\n\nWe’ve all seen the courage of the Ukrainian people because of the courage of American reporters in this room and your colleagues across the world, who are on the ground, taking their lives in their own hands.\n\nAnd although it’s not in Ukraine, it’s Russia – Mom, I’d like to meet you and Dad to talk about your son.\n\nWe just – we just saw a heartbreaking video: Nine have been killed reporting from Kyiv – struck by a kamikaze drone strike after a shopping mall attack; shot in the neck while decounci- [sic] – while – while documenting Ukrainians fleeing; killed when Russian missiles hit the television tower in a residential neighborhood. One journalist from Radio Liberty just killed days ago.\n\nSo many of you telling the stories and taking the photos and recording the videos of what’s happening there, the unvarnished truth shown – showing the – the destruction and the devastation and, yes, the war crimes.\n\nTonight, we also honor the legacy of two historic reporters, and that is Alice Dunnigan and Ethel Payne. I’m glad you saw that tonight. I didn’t know you were doing that. These are the first Black women to be White House reporters, who shattered convention to cover a segregated nation.\n\nWe honor journalists killed, missing, imprisoned, detained and tortured; covering war, exposing corruption and holding leaders accountable.\n\nWe honor members of the press, both national and local, covering a once-in-a-century pandemic where we lost a million Americans, a generation reckoning on race and the existential threat of climate change.\n\nThe free press is not the enemy of the people – far from it. At your best, you’re guardians of the truth.\n\nPresident Kennedy once said, and I quote, “Without debate, without criticism, no administration, no country can succeed, and no republic can survive.”\n\nThe First Amendment grants a free press extraordinary protection, but with it comes, as many of you know, a very heavy obligation: to seek the truth as best you can – not to inflame or entertain, but to illuminate and educate.\n\nI know it’s tough. And I’m not being solicitous. The industry is changing significantly.\n\nThere’s incredible pressure on you all to deliver heat instead of shed light, because the technology is changing so much, the system is changing. But it matters. No kidding. It matters. The truth matters.\n\nAmerican democracy is not a reality show. It’s not a reality show. It’s reality itself. And the reality is that we are a great country.\n\nOur future is bright. It’s not guaranteed, because democracy is never guaranteed. It has to be earned. It has to be defended. It has to be protected.\n\nAs you’ve heard me say many times: There’s not a damn thing this country can’t do when we stand united and do it together. And I know we can do anything we want to do that’s right.\n\nI’ve been around a long time, as has been pointed out many times tonight. But I give you my word as a Biden: I’ve never been more optimistic about America than I am today. I really mean it.\n\nAt times of enormous change, it presents enormous opportunities. For despite all the crises, all the partisanship, all the shouting and the showmanship,\n\nI really know this and you know it too: We are a great nation because we’re basically a good people.\n\nAnd here in America, good journalism, good satire about our leaders, about our society is quintessentially an American thing. It demonstrates the power of our example.\n\nAnd I, honest to God, believe it reveals our soul – the soul of our nation.

But in the age of a pandemic, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s close proximity to the President during the signing – just a day before she would announce that she had tested positive for Covid-19 – has triggered alarm.\n\nAnd elsewhere in Washington, a slew of cases among political partygoers illustrates the push and pull between returning back to “normal” life and continuing efforts to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nWhite House communications director Kate Bedingfield told CNN’s John Berman Friday that it is “possible” Biden will eventually contract Covid-19, but she added the White House continues to take precautions.\n\n“The President is certainly living his life, just as you say all Americans across the country are – while taking precautions, while ensuring that we’re following CDC guidance,” she said.\n\nWhile Covid case numbers in Washington and around the country remain low, a rash of cases among high-profile lawmakers and notable figures in the nation’s capital has led to increased scrutiny on the administration’s Covid protocols.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, in particular, is in the spotlight for her seeming disregard of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for those who were exposed to Covid-19. Her communications director, Jamal Simmons, tested positive after attending the annual Gridiron Club Dinner, one of at least 37 people who have tested positive following the event where members of the press hobnob with prominent Washington officials.\n\nSimmons was a close contact of the vice president, the White House said in a statement. A close contact is defined by the CDC as being within 6 feet for a cumulative total of 15 minutes over a 24-hour period. While Harris did not need to quarantine because of Simmons’ positive test, the White House said that she would follow CDC guidance for close contacts.\n\nBut on Thursday, as she presided over the confirmation vote for incoming Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the vice president was seen maskless at the Senate dais. Harris sometimes could be seen putting her hand up, as if to request a senator not approach too closely, but there were times when individuals, masked and unmasked, did approach her.\n\nThe CDC recommends that people who are exposed to Covid and are up-to-date on vaccinations be tested at least five days after the close contact as well as wear masks around other people for 10 days following the contact. The guidelines do not say that person can be maskless around others if they are practicing social distancing.\n\nA White House official, responding to questions about why Harris had not been wearing a mask inside the Senate chamber during the vote, said the vice president had consulted with a White House physician, was “practicing social distancing” and had “limited and brief interactions from her chair.”\n\nAsked earlier whether Harris had breached protocol by remaining unmasked inside the chamber, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said she had not done “further analysis” and noted that the vice president was sitting on a dais slightly away from the Senate floor.\n\nShe later said Harris would follow CDC protocols at other events, such as the celebration at the White House for Jackson’s confirmation. The President and vice president have continued to test negative for Covid-19 and have both received their second Covid-19 vaccine booster doses in recent days.\n\nTesting Biden’s bubble\n\nThe President, who is 79 years old, is at an increased risk for a more severe case of Covid-19 because of his age, although the CDC says older adults who are up-to-date on vaccines and boosters significantly reduce their risk of hospitalization and death.\n\nBiden’s bubble, the White House maintains, goes beyond the CDC’s guidelines to insulate him from potential infection – testing individuals close to him and implementing physical distancing when possible. And yet, as this week’s events have transpired, the limits of the White House bubble have been tested – with Covid currently affecting at least four individuals in the line of succession to the President to varying degrees.\n\nOfficials and visitors have not been required to wear masks or socially distance at large White House events since the CDC updated its new metrics to guide Covid-19 restrictions such as mask-wearing in late February. Covid cases in Washington have declined since their peak in early January, when the country was facing a wave of Omicron variant cases.\n\nThe White House says that only individuals who are in “close contact” with Biden are tested immediately before meeting or attending events with him, and that not everyone who attended Wednesday’s event on the Postal Service was tested. It also says additional testing protocols for Biden will be up to his doctors.\n\nPelosi, along with other members of Congress at the White House on Wednesday, tested negative ahead of the signing event.\n\nShe and the dinner attendees who have tested positive are not considered to be close contacts of the President. Those dinner attendees include Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo; Attorney General Merrick Garland; Simmons; first lady Jill Biden’s press secretary, Michael LaRosa; Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas; Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California; Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine; and the President’s sister, Valerie Biden Owens.\n\nEven with the spate of positive tests and apparent close calls for the President, the White House is moving forward with normal events – on Friday, Biden will hold an outdoor celebration for Jackson’s confirmation.\n\nThe reception has already drawn some parallels to Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination announcement in the White House Rose Garden in late September 2020, which ended up being a likely Covid-19 superspreader event, and preceded then-President Donald Trump’s Covid-related hospitalization by less than a week.\n\nThe Biden White House has noted, importantly, that unlike at the time of Barrett’s reception, Americans now have wide access to Covid-19 vaccines.\n\n“At that point in time, vaccines weren’t available. People were not vaccinated. It certainly puts us in a different space,” Psaki said on Thursday, emphasizing that Friday’s event will be outdoors.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/03/politics/biden-harris-national-prayer-breakfast/index.html", "title": "National Prayer Breakfast: President Biden urges Congress to come ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday stressed the importance of unifying the country at a “moment of great division,” as he delivered remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast at the US Capitol.\n\n“As I stand in this citadel of democracy that was attacked one year ago, the issue is, for us, is unity. How do we unite us again?” Biden said. “Unity is elusive, but it’s really actually necessary.”\n\n“Unity doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything, but unity is where enough of us, enough of us believe in a core of basic things: The common good, the general welfare, of faith in the United States of America,” Biden said, speaking from the Capitol Visitors Center for the 70th annual National Prayer Breakfast.\n\nThe President said the division in the country “has become so palpable,” and that there is “so much at stake.”\n\nThe President said: “One of the things I pray for, and I mean it, is that we sorta get back to the place – it’s so busy, I think things have changed so much – but that we get to really know each other. It’s hard to really dislike someone when you know what they’re going through the same thing you’re going through.”\n\nThe President, addressing members of Congress in the crowd, said he believed lawmakers don’t spend as much time with one another as they used to. He noted lawmakers of both parties would eat lunch together more often when he first started in the Senate decades ago.\n\nThe annual multi-faith prayer breakfast is meant to bring bipartisan political leaders and their religious counterparts together to meet, pray and build relationships. Because of Covid-19, this year’s event has been pared down and the number of guests is limited.\n\nThe event is typically held on the first Thursday of February each year and was first organized in 1953. Every president since Dwight D. Eisenhower has headlined the event.\n\nBiden spoke at the event last year in the wake of the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol and in the midst of that year’s winter wave of Covid-19 cases. During that speech, he called for unity and faith during what he described as a “dark, dark time” for many Americans.\n\nThose remarks stood in contrast to former President Donald Trump’s remarks at the annual breakfast hosted by the nonprofit Fellowship Foundation. In 2020, Trump, who had been acquitted in his first impeachment trial the day before, took veiled shots at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Mitt Romney, the only Republican who voted to convict him. At his first appearance in 2017, Trump asked the room full of lawmakers, foreign dignitaries and religious leaders to “pray for Arnold” Schwarzenegger so that ratings of his show – NBC’s “The Apprentice” – would go up.\n\nThe President will then head to New York to discuss his administration’s strategy to combat gun violence. Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland will join Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul for a “Gun Violence Strategies Partnership” meeting, the White House says. The group will also visit a New York public school to discuss community violence intervention programs with local leaders.\n\nThe President is scheduled to address the nation later Thursday morning after announcing US Special Forces killed ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi in a counterterrorism mission in northwest Syria Wednesday evening.", "authors": ["Kate Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/30/politics/gallery/2022-white-house-correspondents-dinner/index.html", "title": "The 2022 White House Correspondents' Dinner | CNN Politics", "text": "1.

Why experts say not to worry.", "text": "A confirmed case of human bubonic plague in Oregon raised fears over a resurgence of the infamous contagion that wiped out millions in the Middle Ages. But officials say there's no cause for alarm.\n\nAuthorities confirmed on Feb. 7 that the infected person caught the plague from their house cat. Officials in Deschutes County, a county in Central Oregon where the person lives, contacted and provided medicine to all close contacts of the person and their cat.\n\nThe infected person was diagnosed and treated early on, \"posing little risk to the community,\" the agency said.\n\nMore:Alaska man’s death marks first fatal case of Alaskapox: What to know about the rare virus\n\nExperts say little cause for concern about bubonic plague today\n\nThe plague wiped out at least a third of Europe's population in the Middle Ages, but officials said there is no cause for concern today.\n\nNot at all, said Dr. Robert Bollinger, the Raj and Kamla Gupta Professor of Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\n\"It's not unusual to have an isolated case of bubonic plague,\" Bollinger told USA TODAY. \"It's serious when it happens, but it's treatable if you catch it early enough.\"\n\nThe Oregon case is consistent with a handful of cases that pop up annually in the country, \"usually somewhere between five and 10 cases a year reported in the United States,\" Bollinger said. \"That's been pretty consistent for many, many decades.\"\n\nBubonic plague is one of three ways that the bacteria, known as Yersinia pestis to scientists, can cause disease in humans, Bollinger said. The bubonic form, the most common, causes swollen glands.\n\nAnother more serious form of the disease triggers severe pneumonia. \"That's been associated with the big breaks that happened historically,\" Bollinger said. Pneumonic plague can be transmitted directly between humans coughing, but it's less contagious than COVID-19 or influenza.\n\nIn the last form, septicemic, plague bacteria enter the bloodstream.\n\nBubonic plague not directly transmissible between humans\n\nBubonic plague isn't directly transmissible between humans. \"It's transmitted through fleas or contacts from an infected animal to a human,\" Bollinger said.\n\nThat explains why bubonic plague devastated Europe in the 1300s, even though it poses little threat to humans now.\n\nPeople in the Middle Ages lived \"in very, very close quarters with each other and with rodents,\" Bollinger said, creating a more ideal environment for the plague to jump between the animals and humans.\n\n\"We had a lot more contact with rodents and fleas back in those days than we do now,\" Bollinger said.\n\nNowadays, unless someone is coming into unusually close contact with rodents, \"it's not a big deal,\" Bollinger said.\n\n\"It's just part of the environment,\" he said. \"It's part of the microbiome of some of these rodents.\"\n\n'Very treatable'\n\nTreatments for plague have also vastly improved. \"We have really good treatments, if we get them to people earlier, that weren't available back in the day,\" Bollinger said. \"There's lots of antibiotics that work really well. If you start early enough, it's very treatable.\"\n\nWith proper treatment, a bubonic plague infection could clear up \"over a period of weeks,\" Bollinger said.\n\nAuthorities in Deschutes said the recent case is the first in the state since 2015. Deschutes officials said squirrels and chipmunks are the most likely carriers of the disease in central Oregon, but mice and rodents can also be infected, according to the announcement.\n\nBollinger said 80% of cases in the U.S. occur in the Four Corners area – New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, and Arizona – due to the area's concentration of rodent populations.\n\nDeschutes County Health Services said people can prevent the plague's spread by discouraging house cats from hunting rodents and not touching dead rodents. They also warned against feeding squirrels, chipmunks, and rodents and advised wearing long pants tucked in to boots to avoid fleas.\n\nCybele Mayes-Osterman is a breaking news reporter for USA Today.

It now also has two farmworkers with confirmed bird flu infections – transmitted to them by close contact with sick cows.\n\nTexas is the only other state where a person is known to have contracted the H5N1 virus from a cow, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That state has reported 15 cattle herd infections since March. Seven other states – Idaho, South Dakota, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio and North Carolina – also have cow herds with known infections, the USDA reported.\n\nThe reason Michigan's tally of livestock outbreaks and farmworkers with avian influenza is higher than other states is not because Michigan is especially ripe for viral activity or because there's something different about the state's cows or workers, said Dr. Arnold Monto, emeritus professor of epidemiology and global public health at the University of Michigan and co-director of the Michigan Center for Respiratory Virus Research and Response.\n\n\"The main reason we're detecting more infection is because we're doing very good surveillance,\" Monto said. \"Other states need to do the same. ... It's being missed.\"\n\nThe CDC reported May 22 that 40 people had been tested for highly pathogenic avian influenza nationally. The same day, Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan's chief medical officer, told the Free Press that 35 Michigan farmworkers had undergone testing.\n\nThat means only five people tested as of May 22 were from states other than Michigan. It also means the reach of the virus \"is certainly more widespread\" nationally than anyone currently knows, Monto said.\n\n\"The conclusions are pretty obvious when you hear things like that,\" said Monto. \"If you don't look, you're not going to find it. What we need is to get serious about it in terms of how we handle surveillance because if you don't know it's there and don't have regulations in place ... it's going to spread even more.\"\n\nThe CDC updated its testing and monitoring data Friday, saying 44 people have now been tested nationally for the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, and more than 390 people have been monitored as a result of their exposure to infected or potentially infected animals.\n\nThe agency said it is also stepping up national surveillance/testing by:\n\nAsking local labs to send more samples for subtyping to the CDC and state public health labs to test for the H5N1 virus.\n\nExtending reporting of flu-related hospitalizations through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network. The CDC typically stops reporting influenza hospitalizations from May-September because it’s ordinarily such a seasonal virus. So far, the CDC said its surveillance systems show no indication of unusual flu activity in people.\n\nIncreasing outreach through state and local health departments to health care providers and clinics about H5N1 symptoms so avian influenza is considered when patients with conjunctivitis or respiratory illness and a history of exposure to animals seek medical care.\n\nHow the virus came to Michigan cow herds\n\nThe outbreak of H5N1 virus in dairy cattle – with spillover to humans – began in Texas just a few months ago. It came to Michigan in late March, when infected cows crossed state lines, said Tim Boring, the director of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\n\"We know that a farm in Montcalm County initially (had an outbreak) as a result of cattle movement,\" Boring said, \"and we've seen an expansion of our cases out of that general area since then.\"\n\nCalling the H5N1 outbreak among poultry and cattle in Michigan an \"extraordinary emergency,\" Boring issued an order May 1 that required all dairy and commercial poultry farms in Michigan to adopt biosecurity practices to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nAmong the requirements: Farms must secure animal areas, establish a perimeter and limit access. They must name a biosecurity manager and train employees, and establish cleaning and disinfection practices for all with contact within the perimeter, including delivery drivers. They must keep log books tracking all who enter and leave.\n\nMore:Avian flu has spread to cows, milk — and experts worry human outbreak could be next\n\nThe order also prohibited all lactating dairy cattle, and those in the last two months of pregnancy, from being exhibited at fairs and festivals until there are no new cases of the virus statewide in dairy cattle for at least 60 consecutive days. Similarly, poultry also cannot be taken to exhibitions, fairs or festivals until no new cases of the virus have been detected in domestic poultry for at least 30 consecutive days.\n\nThe state agriculture department also teamed up closely with state and local health departments to ensure people would be protected, Boring said.\n\n\"In Michigan, we're testing in animals and we're testing in people and we've seen really strong coordination between animal and human health components within the state level, the federal level and on the local level,\" he told the Free Press on Friday. \"Part of the reason that we've seen good responses on testing is because of the involvement of local health departments. Those are trusted community partners. They are neighbors, not folks coming in from out of town. We're taking this really seriously. It's a proactive approach. This is both an animal and a public health concern, and we're managing it as such.\"\n\nStill, Boring said, there are many unanswered questions about this virus, including how it spreads.\n\n\"We likely have a multifactorial transmission matrix going on of how the virus spreads from dairy farm to dairy farm. ... We're getting a better handle on it every day, and we're continuing to lead across the country of what the response looks like.\"\n\nHuman cases so far have been mild\n\nAll three people known to be infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza in the U.S. this year have had mild symptoms.\n\nThe Texas farmworker and the first person in Michigan to get ill from exposure to infected cattle reported only conjunctivitis, or pink eye. In the second Michigan case, which was announced Thursday, a farmworker had upper respiratory tract symptoms, including cough without fever, and eye discomfort with watery discharge, the CDC reported.\n\nThere is concern among scientists that the impact on people could change, as more animals get infected.\n\nThe more the virus spreads in animals, the greater the likelihood of human exposures and transmission, Monto said, which also increases the odds that the virus could mutate in a way that would allow H5N1 to spread from person to person or cause more severe disease.\n\n\"That's why we really need to control it – not because we're sure that is going to happen, but because if that does happen, there's a chance it's going to be pretty bad,\" Monto said.\n\nThe CDC is conducting genetic sequencing on the most recent human case in Michigan to determine what, if any changes, there might be.\n\nAll three known human cases so far involved the 2.3.4.4b lineage of the virus that is nearly identical to the H5N1 viruses circulating in U.S. dairy cows, the CDC reported.\n\nIn samples taken from the infected eye of the first Michigan farmworker, whose case was announced May 22, the CDC identified a mutation that allows mammals to be infected more easily. However, it did not contain changes that would likely make it easier for the virus to spread from human to human.\n\nAnd that's key, Monto said.\n\n\"We're lucky that there are receptor-binding issues that are preventing it from getting into humans easily,\" Monto said, \"because if it were easy to transmit, with all of the workers that are on these farms handling the equipment, which is heavily contaminated, we would see more cases.\"\n\nThe virus affects animals, people differently\n\nThe impact of the virus on animals so far has been extremely variable, said Timothy Cernak, an assistant professor of chemistry and medicinal chemistry at the University of Michigan.\n\n\"The virus behaves different in each species,\" said Cernak, whose work centers on developing new antiviral drugs that could be added to the arsenal of current antivirals to help stop a potential avian flu outbreak. \"There are species that it gets into and they just don't seem to notice,\" while others get very sick and others see mass die-offs.\n\nThe current H5N1 strain in the U.S. is extremely deadly in birds and cats, sea lions, raccoons and skunks.\n\nDairy cows get sick from the virus but don't typically die. A report from Michigan State University suggests cows on one Michigan farm with an H5N1 outbreak had high fevers and dehydration. There was a drop in rumination as well, which turns the grass they eat into energy and milk. Milk production dropped dramatically, and some pregnant cows miscarried.\n\nLast week, the USDA reported that alpacas in Idaho also have contracted the virus. And mice became sick within a day of drinking raw milk from an infected cow. The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter from researchers at the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory that showed the mice had high levels of virus in their organs. Levels also were high in the mammary glands of two mice – even though the mice were not lactating.\n\n\"In elephant seals it killed 96% of the pups from last year,\" Cernak said, adding that the virus also devastated the bald eagle population and affected horned owls. \"It's entirely possible in wild populations, there are significant risks of extinction-level events happening.\"\n\nMore:Michigan farmworker is second US case of H5N1bird flu likely transmitted from cow to human\n\nFor humans, he said a different subtype of H5N1 avian influenza that spread in Cambodia from 2003 to 2023 caused severe illness and deaths.\n\n\"In Cambodia, the fatality rate in humans was really high, and that's the concerning thing,\" Cernak said. Of 64 people who contracted the other subtype of the virus, 41 died, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nCould respiratory symptoms signal easier human-to-human spread?\n\nFor now, as the bird flu circulating in the U.S. has remained mild in the few human cases, Cernak said he is concerned about the potential for respiratory transmission to give this virus a boost.\n\n\"The biggest risk that we have is that it mutates toward respiratory transmission,\" he told the Free Press last week — before the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services announced that the state does now, in fact, have a farmworker with H5 infection and respiratory symptoms.\n\nIt's unclear, however, whether having those symptoms will make it easier to spread the virus from person to person.\n\nJoe Coyle, deputy state epidemiologist and director of the MDHHS Bureau of Infectious Disease, said it's the first time respiratory symptoms have been associated with a human H5N1 influenza case following contact with sick cows.\n\n\"Generally speaking, with something like influenza and respiratory viruses, when you have respiratory symptoms, you're more likely to spread the virus than if it was just conjunctivitis like the previous case we had in Michigan and the one in Texas,\" Coyle said.\n\n\"It is a new presentation, and it's something that we'll definitely be looking at ... to see if this represents a different mutation of the virus that's causing these types of symptoms, or is it really the same virus but just a different route of transmission with respect to the human exposure.\"\n\nThe CDC reported that the farmworker with respiratory symptoms was treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir, better known as Tamiflu, and is isolating at home. None of the person's contacts have developed symptoms and all are being monitored and offered antiviral medication.\n\nMore outreach to farms needed\n\nDr. Adam Lauring, an associate professor of infectious diseases and microbiology at U-M, said there are still a lot of unknowns when it comes to the current U.S. H5N1 avian influenza outbreak.\n\n\"Often in the health field, we are maybe appropriately focused on the humans, but the wider the outbreak is in animals, the more risk there is of humans being infected because there are more potential contacts,\" he said.\n\n\"I think everyone's trying to understand different ways that it could be spreading among dairy cattle within a herd and also between herds or between farms, and I think that's an important thing that we need to really get a better understanding of.\n\n\"In terms of how far it has spread in humans, that is dependent on really being able to do good surveillance, which is challenging in this situation in that it depends on people coming to attention, reporting their symptoms, getting tested.\"\n\nMany farmworkers are undocumented migrant workers for whom English might not be a first language and who might be concerned about being deported if they say they are sick or seek medical care.\n\n\"A lot of these populations are hard to reach,\" Lauring said. \"I know MDHHS has been doing outreach to try to do as best they can with surveillance for symptoms in people to try to catch anyone who could be infected, and also then to offer testing. That's how, for example, this (first) case in Michigan was identified was through this program.\"\n\nMichigan, he said, appears to have done a better job than many other states. It has created a daily text-message surveillance system, available in English and in Spanish, that asks workers to detail whether they have symptoms. Anyone who answers yes is then offered testing by local public health workers.\n\nTesting is encouraged, but not required, and the federal government now is reimbursing farms for some of the losses they have incurred from H5N1 outbreaks and testing.\n\n\"This is an ongoing, evolving situation and it's important to pay attention to that,\" Lauring said. \"Fortunately, the risk to the general population is low, but we need to pay attention and reach out to farms and people working with the farms and work together to control the outbreak.\"\n\n'We're flying blind'\n\nKatelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and consultant for several health organizations including the CDC, wrote on a post on her substack, \"Your Local Epidemiologist,\" that the H5N1 situation in the U.S. is far from controlled.\n\n\"We are flying blind,\" she said. \"We don’t know how this virus is spreading, where it is spreading, and if it’s becoming better at infecting humans.\"\n\nLack of trust in public health in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, farmworkers' fears of deportation and language barriers, along with farmers' concerns about the financial impact the H5N1 outbreaks all are affecting surveillance efforts.\n\n\"It shouldn’t be shocking that few are volunteering to test for H5N1,\" she wrote.\n\nAnimal testing for avian influenza viruses in Michigan is done through MSU's Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. Positive results are sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for confirmatory testing, Boring said.\n\nIf an animal's test result is positive, \"we work closely with local and state health officials to make sure that local health is on farms, working with farmworkers, apprising them of everything they need to know about what this virus means and maintaining and tracking some human safety aspects there,\" he said.\n\nThat includes ensuring personal protective gear – such as face shields or goggles, respirator masks, rubber coveralls and boots – are available to workers on farms with infected animals. Although wearing PPE is recommended, it isn't mandatory.\n\n\"We're doing everything we can to assist those human health partners to be getting equipment out to not only just farms, but within those CDC guidelines around processing plants as well.\n\n\"We've had a few farms take us up on that, but the base PPE that makes so much of a difference in these cases – eye protection, gloves – that is equipment a lot of farms have on hand already.\"\n\nNeither of the Michigan farmworkers who were infected by cows wore fully protective equipment, said Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive, in a statement issued Thursday. One was splashed in the eye with milk from an infected cow and the other had \"direct exposure to an infected cow.\"\n\n\"This tells us that direct exposure to infected livestock poses a risk to humans, and that PPE is an important tool in preventing spread among individuals who work on dairy and poultry farms,\" she said.\n\nFor protection, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service recommends that anyone who is within 6 feet of an infected cow should wear:\n\nSafety goggles or a face shield\n\nDisposable gloves\n\nBoots or boot covers\n\nA respirator, such as an N95 mask\n\nFluid-resistant coveralls\n\nHead covering\n\nMany questions about avian influenza remain unanswered\n\nThere remain many questions with wide implications, Monto said, when it comes to how this virus is behaving.\n\nAmong them, he said: For how long is a cow infectious? Will infections be sustained on farms or will they be able to be rid of the virus over time? Why are lactating cows so susceptible and why are virus particles so concentrated in their milk?\n\n\"What is going on in the mixed dairy-beef cattle farms? A cow is a cow,\" said Monto.\n\nHe noted that in one out of 109 samples of beef tested in late May by the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, H5N1 viral particles were detected in muscle tissue. In ground beef that was inoculated with high levels of virus, cooking it to at least 145 degrees (medium) or 160 degrees (well done) killed the H5N1 virus.\n\n\"Even cooking burgers to 120 (rare) degrees, which is well below the recommended temperature, substantially inactivated the virus,\" the USDA reported.\n\nAnd though similar testing of commercial milk found H5N1 viral fragments, those particles were inactivated by pasteurization and were unable to cause infection. Raw milk from infected cows, however, has been shown to be a risk for infection.\n\n\"We do know that raw milk is full of the virus,\" Monto said. \"We know that we shouldn't be drinking unpasteurized milk and some people are (obsessed with) drinking unpasteurized milk.\"\n\nMonto said scientists still don't know whether the milk of other animals – or humans – is infectious when they contract avian influenza.\n\n\"This virus is now spreading wherever they shipped dairy cows. It's come all the way from Texas to Michigan. And it's come to a variety of other states,\" Monto said.\n\n\"We need to control the infection in cattle, and that will lower the probability of humans becoming infected.\"\n\nContact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

Alabama saw 109,000 of its 361,226 confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases reported in December. The surge came after the Thanksgiving holiday, and health officials said they are concerned caseloads will continue to grow in January from the fallout of Christmas and New Year’s gatherings. “We are being overwhelmed right now,” State Health Officer Scott Harris said. “I believe, unfortunately, we are going to see even worse numbers than we have now, and the ones we have now are pretty bad.” The cumulative number of confirmed and probable cases was 251,787 on Nov. 30 and rose to 361,226 cases Dec. 31. While there were some backlogged cases recorded in December, almost all of the reported cases were from December.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Health officials said the state plans on receiving almost 53,000 doses of coronavirus vaccines this month from drug companies Pfizer and Moderna. That figure is about 7,000 fewer vaccines than the state received in December. Thus far, only front-line health care workers in hospitals, residents and employees at long-term care facilities, emergency personnel, community health aides and people conducting vaccinations have been eligible to be inoculated in Alaska. Starting Monday, another tier of people will begin receiving vaccines. That group includes people working in health care who are at the highest risk of contracting the virus, are considered essential to the health care system, and do regular work that can’t be done remotely or postponed. Almost 50 Alaska residents spoke at a public hearing last Monday to advocate for their demographic to be included in the next vaccination group. That group included teachers, older adults and seafood industry workers, the Daily News reports. Alaska has so far vaccinated over 13,000 people, according to a state tracker last updated last Monday.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Despite a surge of coronavirus cases, Gov. Doug Ducey on Saturday rejected the state’s top education official’s call for him to order public schools to use only distance learning for the next two weeks unless they have waivers from health officials. “Given the severity of our state’s situation and the virus’s trajectory after the holiday period,” schools need a “two-week quarantine period” for education leaders and local officials to use local health data “to decide the appropriate instruction model for their communities,” Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman said in a Twitter thread. Hoffman called for the two-week “quarantine period” for schools after the Department of Health Services on Saturday – the second day of the new year – reported nearly 8,900 additional known COVID-19 cases, giving the state a two-day pandemic high for new cases. However, Ducey spokesman C.J. Karamargin said the governor “will not be considering this request or issuing this kind of mandate. This is a local decision. The online option is already available, and the governor has repeatedly made his preference clear: Kids have already lost out on a lot of learning, and he wants schools opened, safely.” Many schools are set to resume classes this week after the winter holidays.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Coronavirus hospitalizations in Arkansas have again set a new record high, as the pandemic strains medical resources across the state. There were 1,216 people in Arkansas hospitals with confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, state health officials reported, an increase of 31 from the day before. Arkansas has repeatedly broken previous records for hospitalizations and case counts over the past week, as the virus surges following holiday gatherings and travel. The Arkansas Department of Health also reported 1,597 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, 403 more probable cases and another 18 deaths. Those case counts are down from Friday’s record high, but Gov. Asa Hutchinson warned that the numbers were deflated by a drop in testing on New Year’s Day. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven’t been tested, and some who get sick don’t show symptoms.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Hospitals struggling to provide enough oxygen for the sickest coronavirus patients in the Los Angeles area began to receive help Saturday when U.S. Army Corps of Engineers crews arrived to update their oxygen delivery systems. The collaboration comes as the six aging hospitals struggle to maintain oxygen pressure while treating an unprecedented number of patients with respiratory issues. Some COVID-19 patients can require 10 times as much oxygen as a normal patient. California started the new year Friday by reporting a record 585 coronavirus deaths in a single day. The state Department of Public Health on Saturday reported another 386 deaths and more than than 53,341 new confirmed COVID-19 cases. More than 20,000 people were hospitalized as of Saturday with COVID-19; 4,500 of them were in intensive care, according to state records. The southern half of the state has seen the worst effects, from the agricultural San Joaquin Valley to the Mexico border. Hospitals are swamped, and intensive care units don’t have any more beds for COVID-19 patients. Makeshift wards are being set up in tents, arenas, classrooms and conference rooms.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A day after Gov. Jared Polis announced that restrictions for places like restaurants and gyms will be eased in much of the state starting this week, some local public health officials said they were concerned about the move. The governor cited improving statewide COVID-19 metrics in lifting certain restrictions in 33 counties, including Denver and the entire Front Range, but his announcement Wednesday came as not all of those counties meet the individual requirements to downgrade restrictions, the Denver Post reports. “It appears that if there’s enough pressure from the business and economic forces in the state that we will change the dial to meet those demands, and that’s kind of frustrating,” said Mark Johnson, executive director of Jefferson County Public Health. The announcement came a day after Colorado said it had confirmed the United States’ first case of a new and apparently more contagious variant of the coronavirus. “We don’t believe that it in any way reflects the spread of the disease or how dangerous the disease is or our concern about what is going to happen with Christmas, New Year’s or the new variant that is more infectious,” Johnson said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Some of the city’s public school students will return to their physical classrooms later this month for the first time since last spring, according to the superintendent of schools. Superintendent Iline Tracey announced on the district website Thursday that officials are preparing for “a limited return of students to a hybrid learning model” starting Jan. 19. The New Haven district has been closed for in-person instruction except for some special-needs programs since the coronavirus pandemic forced schools across the country to shut down last March. Officials in New Haven chose to keep school buildings shuttered in September as other districts in Connecticut offered either full-time or part-time in-person learning. A plan to reopen New Haven’s schools on Nov. 9 was shelved amid rising COVID-19 cases. Tracey said schools will open Jan. 19 to students in prekindergarten through fifth grade as well as students in special-education programs and programs for new immigrants at two of the district’s schools. Two schools, Quinnipiac School and West Rock School, will remain closed because city health officials determined that a lack of ventilation renders them unsafe during the pandemic, Tracey said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After health workers, long-term care staff and long-term care residents are inoculated, the next people to get the COVID-19 vaccine in the state will be front-line essential workers and residents 65 and older. Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Delaware Division of Public Health, announced the state’s decision during Gov. John Carney’s weekly coronavirus press briefing Tuesday. Front-line essential workers include first responders such as firefighters and police, as well as teachers, U.S. Postal Service workers and grocery store workers. The group also includes corrections officers, food and agricultural workers, day care workers and public transit workers. But these people likely won’t start getting the vaccine until mid- to late January due to the limited supply of the vaccine. “Please be patient with us. There’s just not enough vaccine for everyone right now,” Rattay said, adding that employers need to start planning how they will administer their vaccine to workers. People who work in Delaware but live in a neighboring state will likely be eligible for the vaccine in Delaware because they will likely get it through their employer.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Curators Sam Vong and Shannon Perich at the National Museum of American History are collecting written submissions from people across the country describing how they experienced 2020, WUSA-TV reports. “As historians, what we really want to do is document what’s going on before it kind of escapes from us,” Vong said. The Smithsonian museum has put out an open invitation to submit, with the hope that Americans’ recollections will preserve for the future the experiences of a year that really was like no other. “All of these stories will help people drill down or will open up new avenues of exploration and research,” Perich said. The submissions can be mundane. “What did it mean to sit in your home by yourself?” asked Perich. “The only way we’re ever going to know the answer to that question is if people tell us.” Or they can be extraordinary, like one of Vong’s favorites so far from a former Bhutanese refugee who resurrected a grassroots media outlet to share information during the pandemic. The submission period opened in December and runs through March.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Health officials reported a two-day total of 30,767 new cases of the coronavirus in the state and 217 new deaths Saturday. Florida’s Department of Health did not release numbers on New Year’s Day. The state has also chosen not to report COVID-19 cases on two other holidays, Thanksgiving and Christmas. The two-day total brings the overall number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Florida to 1,354,833. The agency posted that 21,015 cases were reported Friday and 9,752 reported Saturday. The state’s death toll throughout the coronavirus pandemic stands at 22,074. On New Year’s Eve, the state reported the highest daily jump in COVID-19 cases ever detected in Florida, with 17,192 new cases. Also on Thursday, state health officials disclosed in a statement tweeted on the department’s HealthyFla site that evidence of a new and apparently more contagious coronavirus strain first seen in England has been detected in a Martin County man with no recent travel history. Martin County is north of Palm Beach County, which along with Miami-Dade and Broward counties have comprised the state’s hardest-hit region in dealing with coronavirus cases.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: As vaccines are being administered to health care workers and long-term care facility residents and staff, law enforcement and first responder agencies are in line to get them soon. Gov. Brian Kemp and Georgia Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey announced Wednesday that adults 65 and older, law enforcement officers, firefighters and first responders were being added to Phase 1A – the highest-priority group eligible to receive vaccinations. Some Augusta-area firefighters and deputies have already started getting vaccinated. The Richmond County Sheriff’s Office said some deputies were inoculated last week, and it is in the process of compiling a list of deputies interested in getting the vaccine. Dr. Stephen Goggans, the director of the East Central Health District, said the timeline for first responders and those 65 or older to get vaccinated was moved up because some parts of the state have already completed or are close to completing vaccinations for health care workers and long-term care facilities.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Residents have been warned to be extra vigilant and continue to follow safety guidelines as cases of a new, seemingly more contagious strain of the coronavirus have recently been reported in the U.S., health officials said. The Hawaii Department of Health, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said there have been increased efforts to find the new variant and to understand how it is transmissible, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. It has not been detected in Hawaii. Confirmed cases of the new coronavirus strains have been found in the United Kingdom and South Africa and in the U.S. in Colorado, California and Florida. “All we know is that we have not yet found it,” State Laboratories Division Dr. Edward Desmond said. “We’re going to cast a wide net to see if we can quickly find it when it is here, and then we can make decisions about whether that should impact our community mitigation measures.” The vaccines being distributed are thought to be effective against the new strain. Health officials have said about 25,000 COVID-19 vaccines have been administered statewide. Local pharmacies received a surprise shipment of 3,800 doses last week, boosting the total delivered in December to 65,250.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little plans to propose tax cuts and investments in transportation, education and water projects to lawmakers this month following another monthly revenue report that exceeded projections despite rising coronavirus infections and deaths. The Republican governor in a statement last month spent little time trumpeting the budget numbers and his fiscal conservatism as he has in the past during live news conferences. The latest numbers show a projected budget surplus of $630 million after November tax revenue came in $45 million higher than expected. For 2020, state revenues were ahead of projections by nearly $170 million, or 10.6%. Little warned that tax cuts and investments are threatened by the pandemic that could overwhelm hospitals with COVID-19 patients. Among those getting sick with the virus are health care workers, he said. “Health and the economy are intertwined,” Little said. “Idahoans must choose to do a better job of wearing masks and avoiding gatherings with people outside their households if we are going to continue this trend.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state’s public health department reported 29 COVID-19-related deaths Saturday, the smallest one-day total in Illinois since mid-November. Not only was the total, included in a news release from the Illinois Department of Public Health, lower than any single day since Nov. 13, but it is also just about a quarter of the 111 daily deaths the state has been averaging over the past two weeks. The latest numbers bring the number of COVID-19-related deaths in Illinois since the pandemic began to 16,674 and the number of cases to 975,352. The health department also reported that there were 4,762 new confirmed and probable cases, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 975,352. But the release included a potentially worrisome statistic as well. The cases that were detected among 61,987 tests submitted on New Year’s Day helped raise the statewide average positivity rate over the past week to 8.3% from 6.8% a week ago, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions have become more prevalent among Hoosiers since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the state’s top health officials said in calling for renewed attention on mental health resources. Many of those reporting mental health woes are affected by COVID-19 itself, Jennifer Sullivan, secretary of the state’s Family and Social Services Administration, said during Gov. Eric Holcomb’s weekly briefing Wednesday on the state’s coronavirus response. That includes dealing with loss and fear, disruption to daily life with recurrent needs for quarantine and isolation, changes to school and work schedules, unexpected illness of friends and family, and disruption to normal social supports. Cold weather and the holiday season, too, have likely added difficulties for people with existing mental illnesses and those experiencing acute stress, she said. As a way to help, Sullivan encouraged Hoosiers to use the state-run BeWellIndiana.org to take a mental health self-assessment. Since April, more than 25,000 Hoosiers have completed those assessments. For more than three-quarters of those taking the surveys, there was confirmation of a mental health diagnosis, Sullivan said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A federal judge has rejected an argument by Tyson Foods that is is not liable in the death of a worker because it was following federal guidance when it kept meatpacking plants open during the coronavirus pandemic. Tyson was sued in August by the family of Isidro Fernandez, who worked at the company’s plant in Waterloo, after he died April 26 from complications of COVID-19. More than 1,000 Tyson workers tested positive for the virus in May, and at least six died. The families of Fernandez and at least three other employees who died claim in lawsuits that the company was negligent in how it reacted to the pandemic. Tyson fired seven managers in December after an investigation found that supervisors held a betting pool on how many employees would test positive for the coronavirus. The Fernandez case was filed in state court but was moved at Tyson’s request to federal court after the company claimed it was following the direction of federal officials, including President Donald Trump, when it remained open in April. But last Monday, U.S. District Judge Linda Reade rejected the argument.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state will rely on genetic tests to identify cases of a new and apparently more contagious coronavirus strain that was first seen in England, the director of the state Department of Health and Environment said last week. No cases of the new strain have been detected in Kansas. Cases have been confirmed in Colorado, Florida and California. Dr. Lee Norman said Kansas already does genetic testing with about 1% of COVID-19 patients and plans to increase its lab capacity so it can do more tests. Norman told reporters during a Statehouse news conference that Kansas already has seen other variations of the virus that causes COVID-19, including a “Utah strain” and a “Wisconsin strain.” “Viruses always change, kind of over time, with minor genetic variations. Mostly, they don’t make much difference,” Norman said. “They’re more alike than different, quite honestly.” The state on Friday reported another 138 deaths from COVID-19 since Wednesday, for a total of 2,879 since the pandemic began. Kansas has confirmed 227,745 COVID-19 cases, an increase of 5,312 since Wednesday, the health department said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: New coronavirus cases leaped in the state in the week ending Saturday, rising 22.7% as 18,408 cases were reported. The previous week had 14,999 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19. Kentucky ranked No. 24 among the states where the coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. Testing has changed around the holidays, making comparisons difficult. Labs and testing sites closed. People traveled or prepared for the holidays instead of getting tested. The worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in Boyle, Lawrence and Clinton counties. Adding the most new cases overall were Jefferson County, with 2,743 cases; Fayette County, with 1,170 cases; and Kenton County, with 702. Weekly case counts rose in 79 counties from the previous week. The worst increases from the prior week’s pace were in Oldham, Hardin and Jefferson counties. The share of Kentucky test results that came back positive was 18.9% in the latest week, compared with 13.6% in the week before, a USA TODAY Network analysis of COVID Tracking Project data shows.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: With the announcement that the state soon will allow people ages 70 and older to get the coronavirus vaccine, residents clamoring for the immunizations have hurried to pharmacies trying to receive a shot, even though those vaccinations don’t begin until Monday and require a scheduled appointment. The Louisiana Department of Health said Friday that it has received multiple reports of people who meet the new, expanded criteria showing up at pharmacies, overwhelming their phone lines and even calling some hospitals trying to get vaccinated days before doses are available. Health department spokeswoman Aly Neel stressed that only a limited supply of 10,000 Moderna vaccine doses will be available this week for those newly eligible, that only certain pharmacies will be administering those doses, and that appointments are required to receive the shot, or the person will be turned away. Still, news of wider availability was drawing intense interest, which Neel described as a promising sign. With thousands of first doses of the two-dose vaccines administered to the first-prioritized groups, Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Thursday that he is expanding the list to include anyone 70 and older, people with kidney failure and additional health care workers.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Protesters gathered outside the Maine Statehouse on Saturday to criticize how Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has handled the coronavirus pandemic. WABI-TV reports the protest organized by the Swinging Gate Organization attracted a large crowd despite snowy weather. “There’s this undercurrent of pent-up energy that’s not doing well under this governor’s rule, and it’s important to harness that organic energy that’s out here that needs something to do; their hands are tied,” said event organizer Dick Campbell. More than 25,000 people have tested positive for the virus in Maine, including nearly 350 new confirmed cases announced Sunday. One additional death was announced, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 359. Just under 33,000 people in the state have been vaccinated against the virus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Maine increased over the past two weeks, going from 445 on Dec. 19 to 528 on Saturday.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The Maryland Department of Health is working with regional and federal partners to test patient samples for infection with the new variant of the coronavirus. The Baltimore Sun reports the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are collaborating with the state’s public health lab, as well as state laboratories in California and Delaware, to test for the apparently more contagious variant. There have been at least two cases of the COVID-19 variant identified in the U.S., one in California and another in Colorado. A Maryland health department spokesman said the variant has not been detected in Maryland. The CDC has said medical professionals do not now believe that the new variant is more deadly than existing ones or that it will not respond to vaccines. But it could much more contagious and make the pandemic even harder to contain.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker signed a wide-ranging health care bill Friday that he said will codify in law many of the emergency changes made to the state system in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Republican said the new law extends requirements for all insurance carriers in Massachusetts to cover COVID-19 testing and treatment. It also increases insurance coverage for telehealth services, which have become vital during the pandemic. Baker’s office said the law also expands the scope of practice for nurse practitioners, other specialized nurses and optometrists; takes steps to protect consumers from surprise medical bills; and calls for a study on the effects of COVID-19 on the health care system, among other steps. Meanwhile, a COVID-19 field hospital that was supposed to open at UMass Lowell last week instead will open Monday after staffing shortages delayed the “soft launch.” While the site has capacity for 77 beds, the facility has so far only recruited enough nurses to staff one 14-bed pod. Lowell General Hospital currently has 63 COVID-19 patients at its main campus.\n\nMichigan\n\nCalumet: A judge has ordered the shutdown of a cafe in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula where customers have been supporting an owner who has defiantly served indoor diners despite coronavirus restrictions. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration got a restraining order against Cafe Rosetta in Calumet, a small town in Houghton County. Since November, bars and restaurants in Michigan have been limited to carryout service or outdoor dining in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Kristi Painter, a state food scientist, visited the cafe for an undercover exam and observed a busy place with 17 people eating or drinking. She ordered a cup of bean soup and a half turkey sandwich. “I did not observe any signs encouraging mask use. … I observed a tip-jar like container that was labeled ‘Legal Fund-join our fight to stand up for your rights,’ ” Painter said in a court filing. Cafe co-owner Amy Heikkinen, a mother of six, said she can’t afford to limit her business to carryout orders. She said sales are up because of her dispute with authorities. “It’s my right to earn an income to protect and feed my family,” she said. “That’s the right of every American. You can’t make me not work.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state on Saturday reported 54 deaths from COVID-19, along with 2,543 positive coronavirus tests, in its final reporting period of 2020. The new numbers bring the state’s pandemic death toll to 5,377 people. A total of 417,832 cases of the coronavirus were detected since the pandemic began. The Department of Health has reported a slowdown in new cases, with the average number of daily new cases decreasing by 48% over the past two weeks. In that period, the state reported one of the nation’s lowest rates of new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. Gov. Tim Walz has kept a ban on indoor dining in place through the holiday period, but some businesses defied that order for New Year’s celebrations. The attorney general has sued one such bar, Alibi Drinkery in Lakeville, for repeated violations of the order. Despite a court injunction ordering it to close, people packed into the bar for a New Year’s party, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: A hospital is offering $5,000 bonuses for qualified nurses as it works to recruit staff during a pandemic and at a time when health care workers are in short supply. WCBI reports Baptist Memorial Hospital - Golden Triangle is offering a number of incentives including the bonus as it works to recruit amid a nationwide nursing shortage. Johnny Judson is responsible for recruiting nurses for the hospital. “I am literally in every school, nursing school, in the area, including along the Alabama border,” he told the station. “I go up to north Mississippi, south Mississippi, and I go to these nursing schools, and I talk to these students.” He said the country’s nursing shortage has been going on for years, and the coronavirus pandemic has made things worse. The bonus is for registered nurses with at least two years of experience. Judson stressed that there are no shortcuts when it comes to hiring new staff. “We put incentives in place to attract more people, but we don’t lower the standards,” he said.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The chairman of the Missouri Veterans Commission resigned after releasing an investigative report that criticized the commission for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 140 lives at seven veteran nursing homes since September. Tim Noonan told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Thursday that he was resigning, citing comments Gov. Mike Parson made last week about the veterans and the commission. A summary of the investigation was released earlier in December, but Noonan, who was commission chairman since 2017, had resisted an open records request from the Post-Dispatch to release the full report. Officials inside Parson’s administration and state Sen. Jill Schupp, a Democrat from Creve Coeur, had urged Noonan to release the full report, and he did so after Attorney General Eric Schmitt directed him to, Noonan said. That came after Parson on Wednesday expressed frustration with the commission, which is an independent body. “I’m not going to worry about everybody’s personal lives that sit on the commission, or the chairman,” Parson said. “I’m just going to absolutely worry about the veterans, and that’s my whole focus.” Noonan said he resigned because of those comments.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Montana PBS has announced plans to renew a broadcast created at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in March to support schoolchildren who were learning remotely or in temporary quarantine. The new schedule for the Learn at Home broadcast was set to launch Monday and continue through the end of the school year June 4, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. The shows run each weekday from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and cover multiple subjects from language arts, social studies, science and math for elementary and middle school students. “We know that not all households in the state have the same access to devices and a strong internet connection but that most homes have a TV that receives our broadcast signal,” Montana PBS Director of Education Nikki Vradenburg said. Chief Operator Paul Heitt-Rennie estimated most households have tuned into the Learn at Home program. He said Nielsen data through the summer showed it was watched by up to 150,000 households, or up to 45% of households in the state. “Every educator we talked to asked us to keep it going,” Vradenburg said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Restaurants that were allowed to start selling carryout cocktails amid the pandemic want to continue doing so even after the public health crisis wanes. The Omaha World-Herald reports the Nebraska Restaurant Association plans to push for the expansion during the upcoming 2021 legislative session. The waiver extends until the end of the pandemic emergency. “This is a way for our restaurants to survive and come out the other side of this pandemic,” said Zoe Olson, the executive director of the restaurant group. Olson said the association’s proposal would include a requirement for some sort of seal on carryout beverages that, if broken, would indicate someone had opened their takeout drink in transit. The proposal would also end to-go drinks at some point, so legislators could review the policy and decide whether it should be extended. But the idea is getting some pushback from groups that oppose binge drinking and drunken driving. “When you increase the availability and the ease of access to alcohol, that’s when you get increased harms,” said Chris Wagner, executive director of Project Extra Mile, an Omaha-based group that seeks to prevent or reduce problems associated with alcohol.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Community advocates and health officials are working to engage with the state’s diverse communities and reach out in Spanish and other languages as Nevada lays plans for mass coronavirus vaccinations. Erika Marquez, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas public health professor and vice chair of the Nevada Minority Health & Equity Coalition, said merely translating information about the vaccine into other languages is not enough. “We had to engage these communities in the conversation, and that takes some time,” Marquez told the Las Vegas Sun. Nevada is a diverse state with a 29% Latino population that includes native Spanish speakers. Nevada also has a fast-growing group of Asian American and Pacific Islanders, of which 70% speak a language other than English at home, according to data shared by Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote. Marquez’s coalition has been working throughout the pandemic to share information encouraging physical distancing, hand hygiene and masks with diverse communities and is preparing vaccine education materials in English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese and Thai.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state has set a goal of administering 100 shots per hour at each of the 13 state-run COVID-19 vaccination sites when it moves to Phase 2. Perry Plummer, the former assistant commissioner of safety, is overseeing vaccine distribution. He told WMUR-TV the goal is realistic, but it will take time to get the effort up to speed. “We expect this to be a little bit of a windy road and to make sure we’re ready to take turns wherever we need to, to make sure we can get people vaccinated in the State of New Hampshire as quickly as possible,” Plummer said. The first phase of distribution has focused on health care workers, nursing home residents and staff, and first responders. The second phase includes teachers, critical workers in high-risk settings, homeless shelter residents and others. As of Friday, more than 21,000 vaccines had been administered.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: More than 70% of the state’s supply of COVID-19 vaccine had not been used as of Thursday, echoing a national trend of slow distribution, according to data released by state officials. Of the 265,000 doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that have been delivered to New Jersey, 72,657 residents had been given a shot by Thursday afternoon. Despite months of planning, state officials said Wednesday that a lack of personnel, along with logistics and timing issues, was to blame. “Remember, you need health care workers to do this,” Gov. Phil Murphy said at a briefing. “I’m not qualified to deliver these vaccines.” The slow rollout has been frustrating to a public eager to end a pandemic that has infected at least 477,000 New Jerseyans, killed more than 19,000 and caused vast economic hardship. State Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said the rollout of the Moderna vaccine in particular has been slow because it was delivered just before Christmas. Persichilli said 57% of the state’s stockpile of Pfizer doses had been administered as of Wednesday, calling it “one of the highest percentages that I’ve seen nationally.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: More than 6,500 businesses and nonprofits will receive up to $50,000 under a state program created to help companies cope with economic fallout from the pandemic. That’s about half of the companies that applied, the Albuquerque Journal reports. “The number (of applications) that we couldn’t fund was very hard for us,” said Marquita Russel, CEO of the New Mexico Finance Authority, the state agency that administered the program. The state implemented the program to help businesses as part of a bigger $320 million coronavirus relief package passed by New Mexico lawmakers. The program uses $100 million in federal coronavirus relief funds allocated to the state. About $40 million of that sum was allocated for businesses located outside the state’s four largest cities. Russel said while her agency had expected to receive roughly 10,000 applications, it received more than 14,000. In all, 6,530 applications were funded. Russel said the agency prioritized businesses that experienced the most significant losses as a result of the pandemic.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The New York City Sheriff’s Department shut down a series of illegal New Year’s Eve parties for violating coronavirus restrictions, operating without a liquor license and other infractions, authorities announced Friday. More than 300 people gathered Thursday night for karaoke and dancing at an illegal bottle club on 58th Street in Queens, the department said on Twitter. Five people were charged with offenses including violating emergency orders that ban indoor gatherings, providing alcohol without a liquor license and obstructed egress. Deputies also raided an illegal gathering on Prince Street in Soho, where more than 145 people were partying in a space with no liquor license, the department said. Four people were charged with multiple offenses. The patrons were not wearing masks in the venue’s overcrowded sixth floor. Deputy sheriffs also found nearly 80 people dancing and smoking hookah at Stars Hall in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn. The organizer of the event was ticketed for violating an executive order.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: COVID-19 hospitalizations and test positivity rates both are reaching record highs in the state. The News & Observer of Raleigh reports there were a record-high 3,576 people hospitalized with COVID-19 over the weekend, according to data reported by 95% of the state’s hospitals. Two weeks ago, there were 2,783 people hospitalized with the virus. That’s a difference of 793 people. On Friday, the last day for which data is available, the state’s health department says 13.6% of COVID-19 tests came back positive. That brought the seven-day average of daily testing results to 14.2%, the highest rate since at least April. The average is seen as giving a better indication of COVID-19 spread because it better accounts for daily spikes and valleys. Every day since Christmas has seen a double-digit positivity rate, including Thursday’s record-high 15.5%.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFort Yates: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is prioritizing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to those who speak Dakota and Lakota languages. Standing Rock Tribal Chairman Mike Faith told KXMB-TV the policy is aimed at keeping customs alive. “It’s something we have to pass on to our loved ones – our history, our culture, our language. We don’t have it in black and white; we tell stories. That’s why it’s so important,” Faith said. The Standing Rock reservation straddles the North Dakota and South Dakota border and is home to about 8,000 people, more than half of whom live in North Dakota. Faith said only about 300 people on the reservation are fluent in the language. Front-line health care workers already have begun receiving the vaccine at the Fort Yates hospital, but starting this week, priority will be for those who speak their native language. In addition to those who can carry on the culture, the next phase includes elders, law enforcement, tribal courts and the school system, tribal officials said. Tribal Health Director Margaret Gates said the Lakota and Dakota speakers “are the most important asset to our tribe and people because of the language.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: As Gov. Mike DeWine applies pressure to get COVID-19 vaccines administered faster throughout the state, those charged with inoculating people against the virus say a combination of factors has contributed to a slow rollout. Vaccines arrived during the holidays, when more workers were off and less likely to be available to get the vaccine. In some cases, “vaccine hesitancy” has contributed to lower demand as well, they say. Shipments also have been unpredictable, sometimes arriving later than expected or in smaller quantities than previous allotments, making it difficult to plan for distribution. Protocols require a 15-minute observation window for each patient, limiting the number of people who can cycle through a chair each day. “This is not your routine stop by the primary care office to get a flu shot. This is a whole different operation,” said Dr. Andy Thomas, chief clinical officer at Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center. On Wednesday, DeWine said he had grown “impatient” with the rollout and challenged hospitals to administer the vaccine within 24 hours of receiving it, calling it a “moral imperative” to get the vaccine out as quickly as possible.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state has reported more than 1,000 new COVID-19 cases, as hospitalizations from the disease caused by the novel coronavirus remained near their all-time high. Oklahoma recorded 1,083 new confirmed cases of the virus Friday and another 38 fatalities, state health officials said Saturday. The Oklahoma State Department of Health has delayed reporting case counts over the holiday weekend. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven’t been tested, and some who get sick don’t show symptoms. There were 1,910 people hospitalized with the virus in Oklahoma on New Year’s Day, according to the department. The state’s record was set last Monday, when there were 1,927 people with the virus in Oklahoma hospitals. Over the past week, more than 18% of coronavirus tests in Oklahoma have come back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A health care worker was hospitalized after having a severe allergic reaction to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Oregon Health Authority. The worker, an employee at Wallowa Memorial Hospital, experienced anaphylaxis after receiving a first dose of the vaccine last week, officials said late Thursday. The health authority said vaccines for COVID-19 can cause mild to moderate side effects in some people, including pain and swelling on the arm and sometimes fever, chills, tiredness and headache. “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that in rare cases, some people have experienced severe allergic reactions after getting a COVID-19 vaccine,” health officials said in a press release. “An allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen, or if they must go to the hospital.” Health officials will continue to track adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Scores of costumed performers took to the streets of their south Philadelphia stomping grounds for a New Year’s celebration of Mummers tradition, far from the customary parade route and despite official cancellation of the annual event and a ban on large gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. Participants in brightly colored costumes, some with faces painted, paraded down 2nd Street in South Philadelphia on Friday following trucks that blared string band or popular music. Some wore masks, but many did not. Mayor Jim Kenney announced in July that the city would not grant permits to planned outdoor events with more than 50 people, effectively canceling the large annual parade and other events as officials struggled to keep a lid on the spread of the virus. Some Mummers leaders and organizations also asked members to stay home. City spokeswoman Lauren Cox said there were no major issues Friday but said seeing pictures of many participants without masks was “very concerning given the seriousness of this current wave of the pandemic.” She urged voluntary quarantines and testing for anyone who had been in large crowds.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The first person to get vaccinated against the coronavirus in the state got his second shot Saturday. Dr. Christian Arbelaez, an emergency room physician at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, received his second dose without the fanfare that surrounded him nearly three weeks prior, the Providence Journal reports. The moment came as his workplace continues to treat a post-Thanksgiving wave of patients and is bracing for another wave after Christmas and New Year’s Day. “It’s this perfect storm – can we take care of everyone?” Arbelaez said. “Do we have capacity? Do we have front-line workers well enough? Those are all the things that worry me.” More than 20,500 people have received their first shots in Rhode Island, according to state health officials.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Nearly 700 nonprofits are receiving state grants totaling $25 million to help offset costs during the coronavirus pandemic. The state Department of Administration announced Wednesday that 686 nonprofits would receive grants ranging from $2,500 to $50,000. Among the groups that got the money are arts organizations, churches and food banks. The grants can be used to cover expenses such as staffing and operating costs as well as personal protective equipment and revenue loss. The state had to turn down another several million dollars’ worth of requests, as a total of 1,590 nonprofits applied for $76 million in aid. The volume of requests led to a two-week delay in notifying winners. That delay had put more stress on businesses already strained by the pandemic, Frank Knapp, president of the state’s Small Business Chamber of Commerce, told The Post and Courier. The monies were allocated by the Legislature in September to spend federal COVID-19 aid for South Carolina. The state is also issuing $40 million to small businesses affected by the pandemic.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A federal judge says a state court can’t use the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to delay a Codington County trial. U.S. District Judge Charles B. Kornmann also criticized South Dakota’s response to the pandemic, saying it has done “little, if anything,” to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Kornmann ordered that unless the Codington County state court resolves Matthew Kurtenbach’s May 2019 case by Jan. 15, Kurtenbach will win a federal petition he filed claiming wrongful imprisonment and a violation of his right to a speedy trial. “South Dakota cannot ‘take advantage’ of its own failures to follow scientific facts and safeguards in entering blanket denials of the rights of speedy trials,” the judge wrote. Kurtenbach petitioned the court at least 25 times for a right to a speedy trial. At one point, Kornmann directly criticized Gov. Kristi Noem’s actions during the pandemic. “The Governor has steadfastly refused to impose a statewide mask mandate. She has often questioned publicly the scientific fact that mask wearing prevents the virus from spreading,” the judge wrote.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Shelby County Health Department will begin vaccinating workers and residents at congregate care facilities, including nursing homes and assisted living facilities, this week, the department said Saturday. The health department started vaccinating first responders with the Moderna vaccine Dec. 28 and is continuing to vaccinate law enforcement officers, firefighters and paramedics, said spokesperson Joan Carr. Doug McGowen, chief operating officer for the City of Memphis, said there are 50,000 health care workers and 6,000 first responders in the Shelby County community, and “it’s going to take a while” to get all of those individuals vaccinated. Some people in priority group 1a2, which includes funeral home workers and people who are 75 or older, have also been vaccinated by the health department. As of Saturday afternoon, all the available weekend appointments for vaccinations at the department’s two drive-thru centers had been filled. The health department has also started vaccinating staff at mass COVID-19 testing sites.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Coronavirus hospitalizations fell slightly Saturday but remained near their record high, as health officials said there were about 600 intensive care beds available across the state of nearly 29 million people. Texas reported 12,319 COVID-19 patients in hospitals Saturday, ending five consecutive days of record-breaking hospitalizations. But even with the decrease of more than 160 patients from Friday, the virus continued to strain medical resources. Intensive care units in several parts of Texas were full or nearly full, with 626 ICU beds available statewide Saturday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The department reported 96 new fatalities, as well as 3,995 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 487 probable cases. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven’t been tested, and some who get sick don’t show symptoms. Over the prior seven days, nearly 1 in 5 coronavirus tests in Texas came back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Less than a quarter of the 127,375 doses of COVID-19 vaccine reportedly received in the state have been used to vaccinate health care providers and long-term care facility residents and staff as of the end of the year, Deseret News reports. “The initial rollout of the vaccine has been slow, slower than anticipated, slower than we wanted,” said Rich Lakin, immunization program director with the Utah Department of Health. “We hope to be at a much faster pace in the next 15 days.” Utah is already starting to speed up the process, health department spokesperson Tom Hudachko said Thursday. More than 6,000 doses were reportedly administered in the state Thursday, double the daily increases earlier in the week. What’s making the difference, Hudachko said, is that local health departments, including tribal clinics, and long-term care facilities are able to give doses much faster than hospitals. In Davis County, a mass drive-thru clinic at the Legacy Events Center is able to vaccinate 28 health care workers at a time with appointments, he said. At long-term care facilities, CVS and Walgreens and other contractors are quickly inoculating both residents and staff.\n\nVermont\n\nStamford: The town has voted to overturn in its community Gov. Phil Scott’s emergency orders issued with the intention of protecting the state during the COVID-19 pandemic. The select board of the town of about 800 people along the Massachusetts border voted 3-2 Tuesday to “terminate” the governor’s restrictions. The three board members in favor of the idea cite a section of Vermont law that they believe allows them to reject the governor’s order. Select board member Daniel Potvin said during the meeting that quarantine requirements, restrictions on large family or public gatherings, and face mask requirements “violate the constitution” in part because they were imposed without normal due process of law. He asserted it was important to stand up against such measures because it could lead to more loss of personal freedoms later on. Scott hasn’t enforced the orders heavy-handedly, he said, “but that could change.” Potvin said Friday the town is expecting some type of legal action from the state of Vermont, but “until it’s cleared up, the governor’s orders are still in effect.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State Sen. Ben Chafin has died after contracting the coronavirus, Senate Republicans said Friday. Chafin represented southwest Virginia and was from Russell County. A Republican, he was first elected to the House of Delegates in 2013 and then moved to the state Senate in 2014. He was 60. Lawmakers from around the state mourned Chafin’s death late Friday. “I knew Ben as a lawmaker, an attorney, a banker, and a farmer raising beef cattle in Moccasin Valley, working the land just as generations of his family had done before him,” Gov. Ralph Northam said. “He loved the outdoors, and he loved serving people even more.” Senate Republicans said in a statement: “He served to ensure that his region and community, and the people he loved, would never be forgotten.” Chafin is the first Virginia lawmaker to die from the virus.\n\nWashington\n\nVancouver: Quartz Mountain Distillers was surprised last week by a $14,060 fine from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for producing hand sanitizer, but the company found out the next evening that the fee is not being enforced. Owner Randy Kyle said the distillery began making hand sanitizer in April. The family owners gave almost all of it away to help local health care workers remain safe, the Columbian reports. All distillers that made hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic were facing the fine. The Department of Health & Human Services on Thursday announced it was directing the FDA not to enforce the fine after the FDA received heavy backlash on social media. “Small businesses who stepped up to fight COVID-19 should be applauded by their government not taxed for doing so,” the Department of Health & Human Services said on Twitter. Kyle said he was unaware of any fine from the beginning of the pandemic. If the company were forced to pay it, he would have to closed down. “I’d just have to lock the door and walk away,” he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state has reported a weekly record in the number of positive coronavirus cases entering the new year. West Virginia had at least 6,915 confirmed virus cases for the six-day period last week, excluding Sunday, according to health statistics. Officials have cautioned that figures could be skewed due to a lag in reporting cases over the Christmas holiday period. Sunday’s cases won’t be reported until Monday. Still, the state had its three highest daily figures last week since the start of the pandemic: at least 1,385 positive cases Tuesday, 1,618 Wednesday and 1,516 Thursday. Last week’s cases marked the ninth weekly record in the past 13 weeks. The previous record of 6,871 positive cases was set two weeks ago. There also were a record 810 people hospitalized for the virus Friday. As of Saturday there were a record 27,418 active cases of the virus statewide, up 57% in the past month.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGrafton: What was initially thought to be a major human error of someone damaging 57 vials of the coronavirus vaccine at the Aurora Medical Center Grafton has since grown into a federal investigation. A pharmacist at the facility intentionally removed 57 vials of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine from the refrigerator and left them out overnight knowing that the vaccines would be “useless” to those who received them. On Dec. 26, Aurora gave 57 people the vaccine from the tampered vials. After further review, the vials were discarded, and an investigation began. On Wednesday, Aurora notified Grafton police, and it became public that the vials were left out intentionally. The pharmacist was arrested Thursday. The FBI and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were also investigating, police said. Jeff Bahr, president of Aurora Health Care Medical Group, called the pharmacist a “bad actor.” According to Grafton police, the now-former pharmacist intentionally took the vials out of the refrigerator and left them out overnight knowing it would render the vaccines “useless” and make people who received them believe they were vaccinated when they were not.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Bars and restaurants across the state will be allowed to return to normal operating hours beginning next Saturday as COVID-19 hospitalizations decline in the state. Gov. Mark Gordon made the announcement last Saturday, praising businesses for adapting to health orders and thanking “the people of Wyoming who recognized the strain on their hospitals and health care workers and acted accordingly,” The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. “These have not been easy times for anyone,” he said. “We are not out of the woods yet, but continued personal safety measures while the vaccine is being distributed will enable our state’s schools and businesses to continue to remain open.” The updated health orders allow bars and restaurants to resume on-site consumption from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., and they allow gyms to increase the number of participants in group fitness classes from 10 to 25. Counties can still opt out of the requirements if local conditions move to safer levels in accordance with White House metrics.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/28/biolabs-pathogens-location-incidents/26587505/", "title": "Inside America's Secretive Biolabs | USA Today", "text": "Alison Young and Nick Penzenstadler, USA TODAY\n\nVials of bioterror bacteria have gone missing. Lab mice infected with deadly viruses have escaped, and wild rodents have been found making nests with research waste. Cattle infected in a university's vaccine experiments were repeatedly sent to slaughter and their meat sold for human consumption. Gear meant to protect lab workers from lethal viruses such as Ebola and bird flu has failed, repeatedly.\n\nA USA TODAY Network investigation reveals that hundreds of lab mistakes, safety violations and near-miss incidents have occurred in biological laboratories coast to coast in recent years, putting scientists, their colleagues and sometimes even the public at risk.\n\nOversight of biological research labs is fragmented, often secretive and largely self-policing, the investigation found. And even when research facilities commit the most egregious safety or security breaches — as more than 100 labs have — federal regulators keep their names secret.\n\nOf particular concern are mishaps occurring at institutions working with the world's most dangerous pathogens in biosafety level 3 and 4 labs — the two highest levels of containment that have proliferated since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001. Yet there is no publicly available list of these labs, and the scope of their research and safety records are largely unknown to most state health departments charged with responding to disease outbreaks. Even the federal government doesn't know where they all are, the Government Accountability Office has warned for years.\n\nA team of reporters who work for the USA TODAY Network of Gannett newspapers and TV stations identified more than 200 of these high-containment lab facilities in all 50 states and the District of Columbia operated by government agencies, universities and private companies. They're scattered across the country from the heart of New York City to a valley in Montana; from an area near Seattle's Space Needle to just a few blocks from Kansas City's Country Club Plaza restaurant and shopping district.\n\nHigh-profile lab accidents last year with anthrax, Ebola and bird flu at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the discovery of forgotten vials of deadly smallpox virus at the National Institutes of Health raised widespread concerns about lab safety and security nationwide and whether current oversight is adequate to protect workers and the public. Wednesday the Department of Defense disclosed one of its labs in Utah mistakenly sent samples of live anthrax -- instead of killed specimens – to labs across the USA plus a military base in South Korea where 22 people are now being treated with antibiotics because of their potential exposure to the bioterror pathogen. As many as 18 labs in nine states received the samples, the CDC said Thursday.\n\n\"What the CDC incidents showed us ... is that the very best labs are not perfectly safe,\" says Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard University professor of epidemiology. \"If it can happen there, it certainly can happen anywhere.\"\n\nSome people find little reassurance that nobody was sickened in the CDC accidents or in the historically low numbers of serious infections among lab workers generally, or that infections spreading into communities surrounding labs have been rarer still.\n\n\"Many of us think that's really a matter of good fortune,\" said Beth Willis, who chairs a citizen lab advisory panel in Frederick, Md., home to one of the nation's largest high-containment research campuses at the Army's Fort Detrick.\n\nThe country's best labs have robust safety programs, said Kenneth Berns, co-chair of a panel of outside lab safety advisers currently examining biosafety at CDC and other federal labs. Yet the systemic safety problems identified at the CDC's prestigious labs have raised questions about what's happening elsewhere. \"It's a matter of some concern,\" said Berns, a distinguished professor emeritus of molecular genetics and microbiology at the University of Florida.\n\nThe consequences could be devastating if accidents were to occur with lab-created strains of deadly influenza viruses that are purposely engineered to be easier to spread than what's found in nature, said David Relman, a microbiology professor at Stanford University who is a federal adviser on lab safety and a past president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\n\"You're talking about something that has the ability to take off, and we could not be confident of being able to contain it,\" he said.\n\nRelman said that not enough is known about the state of safety at labs that perform infectious disease research but emphasized that the kinds of labs drawing concern are the same ones the public needs to discover important new treatments and vaccines. \"We have to find some happy blend of minimized risk and enhanced benefit,\" he said.\n\nAt the high-containment labs identified by USA TODAY, experiments are underway involving drug-resistant tuberculosis, exotic strains of flu, the SARS and MERS viruses, plague, anthrax, botulism, ricin and the Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fever viruses, according to interviews and more than 20,000 pages of internal lab safety records and incident reports obtained from labs across the country.\n\nStudies are also being done on a wide range of bioterrorism pathogens that are less known to the public, such as the agents that cause exotic diseases like tularemia, Q fever and melioidosis. Still others are focused on pathogens that pose serious economic risks to agriculture, such as foot-and-mouth disease, brucellosis and \"mad cow\" disease.\n\nAt a few labs, experiments have been done with strains of flu and other viruses purposely made to be more dangerous in studies that seek to understand how they might mutate naturally. White House science advisers called for a temporary halt of that kind of \"gain of function\" research last fall while expert scientific panels spend the next year studying its risks and benefits.\n\nThe research at BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs — which use special equipment, negative air pressure and numerous safety and security procedures — seeks to better understand how organisms cause disease and ways to protect against them. It's the kind of work that the public doesn't give much thought to until people with Ebola arrive on planes in the United States from an outbreak in Africa, or the current avian flu outbreak forces farmers to kill millions of chickens raising the specter of higher egg prices.\n\nIt's impossible to obtain a full accounting of lab accidents or lab-acquired infections because there is no universal, mandatory requirement for reporting them and no system to analyze trends to assess emerging biosafety risks and disseminate lessons learned on a regular basis.\n\nThe Federal Select Agent Program, which inspects and regulates the subset of research labs that experiment with about four dozen types of pathogens deemed to pose bioterror threats, requires labs to report potential exposure or release incidents, as well as thefts or losses of specimens.\n\nFrom 2006 through 2013, labs notified federal regulators of about 1,500 incidents with select agent pathogens and, in more than 800 cases, workers received medical treatment or evaluation, limited public data in program annual reports show. Fifteen people contracted laboratory-acquired infections and there were three unintended infections of animals, according to the reports, which do not identify labs and mostly provide aggregated counts of incidents by type. Reported incidents involve events ranging from spills to failures of personal protective equipment or mechanical systems to needle sticks and animal bites.\n\nThe program, jointly run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, refuses to release copies of detailed incident reports, citing a 2002 bioterrorism law.\n\nIncident records the USA TODAY Network obtained directly from individual labs provide a window on the kinds of mistakes that happen. An animal caretaker in Georgia was potentially exposed to a bird flu virus that kills 60% of the people it infects when a defective respirator hose supplying purified air detached from its coupling in September. A researcher in Wisconsin was quarantined for seven days in 2013 after a needle stick with a version of the same H5N1 influenza virus. A lab worker in Colorado failed to ensure specimens of the deadly bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei had been killed before shipping them in May 2014 to a co-worker in a lower-level lab who handled them without critical protective gear. None of the workers was infected.\n\nThe public and the lab community tend to learn only about the rare instances of serious or fatal lab infections, which sometimes are published as case reports in scientific journals or make national news.\n\nIn 2009, Malcolm Casadaban, a University of Chicago scientist with an underlying medical condition, died from an infection with a weakened strain of plague bacteria. In 2012, 25-year-old researcher Richard Din died after being infected during vaccine research involving Neisseria meningitides bacteria at a lab inside San Francisco's VA medical center. Both of their deaths involved research in biosafety level 2 labs, where pathogens are considered to be less dangerous than those worked with in high-containment labs.\n\nDin, who became a researcher to cure diseases like the cancer that killed his mother, developed a fever and started feeling dizzy while out to dinner with friends. He had no idea how serious his symptoms were, his friends and family told USA TODAY. By morning, Din was covered in a splotchy rash and could barely talk, recalled Lawrence Tsai, who raced to Din's apartment to help.\n\nTsai carried his friend down two flights of stairs and drove him to the hospital. \"His body was very hard, very straight,\" Tsai said. \"Only his eyes were open. He could not say anything.\"\n\nA few hours later, Din was dead. And Tsai said he and his friends were told they, too, were at risk and needed to take antibiotics because of their close contact with him. The bacteria that killed Din can spread from person to person by direct contact with respiratory secretions. About two dozen emergency room workers also were treated with antibiotics as a precaution, according to a presentation about the case at a scientific conference. Nobody else was sickened.\n\nFederal workplace safety investigators, who investigated because the case involved a death, said Din died because the VA failed to adequately supervise and protect workers in the research lab. Among the \"serious\" issues they cited: Din and other workers in the lab were manipulating specimens of the dangerous bacteria out on tabletops — not inside protective biosafety cabinets that would have reduced potential exposures to droplets or splashes. The lab also failed to train workers about warning signs of infection, violation records show.\n\nAlthough lab-created outbreaks that spread to people or animals in the surrounding community are rare, they have happened.\n\n\"That's what you would worry about,\" said Gigi Kwik Gronvall, of the UPMC Center for Health Security, an independent think tank that studies biosecurity and epidemics. \"But even then the consequences up to now have been limited to the very close contacts of the person who was infected.\"\n\nA small, deadly outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in China in 2004 was traced to lab workers at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. In 2007, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease among cattle in England that required herds to be slaughtered was blamed on leaking drainage pipes at a nearby research complex.\n\nIn Louisiana, tests are underway to make sure a deadly bioterror bacterium hasn't colonized the soil and water around the Tulane National Primate Research Center near New Orleans. Late last year, the bacteria got out of one of the center's BSL-3 labs, likely hitching a ride on workers' clothing, sickening two monkeys that lived in outdoor cages and later infecting others. Tulane will spend the next five years testing its outdoor monkey colony as well as wildlife and feral cats around the 500-acre facility to ensure the bacteria haven't contaminated the environment. The CDC and Tulane say they think the bacteria spread only inside the center's buildings, and so far tests outdoors have not detected the bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, which can cause severe and difficult-to-treat illness in people and animals infected by coming into contact with contaminated soil or water.\n\nOn a global scale, a lab accident is considered by many scientists to be the likely explanation for how an H1N1 flu strain re-emerged in 1977 that was so genetically similar to one that had disappeared before 1957 it looked as if it had been \"preserved\" over the decades. The re-emergence \"was probably an accidental release from a laboratory source,\" according to a 2009 article in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nHowever, most pathogens studied in labs, unlike the flu, don't spread easily from person to person. Often, to become infected a person needs to have direct contact with a pathogen, which is why lab workers are most at risk, experts said. For example, people can become infected with anthrax by inhaling the bacterium's spores, but once sickened they are not contagious, according to the CDC.\n\n\"I don't think the public needs to be too concerned,\" said Marian Downing, president of the American Biological Safety Association. \"There are multiple levels of checks and balances in place.\"\n\nBeyond accidental lab-associated outbreaks, federal auditors consider the deliberate theft and misuse of a deadly pathogen to be one of the most significant risks of biolab research. That's what the FBI says happened in the 2001 anthrax letter attacks that killed five and sickened 17. Bruce Ivins, a biologist and anthrax researcher at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick, Md., was the perpetrator, the FBI concluded.\n\nThe GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, has issued repeated warnings since 2007 that the proliferation of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has increased the aggregate risk of accidental or intentional releases of viruses, bacteria or toxins.\n\nNo single agency tracks the overall number or location of these labs, the GAO has said. Little is known about high-containment labs working with dangerous pathogens such as tuberculosis, the MERS virus and others that aren't on the select agent list and tracked by the Federal Select Agent Program.\n\nNational standards for constructing and operating these kinds of labs are lacking, which means labs vary by local building requirements. While voluntary guidance exists for safe lab design and operations, the GAO has found it is not universally followed.\n\nThe documents obtained by USA TODAY show power failures at BSL-3 labs at Texas A&M University repeatedly resulted in the labs losing their negative air pressure during 2013, a key safety feature that is among several used to keep pathogens contained inside the lab. The CDC's labs in Atlanta also have had airflow problems over the years, the newspaper previously reported.\n\n\"The public is concerned about these laboratories because exposing workers and the public to dangerous pathogens, whether deliberate or accidental, can have disastrous consequences,\" the GAO's Nancy Kingsbury told Congress at a hearing on the CDC lab incidents last summer.\n\nLab regulators at the Federal Select Agent Program — whose departments often fund the research they oversee — would not grant interviews despite repeated requests since last year. The program oversees about 262 organizations that operate BSL-3 and eight organizations that operate BSL-4 labs.\n\nThe two federal agencies that jointly run the program — the CDC and USDA — operate their own labs, which have been involved in recent high-profile incidents.\n\n\"We believe the current system of inspecting/overseeing laboratories is adequate, but we are always open to continued improvements,\" the CDC said in an emailed statement. USDA officials also declined to be interviewed.\n\nLab safety officials at the National Institutes of Health, a major research funding agency that operates its own labs and helps set national biosafety guidelines, also declined interview requests.\n\n\"There is no 'zero-risk' proposition in the conduct of research,\" the agency said in a statement. \"NIH works extremely hard to minimize all research-related risks.\"\n\nMore than 100 labs experimenting with potential bioterror agents have been cited by regulators at the CDC and USDA for serious safety and security failings since 2003, USA TODAY has learned.\n\nYet so much of select agent oversight is cloaked in secrecy, making it difficult to assess regulators' effectiveness in ensuring safety. In several instances, troubled labs and even federal regulators appeared to misrepresent the significance of the government's enforcement efforts.\n\nSince 2003, the CDC has referred 79 labs for potential enforcement actions by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General. It has levied fines against 19 of them totaling more than $2.4 million, the CDC said in response to questions.\n\nSome are repeat offenders. Five labs have had \"multiple referrals\" for enforcement actions, the CDC said. Two labs have been kicked out of the program, and five labs have been suspended from doing any select agent research, the agency said.\n\nWhich labs repeatedly failed to address safety problems? The CDC won't name names — not even for the two labs kicked out of the select agent program. The CDC and its regulatory partners at the USDA say the 2002 bioterrorism law requires keeping this information secret.\n\nYet earlier this year, the CDC publicly announced its suspension of the Tulane National Primate Research Center — after the center's accidental release of a bioterror bacterium became publicly known and was the subject of news reports. The CDC said it balances the public's right to transparency with the risk posed by information being made available to those who might use it to threaten public health or security.\n\nCurrently seven labs are under the extra scrutiny of a federal select agent lab performance improvement program, the CDC said. The program is offered as a voluntary alternative to suspension or other regulatory action, the agency said, for labs with a \"repeated failure to correct past observation, biosafety and security concerns\" or failures to comply with extra security requirements for work with \"Tier 1\" select agents. Tier 1 agents are those deemed to pose the greatest risk of deliberate misuse with the most significant potential for mass casualties or devastating economic effects.\n\nWhile under scrutiny of the program, an individual researcher or project must halt the research that has been found in violation, but other select agent research at the institution generally is allowed to continue, the CDC said.\n\nThirty-three labs have been put on performance improvement programs since 2008, CDC said. Their names are secret too.\n\nDozens more labs have faced regulatory actions from the USDA, which takes the lead overseeing select agent labs primarily working with animal or agricultural pathogens. The USDA says it has conducted 48 investigations that have resulted in $116,750 in fines.\n\nThe USDA said all of its enforcement records about these fines are required to be kept secret because of the 2002 bioterrorism law. The USDA did release a spreadsheet it says documents its actions, but the agency redacted almost all the information on it: lab names, violation types and even dates. Only a few references to warning letters and fines were spared the agency's black marker.\n\nThe Federal Select Agent Program says no law or regulation bars the labs themselves from discussing their select agent research. And universities and other research institutions routinely publish their research on select agent pathogens in scientific journals.\n\nRegistered labs just aren't supposed to share details of specific security measures, such as locations of keys and codes, that would give access to pathogens. The CDC and USDA said there is nothing that prohibits labs from releasing information or answering questions about any regulatory problems they've had. Yet few were willing to readilydiscuss violations or failed inspections.\n\nLabs at the University of Hawaii-Manoa are among those in the federal performance improvement program, at least as of January, records obtained by USA TODAY show. Although the secrecy provisions of the 2002 bioterrorism law apply only to certain federal agencies, officials at the state-run university cited that law among its reasons for denying requests for records about safety violations and the performance improvement program.\n\nThe university inadvertently confirmed that its Honolulu labs had been put in the performance improvement program in records it filed in January with Hawaii's Office of Information Practices, which is deciding USA TODAY's public records appeal. The university wrote that being put on a PIP is something it is \"proud\" of.\n\n\"We do not believe entering into the program is an embarrassment, we think it should be showcased, but that would be improper because as participants in the Federal Select Agent Program, we are obligated to keep this information private,\" the university wrote to the appeals agency, adding that it \"has been an exemplary participant in the Federal Select Agent Program.\"\n\nUniversity of Hawaii officials declined to be interviewed.\n\nLast year, two labs agreed to pay fines handed down by the HHS Office of Inspector General for select agent violations, records show.\n\nA lab that federal officials would describe only as an \"Arizona research university\" agreed in 2014 to pay a $165,000 fine for failing to keep accurate inventory records for select agents and not having biosafety procedures adequate for the risks associated with the pathogens they worked with. The lab, the USA TODAY Network's reporting found, was Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. Lab director Paul Keim said the issues date back to 2010 when the university had difficulty keeping up with changing federal regulations. Since then the university's labs have passed several inspections, he said.\n\nAn unnamed Florida laboratory agreed to pay $50,000 to resolve violations that included failing to ensure accurate inventories of select agents and failing to notify the CDC and appropriate law enforcement agencies after discovering a missing select agent.\n\nThe inspector general's office, citing regulations stemming from the 2002 bioterrorism law, redacted the names of these labs, as well as all other labs receiving fines, in documents it provided to USA TODAY under the Freedom of Information Act. Other labs that have been fined over the years for select agent violations are located in Alabama, California, Missouri, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin, records show.\n\nAs a way of providing some oversight, Congress requires a report each year on the number of thefts, losses and releases of bioterror pathogens at labs regulated by the Federal Select Agent Program.\n\nYet regulators provide scant details of their activities and the problems identified at labs. Usually just three pages long plus a cover page, the reports contain only aggregated counts of lab incidents by type, plus vague information on a few serious incidents.\n\nThe select agent program told Congress it had \"imposed a $425,000 civil money penalty\" on an unnamed lab where a serious biosafety lapse in 2008 had resulted in a cow in a nearby disease-free herd becoming infected with Brucella bacteria, which cause brucellosis.\n\nBrucellosis is a contagious and economically significant agricultural disease — which causes cattle and other livestock to abort their fetuses, produce less milk, suffer weight loss, infertility and lameness. It has been the subject of eradication efforts for decades.\n\nThe $425,000 fine would have been one of the largest in the overall select agent program's history — if it had actually been imposed.\n\nBut it wasn't imposed, USA TODAY's investigation found, and the USDA never corrected the record with Congress.\n\nUSA TODAY was able to identify the Brucella research program at Louisiana State University's AgCenter in Baton Rouge as the likely recipient of the $425,000 fine by examining USDA animal health reports that tallied what states reported brucellosis cases in 2008. Louisiana, which had a case that year, had been declared brucellosis-free in 2000.\n\nLSU officials spent months denying USA TODAY access to its records about the incident, citing among other things select agent regulations unrelated to the requested information. In statements and interviews, LSU downplayed its violations and provided information that was later contradicted by federal records.\n\n\"The incident was not found to be caused by a violation of federal regulations; no fines were imposed upon LSU, and the regulatory agencies had uncertainty as to whether the strain of bacteria in the affected cow was the same strain that was being used in the LSU research,\" LSU officials said in a November 2014 email to USA TODAY.\n\nYet, in December 2014, when USA TODAY received copies of the incident investigation reports from the USDA and Louisiana's state agriculture department, the documents showed no uncertainty.\n\nUSDA records show that investigators documented serious violations. In levying the $425,000 fine, regulators cited LSU for failing to have adequate biosafety measures, resulting in the release of the bacteria that caused the cow's infection. The USDA also cited LSU for violating regulations by sending Brucella-infected cattle that had been part of select agent vaccine experiments to an unregistered slaughter facility where their meat was sold for human consumption.\n\nLSU's Phil Elzer, who at the time ran the Brucella studies and now is a university administrator, said in an interview the practice of sending research cattle to slaughter was declared in the lab's operating procedures that were reviewed and signed off on at each inspection by Federal Select Agent Program regulators. \"To all of a sudden say we were doing it wrong was very surprising,\" Elzer said. LSU appealed, and the USDA eventually dropped the fine, he said.\n\nIn January 2010, records show, the USDA sent a letter to LSU saying the case was being closed but reiterating the issues with the infected cow and the use of the unauthorized slaughter plant.\n\nUSDA officials acknowledge that they never imposed the $425,000 fine and made a mistake touting it in their report to Congress.\n\n\"It should have stated that we were proposing a fine, instead of stating we issued a fine,\" said Freeda Isaac, USDA's director of Agriculture Select Agent Services, in an emailed statement. Isaac added that the USDA suspended a portion of LSU's select agent registration because of the Brucella incident and \"that portion of the registration is still suspended,\" Isaac said last fall.\n\nFor those labs not in the select agent program — and even those that are — self-policing is the front line of biosafety. Biosafety committees at research institutions, often staffed by scientists' colleagues, assess the risks of proposed research and grant or deny approval for studies. Labs also have other safety staff who may do internal inspections and lab audits, plus additional committees overseeing the use of animals in research.\n\nYet some researchers appear ignorant of their institutions' biosafety rules. Others brazenly ignore repeated requests by biosafety staff to stop experiments and address issues.\n\nDocuments obtained by the USA TODAY Network include at least 50 incidents since 2012 in which researchers were conducting experiments with genetically manipulated organisms without proper approval from internal safety committees. In some cases, records show researchers flaunting their institutional rules.\n\n• At the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in, biosafety staff concluded in a 2013 report that the root causes of a researcher failing to get her experiments approved included \"general indifference of the investigator to institutional rules governing the need for biosafety compliance\" as well as a \"lack of oversight of research activities.\" The scientist, the investigation revealed, knowingly launched unapproved experiments — exposing mice to a genetically manipulated strain of Burkholderia thailandensis — in a quest to get a vaccine study manuscript published that reviewers said needed additional data. The research was halted after veterinarians found several cages containing dead and dying mice, yet none of the cages was labeled with the infectious agent and they were in an area not approved for experiments with a BSL-2 pathogen. The incident was \"an extremely unusual event,\" said Sheila Champlin, an assistant vice chancellor at the center, noting corrective actions were taken before the scientist was allowed to resume research.\n\n• At the University of Iowa, a biosafety officer in February 2014 discovered that a scientist had been conducting experiments with a genetically manipulated strain of the MERS virus since September 2013 without biosafety committee approval. The biosafety officer ordered the investigator to stop all experiments, and the scientist was put on probation and received increased safety monitoring. The work was being done in a BSL-3 lab at the time it was discovered, but started in a BSL-2 lab, the safety officer's investigation found. The university concluded that the scientist did not \"effectively communicate\" to his staff the importance of getting safety committee approval before starting the experiments with the virus, which can cause a deadly, contagious respiratory disease in people.\n\n• At the University of California-Irvine, a researcher ignored repeated notices from biosafety staff during 2012 and 2013 that a research project's approval had expired, that it needed further revisions and that all work must cease — yet the scientist continued the experiments with a lentivirus, anyway, in the BSL-2 lab. As a result of the incident, the university now sends researchers four notices starting 90 days before approvals expire, said James Hicks, the university's associate vice chancellor of research. As the deadline nears, Hicks is copied on the notices so he can intervene if necessary. \"We take a very strong view and a very correct view of the importance of following the regulations and the guidelines,\" he said in an interview.\n\n• At the University of Nebraska, a biosafety officer in 2013 found that a researcher had continued growing plants as part of an experiment using a transgenic tobacco rattle virus vector — despite being told repeatedly over two months that additional approval was needed from the biosafety committee before research could begin. As a result of the incident, the university said it revised its biosafety guidelines to describe consequences of unapproved research and sent a letter to faculty. \"This was an isolated instance that was fully and successfully resolved,\" the university said.\n\n• At the University of Hawaii-Manoa, biosafety staff discovered a scientist was doing a type of cancer research in 2012 despite being denied biosafety committee approval and being repeatedly told not to do the experiments. Separately, at a March 2013 biosafety committee meeting at the university, members discussed the need for penalties when researchers fail to comply with biosafety rules, stating \"there must be some consequence and corrective action other than an email\" to the scientist, the minutes say.\n\nLabs that receive funding from the National Institutes of Health and some other federal agencies are required to report incidents to the NIH involving certain types of genetically engineered organisms and recombinant DNA technology. From 2010 through 2014, the NIH received 644 reports of lab incidents during this kind of research.\n\nMost of the reports the NIH receives are for what it says are non-serious incidents, such as small spills, splashes, cuts and equipment failures. Failure to obtain required biosafety committee approvals to do this type of research are among the more common types of non-compliance.\n\nAlthough it is not a regulatory agency, the NIH said in a statement that agency staff have made site visits to 100 institutions in recent years in an effort to help improve biosafety committee resources and adherence to the NIH Guidelines for operating their labs.\n\n\"Most instances of non-compliance result from a lack of full understanding of the requirements of the NIH Guidelines, rather than willful disregard, and our emphasis has been on corrective actions through education, which institutions seem uniformly responsive to,\" the NIH said.\n\nIn September 2014, the NIH contacted the University of Louisville after a whistle-blower alleged the university had knowingly failed to report lab incidents as required, according to records obtained under the federal Freedom of Information Act. In response, the university told the NIH that it discovered three incidents that were not reported to the NIH but should have been, the records show.\n\nThe records indicate that University of Louisville biosafety officials were aware of some of the unreported incidents as much as six months before the NIH opened its inquiry. William Pierce Jr., the university's executive vice president for research and innovation, in a statement to USA TODAY, said \"there was apparent confusion regarding the authority and responsibility for reporting violations to the NIH.\" Pierce said the university has hired an outside firm to oversee its biosafety committee and created training courses for scientists. \"We feel confident the current system is working,\" he said.\n\nThe NIH closed its inquiry after the university answered the agency's questions, filed reports on the previously unreported incidents and agreed to take actions to ensure better reporting in the future.\n\n\"In investigating the incident, we did not find any evidence of willful non-compliance,\" the NIH said in response to USA TODAY's questions.\n\nFor some residents living near labs, the lack of transparency is frustrating — and worrisome. It's not enough to tell the public the labs have robust safety procedures. \"What people are really interested in is how well it's working,\" said Beth Willis, the citizen lab safety representative near Fort Detrick. \"The more people in the community feel that there's secrecy, the more they're distrustful, whether their distrust is warranted or not.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/09/08/respiratory-virus-midwest-children/15269751/", "title": "10 states report outbreak of respiratory illness in kids", "text": "Jessica Durando\n\nUSA TODAY Network\n\nOfficials in 10 states are reporting cases of respiratory illness, some severe enough to send children to hospitals.\n\nIn Kansas City, Mo., more than 300 cases of respiratory illnesses were reported last month, according to the state Department of Health and Senior Services. About 15% of the illnesses resulted in children being placed in an intensive care unit, according to a health alert issued Aug. 29.\n\nTen states have contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for help in investigating enterovirus — Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Kentucky, according to WXIA-TV.\n\nEnteroviruses, with symptoms similar to an intense cold, hits its peak in September, according to medical officials.\n\nBut it is unusual that there have been so many hospitalizations, CNN reports.\n\nThe number of hospitalizations reported could be \"just the tip of the iceberg in terms of severe cases,\" Mark Pallansch, director of the CDC's Division of Viral Diseases, told CNN.\n\nPallansch said the division is looking into the situation.\n\nCincinnati medical officials admitted a record number of children to a local hospital over the weekend. Although there's been no confirmed cases of the enterovirus at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, officials admitted 540 patients Friday, said Dr. Derek Wheeler, associate chief of staff at the hospital.\n\nThe previous record was around 515, Wheeler said.\n\n\"We're just seeing the (increased) volumes, we haven't seen (patients) sicker than usual yet,\" he said.\n\nWhile hospitals from other states have placed restrictions on visitations, Wheeler said there are no plans to do that in Cincinnati.\n\nThe virus is similar to what doctors treat during cold and flu season. That means nothing really changes if a child comes down with the rare virus, he said.\n\n\"The bottom line is this is a virus you wouldn't treat with antibiotics, so other than the (high-level of) interest, there's no reason we would need to know it's an enterovirus,\" Wheeler said.\n\nIn Kentucky, Kraig Humbaugh, deputy commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Public Health, said the CDC recently confirmed that five of 10 cases it tested from Kentucky were enterovirus D68.\n\n\"We're seeing more than the usual number of cases,\" Humbaugh said, adding it has ranged from mild cold-like symptoms to hospitalizations.\n\nAt Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville, about 100 children in August tested positive for one of two viruses that include an enterovirus, but officials can't be certain how many if any might be D68.\n\n\"We have seen an increase in kids admitted to the ICU with respiratory illness,\" said Kris Bryant, an epidemiologist at Kosair and a pediatric infectious disease specialist with University of Louisville Physicians.\n\nWXIA-TV News medical correspondent Dr. Sujatha Reddy said children with asthma or allergies are the ones who are suffering the severest side effects of the virus.\n\n\"If you see your kid's condition changing — they're going just from having the sniffles to a fever to now, perhaps, difficulty breathing, or they just look like they don't feel good — you want to take them to the doctor or to the emergency room to make sure,\" Reddy said. \"Because these kids that have asthma (or allergies) and get this enterovirus can get very ill.\"\n\nThis particular type of enterovirus — EV-D68 — is uncommon, but not new. It was first identified in the 1960s.\n\nAn analysis by the CDC showed at least 19 of the Kansas City children tested positive for EV-D68, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.\n\nA vaccine for EV-D68 isn't available.\n\n\"Many infections will be mild and self-limited, requiring only symptomatic treatment,\" the analysis said. \"Some people with several respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 may need to be hospitalized and receive intensive supportive therapy.\"\n\n\"The virus just runs its course. The illness goes away by itself,\" Reddy said. \"But for kids who may have asthma or may have bad allergies, or have some other underlying medical problem, they're the ones that, potentially, could get more sick.\"\n\nAt Children's Hospital in Denver, 447 kids with respiratory complaints came to the emergency department Sept. 4-7. Of those, 39 were admitted to the hospital for treatment, said Chris Nyquist.\n\n\"Young children are having a tougher time,\" said Nyquist, a pediatric infectious disease specialist. \"It is a huge upswing in the numbers we're seeing.\"\n\nNyquist said parents are alarmed because in some cases kids without any previous asthma symptoms start wheezing after coming down with what appears to be a common cold. She said a small number of kids have required intensive care and breathing assistance from ventilators, but there have been no reported deaths.\n\nNyquist said the hospital initially ran low on supplies to treat the asthma complications but has caught up now. The illness is driving a 12-15% increase in overall ER visits compared to this time last year.\n\nShe said kids with uncontrolled asthma are at greatest risk for serious illness. Those with no history of breathing problems will recover quickly, Nyquist said.\n\n\"Most of the children really do just fine,\" she said. \"That's the scary part — the unpredictability of it.\"\n\nRocky Mountain Hospital for Children in Denver had five children in intensive care and 20 more in the pediatric unit, KUSA-TV reported last week.\n\n\"This is the worst I've seen in my time here at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children,\" Raju Meyeppan told the station. \"We're going to have a pretty busy winter at this institution and throughout the hospitals of Denver.\"\n\nWill Cornejo, 13, was among the children in intensive care at Rocky Mountain after he came down with a cold and then woke up Tuesday night with an asthma attack that couldn't be controlled with his medicine albuterol. His mother, Jennifer, called 911 when her son's breathing became shallow, and her son was airlifted to the Denver hospital, she told KUSA.\n\nIn Cincinnati, Wheeler said parents can prevent their children from getting the virus by making them wash their hands frequently and drink plenty of fluids.\n\nIf they do suspect their child contracted the virus, he suggested parents call their pediatrician first because urgent care facilities will be busy.\n\nDoctors recommend disinfecting school supplies, pens, pencils — even a child's cellphone.\n\nAnd parents should keep sick children home from school.\n\nContributing: Michael Martinez, John Newsome, Elizabeth Cohen, Kyle Dyerm, Trevor Hughes and Keith BieryGolick.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/health/monkeypox-questions-update/index.html", "title": "What is monkeypox, and how can you stay safe while it spreads ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Biden administration has declared the monkeypox outbreak in the US to be a public health emergency.\n\n“We’re prepared to take our response to the next level in addressing this virus, and we urge every American to take this virus seriously and to take responsibility to help us tackle this virus,” US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said.\n\nMonkeypox is a poxvirus, related to smallpox and cowpox. It generally causes pimple- or blister-like lesions and flu-like symptoms such as fever, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe lesions typically concentrate on the arms and legs, but in this outbreak, they’re showing up more frequently on the genital and perianal area.\n\n“Classically, it presents like many other viral illnesses with what’s called a viral prodrome, and symptoms like fevers, chills, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue and muscle aches are common. Within five days of the prodrome starting, patients develop a rash that can look like pimples or blisters,” said Dr. Jason Zucker, an infectious diseases specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center.\n\nHow is monkeypox spread?\n\nMonkeypox spreads through close contact, according to the CDC. That includes direct physical contact with lesions as well as “respiratory secretions” shared through face-to-face interaction and touching objects that have been contaminated by monkeypox lesions or fluids. The virus may also pass to a fetus through the placenta.\n\nMany of the cases in the outbreak appear to be connected to sexual contact, often during sex. The CDC says research is ongoing on whether monkeypox can spread through semen or vaginal fluids, or whether the virus can spread asymptomatically.\n\nWho is at risk of monkeypox?\n\nAnyone who has had contact with someone with a monkeypox-like rash, or who has had contact with someone who has a probable or confirmed case of monkeypox, is at high risk for infection.\n\nHowever, a large number of cases in this outbreak have been in men who have sex with men, including gay and bisexual men, and public health officials are focusing their prevention efforts in this group. The virus is not unique to this community, but the nature of its close-contact spread has led to a disproportionate impact.\n\n“The vast majority of those who have been diagnosed to date with human monkeypox virus are self-identifying men who have sex with men,” Zucker said.\n\n“This is likely due to shared sexual networks. So what we’re seeing is, they’re seeing it first and experiencing the majority of cases. Just like other diseases, there’s no reason it can’t spread to other communities via sexual or other close contact,” he said.\n\nAccording to the CDC, those at higher risk during this outbreak include people who “had skin-to-skin contact with someone in a social network experiencing monkeypox activity,” including men who have sex with men who meet partners online, through an app or at a social event.\n\nPeople with conditions involving a weakened immune system like HIV and eczema, and children under 8 may also be at higher risk of severe illness if infected, according to the CDC.\n\nWhat should I do if I have monkeypox symptoms?\n\nIf you notice a new rash or other monkeypox symptoms, avoid any close contact with other people until you have seen a doctor and gotten tested.\n\n“When you see a healthcare provider, wear a mask, and remind them that the virus is circulating in the area,” the CDC says.\n\nIf you’re diagnosed with monkeypox, the agency recommends isolation at home and away from family members until the rash or lesions are gone.\n\nWhat’s the treatment for monkeypox?\n\nAccording to the CDC, there is no approved treatment specific for monkeypox. But because it’s genetically similar to smallpox, doctors can use similar treatments, such as antiviral medications.\n\nThe CDC is making doses of tecovirimat, an antiviral medication also known as Tpoxx, available for monkeypox patients at risk of severe disease. This may include those whose infection has advanced into the severe stage and people with weakened immune systems. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has also announced a study of Tpoxx as a monkeypox treatment.\n\nTreatment for monkeypox should also include efforts to manage symptoms and complications, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIs there a monkeypox vaccine?\n\nTwo vaccines are available in the US to prevent monkeypox, but not everyone is eligible to get one.\n\nThe US has “ample supply” of the smallpox vaccine ACAM2000, which can also be used to prevent monkeypox. However, it shouldn’t be used in people with certain health conditions, according to the CDC.\n\n“We have 100 million doses of ACAM2000,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said in late June, but its side effects mean that it “in my mind as a public health person, would not be worth giving it widely throughout the general population.”\n\nAnother vaccine, Jynneos, is specifically intended for monkeypox, but it’s in short supply. Federal stock is being distributed to municipalities based on the number of cases and the population at risk in a given area.\n\nAccording to the US Department of Health and Human Services, more than 600,000 doses of Jynneos have been distributed from the Strategic National Stockpile and another 150,000 doses are expected to arrive in September. The CDC has estimated at least 1.5 million people in the US are eligible for monkeypox vaccination.\n\nThe federal government has proposed changing how vaccines are physically given, which may mean the current supply could stretch further.\n\nJynneos is a two-dose vaccine, with a four-week gap between doses. But in light of the shortages, some experts have called for a single-dose regimen until supply improves.\n\nMonkeypox vaccination can be used as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and outbreak response PEP (PEP++), according to the CDC.\n\nPrEP refers to vaccinations given to members of high-risk communities, such as lab or health care workers, before they may come into contact with the virus.\n\nPEP means vaccinating people after a known exposure to prevent disease or help ease symptoms. For prevention, the CDC recommends that the vaccine be given up to four days after exposure. PEP given four to 14 days after exposure may result in milder disease.\n\nPEP++ is the CDC approach for people with unconfirmed exposure to the virus but with risk factors that may make them more likely to get it.\n\n“When coupled with self-isolation and other prevention measures when symptoms first occur, PEP++ may help slow the spread of the disease in areas with large numbers of monkeypox cases,” the CDC says.\n\nCan I get a vaccine?\n\nMonkeypox vaccine demand is high, but supply shortages and eligibility restrictions mean it can be difficult to find at this point.\n\nEligibility for the vaccines remains somewhat strict.\n\nPeople who are known, confirmed contacts of people with monkeypox are eligible to be vaccinated. Also eligible are presumed contacts who had a sex partner in the past 14 days diagnosed with monkeypox, those who had multiple sex partners in the past 14 days in an area where monkeypox is spreading, and those whose jobs may expose them to monkeypox, according to the CDC.\n\nIf you think you meet one of these criteria and want to find out about your eligibility, contact your doctor or your local health department.\n\nHow do I keep myself safe?\n\nThe CDC recommends avoiding close contact or shared objects with someone with monkeypox. Frequent hand-washing is also recommended.\n\nFor social gatherings including parties, raves, clubs and festivals, the CDC says to stick to events with more clothing, where skin-to-skin contact may be less frequent.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAvoid sex or close physical intimacy if any person involved has monkeypox. The CDC recommends specifically to avoid touching any rash that may be on a partner’s body. To help prevent the spread of monkeypox while sexually active, maintaining 6 feet of distance, keeping clothes on during sex, and using condoms and/or gloves can lower chances of exposure.\n\n“However, condoms alone may not prevent all exposures to monkeypox, since the rash can occur on other parts of the body,” the CDC says.", "authors": ["Virginia Langmaid"], "publish_date": "2022/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/31/fallout-from-meningitis-crisis-continues/2038899/", "title": "Fallout from fungal meningitis crisis continues", "text": "Ann Zaniewski, Detroit Free Press\n\nNationwide%2C 730 have become ill%3B 51 have died\n\nMany patients have been hospitalized for weeks\n\nSome fear they may never fully recover\n\nDETROIT -- The pounding headaches started a few days before Mark Klaserner boarded a plane last fall for Colorado and worsened after he landed.\n\n\"They got so strong I decided my glasses needed to be replaced.

Fifty-one have died.\n\n\"We've never had anything like this,\" said Dr. David Vandenberg, medical director of clinical outcomes management at St. Joseph Mercy Ann Arbor, the hospital that became the epicenter for treating outbreak victims in Michigan. \"The thing it's most comparable to would be a slow train wreck, where there's 200 victims, but they come in over a period of a few months rather than on the same day.\"\n\nWeeks-long hospital stays are not uncommon. Mattila has been hospitalized since early October.\n\nHealth officials have since traced the contamination to unsanitary conditions at\n\nthe Framingham, Mass.-based New England Compounding Center (NECC), where inspectors found dirty equipment, a leaky boiler and microbial growth in vials of the steroids. Investigations related to the outbreak are ongoing.\n\n\"What makes this tragedy worse is that it seems like these deaths and illnesses could have been prevented,\" Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said at a Capitol Hill hearing last fall.\n\nThe rate of illness has slowed considerably. But people are still getting sick, developing potentially life-threatening fungal infections. People are still dying.\n\nContinuing fear and anger among patients is magnified by uncertainty. Many patients don't know how long they'll need to take powerful anti-fungal drugs -- or if they'll ever fully recover.\n\nCommon procedure\n\nPlagued by aching back pain for most of his adult life, Klaserner chose epidural steroid injections for relief as he waited for his insurance company to approve needed back surgery. He got a shot before taking an important trip.\n\n\"I wasn't going to miss my first grandson's birth in Denver,\" he said.\n\nEpidural steroid injections are a common procedure. Every year in the U.S., more than 500,000 epidural steroid shots are administered just among people who are on Medicare.\n\nBut in Tennessee, one man in his 50s who had gotten an injection was very, very sick. Weeks after receiving an epidural steroid injection, he visited Vanderbilt University Medical Center with a headache, neck pain and chills. He was admitted to the hospital but his condition improved with antibiotics, so he was sent home.\n\nA week later, he was back. His back pain had gotten worse. A scan showed he had an epidural abscess, a pocket of infection near his spine.\n\nDr. April Pettit at Vanderbilt University ordered additional tests of fluid drawn during a spinal tap and made a shocking discovery -- the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. She also learned from the man's family that he had received epidural steroid injections prior to falling ill. On Sept. 18, she sent an email about the case to officials at the Tennessee Department of Health.\n\n\"This is something that's really unusual. Alarm bells were ringing,\" said Dr. Marion Kainer, an infectious diseases physician at the Tennessee Department of Health, recalling her reaction to the email.\n\nKainer launched what would eventually become a nationwide investigation.\n\nWithin a few days, she learned that two other people in Tennessee had developed meningitis after receiving steroid injections at the same clinic as the first man, the St. Thomas Hospital Outpatient Neurosurgical Center in Nashville. The injections had all come from the New England Compounding Center. Another patient had an unusual posterior circulation stroke.\n\nKainer contacted the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No other cases of fungal meningitis had been reported.\n\nA health department official visited the clinic Sept. 21 and found no water leaks or other possible explanation for the fungal contamination.\n\nAfter suffering seizures, strokes and bleeding on his brain, the man who sparked the investigation was taken off life support and died. He would become the first documented case of illness stemming from contaminated lots of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate linked to the NECC.\n\nBy Sept. 25, Kainer had identified seven other people in Tennessee who had gotten sick after receiving injections. In a conference call that day with health officials from Tennessee, Massachusetts and the CDC, the compounding pharmacy said no adverse events had been reported with the steroid.\n\nThen, the NECC issued a voluntary recall of three lots of the steroid. A national alert was issued asking health officials to report meningitis cases in patients who had received steroid injections. North Carolina reported a case the next day, Sept. 27, confirming for the first time that the problem was bigger than Tennessee.\n\nOn Sept. 28, the Michigan Department of Community Health was notified by the CDC about a potential multistate outbreak of meningitis linked to epidural steroid injections, said Jay Fiedler, the section manager of Surveillance and Infectious Disease Epidemiology for the MDCH. He said the alert asked the state to report any such cases back to the CDC, but didn't provide specific information about how or where patients were exposed.\n\nFiedler said state health officials learned Oct. 2 the names of the four clinics in Michigan that received the tainted steroids. Staff at the clinics and state officials spent the next few days frantically trying to reach patients who had received injections.\n\nFor many, it was too late.\n\nGroundzero\n\nStill believing his headaches were due to outdated prescription eyeglasses, Klaserner was watching TV in Colorado a few days after his grandson was born. He saw a news program about the fungal meningitis outbreak. Almost simultaneously, his doctor called.\n\nKlaserner cut his trip short and flew home to Michigan on Oct. 10. He went to St. Joseph Mercy Ann Arbor, where a spinal tap confirmed he had fungal meningitis.\n\n\"They admitted me right then,\" he said.\n\nThe first local cases linked to the outbreak had begun trickling into St. Joseph Mercy in September, according to doctors there. A handful of people who had headaches, fevers and other symptoms of meningitis, which is an inflammation of the membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, underwent spinal taps. The tests showed an elevated number of white blood cells in the spinal fluid but no sign of the bacteria that would indicate the more common bacterial meningitis.\n\nSome patients were treated with antibiotics and sent home. More people were getting sick.\n\n\"We knew that something unusual was happening,\" said Varsha Moudgal, an infectious diseases physician at the hospital.\n\nIn early October, around the same time the CDC issued its first public nationwide alert about the outbreak, doctors at St. Joseph Mercy connected their cases to the tainted steroids that NECC had shipped to 23 states.\n\nThe tainted injections have led to not only meningitis and spinal and paraspinal infections, but also joint infections and strokes.\n\nSt. Joseph Mercy became a sort of ground zero, treating more people connected to the outbreak than any other facility in the country. At one point in November, so many people were hospitalized at one time with confirmed fungal illnesses -- about 80 -- that the hospital had to send some patients elsewhere.\n\nSt. Joseph's parent company, Trinity Health, brought in 28 nurses from other facilities. The hospital opened beds that had been offline. Doctors created a database containing names of more than 600 people who received bad shots at one nearby facility, Michigan Pain Specialists in Brighton. They also established a fungal outbreak clinic to monitor people after they were discharged from the hospital.\n\nChaplains organized a support group for anxiety-ridden patients and their families. It was the hospital's only support group to meet six days a week.\n\nA few weeks into the outbreak, doctors noticed an alarming number of epidural abscesses. They decided to suggest that every patient exposed to the bad steroids have an MRI to screen for the infections. State health officials expedited approvals to expand operating room capacity and bring in a mobile MRI machine.\n\nOne reason St. Joseph treated so many cases was its proximity to Michigan Pain Specialists. There was an effort to centralize treatment in one place. Hospital officials say 643 people were injected with the fungus at the clinic -- which is not affiliated with the hospital -- between Aug. 9 and Oct. 2.\n\nPatients were also exposed at Southeast Michigan Surgical Hospital in Warren, the Michigan Neurosurgical Institute in Grand Blanc and the Neuromuscular and Rehabilitation Associates of Northern Michigan in Traverse City. In all, at least 1,791 people in the state received the toxic shots.\n\nFungal meningitis is rare and difficult to treat. Because the fungus grows slowly, some people didn't develop meningitis or other infections for weeks. Spinal taps didn't always show disease in people who were later found to be sick.\n\nThat was the case for George Cary of Howell. His wife, Lilian, 67, suffered a stroke and died Sept. 30 after receiving a tainted injection, although her death wouldn't be linked to the outbreak until a few days later.\n\nCary had also gotten a shot from the same clinic. In October, about two weeks after being told that a spinal tap showed he did not have meningitis, he developed severe headaches, neck pain and light sensitivity. A new test showed he had the disease.\n\nThe last case of meningitis in Michigan linked to the outbreak was reported Nov. 17. The last new case nationally was March 22, according to the CDC. Epidural abscesses and other infections in and around the spine continue to pop up.\n\n\"You're always wondering. It's always uncertainty -- is something going to surface?\" said Lydia Doyon, a 45-year-old mother of four from Oxford who received a tainted steroid injection.\n\nThe fungus most often found in patients, Exserohilum rostratum, is a common environmental mold. Before the outbreak, it was rarely known to cause illness in humans.\n\n\"Because this disease never existed before eight weeks ago, we really are using our best judgment and guess, but it is not certain,\" Vandenberg said in early December at St. Joseph Mercy. \"We're adjusting our approach to patients as we learn more and more.\"\n\nDr. Thomas Chiller, deputy chief of the mycotic diseases branch of the CDC, said he wouldn't be surprised to see new fungal illnesses develop up to a year from the last tainted shot.\n\n\"I think that will be the exception, not the rule. I think, thankfully, most of the cases have already occurred,\" he said.\n\nFeelingsof anger\n\nOn high doses of anti-fungal medicine, Klaserner had double vision and hallucinations, seeing his brother or a nurse in his hospital room when he was alone. Sometimes, silver, red, green and blue sparkles danced around people's faces.\n\nKlaserner said he was on a constant stream of IV fluids and gained 60 pounds of water weight. His swollen legs and abdomen ballooned to twice their normal size, making it impossible for him to tie his shoes.\n\n\"I feel like my skin is about to explode,\" he said last fall from his hospital room.\n\nKlaserner was hospitalized for fungal meningitis for seven days in October. He was re-admitted two weeks later after doctors discovered through an MRI that he had an epidural abscess. They cut a wedge out of one of his vertebrae to clean out the infection.\n\nKlaserner's second hospital stint lasted 38 days.\n\n\"The longer it goes, the madder I get,\" he said at the time. \"I could die. I could die tomorrow.\"\n\nMore than three months after leaving the hospital, Klaserner still takes antifungal medicine everyday. His back still aches.\n\nThe former tool-and-die maker tries to stay positive but worries about finances and finding a job. Feelings of anger bubble up.\n\n\"The one thing I do know for a fact that I am most resentful for is that I have aged at least close to 10 years,\" he said. \"At least 10 years of my life came off like that. I feel older. I'm slower. My reflexes are not as a good as they were.\"\n\nKlaserner recently got good news. After another MRI and spinal tap, doctors told him he may be able to get off the anti-fungal medicine in six months.\n\nBut a terrifying, nagging uncertainty hangs over his future.\n\n\"One or two times, I asked different doctors -- I said if I'm 67 years old and I'm on the golf course and start getting symptoms of headaches and nausea, I said what do I do? They said I need to go to the ER and tell them I had fungal meningitis.\"\n\n\"This will continue to impact me the rest of my life,\" he said. \"I have no doubt.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/08/19/polio-nyc-rockland-county-case-wont-spread-like-covid-experts-say/10345851002/", "title": "Polio NYC: Rockland County case won't spread like COVID, experts ...", "text": "In the early 1900s, up to 35,000 Americans a year were disabled by polio. The virus, which mainly spread during summer months, was finally tamed with a highly effective and widely embraced vaccine.\n\nFor decades, transmission had disappeared in the United States. Until now.\n\nNew York reported a confirmed case of paralytic polio in July, and wastewater surveillance showed the virus may have been circulating in neighboring counties since April.\n\nHealth experts are calling it a “wake-up call,” but they don’t think the single case or subsequent viral detection will lead to a countrywide outbreak akin to COVID-19 or monkeypox, as over 90% of the country’s young children are vaccinated against polio.\n\nExperts, however, say pockets of unvaccinated people across the country may be at risk.\n\n“What worries me is the communities where vaccination is suboptimal,” said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. “It is in those communities where you’re likely to get spread rather than communities with coverage.”\n\nHealth officials announced on July 21 that a young adult in Rockland County, New York, had been diagnosed with polio in June. The person had never been vaccinated against the virus, officials said, and suffered paralysis as a result of the disease.\n\nA report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows the case – the first transmitted within the U.S. since 1979 – came from a person who had taken an oral polio vaccine in a different country. A rare complication of the attenuated live vaccine, which has not been given in the U.S. in more than two decades, allowed the person to develop a mild case of polio and shed the disease.\n\nLike every state in the U.S., New York requires children to get a polio vaccination before attending child care facilities and schools.\n\nBut in Rockland County, only about 60% of children under 2 received their recommended series of the polio vaccine, according to state data. The CDC report showed some zip codes have vaccination coverage as low as 37%.\n\n“Ideally, you want more than 90% at minimum among children,” El-Sadr said.\n\nAlthough data is inconsistent throughout the country, health experts say low vaccination rates aren’t unique to New York. There are likely other states with pockets of unvaccinated residents who could be vulnerable to the virus.\n\n'Tip of the iceberg':New York health officials raise alarms over possible polio spread\n\n'This isn’t normal':What to know about New York polio case, a rarity in the US\n\nMeanwhile, wastewater surveillance showed the polio virus in 21 sewage samples taken in Orange and Rockland counties since April, the CDC reported.\n\n“For every one case of paralytic polio identified, hundreds more may be undetected,” New York health commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett said in a statement. “The detection of poliovirus in wastewater samples in New York City is alarming, but not surprising.”\n\nLow levels of vaccination and circulating virus in wastewater indicate “a very major storm developing” in these communities, said Dr. Luis Ostrosky, an infectious disease specialist at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and Memorial Hermann Hospital.\n\nThe “wastewater is showing us there are infected people in the community that aren’t showing clinical signs and symptoms,” he said, as only about 1 in 2,000 people who are infected with the poliovirus develop the disease.\n\nMonkeypox in children:Everything to know about symptoms, vaccines and treatments\n\nThe best way to prevent further transmission in vulnerable communities is through vaccination, health experts say. The standard vaccination series for polio consists of four doses: one at 2 months old, the second at 4 months, the third between 6 and 18 months, and the fourth between 4 and 6 years old.\n\nOfficials urge parents to make sure their children are current with their vaccines. An April report from the CDC found coverage among kindergartners for the 2020-2021 school year fell by 1% due to disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“We really have to play catch up for some children,” El-Sadr said. Health care providers must “remind parents of the importance of getting their kids vaccinated as soon as possible.”\n\nThe highly infectious disease is spread through contact with infected feces, often when children don't wash their hands correctly, health experts said. So, it's also important to maintain good hand hygiene.\n\nThe single case of polio likely won't result in a nationwide outbreak, but it's a reminder that even eliminated diseases can reappear if the public isn't careful, said Dr. Daniel Pastula, a neuro-infectious disease expert at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.\n\n“Poliovirus isn’t eradicated around the world,\" he said. “Under the right conditions, it can rear its ugly head and those conditions are lack of vaccinations, contaminated water and food and unrobust public health systems.”\n\nContributing: Chris McKenna and Nancy Cutler, USA TODAY NETWORK.

But about two dozen cases remain unexplained, which the government vaguely refers to as “anomalous health incidents.”\n\n“There’s just no answer,” said one House Intelligence Committee member briefed on the CIA task force’s work. “They’ve done an immense amount of work, literally spreadsheeting every catastrophic set of symptoms down to the headache and there’s just nothing. None.”\n\nAmong the complaints lodged by CIA officers over the past year is that the agency task force isn’t doing enough to run down legitimate leads that might expose who or what is causing these strange episodes.\n\nMany of the those who have traveled to Capitol Hill to raise concerns identify themselves as Havana Syndrome victims – and while some have been referred to the Hill by the CIA, according to sources familiar with the matter, still others have come to the committees of their own accord.\n\nAt least some of the complainants have launched formal whistleblower proceedings, according to multiple sources, who like others interviewed for this story spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\n‘Significant, credible leads’\n\nThe influx of complaints comes as both the CIA and the State Department are beginning to compensate some victims for their injuries, some of which are severe. One victim has recently developed a rare form of cancer that can be associated with exposure to radiation or microwave energy, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nWhile there is no proven correlation between the cancer and the individual’s believed Havana syndrome incident, there are concerns among other victims that the two could be related. Earlier this year a separate intelligence community panel investigating the incidents found that some of the episodes could have been caused by “pulsed electromagnetic energy” emitted by an external source.\n\nThe maddening lack of progress is giving some victims uncomfortable flashbacks to the months and years following the appearance of the first cases, when former officials say they were treated with skepticism and in some cases outright dismissal by the Trump administration.\n\n“From what I have seen, there are tons of significant, credible leads that to the best of our knowledge the agencies are not addressing,” said Mark Zaid, an attorney who is representing some of the complainants. “Leads that clients of mine put into the system — and they’re not doing it. To me, this is where they need to be held accountable to explain why.”\n\nCIA officials dispute the notion that the task force isn’t conducting a rigorous and thorough investigation, with one agency official calling it “among the most full-scale and aggressive approaches to an investigation that CIA and other agencies have taken.”\n\nCIA director William Burns in a statement to CNN also said the agency is fulfilling its “profound obligation” to conduct “the most rigorous investigation possible.”\n\nCIA Director William Burns during his confirmation hearing, Wednesday, Feb. 24, 2021. Tom Williams/Pool/AP\n\n“We have assembled a large team of some of our very best officers who are focused exclusively on this issue, and we are following every single lead,” Burns said. “I have great confidence in the professionalism of the people, who come from both the CIA and the wider Intelligence Community, who are carrying out this mission, in their commitment to objectivity and in the findings they have reached to date.”\n\nThe probe remains an active intelligence investigation, the CIA official said, meaning the agency isn’t always able to share what it has learned on specific lines of inquiry.\n\nA years’ long investigation\n\nThe CIA task force is only one of at least three US intelligence community investigations into the “anomalous health incidents” – or AHIs.\n\nThese episodes have sickened dozens of spies, diplomats and service members in multiple countries overseas. The symptoms vary, ranging from headaches and vertigo to what some doctors have diagnosed as traumatic brain injury. Many victims have reported hearing a piercing directional noise at the onset of symptoms. Others have suffered inexplicable, debilitating injuries that have forced them to retire early.\n\nOne so-called experts panel – made up of scientific, medical, and engineering specialists who have access to classified information about the incidents – has examined possible mechanisms behind the episodes and is expected to deliver a classified report on its findings to Congress in the coming weeks, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nA declassified summary of the report released earlier this year found that the incidents could “plausibly” have been caused by “pulsed electromagnetic energy,” but stopped short of any definitive conclusions. That finding remains intact, but the full report is more than 200 pages and will provide much more detail to Congress, said one source familiar with the report.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, and Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, told CNN they’re urging the Biden administration to declassify as much of the report as possible in order to get more information into the public eye, even without definitive conclusions.\n\nThe CIA inspector general is also continuing work on an investigation into the agency’s handling of early cases, a report that some victims expect will dredge up a damning litany of how the CIA initially treated victims.\n\nNo evidence of ‘weapon’ behind incidents\n\nThen there’s the CIA’s task force, which for three years has been investigating whether a foreign nation might be carrying out attacks on US personnel. Their work – which has taken data from several government agencies – is ongoing.\n\nAccording to current agency officials and other sources briefed on the intelligence, the task force has found little evidence to support the theory that Russia or another country might be behind the episodes – or even whether all of the episodes are caused by the same thing.\n\nAs part of its investigation, the CIA and the State Department last year began urging employees around the world to report any symptoms that might be associated with Havana syndrome. It led to an explosion of reports from across the globe, many made out of an abundance of caution, intelligence officials say.\n\nBut the CIA task force determined that the vast majority of these reports were able to be explained by other, known causes. And the number of reports across so many dispersed places with no likely actors known in the area wound up providing support to the conclusion that there is no foreign actor behind the incidents, according to another CIA officer – especially given that there is still no evidence of a “weapon” used by a nation-state actor, this person said.\n\n“We have solicited and received many potential leads from AHI-affected officers as well as other members of our workforce,” the first CIA official said. “We have followed up rigorously on each of those.”\n\nThe investigation remains ongoing, the CIA official said. “It’s global in reach, every lead is followed up on, and we continue to take aggressive steps to uncover and validate new information.”\n\nDecrease in reported cases\n\nThere has been a marked decrease in reported incidents over the last year, officials say. The monthly reports of incidents this year have been “significantly less” than the number of the cases reported on a monthly basis last year, they noted.\n\nLast year, when the intelligence community was urging officials to report symptoms, there were reports of clusters of potential incidents in multiple cities, including Bogota and Vienna. Victims of these incidents last year – many of whom are in close contact with one another for the sake of support – say they have not heard of any large clusters of reported incidents so far this year.\n\nA police officers stands guard across the street from the US embassy in Havana, Cuba on May 3, 2022. Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee member insisted there was no “reduction in the commitment to doing the work,” but acknowledged, “These are people. You can imagine after years and years of no leads, it starts to get really frustrating for all of us.”\n\nTo date, victims have broadly praised Burns’ handling of the issue, and the Biden administration has been careful to avoid any suggestion that it is not taking victims’ accounts seriously – or that their injuries are not real and worthy of attention.\n\n“As director, I have no more profound obligation than to take care of our people,” Burns said in the statement to CNN. “We have expanded access to care and resources significantly over the past year and a half.”\n\nThere has been no recent internal CIA communication on the matter to employees, a separate CIA officer said.\n\nCompensation payments are beginning\n\nThe CIA began disbursing payments for some victims earlier this year, sources say, after Congress in 2021 passed legislation mandating compensation for CIA and government victims.\n\nIn recent days some of the State Department victims have received confirmation that they have been approved for compensation payments, according to other sources familiar with the mater. The State Department has received about a dozen requests for compensation payments from diplomats or their family members and expects to approve the first tranche in the coming days, a senior State Department official said.\n\nThe process for receiving compensation involves a patient’s doctor filling out a two-page form that is mostly comprised of yes-or-no questions. Candidates must have received at least a year of medical assistance, among other requirements.\n\nBut the process has not been without headaches.\n\nSome victims have tried to provide additional information, only to be rejected. In one incident, a victim’s physician provided a summary of the patient’s medical condition in addition to the binary form. The State Department rejected the submission, requesting that it be re-submitted without any additional descriptions, according to a source familiar with the matter – frustrating both the patient and the doctor.\n\nThe senior State Department official explained that bureaucrats without medical training are not in a position to evaluate colleagues’ medical information or retain it.\n\n“I respect the fact that people were trying to be thorough and comprehensive,” the official said, explaining that the department’s personnel are not in a position to evaluate colleagues’ medical information or retain it.\n\nThe victim has since been approved for compensation and is now focused on pushing to get treatment for more victims and flexibility for those who have been impacted – worrying, according to a source familiar with this person’s thinking, that the US government may begin to forget about victims’ needs once they are financially compensated.", "authors": ["Katie Bo Lillis Jeremy Herb Kylie Atwood", "Katie Bo Lillis", "Jeremy Herb", "Kylie Atwood"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/02/16/bubble-boy-syndrome-wisconsin-scid-test-requirement-now-50-states/4740563002/", "title": "Bubble boy syndrome: Wisconsin SCID test requirement now in 50 ...", "text": "MILWAUKEE – Dawson Bornheimer, 11, plays football almost every day, likes mac and cheese and shooting video game zombies and is such a picture of health that he can tell you with authority, \"I haven't puked in two years.\"\n\n“He probably can tell you the date,” says his mother, Melissa.\n\nIn Dawson's first year of life, he tested positive for a rare disease.\n\nSince then, a movement in newborn screening has spread across all 50 states and 20 countries around the world.\n\nThe long struggle to win widespread acceptance for the lifesaving test brought together a remarkable group of parents, children, doctors and health officials.\n\nIt began in Wisconsin, in the small village of Edgar, with a phone call from Dawson's pediatrician.\n\nIn January 2008, six months before Dawson's birth, Wisconsin had become the first place in the world to screen all babies for a life-threatening illness called severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID. When Dawson was 12 days old, he tested positive.\n\nAmericans may know SCID by a different name: \"bubble boy disease.\" The colloquial moniker comes from a movie titled \"The Boy in the Plastic Bubble,\" which starred John Travolta playing a child whose real name was David Vetter. Born in 1971, Vetter had a rare, usually fatal disease that crippled his immune system, leaving him so vulnerable to severe infections that he was forced to live in a sterile environment, or “plastic bubble.”\n\nHe died at the age of 12.\n\nAs soon as she got off the phone, Bornheimer Googled the disease to see what Dawson was up against. What she read terrified her. Most babies with SCID died before their first birthday.\n\nAt the baby’s baptism that afternoon, “I cried all the way through the ceremony,” Bornheimer recalls.\n\nPush for newborn testing\n\nJeffrey Modell was born Sept. 25, 1970. When he was 10 months old, he suffered from a high fever. Doctors discovered the baby had inherited an immune system disease called primary immune deficiency. His illness, though similar to Dawson’s, was not as perilous in the short term.\n\nJeffrey’s body would not manufacture white blood cells. Though these cells normally make up only about 1% of all the cells in the blood, they are the main line of defense against viruses, bacteria and other foreign invaders.\n\nVicki and Fred Modell were told that their son’s condition was a time bomb. Any day, he could catch an illness, and without white blood cells to fight it off, a common disease could easily turn fatal.\n\nFor years, his parents took him to see doctors all over the world. They had the money to do so because Fred Modell owned a successful wholesale diamond jewelry company for many years. None of the doctors who saw their son was able to cure him.\n\nJeffrey became very ill with pneumonia. He was placed on oxygen, then on a respirator.\n\n“I am sure you are afraid,” Vicki remembers telling her son, “but don’t be, because we have each other, and everything will be OK.”\n\nShe remembers the tear that ran down his face. Soon after, Jeffrey drifted into a coma. He died Jan. 7, 1986. He was 15.\n\nIn 1987, his parents founded the Jeffrey Modell Foundation to boost research and awareness of primary immune deficiency, a group of diseases that includes SCID.\n\nThe Modell Foundation produced posters showing the 10 warning signs of primary immune deficiency. The Modells campaigned to have SCID included on the panel of diseases for which millions of American newborns are screened.\n\nTo the Modells, the decision seemed obvious. If SCID is detected early enough, it can be cured with a bone marrow transplant, which provides the recipient with a brand new immune system. At the time, the condition was thought to be very rare – affecting one in 100,000 births or fewer.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007, the Modells lobbied health officials, seeking to get SCID added to newborn screening.\n\n“We failed in 2001. We failed in 2002. We failed in 2003 and on and on,” Fred Modell recalled years later.\n\nIn January 2004, when a paper in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention journal suggested SCID was a promising candidate for newborn screening.\n\nIn 2006, during a meeting with state and national health officials, the couple ran into more resistance. One official told the parents the disease was very rare and the newborn screening decision was simply a matter “of the numerator and the denominator.”\n\n“Wait a second. Let’s look at the numerator,” Fred recalls snapping. “How many dead babies shall I bring to you? One? Two? Five? Ten? Tell me how many.”\n\nBecause no one tracked the number of deaths from SCID, health authorities did not know how many lives they could save by screening for the disease.\n\nThere was only one way to find out. Someone would have to start testing babies.\n\nA career-defining opportunity\n\nIn February 2005, while working at National Jewish Health in Denver, Jack Routes read a journal paper that would change the course of his medical career.\n\nThe paper, in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, discussed a test that could be used to diagnose children with SCID. The test worked by discovering when important cells in the immune system have not matured enough to do their job.\n\nA healthy immune system depends on T-cells, which are made by the thymus gland. When these cells have matured, they contain small circles of DNA; absence of these circles of DNA is a hallmark of SCID.\n\nIn 2006, Routes was recruited to Children’s Hospital and the Medical College of Wisconsin. Soon after arriving, he mentioned the idea of screening babies for SCID to Robert Kliegman, chairman of the department of pediatrics at the Medical College.\n\nWisconsin had a reputation as an early adopter of newborn testing. In 1985, the state became the second after Colorado to screen for cystic fibrosis, which damages the lungs, digestive system and other organs.\n\nWhy not take the lead on SCID?\n\n$250,000 pledge sets stage\n\nIn 2007, the Modells traveled to a meeting in Atlanta, still looking for someone willing to begin testing babies for SCID.\n\nAt the meeting, Fred Modell noticed two doctors he’d never seen before. After a discussion of the test for SCID described in the 2005 paper, one of the doctors stood up.\n\n“I think I’ve seen enough,” Fred Modell recalls the doctor saying.\n\nThe doctor was Ronald Laessig, who had directed Wisconsin’s State Laboratory of Hygiene for more than 25 years. Laessig said he was confident the test would work, “but we won’t know if we can do it unless we do a pilot study.”\n\nThat’s when the second doctor stood up. It was Jack Routes.\n\n“I don’t know how we’re going to do it,” Routes said, “but we’re going to do it in Wisconsin.”\n\nRoutes told those in attendance that he did not know where money for the pilot test would come from, only that he would find it somehow.\n\nFred Modell raised his hand.\n\n“We’ll go half,” he said, referring to the foundation named for his son.\n\nThe total cost would be about $500,000; Routes would have to find the remaining $250,000.\n\nChildren's Hospital joins effort\n\nThe search led him to Cindy Christensen, president and chief operating officer at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin. Christensen had an “open door” policy. In 2007, Routes walked into her office.\n\nHe had just joined the hospital. Now he’d come to ask for $250,000.\n\n“It was a time when we did have our belts pretty tight,” Christensen said.\n\nStill, when Routes told her about the idea of launching a pilot study to screen newborns for SCID, she listened.\n\nWeeks later, Routes brought the Modells to tell Christensen their story. Routes stressed that one test at birth could help families avoid the Modells' anguish.\n\nChristensen decided the hospital would proceed with the project.\n\nLaessig at Wisconsin's State Laboratory of Hygiene went to state officials and gained permission to conduct the pilot study.\n\nAfter some fine-tuning of the test, screening of babies in Wisconsin began in January 2008.\n\nBorn on June 12, 2008, at Aspirus Wausau Hospital, Dawson Bornheimer became the state’s first infant to test positive for SCID.\n\nA transplant for Dawson\n\nA few hours after his baptism, Dawson began to run a fever.\n\nHe was taken to a Wisconsin hospital where he was kept in isolation for three days. The baby was placed on antibiotics and released.\n\nThe soreness in Dawson’s belly button worsened. The surrounding tissue turned black. A redness spread across his abdomen. An ambulance took the baby to American Family Children’s Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nDawson had omphalitis, an infection of the umbilical stump; it was not an infection typically seen in children with SCID.\n\nAt the hospital, Dawson had surgery to remove the infected tissue. The procedure left him without a bellybutton, just a tiny dimple where it had been.\n\nAs the Bornheimers prepared to leave the hospital, they came face to face with a team of doctors, all gowned in protective clothing and masks. Something was wrong with Dawson’s immune system. They needed to keep him in isolation while they ran more tests.\n\nThe baby stayed in the Madison hospital for more than two weeks, receiving antibiotics. He was referred to James Verbsky, whom Routes had worked with on the SCID test.\n\nIn July and August, Verbsky examined Dawson, working to confirm the SCID test and reconcile it with the infection the baby acquired. Verbsky treated the child for anemia, a deficiency of red blood cells. The doctor pinpointed the genetic cause of the baby’s SCID to a single mutation on one of the 20,000 or so human genes: RAC2. Verbsky determined that Dawson could be treated with a transplant.\n\nThe Bornheimers learned their son would receive a transplant of umbilical cord blood, which is very similar to a bone marrow transplant. The procedure was set for Sept. 25, 2008.\n\nRoutes called the Modells to tell them what was happening. The campaign they started more than 20 years ago had led to a test that promised to save the life of an infant in Wisconsin. The doctor invited them to Children’s Hospital for the historic moment.\n\nVicki and Fred realized immediately the significance of the date. It was their late son Jeffrey’s birthday. He would have turned 38.\n\nThe couple liked to stay close to home on Jeffrey’s birthday. All these years later, the wound still felt fresh.\n\n“Please,” Routes said. “You’ve got to come out here.”\n\nA harrowing journey\n\nThe Modells flew to Milwaukee.\n\nOn the morning of the transplant, they were ushered into a meeting with doctors and state newborn screening officials. Then Melissa and Michael Bornheimer entered the room, both dressed in blue T-shirts imprinted with the words, “Dawson has big dreams.”\n\nLater, a courier entered Dawson’s hospital room carrying a cooler with the umbilical cord blood, which had come all the way from Germany.\n\nAs an intravenous line allowed the blood to seep into Dawson’s thigh, the baby’s mother and father took turns rocking him gently. Melissa prayed constantly. She prayed that the baby’s tiny body would not reject the new immune system. If his body could hold on for a week, it would give the cord blood time to start working.\n\nBone marrow and cord blood transplants take place after a patient has been blasted with chemotherapy to wipe out their old immune system. Only then does the patient receive the bone marrow or cord blood that will build the new immune system.\n\nThis means the patient must pass through a dangerous period in which the old immune system is gone and the new one has yet to establish itself. During this time, the patient is vulnerable to viruses and bacteria.\n\nA week after the transplant, Dawson suffered severe complications.\n\nThe Bornheimers were told his organs were shutting down. He was sent to the pediatric intensive care unit. On his second night in the unit, doctors told the parents to begin calling relatives. Dawson wouldn’t make it through the night, they said.\n\n“It was terrifying,” Melissa said. “I didn’t sleep the entire time he was in ICU.”\n\nDawson lived through that second night, then a third.\n\nOn his fourth day in intensive care, tests showed new white blood cells. The cord blood was building his new immune system. By the day’s end, Dawson was back in a regular unit.\n\nIn January 2009, after four months in the hospital, the Bornheimers took Dawson home.\n\nThe pilot study was over. Wisconsin had adopted SCID as a permanent component of newborn screening.\n\nRelated: The nation's newborn screening programs depend on speed and science to save babies from rare diseases. But thousands of hospitals fall short.\n\nA plea to follow Wisconsin's lead\n\nA year later, the couple flew to Washington. So did the Modells. By then, Massachusetts had followed Wisconsin’s lead and started screening babies for SCID.\n\nMelissa Bornheimer was in the nation’s capital to testify before an advisory committee to the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The committee recommends changes in newborn screening.\n\n“Today,” she said, “Dawson is the first baby in the world born with severe combined immunodeficiency who was cured as a result of newborn screening. … Our only wish is that young families, like ours, in Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa, Illinois, and all of the states can feel secure that if any one of them gets the call that we did from the pediatrician, a program of newborn screening can turn a devastating tragedy into the kind of joy Dawson gives us every single day.”\n\nWhile Melissa spoke, Vicki Modell held Dawson on her lap. She held up a little container of french fries and ketchup; the toddler’s face was smeared with ketchup. Vicki felt glad that members of the committee could see him and realize: Here’s a child doing what every child does.\n\nThe committee voted 26-0 in favor of adding SCID to the uniform newborn screening panel recommended to every state.\n\nThe Modells and Bornheimers were overjoyed.\n\nThen a member of the committee clarified what had taken place: a recommendation, and no more.\n\nEach state, not the federal government, decides what diseases to include in newborn screening.\n\n“You have to go to every single state,” the committee member told the Modells.\n\nTheir work wasn’t done; it was just beginning.\n\nLeading a crusade\n\nOver the next decade, the Modells traveled more than 100,000 miles campaigning for SCID testing.\n\nThe resistance was always the same. The state has no money in the budget. The disease is too rare to be a priority. The state lab doesn’t have the expensive equipment needed to confirm a positive test.\n\nVicki and Fred stressed the risk of losing a baby to a condition that could have been treated. Sometimes families affected by SCID joined the fight, speaking to the media and public officials.\n\nIn 2010, California and New York added SCID to their newborn screening tests. In 2011, Delaware and Michigan followed; 2012, six more states, including Florida and Texas. In 2014, 11 more states. More followed.\n\nFinally, in 2018, the last of the 50 states added the SCID test: Nevada, Alabama, Indiana and Louisiana.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2017, countries outside the USA began screening for SCID: Israel, Norway and Taiwan. Pilot programs began in Spain, Sweden, Great Britain, France and Germany.\n\n“We’ve trained the scientists,” Routes says at the Medical College. “They come out here, and we show them how to do the test.”\n\nAs more places began testing, scientists learned something surprising: Once believed to affect one in 100,000 babies or fewer, SCID appears to be more common. Routes said the disease occurs in one out of every 40,000 or 50,000 births.\n\nA bond between families\n\nThe Modells have remained close to the Bornheimer family.\n\nWhen Dawson left the hospital in 2009, the Modells bought his family a laptop computer, so they could all stay in touch. The Modells buy Dawson and his three brothers presents at Christmas. The two families talk on the phone and through email.\n\nMelissa Bornheimer feels a special thrill when she watches Dawson score a touchdown or a basket at one of his games. Sometimes she and Dawson take out the CaringBridge journal she kept when he was in the hospital.\n\n“I think he is starting to understand how very important his life has been,” she said.\n\nDawson tells his friends sometimes that he almost died when he was a baby. He’s even told them that one of the surgeries left him without a belly button.\n\n“They all seem to think it’s really neat,” Melissa said.\n\nReach reporter Mark Johnson via email at mark.johnson@jrn.com; follow him on Twitter: @majohnso\n\nBlack History Month:When schools integrated 50 years ago, these black students had to pick up and move\n\nShe was a dancer, he was an Army ranger:30 years later, they still write daily love letters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/16"}]}

Businesses are relocating here. Top Chef launched its latest season in the city, complete with footage of the Milwaukee Public Market, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Hoan Bridge and other landmarks. And while Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much these days, they both decided to hold their conventions in Milwaukee in recent years – or at least try to.\n\nWe wanted to celebrate our great city by honoring some of the things we love about it. The trouble is, there’s so much to love about Milwaukee that it was tough to decide which objects to highlight. (We settled on 100 objects; a push to do 414 was quickly shot down by editors.)\n\nSome of the objects are stunningly beautiful, like the art museum’s wings and the Basilica of St. Josaphat dome. Others are delicious – like a Sobelman’s Bloody Mary, frozen custard and cheese curds. More than a few involve beer and sports, because of course they do. And we included some things that are just so Milwaukee – like racing sausages, Kohl’s Cash and “I Closed Wolski’s” stickers.\n\nWe also know Milwaukee isn’t perfect and has long faced deep problems like racism, segregation and inequality. So we also wanted to focus on the struggle for a better future by including key locations in the city, such as the 16th Street Viaduct, in an effort to honor the fair housing marches of the 1960s.\n\nNext time somebody starts trashing Milwaukee, please tell them the city’s brightest days are still ahead. And maybe send them this list of 100 objects as a reminder that Milwaukee is indeed “the good land” full of promise – and some pretty great things.\n\n—Mary Spicuzza\n\n100 objects that make Milwaukee\n\nArchitecture\n\nCulture\n\nEntertainment\n\nEnvironment\n\nFood & drink\n\nHistory\n\nSports\n\nHow did we come up with these 100 objects? Here's an explanation.\n\nWhat did we miss? What doesn’t belong? Let us know here: bit.ly/MKE100More.\n\nThe Polish immigrants who poured into Milwaukee in the late 19th century wanted a beautiful church that telegraphed their strong Catholic faith and ethnic heritage. And they were willing to do anything for it.\n\nThey mortgaged their homes to raise money. They volunteered their labor. Fr. Wilhelm Grutza, the blacksmith-turned-pastor, shipped 500 rail cars of salvaged materials from a shuttered Chicago post office. He died five weeks after the church's dedication in 1901, exhausted from overwork.\n\nIn a city dotted with steeples and infused with Catholic tradition, the Basilica of St. Josaphat stood out. Modeled after St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, its 220-foot-high copper dome was only second in size to the U.S. Capitol at the time.\n\nToday, 123 years later, the ornate basilica is still larger-than-life. It’s a tourist destination as well as a hallowed space. The faithful who gather understand they’re among tens of thousands who have knelt in the pews for prayer, and heard the acoustics echo, and craned their necks to take in the intricately decorated cupola.\n\nIt’s Milwaukee’s largest church. It’s always been an anchor of the south side. But its dome – first illuminated at night in 2019 – cemented the basilica’s place in Milwaukee’s skyline for years to come.\n\nEven as church attendance and religious belief decline, the dome is a reminder of Catholics’ indelible impact on the city.\n\nIt calls to drivers passing on Interstate 43: I’ve been here over a century, and I’m here to stay.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nMilwaukee has a contentious history with public art (Google “Blue Shirt” if you need a reminder). Ensconced in O’Donnell Park at the lakefront, Mark di Suvero’s steel-beam sculpture “The Calling” has survived several rounds of controversy with the staying power of the sun that it abstractly mimics.\n\nFunded by an anonymous donor, it is made of steel I-beams painted orange and stands 40 feet tall. After 11 argumentative public hearings and much political grandstanding, the Common Council approved the artwork, which was dedicated in April 1982.\n\n“Di Suvero certainly was aware that many people would see his work from great distances and from the windows of rushing cars, buses and trucks,” Milwaukee Sentinel art critic Dean Jensen wrote in 1982. “Through its great size, its garish color and the grammar of its simple forms, it asserts its essence quickly and directly.”\n\n“The Calling” enjoyed a bonus kerfuffle in 2001 when architect Santiago Calatrava’s gleaming white addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum opened. Killjoys wanted the di Suvero away from the Calatrava sightline. The artist responded bluntly: “If you don’t want it, take it apart and ship it to me.”\n\nAs for the architect, he told Journal critic Whitney Gould that he designed the MAM addition with “The Calling” in mind. And if you stand along Wisconsin Avenue in the right spots, you’ll see that “The Calling” and the Calatrava addition line up perfectly.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of spring, when warmer weather finally thaws the winter roads. It’s the sound of the wind blowing across your face and through your hair. It’s the sound of speed, freedom, the open road. It’s the sound of summer, long rides cross-country or a short trip to the beach.\n\nIt’s the sound of friends William Harley and Arthur Davidson’s turn-of-the-20th-century ingenuity that grew from tinkering in a backyard shed to the construction of a two-wheeled, motor-powered bike and the desire to make it go fast, then faster. It’s the sound of a business born in 1903 and raised in Milwaukee, then taking off to become an internationally known brand. It’s the sound linked to leather, and the smell of gasoline. It’s the sound of putting the pedal to the metal.\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of a Harley.\n\n-Jessica Van Egeren\n\nJune 19, 1865, is the most crucial day in African American history. On that day, federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, and declared that the Civil War was over and all 250,000 enslaved people in the state — the last remaining slaves in the South — were now free, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nIn 1997, a flag was designed to commemorate Juneteenth and was later revised.\n\nThe flag features red, white, and blue colors — from the American flag — with a white bursting star of freedom in the middle. An arc runs through the flag’s center to symbolize the new horizon of opportunity for African Americans. The blue is above the red because the red represents the ground soaked with blood from all those who came before us and fought for freedom.\n\nMilwaukee’s annual Juneteenth celebration is one of the country’s oldest — the city was one of the first in the northern states to began officially celebrating Juneteenth, in 1971.\n\nJuneteenth and its flag are significant for me as an African American. My grandparents, who lived in Mississippi, referred to it as “Jubilee Day,” and they celebrated it by enjoying strawberry soda and red velvet cake that symbolized the blood shed by enslaved West African ancestors.\n\nThis flag should be flown on Juneteenth and every day in our country.\n\n-James E. Causey\n\nIf you live anywhere in the Milwaukee area, you’ve almost definitely seen an Oak Leaf Trail sign. The over 135-mile multi-use trail traverses throughout Milwaukee County and is beloved by cyclists, runners, walkers, birders, skateboarders, rollerbladers and more. It’s a mainstay in numerous local running races throughout the year.\n\nThe Oak Leaf can take you pretty much anywhere in Milwaukee and offers beautiful views; nearly a quarter travels along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The trail’s nine branch lines connect users to dozens of county parks, beer gardens and attractions in the area.\n\nThe Oak Leaf also intersects with various other municipal trails, allowing for travel beyond the county. The northern terminus connects to the Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which users can take all the way to Sheboygan County.\n\nWhile it’s hard to imagine the Oak Leaf without its variety of users today, it was not open for non-cycling use (or given its current name) until 1996. The trail’s origins date back to the late 1930s, when local cycling enthusiasts established an about-65-mile bike route around Milwaukee County.\n\nThree decades later, the trail was officially recognized by the county parks department. In 1976, it was christened the “76 Bike Trail” in honor of the national bicentennial.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nFor more than 150 years, few objects have represented the city of Milwaukee better than a mug of beer – the key component of gemütlichkeit, which Milwaukeeans have pursued since long before prohibition.\n\nBeer steins clutched in the hands of dozens of strangers crowded together at long wooden tables under tree canopies represents the city’s long devotion to the craft of beer brewing and community, and pays tribute to the city’s sturdy Germanic roots.\n\nGerman immigrants inspired the creation of the city’s breweries and made beer gardens the quintessential gathering spot of Milwaukee. According to the Milwaukee County Parks Department, more than two dozen breweries were in operation by 1856, making way for beer gardens along the Milwaukee River.\n\nProhibition in the 1920s curtailed such gatherings, but the idea has experienced a revival in recent years.\n\nThe city has several permanent beer gardens, including the popular Estabrook Beer Garden along the river greenway in the city’s northeast side, between Shorewood and Whitefish Bay. And the county’s Traveling Beer Garden tours bring the beer garden experience to neighborhood parks around the city throughout the summer.\n\nHere, you can fill your beer stein with Hofbrau, wash down bratwurst or a soft pretzel, and watch your neighbors polka – just like Milwaukeeans did generations before.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nMusic can bring a community together.\n\nWant proof? Just visit Washington Park’s bandshell on a Wednesday evening in the summer.\n\nYou’ll see families and friends spreading out blankets and popping open lawn chairs on the grassy amphitheater.\n\nYou’ll smell barbecue, wood-fired pizza and popcorn wafting from local vendors’ food trucks.\n\nAnd depending on the night, you’ll hear classical, jazz, reggae, opera, folk, rock, punk or a fusion of genres.\n\nThe stunning art deco bandshell is formally known as the Emil Blatz Temple of Music, named for the man who came from a brewing dynasty and donated $100,000 for its construction in the city’s largest park.\n\nAt its dedication in 1938, a crowd of 40,000 – “a mass of mothers, fathers, maidens, swains and wide-eyed children” – heard a performance from the Wisconsin Symphony Orchestra and singer Jessica Dragonette, The Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\n“If this temple of music gives you as much pleasure as it has given me in donating it, I am fully repaid,” Blatz told those who gathered on the lawn.\n\nIn the 86 years since, the bandshell has hosted musical legends like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Lily Pons, often as part of its “Music Under the Stars” program, which ran for 55 years.\n\nToday, Washington Park Wednesdays, a free concert series, carries on the tradition, providing a welcoming space for neighbors of all ages to sing, dance and listen.\n\n-Ashley Luthern\n\nWhen it comes to Frank Lloyd Wright, most Wisconsinites think of Taliesin, the architect’s home and workshop in Spring Green, the S.C. Johnson headquarters building in Racine or Monona Terrace in Madison.\n\nBut did you know there’s an entire block on the city’s south side that’s a showcase for Wright’s more modest designs?\n\nThe Burnham Block is a one-of-a-kind collection of six buildings constructed in 1916 as models for affordable housing for working-class people. The collection of single-family homes and duplexes on the 2700 block of West Burnham Street have the typical Wright touches of rich woodwork, tall vertical windows and natural construction materials, but they’re substantially smaller than the homes Wright had previously designed.\n\n“These are Frank Lloyd Wright’s vision to house every person, every American in a beautiful, artistic place to call home,” said Mike Lilek, curator for Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block, Inc., the nonprofit that owns five of the six buildings.\n\nThe organization has restored two buildings, which now function as a museum that is open for public tours. Plans are being developed for restoring the home on the northwest corner of South Layton Boulevard and West Burnham Street.\n\nYou can make reservations for a guided tour at wrightinmilwaukee.org.\n\n-Karl Ebert\n\nGreeting visitors by water from the east, the Hoan Bridge is both Milwaukee’s iconic and ironic symbol for the city’s socialist history.\n\nFormer Mayor Daniel Hoan, the city’s longest serving socialist mayor, had much of Milwaukee onboard with his policies, but when the bridge for part of Interstate 794 was erected in his honor, many were dismayed.\n\n“Where transportation was concerned, Dan Hoan was no fan of car culture,” said Phil Rocco, associate professor of political science at Marquette University. “Quite the opposite. He often bitterly complained that cars locked the city into a dynamic of ever-greater spending on ever-widening streets and that greater traffic jeopardized public safety.”\n\nThe public gets an up close and personal view of the Hoan, which opened for traffic in 1977, during the highlight of Milwaukee’s warm months — Summerfest.\n\nIt crosses over the Milwaukee Harbor, welcoming shipping, and connects downtown to Bay View and other parts of southern Milwaukee County. It’s in the foreground of many photographers’ shots of the city skyline, and is lit every night, often to honor an event or person.\n\nCoined the “bridge to nowhere” during construction, the Hoan has very much become part of Milwaukee’s image.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nYou don’t have to be the commissioner of Major League Baseball or owner of the Milwaukee Bucks to eat like them.\n\nAt Jake’s Delicatessen, 1634 W. North Ave., patrons can walk and eat in the shadow of former MLB Commissioner Allan H. “Bud” Selig and late Bucks owner Herb Kohl, who frequented the deli.\n\nJake’s Deli opened in 1955 and catered to the many Jewish families who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to the Haymarket and Sherman Park neighborhoods. In 1969, Selig bought an ownership stake in the business and held it until Wajeeh Alturkman bought it in 2021.\n\nJake’s has a modest appearance with a vertical street sign that reads “Jake’s.” Those in search of a good sandwich don’t need any further description.\n\nJake’s is known for its corned beef, but it’s the pastrami sandwich that gets people talking. Patrons have a choice to get the rye bread toasted or keep it plain, with yellow or brown mustard and their choice of cheese.\n\nIf they take a seat on the bench by the counter, the meat is cut slowly right in front of them. And a pickle spear is served on the side.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nLike its subject, downtown’s mural of Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo is larger than life — covering the three-story back wall of a historic office building at 600-606 E. Wisconsin Ave. It was painted there in spring 2022 by local artist Mauricio Ramirez. The building is owned by Dan Nelson Jr., a Bucks season ticket holder and president and chief executive officer of Nelson Schmidt Inc., a marketing communications agency that operates at the building.\n\nFor Giannis fans, it’s a must-stop photo op, and perhaps Milwaukee’s best-known mural.\n\nHis legacy is still being written, but already includes being named Most Valuable Player in the 2021 NBA championship series and two regular season MVP awards in 2019 and 2020. And it will always include Milwaukee, where we’ve watched him grow from a teenager to a dominant player, an involved father and a noted fan of chicken nuggets.\n\nBucks in six!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nHow do you decide on an iconic symbol to symbolize a place that is so iconic?\n\nI’m speaking of the Milwaukee Public Museum. And, if you’re in a roomful of Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, the answer is, not without a fight.\n\nThe museum has been around (in various iterations and locations) since 1851. And it’s become a go-to place for field trips and weekend excursions.\n\nSo this reporter (having been on many such field trips and excursions) suggested the rattlesnake button for MPM’s symbol. Because how could you possibly end a trip to the museum without sitting on the ledge surrounding the bison hunt exhibit, reaching your hand underneath and flicking the switch? The answer is, you cannot.\n\nAnother reporter proposed the T-Rex, which for decades has been famously munching on the remains of his fallen prey in the museum’s strikingly realistic (and scary) dinosaur diorama.\n\nAfter vigorous debate, we were outvoted by proponents of Granny, who calmly rocks in her chair on the porch of her house in the Streets of Old Milwaukee. Granted, she does live in possibly the most popular exhibit ever at the museum. And (especially impressive for someone her age), she has her own social media accounts. So who is this reporter to argue?\n\nBut MPM apparently agrees the rattlesnake button and T-Rex are iconic since they’ll be making the trek to the new museum, slated to open in 2027. Granny will be there, too.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nMost will agree that a trip (or two or several) to the Milwaukee County Zoo is necessary if you want to call yourself a true Milwaukeean.\n\nAnd many Milwaukee children (or grownups waxing nostalgic about their childhoods) will agree that a trip to the zoo is not complete without a ride on the train and a Mold-a-Rama souvenir of their favorite animal. This is universal.\n\nLess universal is choosing your favorite zoo animal. Milwaukee has had some famous ones over the years, from Gordy the groundhog to Chandar the Bengal tiger to Onassis the geriatric Giant South American River turtle.\n\nPerhaps the most famous is an animal that members of the Millennial generation and afterward never even met. But he lives in the memories of middle-age and older Milwaukeeans.\n\nAccording to the Milwaukee Public Library, Samson the gorilla arrived as a baby in Milwaukee in 1950 (back when the zoo was located in Washington Park). He moved to the zoo’s current location in 1959, and would for years grab the attention of delighted, fascinated and (sometimes) terrified zoo visitors when he pounded on the glass of his enclosure.\n\nSamson died of a heart attack in 1981, but Milwaukeeans can pay homage to him with a visit to the Milwaukee Public Museum, where there is a lifelike re-creation of the famous gorilla.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nIf you’ve never lived outside Milwaukee, you may be wondering why a clearly universal celebration like St. Nick’s Day — that perfectly timed mini-holiday to tide you over till Christmas with a few little treats in your stocking or shoes — is being honored in a dedication to Milwaukee things.\n\nBut Milwaukee is one of relatively few places that have been lucky enough to hold on to the tradition, along with other cities with large German or Dutch influence, such as Cincinnati; Holland, Michigan; and St. Louis.\n\nThe feast of 4th-century bishop St. Nicholas is celebrated Dec. 6. Traditionally, St. Nick is thought to go from house to house on the night of Dec. 5, leaving treats in the shoes of children.\n\nIn most places, St. Nick has become synonymous with Santa Claus, and everybody knows he brings treats and gifts just once a year — on Christmas Eve.\n\nFor kids new to the city (and their parents), now you know: Milwaukee kids get two mornings in December to wake up to find gifts.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nThe Milwaukee County War Memorial is one of the most recognizable buildings on the city’s Lake Michigan shoreline.\n\nSituated just north of the Milwaukee Art Museum, the War Memorial overlooks the lake from the east side of downtown on East Mason Street, and its plaza is a popular spot for gathering to see lakefront fireworks.\n\nIts mission comes down to six words: “Honor the Dead. Serve the Living.”\n\nThe building was dedicated on Veterans Day 1957, the work of Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, according to the War Memorial’s website.\n\nThe building’s design was “influenced by the abstract geometry of modern French architect Le Corbusier,” according to the Milwaukee Art Museum website.\n\nThe building is not only a memorial but a “hub for veteran activities,” the War Memorial website states.\n\nAn eternal flame memorial sits in a small pool, illuminating a black granite honor roll that includes names of Milwaukee County residents who have died while serving in the U.S. military.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nOn your way to a fancy night out in the Third Ward, take the right path and you’ll come across a permanent trio of massive ladybugs that look like they could be headed the same direction as you.\n\nIt’s hard to tell how massive they are, exactly: They’re perched way up on the side of the Milwaukee Building on North Water Street.\n\nAt least, it’s a hard calculation looking up at them from the sidewalk or from a car whizzing by.\n\nThe fiberglass bugs are each about 6 feet long and 3 feet deep and have been hanging there since July 1999.\n\nThey were thought up by John J. Burke to decorate the building that houses the company he started, Burke Properties, according to his obituary.\n\nNot much has been written about them, which is a testament to how many interesting things Milwaukee offers — we take even giant beetles for granted.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nThe most quintessentially Milwaukee treat, especially on a hot summer day. (But, let’s be honest: We Midwesterners enjoy a cold cone even when it’s below zero.)\n\nFrozen custard is a step up from your average ice cream because it includes egg yolks that make for a richer texture.\n\nTravel Wisconsin lists Milwaukee as the unofficial “frozen custard capital of the world,” a kind way of saying no visitor should leave the city without trying frozen custard from at least one, if not multiple, locations.\n\nMight we suggest a formal custard tasting?\n\nThree places to start: Gilles, Leon’s and Kopp’s. Each serves a couple of basic flavors every day, plus a Flavor of the Day that’s often more unique.\n\nGilles Frozen Custard opened in 1938, making it the oldest operating stand in the city, according to Travel Wisconsin. Find it at 7515 W. Bluemound Road, and don’t be shy about taking a look at the full menu of non-frozen treats.\n\nLeon’s Frozen Custard popped up just a few years later, in 1942, and is still operated by the original family, according to its website. The year-round business at 3131 S. 27th St. bills itself as a “classic 1950s-style family owned drive-in, specializing in frozen custard.”\n\nKopp’s Frozen Custard: Come for dessert, stay for dinner. With locations in Glendale, Brookfield and Greenfield, you’re never too far from the custard shop that’s also known for its massive burgers.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nYou might know it from the 1970s and 80s sitcom Laverne & Shirley, in which “Welcome Milwaukee visitors” is displayed in all-caps across the bell tower in the opening credits.Or, you might just be familiar from passing the iconic building that sits on a triangular slice of land with its north end at the intersection of East Kilbourn Avenue and North Water Street.\n\nThe Flemish Renaissance-inspired structure in the heart of downtown Milwaukee was completed in 1895, becoming a fixture of the city’s skyline. It cost about $1 million to construct, according to the city.\n\nIts atrium in the building’s center rises eight stories and serves as the site of city functions and news conferences by officials and those challenging their actions.\n\nOn the floors that ascend from the atrium are various city offices, including the Mayor’s Office and the Common Council Chambers where the 15-member council conducts its public meetings. Others include the Assessor’s Office and City Attorney’s Offices.\n\nFrom the base of the bell tower to the top of the flagpole, the building ascends 393 feet in the air. For a few years after City Hall opened in 1895, it was one of the tallest habitable buildings – if not the tallest – in the nation and world.\n\nThe tower holds the bell known as “Solomon Juneau” after Milwaukee’s first mayor, according to the city. The bell was made from church and firehouse bells from around the city and first rang on New Year’s Eve 1896.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nIn the heart of Marquette University’s bustling campus, a medieval remnant offers respite for the soul.\n\nJoan of Arc Chapel began its life as a place of worship circa 1420 in the village of Chasse, southeast of Lyon, France. Named then after St. Martin de Seysseul, it served the people of Chasse-sur-Rhône for hundreds of years before falling into disrepair.\n\nJoan of Arc, the legendary warrior and patron saint of France, is said to have prayed at the chapel in 1429. That was part of its attraction to Gertrude Hill Gavin, who bought it in 1927 and had it moved to her estate in Long Island, N.Y.\n\nMarc Rotjman, a former president of Racine’s J.I. Case Co., and his wife, Lillian, bought the chapel in 1962 and later donated it to Marquette. Over nine months, its 30 tons of stone and 18,000 terracotta roof tiles were carefully disassembled, labeled and shipped to Milwaukee. The reassembled and renamed chapel opened here in 1966. Its nave was lengthened to allow seating up to 60 people; radiant floor heating and electricity were also added.\n\nThe Gothic chapel is a striking landmark amid so many buildings centuries younger. But it continues to be an active worship site, with as many as seven Masses a week when classes are in session, including a Sunday afternoon liturgy in Spanish.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nFor many people, just balancing on ice skates is hard ... now imagine maintaining control while skating at 30 miles per hour and racing fellow skaters. That’s the sport of speedskating.\n\nMilwaukee is home to one of the top speedskating facilities in the world: the Pettit National Ice Center. The Pettit is one of only two 400-meter indoor speedskating ovals in the country and is an official U.S. Speedskating training facility. It opened in 1992 and replaced the outdoor Wisconsin Olympic Ice Rink, which occupied the site from 1967 to 1991.\n\nAll of the U.S. speedskaters to compete in the past six Winter Olympics have raced or trained at the Pettit Center. The facility has hosted the 2018 and 2022 Olympic Trials and other elite competitions. Over the years, the Pettit has been the home training facility of numerous speedskating greats, including five-time Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair, 1994 gold medalist Dan Jansen and four-time Olympic medalist Shani Davis.\n\nThe Pettit also boasts two international-size hockey rinks and a 443-meter walking and running track. It is the home of multiple local hockey and skating clubs and offers figure skating, speedskating and hockey lessons for children and adults.\n\nThe track is a popular winter training spot for high school, college and adult runners. It hosts track practices, meets and even a 95-lap indoor marathon.\n\nBut, if you’re looking for something a little less athletically intense, the Pettit also has ample public skate hours with skate rentals ... perfect for date night or a fun family activity.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nPecan fingers, snickerdoodles, butterscotch bars and more.\n\nWisconsin residents have been making Christmas treats published in the annual We Energies Cookie Book for nearly a hundred years.\n\nEvery year, the company compiles recipes submitted by residents in a book celebrating themes like military service and hometown favorites.\n\nPicking up a copy of the book has become a Christmas tradition in many Wisconsin households. Some longtime Wisconsinites collect copies for years, passing them down through generations.\n\nThe We Energies Cookie Book was introduced in 1928, back when the company was known as the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co.\n\nThe book was sent to customers to promote the company’s appliances. Through the 1930s, the book grew in popularity and was distributed at the Public Service Building in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nThe book has gone through temporary changes over the years. During World War II, the 1942 edition had 14 recipes for wartime cookies, featuring cookie low in shortening and sugar to accommodate for rationing ingredients during the war.\n\nAfter the 1973 book, the company stopped publishing the book until 1984 due to rising energy costs. The book was published in 1991, 1998, 2002 and restored to its annual printing tradition in 2006. You can find each cookie book digitally archived at we-energies.com/recipes/archive.\n\n-Alex Groth\n\nIf you’ve dined at a Wisconsin supper club or visited a traditional cocktail lounge, chances are you’ve heard of (or enjoyed) the Pink Squirrel. In the family of ice cream drinks like the Grasshopper and the Brandy Alexander, the Pink Squirrel has a special Milwaukee connection: it was, as far as anyone can tell, invented at Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge, 1579 S. 9th St., in the 1940s.\n\nWith just three ingredients — vanilla ice cream, creme de cacao (chocolate liqueur) and creme de noyaux (almond-flavored liqueur) — the Pink Squirrel is a sweet, nutty, creamy way to drink your dessert.\n\nBoth the rosy hue and nutty flavor can be attributed to the creme de noyaux, a liqueur made from apricot, peach or cherry kernels and originally colored with cochineal.\n\nAs the story goes, Bryant and Edna Sharp opened Bryant’s as a Miller Brewing tied house in 1936. Within a few years, Bryant abandoned the beer hall approach and transformed the business into the first cocktail lounge in Milwaukee and, quite likely, Wisconsin.\n\n“People who knew him described him as quiet and serious, with a talent and passion for mixology,” a history of the bar says of Bryant Sharp. “He also was known for putting together unique flavors, which he sold to cordial companies.”\n\nIt’s only fitting that this classic ice cream cocktail can trace its roots to one of the Dairy State’s favorite drinking establishments.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nSince 1994, drivers traveling north on I-43 have seen the giant eagle and only slightly smaller dove on the wall of a National Avenue building. Back then, Esperanza Unida director Richard Oulahan commissioned artist Reynaldo Hernandez to create a mural to reflect the heritage and aspirations of the south-side community. “The Mural of Peace,” about 80 feet by 150 feet, shows both birds with an olive branch, with a bolt of lightning between them and a background of colored stripes representing flags of different lands.\n\nThe mural is painted not on the building’s cream city brick, but on nearly 300 panels affixed to it. After a few years, weather damaged some panels. Contributors to a fund drive to restore the mural included Tippecanoe Elementary students, who raised more than $566 in a penny drive.\n\nThe Walker’s Point building at 611 W. National Ave. is now the Mercantile Lofts Apartments. During its conversion to living spaces, modifications were made that created windows on that wall for inhabitants but still kept the bold colors of Hernandez’s design visible.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nThe Allen-Bradley Clock Tower, located on South 2nd Street and just north of Greenfield Avenue, has been a staple of Milwaukee’s skyline and for decades was the largest four-sided clock tower in the world.\n\nSitting atop what is now Rockwell Automation, the 283-foot-tall clock was revealed on Halloween 1962. The clockworks were built by the Allen-Bradley company, which specialized in electrical controls.\n\nThe tower is four separate clocks running on individual motors. About once a month its gears require greasing, but it’s lit by LED bulbs that rarely need to be replaced.\n\nTwice a year everyone moves their clocks forward or back an hour, usually by pushing a button. Changing the Allen-Bradley clock requires a security guard on the outside with a radio looking up at each face while someone with a special key turns four switches inside a room on the first floor.\n\nIn its early years it was referred to as the “Polish moon” because of the bright display in a predominantly Polish neighborhood. But over time more Mexican immigrants and families moved to the south side and the nickname was changed to the “Mexican moon” to recognize how the neighborhood has changed.\n\nThe clock also illuminated the fight against discrimination in labor in 1968, when the Latino and Black communities joined efforts to fight discriminatory hiring practices at the Allen-Bradley Company.\n\nThe protest was started by Father James E. Groppi. Younger Latino residents took up the cause and more activism against the company continued for another year. The march on Allen-Bradley is considered a success, given the consciousness it created and the progress Latinos in Milwaukee have made in the half-century since.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nFirst things first: The correct pronunciation is poonch-ka, says Joe Parajecki, a chef at the Polish Center in Franklin.\n\nAnd yes, they are similar to jelly-filled donuts, but they’re much richer. Ingredients like sugar, butter, eggs and yeast are put into the dough before giving them up for Lent.\n\nPaczki is traditionally eaten on Fat Tuesday in Milwaukee, though in Poland, it’s actually celebrated on the Thursday before Lent.\n\n“You can’t believe the lines in Poland to get paczki on Fat Thursday. People eat a dozen or more each,” Parajecki said.\n\nMilwaukee is one of the “capital cities of Polish America,” according to Milwaukee historian John Gurda. Two decades after the city was founded, 30 families organized the first Polish Catholic congregation in urban America.\n\nA traditional paczki is the size of a walnut and doesn’t look like a donut at all, Parajecki said. It’s sweet dough wrapped around a prune or filled with rose jam, which is “a very acquired taste. It’s like eating a jar of perfume.”\n\nPrune and raspberry are the most common fillings in America, but there are newer flavors like Nutella and lemon. Parajecki is amazed by how many people who celebrate paczki, even those who aren’t Polish.\n\nHe doesn’t care about the paczki vs. donut discussion — more important is tying it to a memory, like sitting around grandma’s table.\n\n“We’re not eating it to debate those things. We’re eating it to remember, we’re eating it to have a good time.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nYou just got through TSA at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. You’re missing a shoe, toiletries are bursting from your carry-on, and where is that boarding pass again?\n\nA sign past the security checkpoint: Recombobulation Area. An invitation and a space to put your things back in order.\n\nIt all started in 2008, when former airport director Barry Bateman told the sign shop he had a great idea.\n\nHe was told “recombobulation” wasn’t an actual word, the airport’s director of public affairs and marketing Harold Mester said. Bateman knew that.\n\n“He said, ‘Let’s try to make this a little bit more fun during this stressful experience. If someone gets a chuckle when they go through the checkpoint, then we’ve done our job.’”\n\nAs far as Mester is aware, Milwaukee is the only airport to use the “recombobulation” phrase. “Recomposure” is the more technical term, but as Mester pointed out, “that’s an actual word.”\n\nThe American Dialect Society once declared “recombobulation” the most creative word of the year. And the term has inspired other branding efforts in Milwaukee, from billboards to beer.\n\nIt’s also the namesake of a blog by Dan Shafer. As he put it, recombobulation is the “opposite of discombobulation.” He is often tagged in the many selfies taken in front of the sign.\n\nThe sign represents Milwaukee’s sense of humor about itself, Shafer said.\n\n“It’s just one of those quintessentially Milwaukee types of things. It’s just quirky and weird enough and resonates with people.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nWalk into a Milwaukee supper club or bar on a Friday night and you’ll likely see bartenders lining up rocks glasses and filling each with maraschino cherries, orange slices and a dash of sugar. Next comes a shot of soda water and a muddler. Then, the brandy.\n\nThe Old Fashioned cocktail isn’t supposed to be made with brandy, but like anything in Wisconsin, we’ve taken an idea and made it our own. And boy, do we own it.\n\nDuring an average weekend at the Five O’ Clock Steakhouse on West State Street, bartenders serve more than 100 brandy Old Fashioneds, general manager Hegel Terron told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nDuring the week, the daily average probably tops at 75, he said.\n\nAt the Packing House supper club on East Layton Avenue, general manager Chris Wiken said he’s ordering two cases of Korbel brandy per week.\n\nThe vast majority of customers are asking for brandy Old Fashioneds sweet, Wiken said. But in recent years, customers are getting a bit more picky about which brandy they want – ordering Milwaukee’s Central Standard or even comedian Charlie Berens’ spirit.\n\nOn a good Friday night, the Packing House is filling a couple hundred rocks glasses with Wisconsin’s favorite cocktail. In a year’s time, that’s tens of thousands, Wiken said.\n\n“I cannot keep Korbel on hand. It just flies out the door,” he said. “Friday night is probably when we sell the most because the pairing with the fish fry is a really good pairing.”\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, there are a few ways to give yourself away. First: Order a bourbon Old Fashioned instead of brandy sweet. Second: Wear a Cardinals hat. Third: Ask for directions to the nearest water fountain.\n\nInexplicably, public water fountains here are called bubblers and pretty much only here. There are some in Rhode Island, for some reason, but the vast, vast majority of the nation adopted “drinking fountains” and “water fountains.”\n\nMilwaukee appears to be ground zero for the use of bubbler, according to UW-Madison’s Dictionary of American Regional English. Its origins are fuzzy but may be tied to its use by Kohler Co., one of Wisconsin’s most famous brands – a manufacturer of faucets among other water-related products.\n\nThe company in 1914 promoted a water fountain created by Kohler as being fitted with a “continuous flow bubbler,” according to the UW-Madison dictionary.\n\nA former dictionary editor in 2015 told Wisconsin Public Radio that “bubbler” was used especially in the southeastern area of the state starting in the mid 1910s. More than a century later, we’re still using bubblers.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nSundays in Milwaukee have a smell: buttery, fresh-baked rolls.\n\nAfter church, it’s tradition to pick up what’s known as hot ham and rolls – an end-of-weekend feast with origins in the cream city’s German or Polish roots, depending on which bakery owner you speak to.\n\nFor less than $30 at Grebe Bakery, for example, you can get three pounds of ham, 18 rolls and two pounds of potato salad.\n\nThe meal is part of Milwaukee’s identity, so much so that former Gov. Scott Walker made it part of his politico persona along with other attributes Walker promoted to assure voters he was as Wisconsin as they were.\n\nHe tweeted nearly 20 times about procuring hot ham and rolls from now-shuttered Fattoni’s deli after church in Wauwatosa during his first term as governor.\n\nBrian Schwellinger, president of Badger Ham, which provides the hams for many bakeries’ meal deals, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2021 the hot ham and rolls tradition is likely rooted in religion.\n\n“There were so many churches that the church tradition was a strong part of the community, and after service is when you had your first meal of the day,” Schwellinger said.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nThe Great Lakes may seem like an limitless resource, but the world’s largest surface freshwater system faces major threats from pollution, climate change, invasive species and overexploitation.\n\nAnd to understand and protect it, scientists need to be out on the water.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences has made its mark on Great Lakes research. It’s the only graduate school of freshwater sciences in the country and one of only three in the world.\n\nUW-Milwaukee’s main research vessel, the Neeskay, is the only research vessel out on the lakes year-round.\n\nBefore the Neeskay started powering scientific expeditions in 1970, it was an Army T-boat used during the Korean War. Its name comes from the Ho-Chunk word for “pure, clean water.”\n\nScientists use the Neeskay to study algae blooms, invasive quagga and zebra mussels, and microbes that live out in the lakes. It’s also used to deploy buoys that monitor weather and lake characteristics, like temperature and nutrients.\n\nBut the Neeskay, along with a fleet of small boats, are only just the start. The university has been raising money since 2016 to build the Maggi Sue, which will become the most technologically advanced freshwater research ship in the country.\n\nThe Maggi Sue is expected to open many doors in understanding what’s going on out in the Great Lakes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe Bucks’ mascot has delighted crowds with dunks and stunts, from the Milwaukee Arena to the Bradley Center to Fiserv Forum, for almost 50 years.\n\nBango made his debut in the team’s 1977-78 home opener — which pitted the Bucks against the Los Angeles Lakers two years after NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left Milwaukee for L.A.\n\nNamed for the call the team’s original radio announcer, Eddie Doucette, made when players made a long-range basket, Bango was the moniker chosen by fans in a contest.\n\nIn the decades since, he’s gone through several makeovers and celebrated many milestones.\n\nIn 1984, he got his first car (it’s unclear whether he was old enough to drive; we’re not sure how deer aging equates here). He got married in 2002, and welcomed Bango Jr. in 2005. Two years later, Bango and Bango Jr. first appeared in their inflatable forms. 2010 was a big year for Bango: he nailed a few new dunks and was honored as the NBA Mascot of the Year.\n\nThe next few years brought more cervid celebrations: Cartoon Network’s “Most Awesome Mascot,” a human hamster ball dunk and a featured role on the Hulu “Behind the Mask” documentary. There were also a few mishaps along the way — a torn ACL and a broken rim during a Badgers halftime show.\n\nWhether he’s wearing a sweater or a full uniform with the number 68 (for the team’s first season), doing acrobatics on the court or making appearances in the community, Bango is Milwaukee’s most dominant deer.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nOne call, that’s all.\n\nIt’s not a particularly unusual slogan. Milwaukee isn’t home to the only law firm that has used it. But say those words around Milwaukee, and you’ll get immediate recognition, and probably a smile. Is it weird that simply saying the slogan or name of a personal injury lawyer, albeit a locally famous one, can cultivate ... joy?\n\nDavid Gruber, the lawyer in question, has been using the slogan in TV advertisements since the late 1990s, born from a collaboration with a Dallas media company.\n\nHe looks into the camera and punctuates every ad with those famous four words, a catchphrase that has become the dictum around which his entire brand has been constructed.\n\nThe celebrity lawyer can be found in the first few rows of Milwaukee sporting events and has partnered with just about every major sports operation in the city, a nod to his lengthy interest in athletics.\n\nAnd it’s not hard to score a “Gruber Law Office” T-shirt at a sporting event or at street fairs around the city, the perfect giveaway to spread the Gruber gospel and let everyone around you know how Milwaukee you are.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIn Milwaukee, the herald of winter’s thaw is not that growing patch of green on a lawn or the first magnolia blossom peeling open or that last crusty pile of parking lot snow.\n\nNo: It’s the first aroma of match meeting propane, that sizzle of cold meat on hot grates, the collective tower of smoke rising above the interchange at American Family Field.\n\nIt’s spring. It’s grilling season.\n\nYou don’t have to be the one grilling to enjoy its benefits. The first sunny day in March when it’s light past 5 p.m. — that’s when it happens. The first smells of a neighbor lighting charcoal and laying down some hamburger patties.\n\n“Someone’s grilling,” you say, and you smile.\n\nGrill smells permeate the air in Milwaukee from spring to fall. On a summer day, you can drive around with the windows down and you know when the neighbors are gathering. You can be sure there’s a cold beer in a koozy and the charcoal is heating up.\n\nAnd then there’s the tailgate, that communal grilling session. Many urban ballparks have parking garages or no parking at all, thus no opportunity to truly enjoy the baseball experience. But the tailgate endures in Milwaukee. On a sunny day (or rainy or snowy, we’re hardy people), the American Family Field parking lots are packed with canopies, games of corn hole and folding chairs all huddled around one thing: the grill.\n\n-Lainey Seyler\n\nAre you a “call an ace” player or a “picker and jack of diamond” player when you sit down at the sheepshead table? And if you don’t know what those phrases mean, you probably aren’t familiar with “leaster,” “re-crack” or “schmear.” To know the card game is to speak a certain kind of Milwaukee dialect.\n\nThe trick-taking game often features five players but has its share of variants, with different rules and terminology for different parts of the state. But this isn’t a pastime that’s achieved a high level of popularity outside the state’s borders.\n\nLike Milwaukee, sheepshead’s roots are deeply German — the game is Schakopf in its native country, and the unofficial history involves disgruntled peasants inventing the game that gave kings a lower ranking. Sheepshead arrived in Milwaukee with a large population of German immigrants, many of whom worked in brewing.\n\nThe card game’s patron saint, Bob Strupp, published “How To Play ‘Winning’ 5 Handed Sheepshead” in 1983. The lifelong Milwaukeean attended Common Council meetings to advocate that the game should be declared Milwaukee’s official card game, a campaign that proved successful.\n\nFor more than a quarter century, Glendale has claimed to serve as home to the largest sheepshead tournament in the world; a nurse from Kewaskum won in 2024.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere was a time when Milwaukee had earned the title as “The Bowling Capital of America.”\n\nEvolving from German “kegling,” German-Americans helped raise the game’s popularity in the states, and a city like Milwaukee with a deep German heritage was quick to adopt. But as nationwide popularity fell, Milwaukee’s bowling culture wasn’t ... well, uh, spared.\n\nThe United States Bowling Congress, which once called Greendale home, moved to Texas in 2008. The PBA Tour, once sponsored by Miller Brewing, stopped making the city a regular tour stop after 1990, bowling centers closed and WTMJ’s wildly popular “Bowling With the Champs” TV series, which made local celebrities out of top bowlers and served as a precursor to reality competition television, ended after 41 years in 1995.\n\nBut bowling’s history remains visible around the city and state. Milwaukee tavern The Holler House houses the oldest sanctioned bowling alley in the United States, and the miniature version of the sport still has a place at legendary Koz’s Mini Bowl, home to “the last duckpin bowling in the U.S.” The Vulcan Corporation in northern Wisconsin became a major manufacturer of bowling pins.\n\nAnd the PBA even returned for a stop in Wauwatosa in 2023.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIt’s the floor that made Milwaukee famous.\n\nDesigned for $27,500 by New York pop artist Robert Indiana — a man with the perfect name to match the flamboyance of the masterpiece — the MECCA floor was a controversial addition in 1977. The Milwaukee Exposition and Convention Center (known today as the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, but then abbreviated as the MECCA) served as home to the Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette men’s basketball team. Marquette basketball, known for its eclectic uniforms and the fiery personality of recently retired head coach Al McGuire, was the perfect match for the look.\n\nThe floor featured two giant Ms consuming either half of the court, somewhat hidden in the two-toned yellow paint scheme, a red bull’s eye at center court and blue lettering for “MECCA” wrapped twice around the center circle. Dark red for the lanes, dark blue for the sideline and dark green for the perimeter.\n\nThe gaudy floor didn’t quite fit everyone’s aesthetic tastes immediately (including new MU head coach Hank Raymonds), but it was a hit with plenty of fans (and Bucks coach Don Nelson). It became part of the Milwaukee color palette until the Bucks moved into the Bradley Center in 1988. The Bucks re-created the floor for a “Return to the MECCA” game in 2017, a return to the building that harbored the 1971 NBA champion and 1977 NCAA champion.\n\nIndiana rose to fame because of his “LOVE” sculpture, but the MECCA floor remains a distinctly Milwaukee concept.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere are many places around Milwaukee where you can take a drink of history, including many brewery tours.\n\nBut there is also a non-alcoholic option nestled between Wentworth Avenue and Superior Street in Bay View:\n\nThe Pryor Avenue Iron Well, a source of drinking water since 1882.\n\nOriginally drilled to provide drinking water and fire protection, it’s the last surviving public well in the city, according to the Historical Preservation Committee. The city named it a historic structure in 1987.\n\nWhile the well is just a short walk from Lake Michigan, the water actually comes from an aquifer nearly 120 feet underground.\n\nThe iron-rich water tastes a bit different than city water. The water is clear with a distinct metallic taste. Sometimes there might be a faint smell of sulfur.\n\nElevated levels of strontium, a natural element found in bedrock, were detected in 2015. But according to the EPA, the levels are only an issue for sensitive populations after drinking the water over the course of a lifetime.\n\nOverall the water is safe to drink, according to Milwaukee Water Works and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn fact, the well was a lifeline for many during the 1993 cryptosporidium outbreak that ravaged the municipal water supply.\n\nSo fill a jug or take a sip from the bubbler. Just ignore the penny-like metallic notes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe drive along the Hoan Bridge offers some of the best views of the Milwaukee skyline and Lake Michigan.\n\nAnd if the wind blows in the right direction, it’s also where you can get a good whiff of Milwaukee’s signature funky scent.\n\nNo, Eau de Milwaukee isn’t hops, brats or cheese curds. It’s Milorganite, a lawn and garden fertilizer made from our very own wastewater.\n\nThe Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District started making Milorganite – named after Milwaukee organic nitrogen – at the city’s sewage treatment plant on Jones Island in 1926.\n\nThe city used a new method to treat wastewater, called the activated sludge method, which mixed microbes with sewage and air to remove 95% of the bacteria from the city’s sewage and 90% of the solids.\n\nAfter wastewater enters the Jones Island Water Reclamation Facility, microbes are added that feast on the organic material. When the microbes die they settle to the bottom, leaving clean water above that is returned to Lake Michigan.\n\nWater is squeezed out of the microbes before they are dried and turned into pellets that become the nitrogen-rich fertilizer sold around the country.\n\nTurning this waste into fertilizer has kept 10 billion pounds of waste out of landfills since 1926, according to the sewerage district.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nA mark of Milwaukee’s annual celebration of Bastille Day, the 43-foot Eiffel Tower that appears each year in Cathedral Square Park is a testament to the city’s determination.\n\nThe tower has had to go through several rounds of repairs and reinforcement to keep up its yearly appearances. There have been a few years that an inflatable Eiffel Tower took the real one’s place, but it always returns, as it did in 2023 after a year of repairs.\n\nThe tower was initially built as part of an indoor department store display in the late 1980s, possibly in Minneapolis, according to a 2022 OnMilwaukee report.\n\nThe tower was never supposed to be permanent, and it definitely wasn’t meant to be assembled and disassembled each year for its appearance at the festival. But that won’t stop the tower, nor the organizers of the Bastille Day celebration, who are asking for donations to complete more repairs and restoration.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is far from the only French-themed activity of the weekend. There’s also the Storm the Bastille 5K run and walk, in addition to can-can dancers and plenty of French fare. The celebration is meant to honor the storming of the Bastille, the 19th-century French prison, an event that helped to start the French Revolution.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nGo into about any Milwaukee restaurant, tavern or even the corner bar on a Friday after work, and you’re likely to see diners enjoying fish alongside a classic Wisconsin Old Fashioned.\n\nThe crisp crunch of walleye, perch, cod or maybe even bluegill, paired with some type of potato, coleslaw, tartar sauce, a lemon wedge and perhaps a slice of rye bread.\n\nFish fries are actually so popular in Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers declared Feb. 16, 2024, as Friday Fish Fry Day, honoring the history of the meal. According to his proclamation, the fish fry became popular when a large population of Catholic European immigrants settled in Wisconsin in the 1800s and needed something meat-free to eat on Fridays during Lent.\n\nThen, during Prohibition, the meal helped to keep Wisconsin’s breweries and taverns alive, too, further cementing the tradition.\n\nToday, fish fries in Milwaukee and throughout Wisconsin serve as a weekly opportunity to gather with friends and family at your favorite establishment, catch up and swap stories over a plate of deep-fried fish.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nA piece of Milwaukee’s baseball history, Bernie Brewer’s Chalet was once one of the crowning jewels at County Stadium. Bernie Brewer would slide out of the chalet and into a giant stein of beer after every home run or if the Brewers won the game, setting the stage for celebration.\n\nNow, the chalet is a part of another popular Milwaukee stop: Lakefront Brewery. It’s a stop on the brewery’s tour through the facility, and now it can even be booked for a romantic dinner for two, overlooking the kettles of the brewery.\n\nLakefront Brewery was born in 1987 out of something distinctly Wisconsin: some 55-gallon stainless steel drums and used dairy equipment. Jim and Russ Klisch, the founders, sold one barrel of beer to a tavern within rolling distance of the brewery.\n\nLakefront has come a long way. Now housed at 1872 N. Commerce St., the brewery has produced as many as 46,848 barrels in one year (2017) and offers 20 different beers across 30 states, and even some other countries, according to the brewery’s website. The brewery also offers tours for over 80,000 people a year, and was the first to offer beer before, during and after the tour.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, this food item may repulse you – or at least make you do a double take.\n\nBut here in Milwaukee, it’s a delicacy.\n\nWe’re talking about the cannibal sandwich: a base of rye bread topped with fresh raw beef, chopped onion and a little salt and pepper. It’s deeply rooted in the state’s history and still enjoyed today.\n\nVersions of the sandwich also exist in Germany, where it’s called mett or hackepeter. The idea is thought to have been brought over by German immigrants to Wisconsin when they arrived and began to establish cattle farms, giving them easy access to fresh meat.\n\nToday, it’s still a popular tradition served during holidays and family gatherings — though not without a little scrutiny. Eating raw meat, after all, is a health risk. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reminded residents of as much in a 2020 tweet that went viral as those unfamiliar with the sandwich gawked.\n\nBut those who enjoy it are likely to keep paying homage to their heritage. Some Milwaukee delis and butcher shops sell thousands of pounds of high-grade raw beef around the holidays to eager customers.\n\nTasty or mildly terrifying, it’s one of the city’s cultural staples.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nIf you’re looking for a home away from home, look no further than Mr. Perkins Family Restaurant.\n\nWhile the fried chicken and collard greens are rave-worthy, the real showstopper at this 55-year-old establishment is the customer service.\n\nWhen the restaurant, located on the corner of West Atkinson Avenue and North 20th Street, opened in 1969, owners Willie Sr. and Hilda Perkins created a family feeling that brings in regulars and even politicians and celebrities like Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley.\n\nA staple for the Black community in Milwaukee, the restaurant serves comforting southern flavors that can be hard to find here in the Midwest.\n\nWhen Willie Perkins Jr. took over in 1999, he continued creating that feeling, filling customers in on the latest news about the Green Bay Packers and the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nWhen Willie died in 2010, his wife, Cherry, took over. Now, Cherry and a small team — her sister, her son and one other worker who might as well be family — continue the legacy, remembering regulars’ names and orders and creating community in addition to delicious food.\n\n-Zoe Takaki\n\nIt’s synonymous with Green Bay Packers fandom today, but the Cheesehead made its first appearance at a 1987 Milwaukee Brewers game — a completely, ahem, organic creation.\n\nThe legend is well-known now: Ralph Bruno went to his mother’s south-side Milwaukee home to help her reupholster a couch. When he took it apart, he thought the foam inside looked like cheese — so, naturally, he cut a piece into a triangle, burned some holes into it and spray-painted it yellow. It was a self-deprecating homage to an insult Wisconsin sports fans received from their neighbors in Illinois.\n\nTo Bruno’s friends’ surprise, the hats were a hit. So he made more, and sold them from a garbage bag at the next game he attended. That led to neighborhood retail sales and, eventually, the creation of Foamation Inc. — and a robust variety of Cheesehead variations including cowboy hats, baseball caps and koozies. The Packers acquired Foamation in 2023, solidifying the relationship just like a good curd.\n\nOver time, the Cheesehead has inspired song parodies and been featured in a Lil’ Wayne tribute to the Green & Gold (er, Yellow). It’s been worn or displayed by famous figures including George W. Bush, Jodie Foster, Phoebe Bridgers and John F. Kennedy Jr. And despite Chicago Bears fans’ efforts to shred them with their answer — the Graterhead — Cheeseheads are here to stay.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nTwo parallel metal tracks stretch across the roads in downtown Milwaukee, soaking up the heat of the summer and the frost of the winter. You wait a bit, a streetcar the length of two buses slides slowly toward you.\n\nYou wonder if it’s automatic, running robotically and beeping like that, until you see a conductor in the front seat and you let out the breath you’d been holding — it will stop at traffic lights and behind cars. On the side of the car golden letters read in all caps: “THE HOP.”\n\nThe Hop is a fixed-transit network that gives a ride to more than 1,000 people a day, going to various destinations in downtown Milwaukee. Its route stretches from Veterans Park to Milwaukee Public Market and expanded to the lakefront in spring 2024.\n\nThe Hop is a relatively new addition to the city, having started running in 2018. But it’s a continuation of a long history of streetcars in the city — the first electric streetcar started giving rides in 1890 and for decades was the primary form of transportation.\n\nToday, The Hop has become a staple of downtown life, whether or not you ride it.\n\n-Eva Wen\n\nIf Milwaukee was going to have a mountain, it’s fitting that that mountain would be made of the thing that keeps the city moving during its cold, icy winters: road salt.\n\nAlong with the pungent aroma of Milorganite, the gigantic salt piles are likely what most Milwaukeeans associate with the city’s Jones Island, once home to a commercial fishing village of Polish immigrants.\n\nToday, the island holds tens of thousands of tons of road salt delivered to the Port of Milwaukee for use in melting icy streets, highways and interstates across Wisconsin.\n\nIn recent years, concern has grown about excess road salt washing off of streets and into nearby bodies of water, including Lake Michigan.\n\nRoughly 2.2 billion pounds of chloride (a component of road salt) flush into the lake each year, according to a December 2021 study. And while the size of the lake helps dilute the salty pollutant, smaller tributaries aren’t so lucky. In the Milwaukee River basin alone, for example, over 100 miles of waterway are impaired by chloride, some with levels several times that which can be toxic to fish and aquatic life.\n\nMany municipalities and private businesses, including some in the Milwaukee area, have made adjustments to reduce their salt use in the name of protecting freshwater, including brining, where salt is mixed with water before being applied to roads.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nA Milwaukee sub sandwich staple, Cousins Subs began in 1972 when cousins Bill Specht and Jim Sheppard opened their first shop at 60th Street and Silver Spring Drive to “bring their favorite style of sub sandwich from the East Coast to their new hometown of Milwaukee,” the company’s official story reads.\n\nCousins offers classics like the Italian Special, Pepperoni Melt and Tuna, plus specialties like Wisconsin Cheese Steak. And in Milwaukee, Cousins stands apart from national sandwich chains — not only for its local roots but its very-us offerings like Wisconsin mac and cheese, shakes and fried cheese curds.\n\nThe Cousins sandwich — carrying the slogan “Better bread. Better subs” — is so popular the company had to cancel a free sub promotion in early 2024 when restaurants couldn’t keep up with the overwhelming response.\n\n-Erik S. Hanley\n\nWouldn’t you like to go to Orlando in mid-February? Not for Disney, but for the greenery, the smell, the sense that things are alive.\n\nThat’s what you’ll find in the Tropical Dome — where you can sit in the sun with a book in hand, no matter the season. Roll up your sleeves, find a bench and relax.\n\nIn contrast, if you’re always too hot, the Desert Dome stays 50 degrees through the winter. If you have kids with you, think Show Dome and occasional choo-choos.\n\nThe three beehive-shaped Domes, aka Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory, sometimes seem the forgotten child of Milwaukee attractions. They’re fighting for their future. Yet even the common name – Domes – has a Milwaukee humility about it.\n\nWith more than 1,800 plant species, cleverly described with signage, the Domes are worth a walk.\n\nSince Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the Domes in the fall of 1965, other accolades have followed. In 2017, the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave “National Treasure” status to the Domes.\n\nAnd the Domes have a characteristic that Milwaukeeans love: They’re cheap.\n\nThe priciest admission costs $9, and parking is free, unlike at the stadium, the zoo, or almost the entire downtown.\n\n-Pete Sullivan\n\nBratwurst. Polish. Italian. Hot Dog. Chorizo.\n\nBrewers fans have been cheering for one sausage or another during their race at the bottom of the sixth inning for more than 30 years. What started as a cartoon competition on a County Stadium scoreboard made its way to Miller Park (now American Family Field) as a treasured Milwaukee tradition.\n\nThe real-life Racing Sausages debuted June 27, 1993, and gave rise to live-action mascot races throughout Major League Baseball, such as racing presidents and pierogis. The idea to take the links from the scoreboard to the field came from Michael Dillon, who worked as a graphic designer with McDill Design at the time, and their first appearance was a surprise to almost everyone in the ballpark.\n\nThe matchup of 7-foot-tall encased meats was sponsored by Klement’s until 2018, when Johnsonville took the reins.\n\nThe sausages have had their ups and downs over time. Among the wurst: In 2003, then-Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Randall Simon whacked the Italian Sausage with a bat, causing the Hot Dog to tumble as well. Both finished the race, thanks to an assist from the Polish (the Bratwurst won). There was also the time in 2013 that the Italian Sausage’s casing (er, costume) was stolen (and ultimately returned) in Cedarburg. A few years later, Hot Dog took a tumble and brought Chorizo and Bratwurst along with him. And as recently as the team’s 2024 season opener, Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton narrowly missed being taken out by Bratwurst.\n\nNo matter the wiener, Milwaukee will always love its Racing Sausages.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nLegend has it George Webb first predicted Milwaukee’s baseball team would win 12 games in a row back in the 1940s – and maybe even hinted that his namesake restaurant would give out free hamburgers to celebrate the winning streak.\n\nDecades passed before his prophecy came true, but in April 1987, the Milwaukee Brewers finally pulled off the feat – and some 168,194 people lined up outside George Webb Restaurants for free burgers. It’s hard to describe how big of a deal it was to those who didn’t experience it firsthand, but trust us, there are few things us frugal Wisconsinites love more than free stuff. Combine that with baseball and burgers, and it basically felt like a street festival.\n\nWhile most people ate their free burgers, some decided to save the historic freebies for posterity. One man even had his bronzed for his father. Others threw theirs in basement freezers, only to find them decades later. (This reporter would like to apologize to her older brother, Paul, for throwing out his 20-year-old frozen burger instead of bronzing it.)\n\nThe Brewers did it again in 2018, and for only the second time in Milwaukee history people lined up to celebrate and claim their free burgers.\n\nEven when it’s not promising free burgers, George Webb is a beloved burger joint open 24 hours a day. Still, any long Brewers winning streak definitely starts to feel like a free-burger watch party.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nBob Uecker didn’t sign a broadcasting contract with the Milwaukee Brewers until 2021.\n\nBefore then, it was handshake agreements with owners Bud Selig and Mark Attanasio.\n\nUeck tries not to take himself too seriously. It’s part of the reason why he is such a revered figure among Americans, specifically Milwaukee natives and Brewers fans.\n\n“Mr. Baseball” being the butt of the joke is why the “Uecker seats” named in his honor are considered the best worst seats in baseball. “I must be in the front row,” Uecker said to a stadium usher in a mid-’80s Miller Lite commercial who told him to move to where his ticket was located — way up high.\n\nUecker seats used to be sold for as little as $1, but there was a catch: Fans would need to wait hours before first pitch at the box office to get their hands on the tickets, and the seats were less than desired — up in the nosebleeds with an obstructed view, but near Uecker’s statue.\n\nUecker, 91, has been speaking into his microphone for the Brewers radio broadcast since 1971. He wouldn’t want to hear it, but his mic serves as a symbolic gold standard for not only sportscasters but also the entertainment figures we allow into our living rooms.\n\nHe’s been a regular guest on “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,” hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 1984 and had roles in Hollywood films — his delivery of “Juuust a bit outside” in the 1989 cult classic film “Major League” (filmed at County Stadium) endures today.\n\nUltimately, the reason he finally signed a contract with the Brewers was because he lost benefits from the Screen Actors Guild.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nWhen she was a teenager, UW-Milwaukee professor Chia Youyee Vang remembers how her mother and aunt wrapped a long, purple cloth into a turban around her head. Then decorated with a black-and-white striped ribbon, it was one piece of the elaborate traditional clothing Vang would wear to celebrate the Hmong New Year.\n\nToday, the phuam txoo suab is more hat than headwrap. It’s often sold pre-wrapped, and it might be embroidered with silver coins or shiny beads. At annual New Year celebrations at Wisconsin State Fair Park, it’s a common headpiece for girls and women.\n\nThe headwrap’s evolution parallels Milwaukee’s Hmong community in some ways. Today’s young generation fuses American culture with the traditions of their parents and grandparents, who fled Laos as refugees in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nOlder immigrants worry about language and culture fading. But they also see their descendants blossoming: earning degrees, running businesses and buying homes in neighborhoods across the area.\n\nMilwaukee County is home to about 13,000 Hmong, census data shows. That’s nearly one-third of all Asian residents in the county.\n\nLike the Germans, Poles and Italians before them, the Hmong have made their mark on Milwaukee. The ways they’ll express and share their traditions with the city will only become more intricate as their roots deepen.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nOpening a box of Italian cookies from Peter Sciortino Bakery has an undeniable sweetness – like a mix of happy family memories and buttery goodness.\n\nSince Peter Sciortino and his wife, Grace, opened the bakery in 1947, it has grown into a beloved fixture on Brady Street. It opened just one year after Glorioso’s Italian Market, another legendary business that still calls Brady Street home. Both first became institutions as Italians began moving north from the Third Ward to the east side neighborhood decades ago, and have since become a tradition for families throughout Milwaukee.\n\nThe aroma of fresh-baked bread and cookies typically surrounds Peter Sciortino Bakery, and inside, cannoli is made fresh with each order.\n\nLuckily the cookies are sold by the pound, so there’s no need to choose between cimino, biscotti, amaretti, chocolate mezza luna, or any of the other varieties – just make sure you get a big enough box to try as many as possible.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nWhere Russell Avenue meets Superior Street in Bay View, an understated brown sign pays homage to one of the most significant sites in Milwaukee’s history: a 19th-century iron mill where a march for an eight-hour work day turned deadly.\n\nThe historical marker recalls the events of May 5, 1886: the Bay View Massacre.\n\nThat year, labor organizations nationwide were demanding an eight-hour work day, and they wanted it by May 1. Many Milwaukeeans were working 10-hour days, six days a week for paltry wages, Milwaukee historian John Gurda noted in his book “The Making of Milwaukee.”\n\nAs companies balked at the demand, strikes grew. By May 3, about half of Milwaukee’s men were on strike, Gurda found. They marched through the city, urging more workers to join them. Panicked officials called in militia from across the state after police were unable to “quell the disturbance,” the Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\nOn May 4, tension mounted at the Bay View mill where executives refused the eight-hour demand. Militia forcefully dispersed a crowd of protesters.\n\nOn the morning of May 5, about 1,500 marchers returned to the mill. When they were about 200 yards out, the militia fired. Among the seven dead was a 12-year-old boy.\n\nThe next day, streets were deserted. Local officials conferred about how to prevent “socialistic agitation,” deciding to arrest as many demonstrators as they could, the Journal reported.\n\nLabor leaders, meanwhile, had public opinion on their side. They turned their focus to winning elections.\n\nThat year, the labor-backed People’s Party of Wisconsin won elections up and down the ballot, with priorities including progressive taxes, child labor restrictions, and arbitration of labor disputes, Gurda wrote. While socialist leaders initially supported that party, they later split and ran their own candidates, launching Milwaukee’s socialist era in 1910.\n\n-Rory Linnane\n\nYou just moved to Milwaukee. You are sitting in your bungalow in Bay View and staring at the blank walls. You are a full-fledged grown-up, so those leftover posters from your college dorm don’t cut it anymore.\n\nFor generations, the Milwaukee neighborhood posters have provided an easy and classy way to decorate your new space. They were unveiled in 1983 by the City of Milwaukee’s Discover Milwaukee program, with colorful, eye-catching artwork by Jan Kotowicz of local landmarks, like the lower east side’s Oriental Theatre and Washington Park’s bandshell. Wait, what is Pigsville? Thankfully, local historian John Gurda provided illuminating text on the back of the posters about each neighborhood. The posters even popped up in “Wayne’s World” to lend authenticity to Alice Cooper’s Milwaukee-centric cameo.\n\nBest of all, the posters follow the egalitarian spirit of the city. The original run of 21 neighborhoods initially cost just $2 apiece. Now there are 39 options available from Historic Milwaukee, Inc., including one with all the neighborhoods, for only $10. There’s no excuse for those blank walls.\n\n-Ben Steele\n\nAmerica’s Black Holocaust Museum is the first and only museum of its kind in the U.S. It’s an unflinching look at more than 400 years of slavery, dehumanization, lynching and mass incarceration of Black Americans.\n\nThe dream for the museum began as a small collection in Dr. James Cameron’s basement. In 1930, when he was 16, Cameron narrowly survived a lynching in Marion, Indiana. He spent the rest of his life in Milwaukee collecting photos, artifacts and books that shed light on the histories of African Americans. He regularly welcomed guests into his home to learn this history.\n\nThe museum moved to its first official location in the Sultan Muhammad Islamic Center. Its grand opening was Juneteenth Day in 1988.\n\nCameron passed away in 2006. The museum subsequently moved buildings and briefly closed, and now resides at 401 W. North Ave., part of a redevelopment project in the heart of Bronzeville called the Griot — a West African term for “storyteller” — in honor of Cameron.\n\nThe museum starts in Africa in 300 CE, long before Europeans arrived, and ends with issues impacting Black people today, like police brutality and mass incarceration — covering the 16 generations of slavery in the U.S., reconstruction, 100 years of Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA tree with branches stretching along the ceiling pays homage to the powerful song “Strange Fruit,” made popular by artist Billie Holiday, that fearlessly protested the widespread lynchings of Black Americans.\n\n-Gina Castro\n\nPabst Brewing Co. shut down its Milwaukee operations in 1996. But the huge “Pabst” sign that’s stretched far above West Juneau Avenue for several decades has remained a constant — even as the former brewery was redeveloped over the past decade or so into offices, housing, a craft brewery and other new uses.\n\nThe sign is attached to an iron footbridge that is anchored by Pabst’s former malt house, now The Malt House apartments, and the old brew house, now the Brewhouse Inn & Suites. The glowing red sign has undergone repairs in recent years, with the iron bridge’s restoration being completed this spring, according to Erin Stenum, manager of the neighborhood improvement district at the former Pabst complex, now known as The Brewery. Ein Prosit!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nThe soundtrack to most city parks includes the ping of a bouncing basketball, the tinny reverb of a faraway stereo or the sizzle of a grill fired up for sausages.\n\nYou’ll hear those at Burnham Park, too, but there’s another layer to the score: the soothing hum of a handful of taco trucks parked just outside, and the chatter from hungry hoards waiting in the wings for a carne asada taco, a lengua huarache or a cooling horchata on a hot summer night.\n\nThese food trucks are part of the fabric of Burnham Park. Beyond the neighborhood, the south side is dotted with family-owned fleets carrying specialties all their own, parked on Historic Mitchell Street, West Lincoln Avenue, West Becher Street and across the neighborhoods tucked in between.\n\nYou could stop at one to satisfy a craving or you could go on a full expedition, grabbing an al pastor taco shaved straight off the spit at La Guelaguetza (go on Wednesdays to nab ’em for a dollar each), head to Marta’s Tamales Food Truck for a juicy pambazo dipped in red pepper sauce, and finish at Isa’s Ice Cream for a creamy scoop of mango or passionfruit nieve de garrafa to round out the night.\n\nThey’re the tastes of the neighborhood and the passion from a piece of Milwaukee with undeniable flavor all its own.\n\n-Rachel Bernhard\n\nThey only surface for one week.\n\nBut for that one week, they’re everywhere.\n\nThey are the ribbons worn by Northwestern Mutual agents during the company’s annual gathering in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nEach summer, the Milwaukee insurance and financial services company brings more than 12,000 employees and agents together for a week of meetings and events; ground zero is usually the Baird Center and Fiserv Forum, but they can be seen all over downtown.\n\nAnd every agent wears a nametag lanyard with attached ribbons denoting sales goals achieved, landmarks passed, accomplishments reached.\n\nSome agents have two or three ribbons. A few sport a ribbon that goes down to the floor.\n\nTo outsiders, the ribbons might look like scout badges or sashes from a secret society — swag from a party they weren’t invited to.\n\nTo the agents, the ribbons are an expression of how far they’ve come in the business — and where they rank among their colleagues. After the week’s meetings are over, they’re put away.\n\nIn a way, they’re like cicadas: They swarm the city for a brief period, and then they’re gone.\n\nBut we know they’ll be back.\n\n-Chris Foran\n\nJust over a year after moving to Milwaukee, I arrived at Wolski’s Tavern with a singular goal: Get that damn sticker. You know the one. The ubiquitous capital-letter “I CLOSED WOLSKI’S” sticker plastered on dive bar bathroom walls and 20-somethings’ water bottles.\n\nEven if you don’t know what Wolski’s is, exactly, it’s still likely you know about the stickers. The fantastic marketing strategy has worked wonders for the more-than-a-century-old bar.\n\nWhen we arrive that night, we sit outside despite the evening’s light rain. I find myself tiring long before 1 a.m. But the lure of the sticker provides energy as the night goes on.\n\nAs 2 a.m. passes, a man urinates off a tree-shielded wall and an employee yells it’s time to go. A sloppy early-20s crowd, a few stray middle-age folks and I begin to filter inside. The crowd lingers, holding glass beer mugs and Miller High Lifes.\n\nTen minutes later, another call to leave rings out. This time, people form a line to a door guarded by a young doorman holding a stack of stickers. One in front of me doesn’t take it, but later reverses her decision. The doorman teases she can’t have one, and receives a kiss on the cheek when he concedes.\n\nI give him a nod and thank-you, taking my prize.\n\nI closed Wolski’s — now I just need to find where to put the sticker. Any ideas?\n\n-David Clarey\n\nIn Milwaukee, seemingly every component of the gooey globules known as cheese curds — pieces of young cheese that during the cheesemaking process become separated from the whey — is as malleable as the cheddar itself.\n\nA simple scan of the city’s pubs, bars and even fine-dining restaurants is evidence of an oft-repeated Wisconsin stereotype: It’s the cheese curd capital of the world. And per usual, Milwaukee isn’t going to skimp on the party.\n\nRestaurants generally buy fresh curds of white or yellow cheddar — in rarer cases, mozzarella or pepper jack — before adding their own personality via batters, sauces and names. Milwaukeeans take pride in experimenting with curd coatings: they might be buttermilk-battered, pancake-battered, beer-battered, honey lager-battered, Lakefront Riverwest Stein-battered, or slathered in an ambiguous “house-made batter.”\n\nThose curds are then “fried up squeaky clean” (at the Wicked Hop), turned into “mini explosives” disguised as curds (at Safehouse Milwaukee), or transfigured into “little pillows of cheesy heaven” (at Joe Mama’s Bar). Many restaurants serve up half-pound portions; some, like Steny’s, offer a full pound of cheese.\n\nNotably, the Journal Sentinel didn’t come across any menus advertising curds served with ketchup. But various varieties of tomato, like marinara sauce and tomato jam, made appearances. Many menus experiment with ranch varieties like buttermilk, garlic, chipotle or jalapeño, or specialty sauces like buffalo blue cheese aioli, maple syrup, Bloody Mary buffalo, or sweet and spicy pineapple.\n\nAs Brothers Bar and Grill puts it, the final step is up to you: transporting the morsels “from the cheese curd capital of the world to your mouth!”\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nRyan Putskey isn’t fazed by calls to the Oriental Theatre asking if “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is “appropriate.” Or, calls telling him it’s not.\n\n“To be fair, it can be kind of graphic. But, I mentioned this to the cast — it’s been like this for probaby 40 years,” said Putskey, the theater’s longtime caretaker.\n\nA quick Google search confirms the historic East Side theater gets national kudos for its longstanding commitment to Rocky Horror. In some tellings, the Oriental takes the crown for the longest single run of the movie since its release in 1975.\n\nPutskey humbly said that’s a point of contention: the Oriental’s tradition dates back to January 1978 — before its rival for Rocky Horror longevity, the Clinton Street Theater in Oregon — but has logged fewer individual shows.\n\nRegardless, Rocky Horror devotees consistently show up for the movie and live stage performance at midnight on the second Saturday of each month to call out virgins in the audience and throw toast at the stage. They never tire of watching the transformation of an under-sexualized engaged couple, Brad and Janet, as they wander into a castle and are soon seduced by a mad scientist from the planet Transsexual and his Frankenstein-esque creation, Rocky.\n\nThose details aren’t unique to Milwaukee. But the Oriental’s minaret towers and lioness statutes add an otherworldly, in-person touch to the celebration of madness, weirdness and sexuality that demands to be taken seriously.\n\n“You’ll consistently be there with — and I say this will all due respect to all of them — a bunch of weirdos,” Putskey said.\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nNobody has to be from Cleveland to know that the city has been the subject of more than a few one-liners over the years.\n\n“Attention Cleveland, your river is on fire!”\n\nOr ...\n\n“In Cleveland, Velveeta cheese can be found in the gourmet section of the supermarket.”\n\nBut here’s a burning question, why did Cleveland become the butt of a zinger of a gag in Milwaukee’s Bay View, of all places?\n\nIn 1978, while having lunch with his assistant, now retired photographer and artist Mark Gubin decided to have some fun with air travelers flying into Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport.\n\nRealizing that low-level planes coasted over his studio and home (the former Bay Theater) in the path of a runway, he painted “Welcome to Cleveland”on his roof.\n\nWas there any specific reason behind the Cleveland tomfoolery, these 6-foot high letters that have given more than a few air travelers an uneasy, eerie (or Erie) feeling?\n\nNope, it was just Gubin’s wicked sense of humor, the right time to welcome visitors to the wrong place.\n\n“I never did it as any kind of thing to help my business or anything like that. It was just plain madness. You need that in the world,” Gubin told former Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl in 2015.\n\nThe internet, cyberspace and social media have helped Gubin’s prank reach a sort of rock star quality.\n\nNow 46 years later, the gag certainly hasn’t gotten old … it’s still flying.\n\n-Emmett Prosser\n\nIn the 1980s, many members of the Forest County Potawatomi tribe lived in poverty.\n\nNo more.\n\nToday, members of the tribe receive tens of thousands of dollars in dividends.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe Potawatomi Casino in the Menomonee River Valley happened.\n\nWhen it first opened around 1990 at 1720 W. Canal St., the facility was a large bingo hall with a few hundred slot machines of questionable legality and little outside regulation.\n\nThe tribe’s reservation is in northern Wisconsin, making the Milwaukee casino the nation’s first off-reservation tribal casino. The land where the casino is located is believed to have once been a Potawatomi village, according to a Milwaukee Public Museum history of the tribe.\n\nIn its initial years, the tribe shared its gaming revenue with the Indian Community School and a non-Indian management company. Those deals have since expired.\n\nToday, the casino is a major Milwaukee tourist attraction and an unmissable part of the city’s skyline. It rakes in more than $400 million in gambling winnings a year. A chunk of those winnings goes to members of the tribe in the form of per-capita payments estimated to be more than $70,000 per member.\n\nThe gambling hall draws nearly 6 million visitors a year and the 784,000-square-foot casino offers a range of ways to win or lose money, including about 3,000 slot machines, sports book, craps and a variety of table games including poker and blackjack.\n\nAnd since 1999, The Forest County Potawatomi Foundation has donated about $75 million to Milwaukee-area nonprofits, according to a spokesperson for the tribe.\n\n-Cary Spivak\n\nDo you know where you were in 1880?\n\nThat’s a trick question — you were surely not born, but if you were, you could’ve been among the first to munch on some of the finest sausage to come out of Milwaukee at that time.\n\nLuckily, you still can enjoy it. That’s because Usinger’s Famous Sausage has stood the test of time since founder Fred Usinger moved to Milwaukee from Germany and started his own successful sausage shop in 1880.\n\nIn the nearly century and a half since, the company has grown to have a wide shipping network while retaining its beloved place in Milwaukee, with its vintage-style building, tasty and bountiful meats and a rather helpful staff. Don’t forget about the storied elves — prominent in local advertisements and in the deli’s window displays, the company touts them as the invisible makers of its beloved sausage.\n\nUsinger’s sausage earned a spot in the Milwaukee Public Museum’s Streets of Milwaukee exhibit and in an episode of “Top Chef.” There’s even an annual Fred Usinger Day on Feb. 23.\n\nPerhaps a 1980 ad in the Milwaukee Journal put it best: “In 1880, Milwaukee got its first electric street lights, its first native mayor, and its first taste of Usinger’s sausage. It was a very good year.”\n\nIt was a very good year, indeed. And, thankfully, those tastes have continued for 144 years.\n\n-David Clarey\n\nWisconsin’s oldest continually operating gay bar wasn’t always easy to spot. When June Brehm opened This Is It! at 418 E. Wells St. in 1968, Milwaukee’s LGBTQ+ scene operated under the radar, and closeted patrons made use of the bar’s rear entrance to avoid being identified.\n\nToday, This Is It! welcomes patrons with a concrete facade adorned with a diamond pattern in the colors of the rainbow.\n\nDrag superstar and Wisconsin native Trixie Mattel became a co-owner with George Schneider in 2021.\n\nNot only is This Is It! a Milwaukee institution — it’s one of the country’s oldest LGBTQ+ bars. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin recognized Brehm and her son Joseph for their contributions to Wisconsin’s LGBTQ+ community, and the bar became the site of the Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project’s first permanent public display in 2019.\n\n“This Is It! is not Milwaukee’s favorite gay bar, it is Milwaukee’s favorite bar,” Mattel said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “Everyone in town has a personal story or anecdote, or sometimes even a night they can barely remember. The exterior has rainbow accents that invite all walks of life into the space, and remind people to come in and act right. It reminds people that even if you’re homophobic, not in this (expletive) building you’re not.”\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nA symbol of Milwaukee’s proud brewing history, bottles of Miller Lite can be seen in the hands of drinkers at dive bars and tailgates across Milwaukee.\n\nIt’s probably the most ubiquitous of the Miller beers — Miller Chill, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller High Life and Miller 64 Extra Light — in a town where the Miller name still looms large (literally — the large red Miller sign can be seen by anyone driving into downtown from the west on Interstate 94).\n\nIn 1973, Miller Brewing bought a low-calorie “Lite” brand of beer from Chicago-based Meister Brau Inc. and turned it into what’s now known as Miller Lite. From there, the company advertised the beer with the help of sports stars like Mickey Mantle, John Madden and Bob Uecker with the popular line “Tastes great … less filling.”\n\nToday, Miller Lite and other Miller beers are under the MolsonCoors’ list of brands.\n\nIn 1996, Miller acquired the naming rights to the Milwaukee Brewers’ yet-to-be-built stadium, which opened in 2001. It was called Miller Park until the naming rights agreement expired in 2020 and American Family Insurance took over, renaming the stadium American Family Field.\n\nBut naturally, Miller Lite can still be found for sale at the stadium during Brewers’ games.\n\n-Alec Johnson\n\nCathedral Square is home to many summer festivals.\n\nThere’s Jazz in the Park, Bastille Days and the dazzling Christmas tree display that wash Cathedral Square in lights at night.\n\nBut on the corner of Kilbourn and Jackson stands a metal plaque that marks a little-known event that occurred more than a century and a half ago. Passersby rarely stop to note the significance of that historical marker, erected in 2001 by the Wisconsin Historical Society.\n\nIt tells the story of Joshua Glover, an escaped slave from Missouri. Glover found refuge and freedom in Wisconsin until he was captured and jailed under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. His imprisonment stirred nearly 5,000 anti-slavery demonstrators who stormed the Milwaukee County Jail — which stood on present-day Cathedral Square — to break Glover out on March 10, 1854.\n\nBut Glover was still a wanted man.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act called for the recapture of freedom seekers or escaped slaves like Glover to be returned to their owners. Glover was on the run for years fearing recapture by his slave owner, a man named Benammi Stone Garland.\n\nWith the help of Wisconsin’s Underground Railroad, a network of safehouses manned by abolitionists who offered safety and shelter to runaway slaves, Glover eventually made his way to Canada and to freedom.\n\nGlover’s story is also depicted on a mural on the I-43 overpass on Fond du Lac Avenue.\n\n-LaRisa R. Lynch\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. visited Milwaukee at least twice. Now, Milwaukee honors King’s legacy with a statue in the historic Bronzeville neighborhood.\n\nKing’s first recorded speech in Milwaukee was in August 1957 at the Grand Avenue Congressional Church, now the Irish Cultural & Heritage Center on West Wisconsin Avenue.\n\nHe returned during a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement in January 1964, where he spoke to over 6,000 at the Milwaukee Auditorium (now the Miller High Life Theatre).\n\nIn the biggest showing of support for King, an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people marched on Milwaukee just a few days removed from his assassination. The march was considered the largest civil rights demonstration in the city’s history.\n\nKing’s Milwaukee sculpture is located at North King Drive and West Vine Street. The sculptor, Erik Blome, once said he hoped to capture King animated as if he was giving a speech.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nHow things have changed.\n\nMarquette won the NCAA basketball trophy on March 28, 1977, with a 67-59 victory over the North Carolina Tar Heels, which sent students streaming down Wisconsin Avenue in an impromptu party-parade to the lake.\n\nUnder the brash, colorful (and quotable) Coach Al McGuire, the team – which famously took its team photo in tuxedos while sitting in a classic car – had captured the attention of the city, and the nation.\n\nThe teams were unseeded — it was the last year before teams came into the tournament with a ranking. And the term “March Madness” — describing the unpredictability of upsets and bracket busters — was not widely used until the ’80s.\n\nIt was legendary coach Al McGuire’s last game leading Marquette. He came into the game with a 25-7 record, after sneaking into the tournament, to the Tar Heels’ 28-5 record.\n\nOne of McGuire’s key strategies was to not give North Carolina any lead. If they led, the Tar Heels were sure to do the dreaded Four Corners Offense, a “stall offense” where the players would pass the ball to kill time.\n\nThe teams could take 10 minutes for one possession — there was no 30-second shot clock to keep the game moving. There was no 3-point line.\n\nDespite the fact basketball was played so much differently then, it is still remembered each year when Marquette plays in the NCAA tourney — as the only time Marquette men’s basketball won it all.\n\nIf anyone needs any reminding, the original trophy is in the Walk of Champions display at Marquette’s Al McGuire Center.\n\n-Cathy Kozlowicz\n\nCue the “Happy Days” theme song. The Bronze Fonz, a life-size statue that pays tribute to Arthur Fonzarelli, is a pillar of the city’s downtown RiverWalk.\n\nThe set-in-Milwaukee sitcom ran in the ’70s and ‘80s, but Fonzie — played by Henry Winkler — remains a beloved Brew City icon.\n\nVisit Milwaukee had spearheaded an effort that raised $75,000 for the statue, and artist Gerald Sawyer brought it to life. The statue arrived in 2008 with a lot of fanfare, including a parade, the king of cool himself, other castmates and the stars of “Happy Days” spinoff “Laverne & Shirley.”\n\n“It is a great honor,” Winkler said in a previous Journal Sentinel interview. “You cannot be blase about that, no matter how much time goes by.”\n\nWhen the statue disappeared to undergo routine maintenance a couple years back, it caused quite the stir. About 40 people attended a ceremony marking its return.\n\nWant to see the Bronze Fonz for yourself? It’s located on the east side of the RiverWalk just south of Wells Street. And while you’re there, you might want to snap a pic. The statue is one of the city’s most selfied landmarks.\n\n-Hannah Kirby\n\nTomatoes are just one of the many vegetables you’ll find planted at Alice’s Garden, one of the city’s best-known community gardens, on the city’s north side at North 21st Street and West Garfield Avenue.\n\nBorn out of an abandoned highway project, the 2-acre garden is located along a larger, 3-mile corridor where entire blocks of houses were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the Park West Freeway. The project cut through the city’s west and north sides, displacing several thousand residents and disrupting the community’s economy. Ultimately, the highway was never built, largely because of sustained neighborhood opposition. In its wake, large swaths of empty land were left.\n\nOut of that empty land sprang Alice’s Garden, now a thriving community garden and gathering place. The garden is there to reconnect city residents to the land and to oft-lost traditions of growing fresh, healthy food.\n\nGardeners come from all ethnicities and cultures, and their plots often speak to their heritage. In a Native American’s garden might be corn, beans and squash, known as “the three sisters” for how they are planted close together, for mutual benefit. A Black gardener might grow black-eyed peas, collard greens and okra in homage to past ancestors.\n\nNot only is the garden a place to cultivate food, but also relationships. Walking paths lined with herbs invite visitors for a stroll. Kids race across the grass or sit on picnic blankets for monthly storytimes. The pavilion shelters people sharing fellowship and a meal.\n\n-Sarah Volpenhein\n\nOne sign that summer is here in Milwaukee is the volleyball nets going up at Bradford Beach. Once the weather gets nice, it’s common to see people of all skill levels bumping, setting and spiking at the city’s largest beach during the afternoons and evenings pretty much any day of the week.\n\nFrom late May until September, the beach is home to more than 30 volleyball nets. The nets are currently managed by Volley Life, a local company that organizes beach volleyball clinics, tournaments and leagues.\n\nIn 2016, the beach hosted the USA Volleyball Junior Beach National Championships, and, at the end of this summer, it will host the Badger Region Beach Championships.\n\nBut, you don’t need to be a former high school volleyball star to join in on the summer fun.\n\nVolley Life has multiple leagues nearly every day of the week encompassing skill levels from those just learning the game to experienced players competing for prize money. When leagues are not playing, nets are open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nThe nickname “Cream City” might make some think of milk.\n\nBut Milwaukee’s popular moniker does not stem from the dairy or beer typically associated with Wisconsin. It has to do with brick.\n\nLook around and you’ll see them. The light-colored, yellowish bricks are the main material in a number of old buildings across the city: the former Schlitz brewery, Holy Trinity Church (now known as Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church), the Woman’s Club of Wisconsin and other industrial buildings and row houses.\n\nThe so-called cream city bricks were first used in the Milwaukee area in the 1830s. The material came from a clay found in the Menomonee River Valley filled with magnesium and lime. When put to fire, the clay produced a yellowy, cream-colored brick.\n\nThe bricks were widely exported and made it to major U.S. cities like Chicago and New York. But they remain a distinctly Milwaukee look and give the state’s largest city its name: Cream City.\n\n-Lawrence Andrea\n\nA hidden gem in Milwaukee’s premier lakefront property, Lake Park, is a 2,000-year-old ancient Indigenous burial mound.\n\nIt is a large conical mound about 40 feet in diameter and 2 feet high overlooking Lake Michigan near Lake Drive and Locust Street.\n\nThe mound was built by Indigenous people during what archaeologists call the Middle Woodland Culture between 300 B.C. and 400 A.D.\n\nMilwaukee was once home to hundreds, or even thousands, of these ancient mounds, but they were destroyed by development. The Lake Park mound is the last one left in the city.\n\n-Frank Vaisvilas\n\nFew signs bring as much joy as the one that reads “MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MARKET.”\n\nThe large red neon sign hovers above the market’s west entrance, beckoning to passersby and serving as a de facto billboard for downtown and the Third Ward. It glows at night, and casts a shimmering reflection even on the rainiest of days. Get off that concrete freeway, it tells visitors. (Who among us hasn’t driven past the sign and wondered why they’re still on I-794 instead of walking through the public market, stopping by the lakefront, or visiting one of the city’s many festivals?)\n\nThe sign alone has basically become a local landmark. And the market itself, which opened in 2005, is a sleek space full of natural light and packed with local vendors selling an impressive range of goods – including cheese, spices, wine, fresh fish on ice, flowers, chocolate and Milwaukee merch.\n\nThe Milwaukee Public Market sits at the corner of what was once known as Commission Row, a stretch of Broadway that was once packed with Italian fruit and v", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/23"}]}

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/10/24/self-checkout-good-bad/71219910007/", "title": "Is self-checkout worth it? The pros and cons for retailers, shoppers", "text": "Julie Domina loathes self-checkout.\n\nThe 50-year-old real estate agent says they glitch too often and worries the technology is making checkout more difficult for the elderly and visually impaired. And while she’s used to dealing with unmanned kiosks during trips to larger chains like Walmart and Albertsons, she’s disappointed to see them popping up at the local grocery store in her hometown of Newcastle, Wyoming, a town of just over 3,000.\n\n“They just aggravate me,” Domina told USA TODAY, adding, “If I'm going to be checking myself out, I want to get a discount because that means you're not paying an employee to check me out.”\n\nAlthough opinions on self-checkout are mixed, many retailers are leaning into the technology. Some Kroger supermarkets are operating entirely via self-checkout. Kohl’s earlier this year announced plans to add self-checkout kiosks to 250 stores. And fast-fashion brands like Zara are rolling out self-checkouts at select stores.\n\nBut other chains appear to be reconsidering their approach, with certain stores removing the technology or staffing up self-checkout lanes to prevent theft. The shift comes amid reports that raise questions about just how much value self-checkouts bring to retailers and shoppers.\n\n“Different industries have different responses from consumers (on self-service),” said Ron Larson, a visiting associate professor of economics at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. He noted that it works great in certain areas like pumping gas, but “just because it works in one industry doesn't mean that's going to work in others.”\n\nThe shift to self-checkout\n\nWhile self-checkout technology has been in supermarkets since the 1980s, usage surged during the pandemic, when retailers were struggling to hire and customers wanted less human interaction. The share of transactions through self-checkout lanes hit 30% in 2021, almost double that from 2018, according to data from the Food Industry Association.\n\nThe technology has been viewed as a way to lower labor costs and improve efficiency by taking up less space than manned checkout registers, according to Neil Saunders, managing director of the analytics company GlobalData. And while some shoppers despise the tech, others prefer it and believe it's a faster alternative – even if there’s little data to support that.\n\nOther customers “do not want to interact with a sales associate so they can have a hassle-free experience,” said Hanna Lee, assistant professor at the University of South Carolina’s Department of Retailing.\n\nBut there are also concerns.\n\nFailures aren’t uncommon with the devices, despite their high price tags. And while self-checkout is meant to help cut down labor costs, this has yet to pan out in the data.\n\nAlbertsons, which started installing self-checkouts in nearly all stores in 2019 after giving up on self-checkout nearly eight years prior, had an employee-to-supermarket ratio of nearly 118-to-1 in 2019, according to figures in its annual report. By February 2023, that ratio had increased slightly to about 128 workers per store.\n\nIn 2012, as Kroger was adding more self-checkout devices in its new stores, the supermarket chain had a ratio of about 139 employees per store compared to 158 per store as of January. At Target, the ratio as of January was about 226 employees per store, compared with 190 per store in early 2016.\n\nAlbertsons and Kroger did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFederal data also shows that the number of cashiers in the country has remained largely unchanged over the last decade, although the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects a 10% decline by 2032.\n\n“I think many companies believe they've saved their money with self-checkout, but it’s going to vary by store. And the stores that have tried to go all the way, I think they've realized that it’s not a good idea,\" Larson said. \"The key is to give people an option.”\n\nTheft concerns around self-checkout\n\nSelf-checkout kiosks are also known to contribute to shrinkage – an industry term for missing inventory from theft, broken items, administrative errors and other factors.\n\nRetailers have been sounding alarms on shrink recently, with a number of companies putting the blame on a spike in organized retail crime. Self-checkout isn't often brought up as a concern, despite data that shows it can have an effect on shrinkage.\n\nA 2018 report authored by Adrian Beck, emeritus professor at the University of Leicester's Department of Criminology and academic adviser to the ECR Retail Loss Group, found that stores with the average number of self-checkout machines could expect to see shrinkage losses 31% higher than the industry average, and those relying on an above-average number of unmanned kiosks could see shrink rates 60% higher.\n\n“Retail businesses, and their partners, need to rebalance their assessments of the benefits that can accrue from investing in (self-checkout-related) technologies,” the report reads.\n\nWhile some losses may be from people using self-checkout to steal, others are from user errors by customers who weren’t trained to use the machines. Maybe the shopper didn’t notice that an item didn’t scan before bagging it, or keyed in the wrong item when weighing their produce.\n\n“There's a combination of mistakes and genuine fraud,” Saunders said, who believes self-checkouts are responsible for \"some of the rise in theft. Certainly not all of it.”\n\nCompanies reconsider self-checkout strategies\n\nSome companies seem to be reconsidering their self-checkout strategies.\n\nWalmart has started removing self-checkout at select stores. Costco has started asking staff to crack down on checking membership cards in self-checkout lines, with Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti in September noting that inventory shrink had increased by a couple of basis points \"in part, we believe, due to the rollout of self-checkout.\" And Target is testing self-checkout lanes limited to 10 items or fewer at select locations \"in order to reduce wait times and better understand guest preferences,\" according to spokesperson Brian Harper-Tibaldo.\n\nWalmart and Costco did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis isn’t the first time companies have backtracked on self-checkout. Kmart removed self-checkout kiosks in 2003 due to machine costs and theft rates. Costco also removed self-checkout in 2013 and Albertsons announced plans to remove it in 2011 (although both companies have since reintroduced self-checkout).\n\nExperts who spoke to USA TODAY said they expect to see more companies turn to self-checkout, but warned that retailers should be careful not to wipe out manned registers altogether.\n\n“I think that the prevailing wisdom right now is to give consumers a choice,” Larson said. “The strengths that supermarkets have had in the past is they've been able to have some human interaction. I think they’re realizing they need to keep that, at least for customers who really appreciate that.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2024/01/12/sams-club-uses-ai-at-exit/72201366007/", "title": "Sam's Club announces it will stop checking receipts and start using ...", "text": "Sam's Club announced it will start using artificial intelligence to scan receipts at its store exits.\n\nSam’s Club chief merchant Megan Crozier introduced the new feature during a keynote speech at CES 2024, the Consumer Electronics Show, in Las Vegas.\n\nThe exit technology will resolve the \"key member concern\" of waiting in long lines at its store exits, Sam's Club parent company Walmart said in a news release on Thursday.\n\nCES 2024 Walmart announcementsMore drone deliveries, new AI tech: Here's a guide to what Walmart unveiled at CES 2024\n\nCrozier said the company plans to include the feature in its nearly 600 stores across the country by the end of 2024.\n\n\"We aspire to be the most convenient place to shop,\" said Crozier during the presentation.\n\nThe American chain tested the technology at 10 stores – nine in the Dallas metro area and one in Joplin, Missouri, reported Retail Dive.\n\nSam's AI system uses 'computer vision, digital technology'\n\nThe new exit system, which Retail Dive said was built by in-house Sam’s Club engineers, will use \"a combination of computer vision and digital technology\" to capture images of a customer's cart at the exit to verify if the the items in it were purchased, according to the company.\n\n\"Now it's one thing to enable this easy kind of exit tech in a small footprint store for a handful of items,\" Crozier said. \"But we're doing it at scale.

Now it's in revolt", "text": "Pharmacists with the nation’s largest retail pharmacy chain felt dangerously burned out.\n\nIt was August 2020. The pandemic was in full swing, straining an already weary workforce hit by a decade of relentless budget cuts and rising demands.\n\nOne by one, the pharmacists dialed into a weekly conference call with their boss. He could have empathized with them or addressed the reality of their pressure-cooker environment – one that breeds medication errors and creates missed opportunities to prevent potentially deadly mistakes.\n\nInstead, CVS District Leader Khalil Haidar turned up the heat. He harped on his Texas-and-Louisiana-based team to hit corporate quotas: Sell more store memberships. Push for more prescription pickups. Vaccinate more people. He threatened discipline and staff cuts unless pharmacists convinced at least five customers that week to get a flu shot before flu season had even officially started.\n\n“If you get your goal, nobody will come after you,\" Haidar said on the call, one of several recorded and shared with USA TODAY. \"And many patients, they are ignorant. They don’t know what the flu is ... How are you going to convince them? How can you persuade them? That’s your job as a pharmacist.”\n\nPharmacists take an oath to hold patient safety in the highest regard when preparing and dispensing medication. But rising pressures inside the nation’s largest retail chains have forced pharmacists to choose between that oath and their job.\n\nThe situation was bad before the pandemic. COVID-19 made it worse. It has only gone downhill since then. Frustrations boiled over this autumn in a series of high-profile walkouts that left a string of CVS and Walgreens pharmacies shuttered or short-staffed. Those actions might have caught consumers off guard. But inside the troubled industry, it was the clarion call of a beleaguered workforce pushed to the brink.\n\nCorporations like CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and Walmart have consistently slashed pharmacy staffing levels while simultaneously saddling their frontline workers with a burgeoning list of additional duties.\n\nStores that a decade ago might have had two pharmacists and six pharmacy technicians filling an average of 500 prescriptions a day now may have half the staff and an even higher prescription volume – plus an endless crush of vaccine appointments, rapid tests and patient consultation calls.\n\nEvery task is timed and measured against corporate goals that reward speed and profits. Staff who do not fill prescriptions fast enough, answer the phones quickly enough or drum up enough vaccination business can face discipline, reassignment or termination.\n\nPharmacists said it’s nearly impossible to meet all the demands without cutting corners, and when corners get cut, patients can get hurt.\n\n“The public’s health is in danger,” said Oklahoma City pharmacist Bled Tanoe, who quit her job at Walgreens in August 2021 over what she considered unsafe staffing levels and an emphasis on hitting corporate targets. “The incidents of error are multiplied by infinity.”\n\nUSA TODAY interviewed four dozen current and former retail pharmacists from different chains across the nation and spoke with industry leaders, patient advocates and patients harmed by pharmacy errors. Many pharmacists spoke to USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs.\n\nThe media organization also reviewed more than 100 emails from chain pharmacists sharing their concerns; inspected internal emails, text messages, metric score sheets and coaching notes; and listened to more than five hours of recorded conference calls.\n\nThese interviews, audio recordings and documents – along with dozens of pharmacist workplace surveys, task force studies and state board of pharmacy reports – add up to a prescription for disaster.\n\n“I could cry as to what’s happening in my profession,” said Daniel A. Hussar, a professor and dean emeritus at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, where he taught for 52 years before retiring in 2018 to focus on his family and his blog, The Pharmacist Activist.\n\nHussar lamented the transformation of a once-vaunted career into the equivalent of a fast-food job whose workers are pressured to upsell every customer and race through every order. Mistakes in that environment are not only common, he said, they’re potentially fatal.\n\n“At corporations like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Rite Aid – the huge pharmacies – errors are a cost of doing business,” Hussar said. “I don’t think the boards of pharmacy or the colleges of pharmacy or the professional associations are doing enough to address the issues.”\n\nFor years, pharmacists have reported these problems to their state boards, complained to their professional organizations and warned the media. The New York Times wrote about how the dangerous workload imperils patient safety just before the pandemic hit U.S. shores.\n\nPromises were made and broken – documented by pharmacists themselves in state surveys that followed.\n\nIn California, 91% of chain pharmacists surveyed by the state Board of Pharmacy in 2021 said they lacked the staff needed to ensure adequate patient care. More than half of pharmacists polled by the Kansas Board of Pharmacy in 2022 said they didn’t feel they could perform their jobs safely; the biggest reasons cited were a lack of adequate staffing and employer-imposed metrics, like filling a specific number of prescriptions a day or providing service to customers within a set time.\n\nHundreds of pharmacists in Ohio responded to a 2020 callout from their state board about the toll of their workload on patient safety in a report made public in the next year.\n\n“I feel a mistake is breathing down my neck as I try to manage all the tasks that I am asked to perform,” one wrote. Another said they had left the profession because “the environment was set up for me to fail.”\n\nState regulatory bodies overseeing pharmacies have for years refused to intervene. Their role is mainly to protect consumers, not pharmacists, and they traditionally considered many of these complaints – staffing, metrics, workload – outside their purview. They were seen as business decisions, not consumer safety issues, said Karen Winslow, interim executive director of the Virginia Pharmacy Association.\n\nThat’s starting to change, but not without a fight.\n\nOhio proposed a series of rules this year aimed at improving pharmacy working conditions. Among them: A ban on quotas and requirements for sufficient staffing. The rules are currently pending a vote amid overwhelming support from pharmacists and opposition from retail pharmacy chains, including Walgreens and CVS.\n\n“The Board should stay focused on the regulation of the practice of pharmacy rather than the business of pharmacy,” wrote CVS Director of Regulatory Affairs John Long in opposing an early version of Ohio’s rules last year.\n\nVirginia passed emergency regulations in late September also banning production quotas and bolstering pharmacy staffing. Those rules are in effect until March 2025, giving the state time to develop and pass more permanent measures.\n\nEnforcing these rules could prove challenging. California, one of the first states to outlaw pharmacy production quotas and mandate minimum staffing, is coping with routine violations by retail pharmacies that then fail to provide records to inspectors seeking to verify complaints, state Board of Pharmacy minutes show.\n\nProfessional associations, meanwhile, have earned their members’ scorn for hosting workshops on resiliency rather than advocating for better working conditions. Many pharmacists told USA TODAY they feel like no one stands up for them.\n\nThat, too, is starting to change. In the wake of the CVS walkouts last month, the new head of the American Pharmacists Association, the industry’s largest professional organization, flew to Kansas City to meet with the organizers and committed to more aggressive leadership on these issues.\n\n“The APhA has been focused on longer-term fixes, and what we’ve heard loud and clear is we need to focus on the acute problems,” said Michael Hogue, the association’s chief executive officer and executive vice president. “That’s what we’re going to do.”\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and Rite Aid for comment.\n\nRepresentatives of CVS and Walgreens generally acknowledged the challenges their pharmacists have faced in recent years but denied allegations of dangerous working conditions. They said goal-based metrics on measurable objectives such as quick prescription turnarounds, short telephone hold times and vaccination volumes are standard within the industry and meant to assess quality rather than penalize staff.\n\nCVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and Walmart all emphasized their commitments to patient safety and described their various efforts to continually reduce error rates.\n\n“Patient safety is our highest priority,” Amy Thibault, CVS Pharmacy’s lead director of external communications, told USA TODAY. “Our more than 30,000 CVS pharmacists approach this responsibility with seriousness and dedication and we work hard to earn the trust of our pharmacy patients.”\n\nCVS, Walgreens and Walmart also said they have invested in new technologies to streamline services, increased wages to better recruit and retain staff, and rolled out new initiatives to support their teams and reduce their workloads.\n\nThe major chains now provide half-hour lunch breaks for staff. Many also recently announced reduced pharmacy hours at locations nationwide. Walmart spokesman Tyler Thomason said reduced operating hours promote a “better work/life balance.”\n\nBut pharmacists told USA TODAY their workloads remain the same and that they’re pressured to work through lunch and stay late to finish everything. At locations where hours were cut, many pharmacists said, they’ve seen their salaries decrease accordingly.\n\n“I’ve given the company thousands and thousands of dollars in free labor,” said a CVS pharmacist who was on Haidar’s team during the pandemic-era conference calls. “Our bosses can log into the computer any time and tell how far behind we are. They will send group texts and say, ‘I see you’re trending behind. What are your plans to finish it tonight?’ Very intimidating comments. You fear for your job all the time.”\n\nHaidar, who now leads a different team, told USA TODAY the recordings must have been altered and that he never threatened staff with discipline for falling short of vaccination goals. He also said they are not an accurate depiction of his leadership. When asked if he would like to listen to the recordings, Haidar declined.\n\nMichael DeAngelis, CVS’ executive director of corporate communications, said it is not the company’s “policy or practice to penalize pharmacy teams regarding the number of vaccinations they administer” and that it “is committed to compensating our colleagues appropriately for the hours they work.”\n\nDeAngelis also said CVS recently reduced its pharmacy metrics by 50%, but he declined to provide additional details.\n\nWalgreens announced last year the complete elimination of performance-based metrics, the only major chain to have taken such a step. But interviews with pharmacists and documents provided to USA TODAY show the company continues to push staff to hit unrealistic goals.\n\nOne Walgreens pharmacist said she was reprimanded earlier this month for taking too long to verify prescriptions, even though her extra diligence had caught several serious mistakes.\n\nAccording to notes from her coaching session, shared with USA TODAY, she should take less than 30 seconds to verify the accuracy and appropriateness of every prescription, in addition to checking for potential problems like drug allergies or interactions.\n\n“I pray every day that I don’t miss something or cause a patient harm,” said the Tennessee-based pharmacist, who estimates she handles several hundred prescriptions daily. “I feel guilty knowing that I would want someone to double check the math on a prescription of antibiotics for my child, but I don’t have time to do that for their child.”\n\nMedication errors: A pharmacist's worst nightmare\n\nMedication errors are a pharmacist’s worst nightmare. Many told USA TODAY they lie awake at night wondering if, in their haste, they made a mistake that might hurt or kill someone.\n\nIn May 2021, that someone was Brenden Fisher.\n\nThe Sarasota, Florida, child overdosed on a newly prescribed anti-seizure medication after the CVS pharmacy near his home dispensed the drug with the wrong instructions on the label.\n\nBy the third dose, Brenden was lethargic, dazed and struggling to breathe. His parents, Paris Bean and Jason Fisher, rushed their then-2-year-old to the hospital, thinking he was dying.\n\nHospital staff didn’t know what was wrong with him, Bean recalled, until a nurse asked if he was taking his 1.2 ml of levetiracetam twice daily.\n\nWhen Bean told her the instructions said to give him 7.5 ml, “you could almost hear her jaw drop,” Bean recalled. “She said, ‘Did you give that to him?’ And I said, ‘Yes. Is that why we’re here?’ She said, ‘I wouldn’t be surprised.’”\n\nBrenden still suffers from a full-body tic he first developed during the incident, his parents said. Dozens of times a day, he will suddenly stop whatever he is doing, clasp his hands together, clench his jaw and tense every muscle in his body while staring off into space. Each episode lasts anywhere from 5-10 seconds.\n\nHis parents haven’t been able to definitively link the tic to the overdose, but they said they have no other explanation for it.\n\nAnti-seizure medications like levetiracetam depress the central nervous system, Hussar said. Because nerves tell muscles when to contract and relax, he said, there could be a connection between the overdose and Brenden’s involuntary muscle contractions.\n\nBean said she blames CVS for the mistake but also herself: “I’m the one who physically administered it ... I could have killed him.”\n\nCVS declined to comment on the error.\n\nBean and her husband filed a lawsuit against CVS in February that was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. But they said they did not file a complaint with the Florida Board of Pharmacy.\n\nThat means it’s one of countless errors for which there’s no official tally or public record.\n\nDespite a widespread industry belief that medication errors are on the rise as a result of unsafe working conditions, there is no reliable or comprehensive public data to prove it.\n\nNo federal agency requires pharmacists to report medication errors, and few state boards of pharmacy mandate it. Many pharmacies and pharmacy chains track errors internally but do not share the numbers with the public. CVS and Walgreens both declined to share their data with USA TODAY.\n\n“There really is no way of knowing how many errors are actually out there,” said Larry Selkow, a retired California pharmacist who recently served on the American Public Health Association’s task force on pharmacy medication safety issues.\n\nThe group estimated U.S. pharmacies annually make 54 million dispensing errors, of which 2.3 million are potentially harmful. It recommended the establishment of a national pharmacy reporting system to collect data on errors and their underlying causes. Having such information, Selkow said, would allow pharmacies to adopt practices to prevent future mistakes.\n\nNumerous pharmacists told USA TODAY that errors are not consistently reported – even internally. Small mistakes and those caught early are routinely hidden.\n\n“Some pharmacists don’t report it especially if they’ve already had, like, five errors that year,\" said Shane Jerominski, a California pharmacist who worked for both Walgreens and CVS. \"For every error that gets found out, there will be an error that never gets caught.\"\n\nEven when they do report potentially fatal errors, some pharmacists said, no one from their companies investigates how they occurred or makes changes to prevent them from repeating.\n\nA former CVS pharmacy manager at a short-staffed, high-volume store in Georgia said he was horrified when one of his patients who was prescribed Bisoprolol for high blood pressure accidentally received a sleeping aid called Belsomra and got sick after she started taking it.\n\nThe pharmacist, who now works for Walmart, said he had hoped the error would be a wake-up call for higher-ups who might finally give his store adequate staffing. It didn’t work out that way.\n\n“They had me do that little report, but my manager, nobody ever followed up,” he said. “They were like, ‘OK, cool, see if she would like a gift card, and we’ll handle it from here.’ And that was it. It’s like they could care less. Like it didn’t even happen.”\n\nCVS did not comment on the incident, but Thibault said that the company’s first priority when it learns of any error is the patient’s safety. She said it then takes steps to correct the error and learn from it. Walgreens said in a statement that it’s mandatory for employees to report errors under the company’s “Continuous Quality Improvement Program.”\n\n“We take any prescription error very seriously and have a multi-step prescription filling process with numerous safety checks to minimize the rare chance of human error,” said Marty Maloney, Walgreens’ senior manager of media relations.\n\nPharmacists are personally liable for medication errors and risk fines, discipline and loss of license if investigated and found responsible by their state board. Many told USA TODAY they get little or no support from their company when mistakes happen, even if the conditions imposed by those companies contributed to the error.\n\nThe Nevada Board of Pharmacy in September fined and suspended the licenses of two CVS pharmacists who accidentally gave a pregnant woman the abortion drug misoprostol instead of the fertility treatment she was prescribed. The mistake, which was first reported by 8NewsNow in Las Vegas, ended the woman’s pregnancy.\n\nThe Nevada board also fined CVS $10,000 over the objections of company attorney William Stilling who argued CVS itself did nothing wrong.\n\n“The only allegation” against CVS, Stilling said, “is that they had these pharmacists.”\n\nPharmacy benefit managers played role in the current crisis\n\nRetail pharmacy wasn’t always this bleak.\n\nTwenty years ago the industry was thriving. CVS and Walgreens were opening new locations at a rapid clip. New pharmacy schools popped up to meet the needs of a profession in high demand. Meanwhile, Americans’ appetite for prescription drugs was soaring.\n\nIndependent and chain pharmacies alike were earning relatively healthy profits from drug sales and could afford to hire and retain enough staff to keep their operations humming.\n\nA constellation of factors contributed to the industry’s downturn. They include rising drug costs, changing consumer habits and the emergence of online pharmacies.\n\nBut none looms larger than the outsized influence of pharmacy benefit managers. These third-party administrators of health insurers’ prescription drug programs have eroded the profits of retail pharmacies to the point where they now lose money on many sales.\n\n“In today’s world, 7 out of 10 medicines dispensed by a pharmacy are dispensed at a loss,” Hogue said, referring to the non-generic drugs that represent pharmacies’ largest expense.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers, commonly referred to as PBMs, act as a middleman between the insurers, the drug manufacturers and the pharmacies. They negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, determine which drugs will be covered by insurance plans and set reimbursement rates for pharmacies that buy and sell the drugs.\n\nAs the power of PBMs rose over the years, they demanded bigger rebates from drug manufacturers and pocketed increasingly bigger shares of those savings instead of passing them along. They also lowered pharmacy reimbursement rates and tacked on hefty fees known as Direct and Indirect Remuneration.\n\nThe three largest PBMs – ExpressScripts, owned by Cigna; CVS Caremark, owned by CVS Health; and OptumRx, owned by the same company as UnitedHealthcare – control a majority of the market.\n\nWhile PBMs’ collective profits skyrocketed over the past decade, their tactics plunged retail pharmacies into financial distress and left them scrambling for alternative sources of revenue, like vaccinations, to stay afloat.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry last year into PBM practices, which have already been the subject of several lawsuits.\n\nIndependent pharmacies have been hit especially hard. Not only are their reimbursement rates lower than those of chains, but their patients have been steered away by PBMs that insist they use a preferred chain pharmacy instead.\n\nCharles Thompson, a pharmacist and independent owner of Grove Park Pharmacy in Orangeburg, South Carolina, said he has lost countless customers who were told by their PBMs to use CVS and Walgreens instead. Between that and the lower reimbursements, he said, Grove Park had to diversify to stay open. It now offers an in-store medical clinic, hospice services and medical equipment rentals.\n\n“If I had to rely only on filling prescriptions,” Thompson said. “I would be out of business.”\n\nOther independent pharmacies simply closed. The United States has lost more than 3,500 mom-and-pop pharmacies in the past decade, according to data from the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents independent pharmacies.\n\n“The independents have been the canaries in the coal mine,” said B. Douglas Hoey, chief executive officer of the National Community Pharmacists Association.\n\nNow the chains are following suit. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid all recently announced the closure of hundreds of pharmacies as they face slumping revenues and the fallout from multiple lawsuits for their alleged roles in the nation’s opioid crisis. Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy earlier this month.\n\n“It’s all coming home to roost,” Hoey said of the PBMs’ unchecked power and their practice of steering patients away from the independents and into the chains. “It has overloaded the system, and also that corporate mentally of just, ‘we’re going to work the workers to death,’ I think that’s coming home to roost, too.”\n\nPharmacists bleeding, crying, working alone\n\nLike the metaphorical frog boiling in the pot, Wendy Lear said she didn’t realize how bad her job at CVS had gotten until there were so few staff left that she was forced to work alone, even when she had no business being behind the pharmacy counter.\n\nLear’s stint with CVS started in 2009 when the chain bought the independent pharmacy where she worked in Lexington, Kentucky. The transition was dramatic but initially tolerable, Lear said, because CVS retained enough pharmacists and technicians to meet the patients’ needs.\n\nBut that changed over the years as CVS whittled away its staff while heaping more work upon the few who remained.\n\nOne time, Lear recalled, she went to work while miscarrying her first child because her boss couldn’t find anyone to cover her overnight shift and begged her to go in. Bleeding, cramping and emotionally distraught, Lear said, she fielded phone calls and filled prescriptions until she had to lie down on the floor.\n\nAnother time when she was sick with norovirus and vomiting in a trash can behind the pharmacy counter, Lear said, she was asked to keep working until her boss could find someone to replace her. Lear toughed it out for two hours before texting her boss for an update.\n\n“Any word???” she wrote. “I can’t stay here. I am so sick. I am going to have to close.”\n\nHer boss texted back, instructing Lear to have the store manager take care of patients in her absence.\n\n“That’s illegal,” Lear told USA TODAY of her boss’ request. “You have to have a pharmacist on premises to sell prescriptions. She was so frustrated I had to go home, and, it’s like, you have to have contingencies for when people fall ill during their shift.”\n\nEventually, Lear said, the demands of the job became too intense and the risk of errors too great – especially during solo shifts – that she quit CVS in 2021 and found a new job at an independent pharmacy, Remington Drug Co., in northern Virginia.\n\n“Answering phone calls, taking prescriptions at drop off, entering those prescriptions, verifying once, filling those prescriptions, verifying twice, running the register, giving vaccinations, making metric-monitored phone calls, all fell on one person,” she said of her job at CVS. “In a double-check system, who’s checking me? This is when patient safety is most compromised.”\n\nDeAngelis told USA TODAY it is not CVS’ policy or practice to require staff to work when they are ill.\n\nBut retail pharmacists from CVS and other chains across the country shared similar stories of corporate pressure and severe burnout:\n\n“All day long stuff’s blowing up and management is yelling at us because we can’t answer the phones fast enough and we’re not giving enough immunizations,” said a current Walgreens pharmacist in Arizona. “I’ve seen pharmacists cry back in the pharmacy because it’s so busy.”\n\n“This situation has slowly worsened, but the big turning point was when we started giving COVID shots,” said a current Walmart pharmacist in Iowa. “One day it was just me there, and I did 77 COVID shots.”\n\n“There was not a single week where I didn’t work 80 hours, but I was only paid 42,” said a former CVS pharmacist from Virginia. “We were behind on prescriptions the entire year. I was begging, ‘please can we get more hours?’ Instead, corporate would suggest we do these overnighters to get caught up.”\n\nThousands of retail pharmacists left the industry during the first two years of the pandemic, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which reported a 6% drop in employment numbers between 2019 and 2021.\n\nAlthough those numbers have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, the latest data shows, overall interest in the profession has nosedived, raising questions about the future of pharmacy.\n\nApplications to U.S. pharmacy schools plummeted nearly 70% from their peak in the fall of 2009 to the fall of 2021, according to the most recent data published by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. Those schools, which graduated nearly 15,000 students a year at their peak, are expected to produce just 11,000 new pharmacists annually by 2025, Hogue said.\n\nStuart Beatty, dean of Ohio Northern University’s Raabe College of Pharmacy, said his school is facing the same enrollment slump despite efforts to recruit students and reassure them of a bright future.\n\nIf he and his academic peers can’t reverse the tide, he said, the nation soon could face a severe pharmacist shortage.\n\n“It makes sense. Why would you go into a doctoral degree when all this is happening?” said Janan Sarwar, a Louisville-based pharmacist, publisher and career coach. “They want to help patients. They don’t want to enter a profession that oppresses their ability to help and do good in the world.”\n\nMistakes like this are why pharmacists say they're leaving\n\nShelby Richards blames chronic pharmacy understaffing for the medication error that cost her thousands of dollars.\n\nThe Memphis Walgreens she frequented was always “busy, low staffed, lines out the door,” Richards said, including the day in March 2021 when she retrieved a newly prescribed anti-anxiety medication to treat panic attacks after a car wreck.\n\nInside the bottle were two sizes of round, white pills. Richards said she assumed they were different doses of the same drug because her doctor had mentioned wanting to start her on 5 mg of Buspar before increasing it to 10 mg.\n\nSo she started taking the smaller of the two pills, not realizing it was a different drug altogether – a calcium channel blocker called amlodipine to treat high blood pressure.\n\nWithin days, Richards said, she began to feel nauseous, light-headed and her legs were swelling – all common side effects of amlodipine. Uninsured, she racked up $15,000 in bills from three hospital visits as doctors tried in vain to determine the cause, records show.\n\nIt wasn’t until her boyfriend took a closer look at her medication and noticed the different-sized pills that she had an answer.\n\n“I told her it … should always be a separate bottle,” said her now-husband Taylor Richards, who researched the two pills online and learned the one she had been taking was the highest dose of amlodipine available.\n\nThe couple called Walgreens to report the error and said they were dismissed without an apology. They tried to sue but missed the state statute of limitations, so they filed a complaint with the Tennessee Board of Pharmacy, which they provided to USA TODAY.\n\n“It seems like their staff is working like slaves,” Taylor Richards said. “There are usually two people back there, and it’s probably one of the busiest pharmacies around. I imagine they’re requiring them to fill so many prescriptions that it will continue to cause these types of errors.”\n\nWalgreens declined to comment on the error.\n\nPharmacists, meanwhile, said it’s a prime example of how working conditions put patients at risk and why so many of them are quitting the profession altogether.\n\nIt’s also why dozens of pharmacists recently walked out recently in protest. Another walkout is planned for Oct. 30-Nov. 1. Pharmacists are calling it Pharmageddon.\n\n“The primary reason is our concern for public safety,” said Corey Schneider, one of the CVS pharmacists who participated in the Kansas City walkout. “It’s also about basic decency. Pharmacists shouldn’t have to cry at work or go home worried that they made a mistake.”\n\nA few, like Tanoe, have funneled their frustration into advocacy. The former Walgreens pharmacist launched a public campaign in 2021 around the hashtag #PizzaIsNotWorking to highlight the dangerous working conditions that gestures such as free pizza from corporate won’t fix.\n\nSince then she has connected with thousands of retail pharmacy workers through her Facebook page, LinkedIn account and the online pharmacist advocacy community, RPhAlly, of which she is the vice president. She also helped organizers of the recent CVS and Walgreens walkouts share their messages and recruit participants and supporters.\n\nTanoe said it’s time the state pharmacy boards, professional organizations and corporate owners take these concerns seriously. If not, she said, the nation will see fewer pharmacies, fewer pharmacists and more incidents of patient harm.\n\n“For so long we have been told our patients come first – no matter what you do, your patient comes first,” Tanoe said. “Now, we are saying, no. We come first. We hold our patients’ lives in our hands. If we’re not well, they’re not well.”\n\nEmily Le Coz is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team.

Know your rights | CNN Business", "text": "The abrupt and unceremonious way that thousands of Twitter employees got laid off last week was a spectacle.\n\nBut it was also a helpful reminder that while employers can get rid of many workers at will (and with zero graciousness), employees are not without rights when they are laid off en masse.\n\nHere’s a quick primer on what employees need to know.\n\nHow much advance notice should I get?\n\nFor a plant closing or a mass layoff, you should get at least 60 days notice, under the federal Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. Some states may require more notice – New York, for instance, requires 90 days. And states also may set stricter standards than the federal law, such as requiring employers with fewer workers to comply with the WARN Act.\n\nIf an employer is found to have violated the WARN Act, in addition to paying penalties to the state, it will be required to pay out up to 60 days (or more, depending on the state requirement) of back wages and benefits to those laid off, depending on how many days’ notice the company actually gave.\n\n“Notice” in this instance means notifying the community at large but also each individual who will be laid off, said employment attorney Michael DuPont, who is managing shareholder at the Minnesota-based law firm Wagner, Falconer & Judd and also provides legal services through LegalShield.\n\nIf a company lays you off abruptly, it may be found to have complied with the WARN Act so long as the effective date of your layoff is at least 60 days after the day you got notice that you’re being let go, said employment attorney Alex Granovsky, cofounder of the New York-based law firm Granovsky & Sundaresh.\n\nTechnically you will remain on the company’s payroll and will continue to receive pay and benefits in the interim, and then any severance you’re given would kick in.\n\nHow much severance am I entitled to?\n\nUn-fun fact: No law – federal or state – requires employers to offer you any severance when they lay you off, unless you have a union or individual employment contract that includes a provision for it.\n\nThat said, many employers do offer some form of severance to protect themselves from any potential legal claims you might bring as a result of your employment or termination.\n\nA second reason many offer severance: “Good will and fairness to the employees and to the community as a whole. To offer additional compensation in recognition of the potentially tough time the employee and community would [experience],” DuPont said.\n\nWhat do I give up in exchange for accepting severance?\n\nAn employer will want you to waive certain rights in exchange for money.\n\nPut bluntly, “the company covers itself in every way a former employee can hurt [it],” Granovsky said.\n\nGenerally speaking you will waive your right to bring a claim against the company, such as discrimination, hostile work environment, pay violations or any other alleged wrongdoing.\n\nYou also typically will need to agree to several clauses that prohibit you from harming the company, he said. They include:\n\nA confidentiality clause: This clause prohibits you from sharing details of the company’s business or even the terms of your severance agreement.\n\nA non-disparagement clause: This prohibits you from badmouthing the place.\n\nA cooperation clause: You agree to assist the company if it gets sued in the future over a matter that you know something about as a result of your tenure there.\n\nA non-cooperation clause: This prohibits you from helping anyone else trying to sue the company.\n\nA non-solicitation clause: This typically means you can’t poach your soon-to-be former employer’s clients or employees should you start working elsewhere or launch your own business.\n\nWaiving these types of rights does not, however, excuse the employer from having to pay you what is already owed, such as a pension or earned vacation or sick leave. “The consideration offered for the waiver of the right to sue … must be something of value in addition to any of the employee’s existing entitlements,” the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) notes.\n\nCan I negotiate the terms of the severance?\n\nIf you think you have legitimate claims against the company, your employer would almost certainly rather you not sue, so it will likely be more open to negotiating the terms of your severance instead.\n\n“A company would rather pay $100 now to avoid having to pay $150 later,” DuPont said.\n\nIf you don’t have a strong case that could justify filing a lawsuit, which you could use as a bargaining chip, you can still try to make the case for why your employer might sweeten your severance package.\n\n“Asking is fine. You should ask. There’s no harm in asking,” Granovsky said.\n\nYou might ask for more months of paid health benefits if you or a family member on your insurance plan is battling cancer, DuPont noted as an example. Or if you’re a long-term employee in good standing or you have a special skill set that the employer might want to tap in the future, you might make a compelling case for why the company should offer you some additional pay.\n\nShould I hire a lawyer?\n\nSince a severance agreement is an important legal document that will affect your immediate future, it can be helpful to have an employment lawyer with experience in severance cases review the company’s offer.\n\nIf hiring a lawyer directly is too expensive, you might consider a less expensive service like LegalShield, which only charges about $30 a month to gain access to an employment attorney in your state who can review your offer, make sure it complies with the law and make a call on your behalf to your employer if you’re seeking modifications to the agreement.\n\nIf your case is complicated and involves further legal action, or if your severance agreement is more than 15 pages long, your costs will be higher, but you will get a discount on the hourly fees of the lawyer on your case.\n\nOr, if you just have some very simple questions, some employment lawyers might offer a free consultation by phone.\n\nHow long will I have to decide whether to accept a severance package?\n\nUnder federal laws, if you’re 40 or older, you must be given at least 45 days in a group termination (21 days if your layoff is not part of a mass layoff) to decide whether to sign your severance agreement.\n\nIn either case, if you accept the offer you also must be given a 7-day period afterward to change your mind.\n\nThat said, each state may have its own requirements above the federal minimum requirements, DuPont said. So check your state’s Department of Labor site to see what its specific requirements are.\n\nWill I lose my severance if I start earning income again?\n\nMany employers may stop your severance payments if the company rehires you for a new position.\n\nIf you find a job elsewhere or start freelancing for others, some employers may choose to reduce your severance payments if your new source of income is less than what you used to be paid.\n\n“They may say, ‘If you make less money we’ll only pay the delta,’” Granovsky said.\n\nIn either case, your severance agreement should state explicitly what the employer’s policy is. So don’t sign it until you’re clear about those terms.\n\nBut if the agreement is silent on the issue then you likely may continue to receive your full severance while also earning income from another source. “So that’s a win for the employee,” DuPont said.", "authors": ["Jeanne Sahadi"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/04/11/coronavirus-white-house-cases-deaths-easter-preparations/5132802002/", "title": "Coronavirus update: US deaths top 20,000, COVID-19 Easter news", "text": "All 50 states are simultaneously under a disaster declaration for the first time in history after President Donald Trump approved a declaration for Wyoming, White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said Saturday.\n\nThe news came as the U.S. surpassed Italy for the most coronavirus fatalities and the total U.S. death count topped 20,000 on Saturday.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service announced Saturday night that the first wave of stimulus checks had been deposited into Americans' bank accounts. \"We know many people are anxious to get their payments; we’ll continue issuing them as fast as we can,\" the IRS said in a tweet.\n\nMeanwhile, in an effort to keep the virus from spreading further, some states are taking extra measures to prevent large Easter celebrations on Sunday.\n\nWorldwide, there are more than 1.7 million cases and at least 108,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

I was shocked by the temerity of the industry to ask for blanket immunity from lawsuits… and to do it during the middle of this crisis. It’s appalling, and it’s a total slap in the face of families,” Lee said. “All of their focus should be on saving our families lives, but it shows that, at the end of the day, they care more about their own protections. It’s gross.”\n\nBut the FHCA's argument is that “in the midst of this unprecedented crisis, (health care professionals) should be able to direct their skills and attention to helping individuals who need them, and not have to worry about being sued for making tough decisions while trying to comply with government directives,” spokesperson Kristen Knapp said.\n\nFlorida is reporting more than 18,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the state.\n\n– Grace Hauck\n\nAmericans are ‘starting to need a haircut’ Walmart CEO says\n\nConsumer buying habits are going through a variety of stages as the country adjusts to life under lockdown, and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon says it’s clear many people are now in need of a haircut.\n\nMcMillon told the \"Today\" show that paper goods and hand sanitizer are continuing to sell out, with the retailer selling enough toilet paper in less than a week for every American to “have their own roll,” he said.\n\nThose products were a part of buyers' first wave of purchases as the nation adjusted to widespread lockdowns and social distancing restrictions. Next, McMillon said Walmart saw a spike in puzzle and game purchases.\n\nNow, other types of essentials are seeing a surge of interest: “Lately, we’ve seen more grooming products.

Andrew Cuomo quickly nixed the move, saying that was only the mayor's opinion.\n\nCuomo, speaking only hours after de Blasio's statement, said any decision about closing or opening schools would be coordinated with surrounding school districts in Westchester, Suffolk, Rockland and Nassau counties.\n\n\"There has been no decision on the schools,\" Cuomo said at his press briefing on Saturday, calling de Blasio's announcement the mayor's \"opinion.\"\n\nAt this point, schools are only closed in New York through April 29.\n\nThe New York City school district serves 1.1 million students at more than 1,866 schools. The number of coronavirus deaths in New York state is over 8,627 and the number of positive cases exceeds 170,000. Of those cases, 74% are in New York City.\n\n– Georgie Silvarole\n\nFact check: New York City is not planning to use trenches in local parks as burial grounds\n\nPoll: More Americans think the economy is getting worse\n\nA majority of Americans (65%) believe the economy is getting worse, a 40 percentage point jump from four weeks earlier, according to the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project with USA TODAY.\n\nIn the four weeks between surveys, the economy ground to a near-halt as much of the country was put under stay-at-home orders and nonessential businesses were forced to close.

But rarely, if ever, have they been deployed on such a massive scale to so many places at once — and in such a public way.\n\nImages of people in protective suits loading bodies into trucks have appeared in numerous media outlets in the past few weeks. And they have prompted questions about respect for the dead and — when the makeshift morgues are no longer needed — what happens to the trailers.\n\nTypically, the bodies of those who die in hospitals go straight to funeral homes, where they are prepared for memorial services.

At the same time, posts on social media also note how self-checkout is being limited at some Walmart stores.\n\nSelf-checkout has been a hot topic on Reddit for several months, with Walmart employees noting how some managers are opting to restrict self-checkout lanes, possibly for losses due to theft or incorrect input on food products.\n\nSimilarly, consumers who had gotten used to using self-checkout are now confused when they find most or all of the self-checkout lanes closed and lines waiting for clerks at registers racking up the sales.\n\n\"All the checkout lines were closed and I had to wait 40 minutes in a line,\" one person posted on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nTarget Circle:Target launches paid membership program, Circle 360, with free unlimited same-day delivery\n\nA shopper at Target posted a photo on X showing self-checkout lanes closed. \"SMH why?\" they asked.\n\nSelf-checkout shifts at Target, Walmart, Costco\n\nThese reports come as other retailers in recent months shifted their self-checkout strategies.\n\nTarget told USA TODAY in October it had begun experimenting with self-checkout lanes limited to 10 items or fewer at select locations \"in order to reduce wait times and better understand guest preferences,\" according to spokesperson Brian Harper-Tibaldo.\n\nAbout the same time, Walmart removed self-checkout at select stores and some stores began posting clerks at self-checkout lanes to watch for possible checkout errors.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, Costco began asking staffers to crack down on checking membership cards in self-checkout lines. One reason: an increase in \"shrink,\" from theft or products selling for less than actual prices.\n\nSelf-checkout's effect on profit isn't new.\n\nIn the 2022 report “Global Study on Self-Checkout,” two-thirds (66%) of the 93 retailers in the survey (29 were from North America) said they thought self-checkout losses were becoming more of a problem in their businesses.\n\n\"There is no doubt retailers that have invested heavily in (self-checkout) SCO are now having to develop a range of ways in which to keep the associated losses under control,\" the report's author Adrian Beck, emeritus professor in the Department of Criminology at the University of Leicester in the U.K., told USA TODAY. \"Typically, these are a combination of technologies, guardianship, design and changes to store processes.\"\n\nIs Walmart getting rid of self-checkout?\n\nNot necessarily. Walmart has not issued a corporatewide directive on self-checkout but lets store managers experiment with what works at their location, Walmart spokesperson Joe Pennington told Business Insider.\n\n\"Our managers look for ways to innovate within their stores and pay close attention to customer feedback on where they can better meet their needs,\" he said in a statement sent to USA TODAY. \"Based on several factors including customer and associate feedback, shopping patterns, and business needs, some locations are temporarily testing different checkout staffing options.\"\n\nAny changes, he told Business Insider, are not meant to drive adoption of Walmart+ memberships ($98 annually), which give customers benefits including free deliveries and shipping, plus mobile scan and go shopping using your smartphone in stores.\n\nUSA TODAY has also contacted Target for comment about its self-checkout strategies.\n\nAfter Walmart removed the self-checkout lanes at those select stores, Pennington told USA TODAY in October, \"There are no current plans for self-checkout removals nationwide.\"\n\nBut retailers are rethinking what part self-checkouts play in the retail process. They must balance using costly self-checkout lanes and staffing concerns, along with lost revenue from theft and incorrect sales.\n\n\"I personally don’t think self-checkout is going away, but we are seeing some big shifts from grocers in this department,\" said Supermarket News senior editor Bill Wilson in a column this week.\n\nAmong other recent developments he cited: Schnucks has limited self-checkout to 10 items or less and Dollar General planned to cut back on self-checkout in 2024.\n\n\"Why? Shrink inventory has been a nasty pest over the past year, and it appears some of that theft is happening when shoppers 'forget' to scan items,\" Wilson said. \"Late last year, Kroger began leaning on AI to ensure that items in the cart make it through the scanner and into the bag.\"\n\nDo you prefer self-checkout? It may depend on your age\n\nAnother issue for retailers to balance: Some shoppers love self-checkout, but others do not.\n\nMore than 4 out of 10 consumers (43%) preferred self-checkout when buying groceries, according to a survey of 1,133 U.S. consumers by NCR Voyix, released in January.\n\nBut Generation Z and Millennial shoppers, aged 18-44, were more likely to prefer it, while only 40% of those ages 45-60 and 26% of those over 60 did.\n\n“The reality is shoppers want more control over their checkout experience and self-checkout delivers that flexibility,\" NCR Voyix CEO David Wilkinson said in a statement accompanying the report. \"For retailers, self-checkout enhances operational efficiency in a time when many are struggling to retain staff and are combatting unprecedented levels of shrink.”\n\nContributing: Bailey Schulz.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

A new poll shows that 75 percent of citizens support the demonstrations.\n\nThe turnout in Saturday's protests was lower than the 1 million participants seen on Thursday and there was less violence. But in the city of Belo Horizonte police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters who tried to pass through a barrier and hurled rocks at a car dealership. The city of Salvador also saw demonstrations turn violent.\n\nThe protests have become the largest public demonstrations Latin America's biggest nation has seen in two decades. They began as opposition to transportation fare hikes, then became a laundry list of causes including anger at high taxes, poor services and World Cup spending, before coalescing around the issue of rampant government corruption.\n\nMany protesters were not appeased by a prime-time television address Friday night by President Dilma Rousseff, who said that peaceful protests were welcome and emphasized that she would not condone corruption. She also said she would meet with movement leaders and create a plan to improve urban transportation and use oil royalties for investments in education.\n\n\"Dilma is underestimating the resolve of the people on the corruption issue,\" said Mayara Fernandes, a medical student who took part in a march in Sao Paulo. \"She talked and talked and said nothing. Nobody can take the corruption of this country anymore.\"\n\nA new poll published Saturday in the weekly magazine Epoca showed that three-quarters of Brazilians support the protests. The poll was carried out by the respected Ibope institute. It interviewed 1,008 people across Brazil June 16-20 and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.\n\nOn Saturday, protesters denounced congressional legislation, known as PEC 37, that would limit the power of federal prosecutors to investigate crimes - which many fear would hinder attempts to jail corrupt politicians.\n\nFederal prosecutors were behind the investigation into the biggest corruption case in Brazil's history, the so-called \"mensalao\" cash-for-votes scheme that came to light in 2005 and involved top aides of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva buying off members of congress to vote for their legislation.\n\nLast year, the supreme court condemned two dozen people in connection to the case, which was hailed as a watershed moment in Brazil's fight against corruption. However, those condemned have yet to be jailed because of appeals, a delay that has enraged Brazilians.\n\n\"It was good Dilma spoke, but this movement has moved too far, there was not much she could really say,\" said Victoria Villela, a 21-year-old university student in the Sao Paulo protest. \"All my friends were talking on Facebook about how she said nothing that satisfied them. I think the protests are going to continue for a long time and the crowds will still be huge.\"\n\nAcross Brazil, police estimated that about 60,000 demonstrators gathered in a central square in Belo Horizonte, 30,000 shut down a main business avenue in Sao Paulo, and another 30,000 gathered in the city in southern Brazil where a nightclub fire killed over 240 mostly university students, deaths many argued could have been avoided with better government oversight of fire laws.\n\nTens of thousands more protested in more than 100 Brazilian cities, bringing the nationwide total on Saturday to 250,000, according to a police count published on the website of the Globo TV network, Brazil's largest.\n\nIn the northeastern city of Salvador, where Brazil's national football team played Italy and won 4-2 in a Confederations Cup match, some 5,000 protesters gathered about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the stadium, shouting demands for better schools and transportation and denouncing heavy spending on next year's World Cup.\n\nThey blocked a main road and clashed with riot police who moved in to clear the street. Protesters said police used rubber bullets and even tossed tear gas canisters from a helicopter hovering overhead. The protesters scattered and fled to a nearby shopping mall, where they tried to take shelter in an underground parking garage.\n\n\"We sat down and the police came and asked us to free up one lane for traffic. As we were organizing our group to do just that, the police lost their patience and began to shoot at us and throw (tear gas) canisters,\" said protester Rodrigo Dorado.\n\nThat was exactly the type of conflict Rousseff said needed to end, not just so Brazilians could begin a peaceful national discussion but because much of the violence is taking place in cities hosting foreign tourists attending the Confederations Cup.\n\nBrazil's news media, which had blasted Rousseff in recent days for her lack of response to the protests, seemed largely unimpressed with her careful speech, but noted the difficult situation facing a government trying to understand a mass movement with no central leaders and a flood of demands.\n\nWith \"no objective information about the nature of the organization of the protests,\" wrote Igor Gielow in a column for Brazil's biggest newspaper, Folha de S. Paulo, \"Dilma resorted to an innocuous speech to cool down spirits.\"\n\nOutside the stadium in Belo Horizonte where Mexico and Japan met in a Confederations Cup game, Dadiana Gamaleliel, a 32-year-old physiotherapist, held up a banner that read: \"Not against the games, in favor of the nation.\"\n\n\"I am protesting on behalf of the whole nation because this must be a nation where people have a voice … we don't have a voice anymore,\" she said.\n\nShe said Rousseff's speech wouldn't \"change anything.\"\n\n\"She spoke in a general way and didn't say what she would do,\" she said. \"We will continue this until we are heard.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/us/us-rallies-in-support-of-ukraine/index.html", "title": "US rallies in support of Ukraine: 'The whole world right now needs to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nCities across the United States have seen rallies in support of Ukraine this weekend as the invasion by Russian forces continues.\n\nCrowds gathered in cities including Atlanta, Washington, DC, and New York – where Olga Ladygina told CNN at a rally in Times Square Saturday that she hasn’t slept for the last three nights. Her friends in Ukraine have stayed up, too, Ladygina, who is from Kyiv, told CNN. But they’re making homemade bombs to try to stop Russian tanks.\n\nLadygina has been up crying, watching the news and trying to call her loved ones who remain in Ukraine. It’s a stark contrast to what she sees in New York, she said. On Saturday, she saw people sitting and eating in restaurants who “don’t think that the war can come to their houses,” she told CNN.\n\nBut peace, she said, is fragile.\n\n“I think that the whole world right now needs to unite,” Ladygina said, adding: “Now is the time to say no and stop one person who keeps in fear the whole world.”\n\nSince the Russian assault began early Thursday, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes, according to United Nations figures. But Ukraine has remained defiant, and President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged citizens to help defend their country. Early Sunday, the capital city Kyiv remained under Ukrainian control, while fighting had broken out on the streets of Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city.\n\n“Each Ukrainian should keep one thing in mind: if you can stop and destroy the occupiers – do it,” Zelensky said in a video message Saturday. “Everyone who can come back to Ukraine – come back to defend Ukraine.”\n\nAnti-war protesters gather in Times Square in New York on Saturday to protest Russian attacks on Ukraine. Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nA similar resolve was seen among Ukrainian-Americans and their allies in the US as they demanded more action to support Ukraine and its outgunned military. Western nations have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in response to the invasion, and the US, UK and EU on Friday sanctioned President Vladimir Putin himself.\n\nBut some Ukrainian supporters think more needs to be done.\n\nUkrainians appreciate the support shown around the world, but it does not change the fact Ukrainians are dying, 18-year-old Tanya Fedak, a second-generation Ukrainian-American, said in a speech at a rally Sunday in Chicago, which boasts a large Ukrainian community.\n\n“What we need is action,” Fedak said. “What we need is physical support, and not just world leaders who can sit and watch mass destruction from the comfort and safety of their living room, tweet ‘thoughts and prayers for Ukraine,’ and then change the channel.\n\n“What we are doing now is not enough,” she said.\n\nDemonstrators call for solidarity with Ukraine at a rally in Chicago on Sunday, February 27, 2022. Courtesy Simeon Tzolov\n\n‘Pray for Ukraine’\n\nSimeon Tzolov estimated hundreds of people were at Sunday’s rally in Chicago’s Ukrainian Village, telling CNN he saw Ukrainian flags, along with those from America, Lithuania and Latvia. Tzolov himself is Bulgarian and American, he said, but he was there to support his Ukrainian friends and coworkers, calling the conflict in Ukraine an “unjust” and “unprovoked war.”\n\nDan Ihor Diaczun, president of the Illinois division of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, told the crowd alleged attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure were aimed at demoralizing Ukrainians and forcing them to capitulate.\n\n“What Putin didn’t count on,” he said, “was the resolve and the will of the Ukrainian people, not only to resist, but to fight and fight hard.”\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker was also in attendance, telling the crowd his family originally hailed from Kyiv, but “today we are all Ukrainian.”\n\n“Today we stand in resolve against tyranny,” the governor said. “Today we stand for democracy and today we stand united for peace and freedom for Ukraine. To the heroes of Ukraine, Illinois is with you.”\n\nIn downtown Atlanta, dozens of people gathered for a “Stand with Ukraine” rally Saturday. Some wore blue and yellow, the colors of the Ukrainian flag, while others carried signs that read, “Pray for Ukraine” and “Ukranians Unite!” as they sang the Ukrainian national anthem.\n\nUkrainian Anton Kilpa was among them. His parents live in Kyiv, Kilpa told CNN affiliate WGCL. He learned the invasion had begun when a Canadian-Ukrainian friend called him earlier this week, just before bed, and told him to phone his parents immediately.\n\n“It was hard to believe,” Kilpa told WGCL. “It was (a) new reality.”\n\nJoshua Hill, another attendee in Atlanta, doesn’t have a personal connection to Ukraine, but he told CNN via Twitter he joined because “Ukraine needs the support of the world.”\n\n“Our leaders aren’t doing enough,” Hill said. “I’m here to show support for more action from the US government, NATO and all of Ukraine’s allies.”\n\nDemonstrators rally on Saturday in Atlanta in support of Ukraine. Joshua Hill\n\nAcross the country, Josh Hersh went to a rally Saturday in San Francisco, where he said people shared personal stories about their Ukrainian family and friends. Several Russian Americans also spoke, Hersh said, and told the crowd they were standing with Ukraine. A group of musicians also attended, singing a traditional Ukrainian song.\n\n“A few Ukrainians joined in and led the singing. It was really powerful,” he said. “And there was laughter at moments, which was good to see too.”\n\nIn Los Angeles, a large crowd rallied for hours Saturday afternoon as cars drove by honking to signal their support as well, according to Mark Haynie, who was there with his wife, Anastasiia Ponomarova. The crowd was mostly Ukrainians but there were other eastern Europeans as well, he said, including Russians.\n\nHaynie told CNN Ponomarova escaped her apartment in Donetsk with just a suitcase and her cat in 2014, when parts of the Donbas region fell under the control of Russian-backed separatists. Ponomarova felt few people cared back then, Haynie said. But she’s happy that Ukraine appears to be receiving support and recognition for its struggles today.\n\nDemonstrators rally in support of Ukraine in San Francisco on Saturday.

Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n\nOther signs called for more robust consequences, like expelling Russia from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), a high security network that connect thousands of financial institutions around the world. On Saturday evening, the White House and the EU announced the expulsion of select Russian banks from SWIFT.\n\nOne demonstrator, JP Wheeler, told CNN he was “just a concerned citizen” with no personal ties to Ukraine. “No family or friends, just a human connection and a desire to support the Ukrainians and (their) struggle,” Wheeler said.\n\nA couple miles away from the rally outside the White House, Eleanor Shiori Hughes, a graduate student at Georgetown University, left flowers on the steps of the Ukrainian embassy, where a sign read “Long Live Free Ukraine.”\n\nFlowers are seen left on the steps of the Ukraine Embassy in Washington on February 26. Eleanor Shiori Hughes\n\nShe, too, had no connection to Ukraine.\n\n“I just wanted to show my support and solidarity for the Ukrainian people,” Hughes said.\n\nThat solidarity was shown in ways other than protest, too: Across the country, buildings lit up blue and yellow to signal support for Ukrainians. Among them were state capitols in New York and Colorado, along with Atlanta City Hall.\n\n“We know that freedom, democracy, and independence are a light unto the world,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.\n\n“We are proud to cast the colors of the Ukrainian flag across our own State Capitol as we continue to support and pray for the brave people of Ukraine during this dark time,” he said.\n\n‘The world needs to act’\n\nSimilar demonstrations were held in a number of cities on Friday.\n\nIn Nashville, CNN affiliate WTVF reported several dozen protesters had gathered on the steps of Tennessee’s state capitol that morning.\n\n“Sanctions are not enough,” one sign read, per footage from WTVF. Another: “The world needs to act now.”\n\nAlisa Kaiser told the station that most of the demonstrators probably had family in Ukraine. “They’re happy we’re not there, because we’re safe here,” she said. “But all you want is to be there with them to support.”\n\nShe added: “We need to make sure that this does not go further than it already has … It’s gone too far.”\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

For the latest news on the protests view our live updates file for Thursday, April 25.\n\nNEW YORK − Columbia University announced Wednesday that students had agreed to scale down their encampment as protesters across the nation pressed their demands for an end to the civilian casualties in Gaza that have tested the American public's historically ironclad support for Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, police arrested protesters Wednesday at the University of Southern California campus, which closed to the public Wednesday amid clashes between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and authorities at the school and nationwide.\n\nArrests were actively being made on the USC campus Wednesday night, a Los Angeles police spokesperson told USA TODAY. The spokesperson said he could not provide an estimate on how many people were detained.\n\nColumbia student protesters earlier in the day issued a statement saying the school had made a \"a written commitment and concession not to call the NYPD or the National Guard,\" calling the progress \"an important victory for students.”\n\nThe university closed the main campus due to the \"significant activity on campus,\" USC's Department of Public Safety said in an alert to students. Everyone on the campus could still leave but students were required to enter through pedestrian gates using their school IDs.\n\nRallies and encampments have sprung up on campuses from California to Massachusetts this week, sometimes prompting police intervention, as was the case Wednesday at the University of Texas in Austin and at the University of Southern California. The protesters are calling for an end to U.S. military support for Israel and for eliminating Israeli investments.\n\nThe New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights organization, called on political leaders and university officials to stop “endangering” Jewish, Muslim, Palestinian and other students who conducting peaceful protests. \"Students should not have to risk their reputation, livelihoods or their safety to speak out against a genocide or their university’s complicity in genocide,\" CAIR-NY’s Executive Director Afaf Nasher said in a statement.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday signed a controversial aid package bill that provides billions of dollars for the Israeli military. Lawmakers who supported the aid have been among targets of the protesters. In Brooklyn, police made arrests for disorderly conduct late Tuesday during a street protest near the residence of Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the largely pro-Palestinian protests at U.S. campuses, calling them \"horrific'' and saying, \"Antisemitic mobs have taken over leading universities.''\n\n∎ Hamas also put out a statement about the demonstrations, as Izzat Al-Risheq, a member of the militant group's Political Bureau, said the Biden administration is \"violating the individual rights and the right to expression through arresting university students and faculty members'' who are protesting.\n\n∎ At the University of Minnesota campus in St. Paul, police made nine arrests and cleared an encampment after the school asked them to take action, citing violations of university policy and trespassing law.\n\n∎ In the Boston area, encampments have been erected at multiple schools including Tufts University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Emerson College.\n\n∎ California's Cal Poly Humboldt in Arcata will be closed Wednesday after pro-Palestinian protesters occupied a campus building, the school announced.\n\nProtests in New York flare:US campuses brace for more unrest over Gaza war\n\nProtesters met by police at UT Austin, USC\n\nAt least 20 people were arrested after a large number of law enforcement officers in riot gear descended upon the University of Texas' Austin campus Wednesday and broke up a peaceful antiwar protest, the Austin American-Statesman reported. At least nine of those arrested were handcuffed and loaded into police vehicles.\n\nOfficers wearing helmets, some of them on horseback, ordered the demonstrators to disperse after they had been marching for about 45 minutes, the newspaper said. The crowd spread out but then gathered again, leading to the detainments.\n\nThe protest, which featured chants of \"Free Palestine,'' was organized by a student group in solidarity with demonstrations in other college campuses demanding schools sever ties with corporations linked to the Israeli military and for the U.S. to stop funding Israel's war effort.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the University of Southern California closed off its campus Wednesday after police clashed with protesters trying to set up an encampment at the school's Alumni Park.\n\n\"There is still significant activity at the center of the UPC campus due to a demonstration,'' USC said in a social media posting around 12:20 p.m. PT. \"The gates are closed, so anyone coming to campus should be prepared to show an ID at the gates for class or for business.''\n\nHouse Speaker Johnson booed at Columbia speech\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson called for Columbia University President Minouche Shafik to resign during his visit to the school Wednesday. In his remarks, Johnson shamed students and faculty involved in the protests, as well as administrators for not doing enough to prevent them.\n\n“It's detestable. As Columbia has allowed these lawless agitators and radicals to take over, the virus of antisemitism has spread across other campus,” Johnson said. “Anti-Israel encampments are popping up in universities all across this country. The madness has to stop.”\n\nWhen Johnson described instances of antisemitism, called for Shafik’s resignation, and said students perpetrating violence should be arrested, protesters nearby booed and chanted, “We can’t hear you.”\n\n“Enjoy your free speech,” he told them in response.\n\n-- Rachel Barber\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters urge universities to divest from Israel. What does that mean?\n\nColumbia students say they have won some concessions\n\nColumbia student protest organizers said Wednesday the university has conceded to some demands but is still putting students at risk of attacks. The statement − issued in response to the university’s campus update on progress in negotiations with student organizers − referenced historic actions of American universities against student demonstrators at Jackson State and Kent State, where authorities fatally shot several students more than 50 years ago.\n\n“Columbia’s reliance on the threat of state violence against peaceful protesters has created an unstable ground for the negotiations process which will continue over the next 48 hours,” the statement said, referring to the deadline the university has issued. “However, Columbia’s written commitment and concession not to call the NYPD or the National Guard signifies an important victory for students.”\n\nBiden signs off on $17 billion in aid for Israel\n\nBiden signed a controversial aid package bill Wednesday that provides, among other things, $17 billion for Israel. The bill also supplies $9 billion for humanitarian aid, some of it for Palestinians in Gaza, but that's a little over half the amount assigned for military aid to Israel. Such funding has been a driving force for the encampments and other protests at universities and elsewhere in the U.S.\n\nIn comments at the White House, Biden focused on the humanitarian aid and the threat Israel faces from Iran.\n\n\"My commitment to Israel ... is ironclad,\" he said, adding that more than $1 billion in aid is for Palestinians facing a humanitarian crisis because of \"the war Hamas started.\"\n\n\"Israel must make sure all this aid reaches the Palestinians in Gaza without delay,\" Biden said.\n\nColumbia students agree to remove some tents, university says\n\nAt Columbia, student protesters gathered on campus early Wednesday for another day of demonstrations while just outside the gates protesters were chanting in support of the students. Earlier, the school issued a statement saying protesters had agreed to remove a \"significant\" number of tents, would allow only students to take part in the encampment, would follow city fire safety rules and would \"make the encampment welcome to all and (prohibit) discriminatory or harassing language.\"\n\n\"In light of this constructive dialogue, the University will continue conversations for the next 48 hours,\" the statement said.\n\nLead student negotiator Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student who is Palestinian, disputed that an agreement was in place. \"We are doing our best to work with the university to actually meet our demands, because this encampment is for specific demands,” he told USA TODAY. “If it takes 48 hours, takes more than that, the students are here to stay until their demands are met.”\n\nBefore the school issued the statement, Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine said administrators threatened to bring in police and the National Guard if protesters did not comply with their demands. \"We remain steadfast in our convictions and will not be intimidated by the University's disturbing threat of an escalation of violence,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nHarvard students start their own tent city\n\nHarvard students set up a ring of tents in Harvard Yard midday Wednesday and said they plan to stay put until the school’s administration responds to their demands to divest from funds that support Israel’s military. Students sang and danced in a circle in front of the statue of John Harvard, the school’s namesake, draped with a keffiyeh (scarf), as dozens of others looked on.\n\n“We resist the fact that our tuition money is going toward bankrolling Israel’s genocide,” said Violet Barron, a sophomore from Los Angeles and member of the Harvard Out of Occupied Palestinian Coalition.\n\nShe said the school’s administration has consistently suppressed student support for Palestinians and now, after more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, the students decided to take more public action. “We tried countless times to go through institutional channels,” Barron said.\n\nA sophomore majoring in social studies, Barron said her own activism is both a reflection of what she’s learning in her history classes as well as her Jewish upbringing, which taught her to try to “repair the world.”\n\n− Karen Weintraub\n\nAuthor Lis Harris defends students impacted by a 'nasty situation'\n\nLongtime author and critic Lis Harris, a Columbia writing professor, defended the students' right to form the encampment she called a \"tent city,'' and said police should not have taken it down and arrested protesters last week.\n\n“I mean, how could the young people not feel as they do? It’s a nasty situation,” said Harris, who authored the 2019 book, “ In Jerusalem: Three Generations of an Israeli Family and a Palestinian Family .”\n\nThe book examines the impacts of the intractable Israelis-Palestinian conflict, which have been felt for decades and are particularly acute now.\n\n“When you read about history happening by the leaders, that’s one thing,” she said. “It’s quite another to see the effect of all this violence and fear on the generations that keep coming and going.”\n\nBrown students protest despite threat of disciplinary action\n\nStudents at Brown University in Rhode Island established an encampment Wednesday. Large signs announcing \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" and \"Brown invests in the Palestinian genocide\" were prominently displayed.\n\nThe encampment was set up hours after Provost Francis Doyle sent an email to all students warning that encampments are a violation of university police and and that participants could face disciplinary action \"up to and including separation from the institution,” The Brown Daily Herald reported. University Spokesperson Brian Clark told The Herald protest becomes unacceptable when it violates safety policies or interferes with \"regular operations of the university.\"\n\n“We have been troubled by reports of violence, harassment and intimidation at some encampments on other campuses, but we have not seen that kind of behavior at Brown,\" Clark said. \"Any such behavior would not be tolerated.”\n\nScores arrested in Brooklyn protests\n\nIn Brooklyn, police made scores of disorderly conduct arrests when a street protest reached a standoff Tuesday night. The protesters, organized by the activist group Jewish Voice for Peace, had gathered at Grand Army Plaza, near the home of Schumer, who has led the effort in Congress to provide funds for the Israeli military. The protesters conducted a Seder dinner and demanded a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nBy nightfall, demonstrators sat in the street and led protest chants against Israel and U.S. foreign aid to the country. Police began pulling dozens of people, young and old, off the roadway. Officers handcuffed them with zip ties and loaded them on several buses that lined the street.\n\n\"We refuse to let our traditions be used to starve, displace, and massacre Palestinians,\" the Jewish Voice for Peace said in a tweet during the protest. \"Taking seriously the mandate of the Jewish holiday of liberation requires us to show up with everything we have on the doorsteps of those still arming and funding these historic atrocities.\"\n\nThe New York Police Department said officers arrested 208 demonstrators who blocked traffic at Grand Army Plaza.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/25/us/minneapolis-crime-defund-invs/index.html", "title": "Once nicknamed 'Murderapolis,' the city that made itself the center of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMarnette Gordon was doing laundry at home in Minneapolis one summer morning last year when a call came from her 36-year-old son.\n\nShe figured her son, Telly Blair, was checking in to see if she wanted a soda from a gas station down the street, where he often went for fuel and snacks.\n\n“Mom, I’ve been shot,” he said. “Call the police!”\n\nMarnette, her other son Tamarcus and his 12-year-old daughter rushed to the gas station from their home in the city’s north side, a part of town long beset by violent crime.\n\nBlair’s family came upon his blue 1986 Chevy Caprice at pump No. 5 — beating police and paramedics by a few minutes, they said — only to find him slumped in his car, bleeding from multiple bullet wounds in his chest. A 17-year-old male in an orange hoodie had fired nine rounds from a handgun into Blair’s car before running off.\n\nWhile an off-duty nurse in scrubs who’d been at the gas station tried to stop his bleeding, Marnette — a heart-transplant recipient — couldn’t bear to watch and stood at a distance. Telly was her caretaker.\n\n“It was just horrible to see him sitting there, waiting on the ambulance,” she told CNN.\n\nThe 12-year-old called 911 while watching her uncle struggle to breathe.\n\n“Oh my God, please,” the girl, who was crying, said to a dispatcher, according to 911 transcripts of the August 9, 2021 shooting obtained by CNN. “Hurry up, hurry up, hurry, hurry, he’s dead, hurry up!”\n\nTelly Blair was among 93 people who were murdered in Minneapolis last year, city crime data shows. That’s just a few shy of the total killings in 1995, when the city earned the nickname “Murderapolis.” (Neighboring St. Paul witnessed 38 murders last year — a historic high.)\n\nA photo of Telly Blair and his mother, Marnette, rests on a table in their home in north Minneapolis. Marnette Gordon, 61, mother of Telly Blair, 36, who lost his life to gun violence in north Minneapolis, photographed in her home.\n\nAfter the police murder of George Floyd in May of 2020, Minneapolis became a worldwide symbol of the police brutality long endured disproportionately by Black people. In a kind of Newtonian response, the city became the epicenter of the culturally seismic “Defund the Police” movement. But that progressive local effort fizzled with a decisive referendum last November.\n\nNow, with its police department under investigation by the Department of Justice, the city of 425,000 is trying to find a way forward amid a period of heightened crime that began shortly after Floyd’s death.\n\nThat year, the number of murders soared to nearly 80 — dwarfing the 2019 body count of 46. It has cooled somewhat this year, though the amount of killing — and violent crime in general — remains elevated far above 2019 levels and homicides are on pace to surpass the 2020 figure. The reasons why are far from clear.\n\nKG Wilson, a longtime resident of the Twin Cities, said police withdrew from violent neighborhoods in the aftermath of Floyd’s killing — a common sentiment among locals.\n\n“The criminals were celebrating. They were getting rich,” he said. “They were selling drugs openly.”\n\nWilson told CNN the violence devastated his own family: His 6-year-old granddaughter was killed in May of 2021 after getting caught in the crossfire of a gunfight in north Minneapolis. The culprit remains at large.\n\nAnother factor was the pandemic, which some observers see as the biggest impetus for the crime surge.\n\n“It unsettled settled trajectories,” said Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor who is now a professor at St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis. “Kids who were going to school, who would have graduated but drifted off because there is no school — we’re seeing a lot of the violent crime is by juveniles.”\n\nCiting sinking morale in the wake of the unrest after Floyd’s killing, leaders at the Minneapolis Police Department say the officer head count has shrunk from 900 in early 2020 to about 560 in August — a loss of more than a third of the force.\n\nKG Wilson created a memorial for his granddaughter Aniya Allen in his SUV. The car seat cover of her face rests on the seat where she would ride with him. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the political pendulum on public-safety matters in this reliably liberal city — the “Mini Apple” hasn’t had a Republican mayor since 1973, and that was for just a single day — seems to have swung away from a progressive mindset towards the middle.\n\nAnd on matters of public safety, the middle is where many of the city’s Black residents already were.\n\nLast year, progressives touted a ballot measure that was said to be a referendum on the “defund” concept. Question 2, as it was known locally, would have replaced the Minneapolis Police Department with a new “public health-oriented” Department of Public Safety and removed a minimum staffing requirement from the city charter.\n\nIt failed in November, with 56% of voters rejecting it. That figure was 61% in north Minneapolis, a pair of neighboring city wards where Blacks make up a strong plurality of the roughly 66,000 residents. All but one of the 17 precincts in the north voted against the measure.\n\n“We did not believe that the police should be defunded, but we do believe in police reforms,” said Bishop Richard Howell of Shiloh Temple, a north-side church founded more than 90 years ago.\n\nRae McKay-Anderson — Telly Blair’s sister — said “you can’t possibly defund the police in a way that’s going to benefit the Black community.”\n\nDealing the final blow to the local “defund” movement last year was a city council vote to essentially refund a cut they’d made the prior year. Mayor Jacob Frey is proposing another budget bump for the next two fiscal years.\n\nThe question of the moment is, if the police budget has been restored, and if all the anti-cop shouting by politicians and activists that left officers demoralized has weakened to a whimper, why are citizens — especially in the rough parts of north Minneapolis — still feeling neglected by police and fearful for their safety?\n\nA feeling of lawlessness, a sense of neglect\n\nResidents of the north side describe a landscape that can feel lawless. Indeed, about 60% of police calls for shots fired this year have come from the area, even though it makes up just 15% of the population, according to city data.\n\nPaul Johnson, 56, said young men openly sell drugs during the day in public places, such as a gas station on Broadway Avenue that has been dubbed the “murder station” due to all of the fatal shootings there. (It is near the one where Blair was killed.)\n\n“You pull up to get gas – they try to sell you drugs,” he said. “And not just three or four, but it’s a bulk of people.”\n\nThe perception among many residents is that the police ignore the area.\n\n“They just let it go on,” said Johnson’s friend, Brian Bogan, 42, who said he moved from north Minneapolis to relatively safer St. Paul due to his kids growing up in an area where they don’t know if “it’s fireworks or gunshots.”\n\nA memorial for Aniya Allen lay on the ground of the corner store near where she was shot in north Minneapolis. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nWhile Minneapolis is far from the nation’s most dangerous city, its rate of increase in homicides — the count in 2021 was about double that of 2019 — is among the highest in the nation, said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri- St. Louis and co-author of an annual study on crime trends.\n\nOn per-capita murders, it has ranked fairly high — 19th out of 70 jurisdictions in the US — during the first half of this year, according to the Major Cities Chiefs Association. The city ranked even higher on other per-capita crime measures, such as robbery (4th), rape (8th) and aggravated assault (13th).\n\nJuliee Oden, 56, can’t even count the times she has called 911 to report gunfire outside her north-side home. One night last summer, a volley of shots jolted her out of bed while she was watching TV — it was coming from her front lawn.\n\n“I hit the floor,” she said. “My phone went flying. I had to crawl on my stomach to get to the phone” to dial 911.\n\nIt got to the point where it was hard to sleep at night and Oden, who works at a construction company, had colleagues install a bulletproof panel behind the headboard of her bed.\n\n“Now I go in my room with complete confidence,” she said. “If somebody is to shoot directly at my house, I know: As long as I’m behind my headboard, I’m 100% safe.”\n\nOden was among eight residents in north Minneapolis who filed a lawsuit in the summer of 2020 calling on the city to replenish the police department by filling vacant positions. The suit singled out city council members who supported the “radical ‘dismantle the police’” idea and accused them and Mayor Frey of creating a “hostile” environment for the police. It was largely upheld by a state Supreme Court decision this summer — meaning the city needs to staff up to at least 731 police officers.\n\nDoug Seaton, an attorney representing the eight residents, said the successful suit was filed in direct response to how progressive city council members had embraced the “defund” idea. It demoralized the police department and ultimately led to a mass exodus of officers, he said.\n\n“That is, we think, the major reason that crime has spiked throughout the city and hasn’t gone away yet,” Seaton said.\n\nMeanwhile, as the MPD headcount has shrunk, wait times have grown for people who call 911 to report serious “priority 1” incidents, which can include shots fired, robberies, assaults and mental health crises.\n\nAverage 911 response times jumped the very month of Floyd’s death — May of 2020 — from around 10 or 11 minutes early that year to 14 minutes, according to public records obtained by CNN. They kept rising in 2021 to 16 minutes; response times in the north side’s fourth precinct last year actually surpassed 17 minutes, where they remain.\n\nSome nights are so busy that the dispatchers are directed to hold all non-priority-1 calls citywide; these would include reports of property damage, suspicious persons or theft. That happened during a frenetic five-hour stretch on the night of September 8, when officers responded to multiple shootings and calls for shots fired — many of them in north Minneapolis; one near the “murder station” — that left two dead and seven wounded.\n\nThe Minneapolis Police Department has even flatly refused to respond to certain crimes in a timely manner. One couple who run a property management business recently took it upon themselves to investigate the theft of their van, box truck and tools by a culprit who brought the stolen goods into a homeless encampment on the north side, according to local news reports.\n\nPolice told KARE 11 that the hostility towards police on the part of some encampment dwellers compels them to take a slower approach when investigating property crimes there.\n\nBut by and large, police officials have said the slower response times are the expected byproduct of a depleted force that has witnessed an overwhelming wave of retirements, resignations and disability leaves due to post-traumatic stress.\n\nMuch of that exodus owes to a bottoming out of morale in the wake of a crisis that left police officers feeling reviled, said interim Minneapolis Police Chief Amelia Huffman.\n\n“There’s really been a very fundamental challenge to our sense of purpose in law enforcement,” Huffman said of the post-Floyd era. “(Minneapolis) is the eye of the storm. So all of those challenges and the pressure is magnified, you know, a hundred fold – a thousand fold.”\n\nSimilar headcount plunges have plagued police departments from coast to coast.\n\nSome law enforcement officials have attributed the mass resignations and retirements to pandemic-related reasons, but Sgt. Betsy Brantner Smith of the National Police Association said morale is a major factor.\n\n“It’s no secret that law enforcement … especially in the last two and a half years, has been badly vilified and wrongly vilified,” she told CNN. “You can’t call an entire profession racist and expect people to just sit back and say, okay, you know, keep piling on.”\n\nThe gas station where Telly Blair was fatally shot in north Minneapolis. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nIn June, the embattled Minneapolis department was hit with more bad press — this time for its abysmal numbers on unsolved murders in recent years.\n\nSince 2016, the clearance rate (or the percentage of homicide cases closed) in Minneapolis sank from around 54% — the most recent national average — to 38% in 2020, according to the latest available data from the FBI. Figures for last year haven’t been released by the FBI, but Huffman insists the rate has improved considerably, claiming that the unofficial figure for this year to date is back to 54%.\n\nEven so, some family members of murder victims say they have felt compelled to take a lead role in the homicide investigations of their own loved ones.\n\nResidents take matters into their own hands\n\nAmong them is Dorothy Royston, a 26-year-old healthcare professional who said she spent weeks proactively feeding police information shortly after her unarmed younger brother, Charles Royston Jr., was gunned down on a snowy street in north Minneapolis on a January night in 2021, according to police reports.\n\n“They had a lot of the information or the logistics of what was – like bullet casings and stuff like that,” Dorothy said. “But when it comes to who was involved with the actual shooting, who was around – and the people information? I actually provided that to the police.”\n\nDorothy provided CNN with text messages between her and a lead investigator on the case. In February of 2021, the investigator told her in a message that there would be a warrant out for the arrest of a suspect by the next day. He still hasn’t been arrested, Dorothy said.\n\nShe said communications from the investigator fell off around March of 2021.\n\nA couple months ago, about a year and a half after the killing, Dorothy said, she called the investigator to ask for an update.\n\n“He told me that he was currently doing something and that he would call me back,” she said. “He never called me back.”\n\n(The investigator agreed to talk with CNN, but a police spokesperson called off the interview. )\n\nTaken together, the current state of crime and policing in Minneapolis — from slow response times to recent brutality complaints to the poor clearance rates — has fostered an atmosphere of distrust.\n\nThe distrust paves the way for some to assume bad intentions. Dave Bicking, a board member of the Minneapolis-based Community United Against Police Brutality, goes so far as to suggest the police since Floyd’s death may have engaged in a “sickout” — that is, that officers are purposefully sluggish to respond to or investigate certain crimes.\n\n“It’s still going on to a considerable extent — it was dramatic in the beginning,” Bicking told CNN. “The police would simply, if they showed up at all, say, ‘Oh, we don’t have anybody to deal with that,’ or ‘You people don’t want us here, so we’re not going to do anything.’”\n\nDave Bicking outside his facility, Communities United Against Police Brutality, in Minneapolis. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nBicking, who has been publicly critical of the “defund” tactic from the get-go, said he bases the sickout claim on a drop-off in jail bookings shortly after Floyd’s death and on more than 2,300 interviews the CUAPB has conducted over the past year and a half with Minneapolis residents about their experiences with the MPD.\n\nHe added that the CUAPB persuaded the Department of Justice to include in its investigation of the MPD the alleged lack of Minneapolis police investigations into murders of people of color.\n\nChief Huffman did not respond to follow-up questions related to sickout allegations, but in her earlier interview with CNN she said Minneapolis has unique challenges.\n\nFor one, she said, Minneapolis has a relatively low rate of domestic murders, which are typically easier to solve, and a high rate of gang murders, which are more difficult.\n\nBut the bigger factor again comes down to attrition. Huffman said the Minneapolis Police Department has lost about 100 investigators in its investigations bureau since early 2020.\n\nStill, Huffman said the MPD is committed to solving homicides, adding that unsolved murders can have serious negative repercussions that ripple through communities for years and devastate families.\n\n“The lack of justice for families who have had family members murdered is completely unacceptable,” she said. “And it’s incumbent on us to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to solve those cases.”\n\nHuffman’s new boss, Cedric Alexander — who was hired in August as the city’s first ever community safety commissioner — said he understands the community’s frustration.\n\n“When you have a body drop and another body drops and another body drops, what you have oftentimes is ongoing violence – it certainly does overwhelm an agency that already is struggling with a great deal of shortages,” he told CNN. “It does give people the perception nothing is being done. But I can assure you that it is. And in any of these violent cases where we have victims, it is taken at a very high priority.”\n\nHow ‘defund’ failed\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey is shouted at by protesters at a Defund the Police march in early June of 2020 to protest the police killing of George Floyd. (Victor J. Blue/The New York Times/Redux) Victor J. Blue/The New York Times/Redux\n\nIn June of 2020, nine of the Minneapolis City Council’s 13 members stood on a stage adorned with an oversized sign saying “DEFUND POLICE.”\n\nAround the same time, in another spectacle that made national news, Mayor Frey was booed and jeered by activists at a George Floyd protest near his home for saying — in response to a question — that he did not support “the full abolition of police.” As he walked away, the crowd broke into a “Go home Jacob!” chant.\n\n“It was a lonely walk,” Frey told CNN recently. “At that moment there was a very loud chorus of people, including elected officials … that were all calling very loudly to defund the police.”\n\nIt’s well established that those widely viewed events boosted a movement in Minneapolis that would later fail at the polls last November. Lesser known is how the very community most directly impacted by crime and policing in the city — the north side — was among the least supportive of the “defund” idea.\n\n“I think what’s at issue is the White progressives’ belief that they’re helping us,” said Lisa Clemons, a former Minneapolis police officer, who is Black and runs a gun-violence organization called A Mother’s Love in north Minneapolis. “Oftentimes they are hurting us.”\n\nClemons said people in north Minneapolis don’t want to get rid of cops – “they just want respectful cops.”\n\nLisa Clemons, a resident of north Minneapolis and former cop, at the Northside Community Center at Cub Foods. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nMinneapolis voters not only resoundingly rejected what was seen as the “defund” initiative, they also voted to strengthen the office of the mayor and reelected Frey, who’d become a local avatar for moderate Democrats put off by the party’s most liberal wing.\n\nThe Minneapolis area with the largest Black population — Ward 5 on the north side — also proved a strong base of support for Frey in his reelection, according to a CNN analysis of voter data.\n\nFrey said that while no demographic group is a monolith, White progressives in the aftermath of Floyd’s death often seemed out of sync with ordinary Black residents.\n\n“I heard a lot of White activists purport to be speaking on behalf of communities of color. And I was listening to them — listening to communities of color — and they weren’t saying the same things,” Frey said. “I’d walk down the street and I’d hear from White people, ‘Defund the police! Defund the police!’ And then I’d hear from a Black person a half block later, ‘Hey, we really need to have some additional help.’”\n\nSheila Nezhad, a community organizer who turned out to be one of Frey’s most competitive mayoral opponents in November, noted that turnout was lower in north Minneapolis than the citywide average, and that the advocacy group — called Yes 4 Minneapolis — that proposed the ballot measure that came to be seen as the “defund” referendum was led by Black people.\n\n“And I’m not White,” she said. “So when Jacob Frey talks about only White people want to defund or whatever … I think that he is perhaps shaping the narrative to benefit his political goals.”\n\nEven before Floyd’s killing, the MPD had drawn criticism for its approach to policing the Black community.\n\nIn 2016, anti-police protests erupted after it was announced that two Minneapolis officers involved in the shooting death of Jamar Clark – a 24-year-old Black man who scuffled with the officers and, according to authorities, reached for one of their guns — would not be charged. Two years later, after responding to calls of a man shooting a gun in the air, police chased and fatally shot 31-year-old Thurman Blevins, who said “please don’t shoot me” as he ran away from them; body cameras showed officers yelling at him to drop his gun. Police say Blevins turned with his gun toward the officers, who ultimately were not charged.\n\nAnd then came May 25, 2020. In a nine-minute video that seemed to last an eternity, a police officer defiantly knelt on the neck of a handcuffed, face-down Floyd, whose pleas for help went unanswered until he fell silent. Now infamous, the officer, Derek Chauvin – who’d already had 18 prior complaints filed against him – was convicted of Floyd’s murder and sentenced to 21 years in federal prison.\n\nA person holds a sign displaying a portrait of George Floyd during a vigil at an art installation honoring victims of police burtaliuty in Minneapolis in June 2020. (Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images) Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“For me, it was a moment of deep grief,” said Nezhad, who still wants to abolish the Minneapolis Police Department. “And the days that followed offered a glimpse into just how ready so many people are for massive change.”\n\nIn April, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights released a report, two years in the making, charging that the Minneapolis department’s officers have engaged in a pattern or practice of race discrimination when conducting traffic stops or using force. It called for ordering a consent decree, which is essentially a court-enforced settlement to reform the department. The report also blasted the MPD for “ineffective accountability,” saying that “almost every investigation of a police misconduct complaint against an MPD officer … is assessed or guided by sworn MPD officers.”\n\nThe city is in negotiations with the human rights department over the consent decree, and Frey has indicated that some of his budget priorities are in direct response to the report.\n\nDon Samuels — a former Minneapolis City Councilman who surprised political observers this summer by nearly defeating US Rep. Ilhan Omar, an icon of progressive politics in America — said the video of Floyd’s death was the most “evil thing I had ever seen.”\n\n“That was so painful — just painful to watch and to see a Black man, of dark complexion, under the knee of a dispassionate White male,” Samuels said. “It conjured up all kinds of slavery imagery.”\n\nAnd yet, Samuels, a 73-year-old immigrant from Jamaica — who lives in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods of north Minneapolis — experienced another kind of dismay when he saw the nine council members on the Defund stage while watching the news on TV with his wife.\n\nDon Samuels, the moderate Democrat who nearly unseated US Rep. Ilhan Omar on August 9, photographed in his home in north Minneapolis. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\n“It was like a World Trade Center moment for us,” he told CNN. “Our jaws fell to the floor. Literally, we were aghast. We looked at each other and said, ‘Oh, my God. It’s going to be Crime City in Minneapolis.’”\n\nThat summer, Samuels joined the residents of north Minneapolis who sued the city for its police shortage. Half of the plaintiffs are Black.\n\nDuring his campaign for Congress, Samuels ran a kind of middle-ground campaign on public safety.\n\n“We don’t have to choose safety or police – we can have both/and,” Samuels said at a town hall campaign event in August. “Let’s get rid of the bad police, let’s fix the fixable police.”\n\nHe lost, but the “both/and” approach appears to be the current path that the city of Minneapolis is on.\n\n‘Both-and’: A post-Defund approach\n\nOn a morning this August, in a scene that offered a sharp contrast from two years ago — when Mayor Frey made his “lonely walk” through an angry crowd — he and Commissioner Alexander, both smartly dressed, strode triumphantly through corridors of City Hall.\n\nAlexander, a 67-year-old former deputy sheriff with a doctorate in psychology who was hand-picked by Frey, had just been confirmed as the city’s community safety commissioner in a contentious council meeting. His newly created position amounts to the first piece of Frey’s proposed plan to combine 911, police, fire, neighborhood safety and emergency management under one roof.\n\nCedric Alexander speaks about policing in America during CivicCon at the Rex Theatre in downtown Pensacola, Florida, in September 2021. (Gregg Pachkowski/News-Journal/USA Today Network) Gregg Pachkowski/USA Today Network\n\n“The number one, first priority is the fact that people in this community don’t feel that they’re safe,” said Alexander — who served on the 21st Century Task Force on Policing under former President Barack Obama — during an impromptu press conference minutes after his hiring. “The fact is that we have violent crime that’s occurring, and occurring way too frequently.”\n\nAlexander, who retired in 2017 as the public safety director in DeKalb County, Georgia, in the metro Atlanta area, added that the MPD isn’t likely to become fully staffed overnight — “probably not even in our careers” — and stressed the importance of data-driven policing and building relationships.\n\n“If we don’t build relationships with these people in our communities, you ain’t solving crime nowhere,” said Alexander, a former CNN contributor on law enforcement issues.\n\nOsler, the St. Thomas professor, said at the moment, people don’t want to work for the MPD, “where officers are not respected. And to be straight-up about it, MPD earned that lack of respect.”\n\nIn the meantime, he said, the department needs to focus on two key metrics: improving homicide clearance rates and executing search warrants for violent criminals, which, Osler acknowledged, is no easy feat.\n\n“Think about it from the perspective of the person executing that warrant,” Osler said. “You’re going to bust down the door and who you know is on the other side is someone who’s probably already shot somebody. That’s a tough job. No wonder people don’t want to do it.”\n\nExterior of the police department's 3rd Precinct in south Minneapolis that was burned by rioters in May of 2020. To this day it remains boarded up. Its officers are currently headquartered a few miles away downtown. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nOn the policy front, the wheels of change seem to be grinding forward, however slowly.\n\nSince Gov. Tim Walz signed a police accountability law two years ago that banned chokeholds and “warrior” style police training, the city of Minneapolis appears to be finding a path forward that avoids having to choose between building the police force and reimagining public safety. The city is not only looking at further beefing up the police budget but is also piloting a slate of programs that send unarmed responders to nonviolent 911 calls. Mayor Frey has proposed making them permanent in his recommended budget for 2023-2024.\n\nFrey argues that the centerpiece of his proposed public safety plan – creating a new Office of Community Safety — captures much of what the “defund” movement was after in the first place.\n\nThe concept is to “match the best possible people with what is actually being experienced on the street,” Frey said. “Anybody who was for that before but is not for it now is pretty disingenuous.”\n\nWhen it comes to hiring, the MPD is trying to entice young blood with incentives — for instance by covering the cost of tuition for potential recruits who need law-enforcement coursework but only have a high school degree. It’s a big challenge — not just because so many officers have left, but also because there is a shortage of young people across the country getting into law enforcement, Alexander said.\n\nThe city has made headway when it comes to filling the top job: Frey recently announced three finalists — all of them from outside Minneapolis — for the permanent chief position, which Huffman has filled on an interim basis since December.\n\nLast summer, the police presence in the city was so thin — and the rate of violence so high — that a group of volunteers in the faith community went to heroic measures to break the cycle.\n\nThe idea was simple. In an initiative called 21 Days of Peace, church volunteers simply hung out in some of the most deadly neighborhoods to engage in violence prevention.\n\nThe effort was considered a success, but for one volunteer it came at a cost.\n\nGloria Howard, a grandmother, had just handed out snow cones to two women with young children at one of the violence hotspots near a liquor store on Broadway Avenue when a barrage of gunfire sent people scattering.\n\nHoward crumpled to the ground. When she tried to get up, she couldn’t — she’d been shot twice.\n\nGloria Howard, a survivor of gun violence, poses for a portrait a few yards away from where she was struck by bullets in north Minneapolis. She was serving snow cones as a volunteer for 21 Days of Peace when it happened. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nPeople from a nearby church rushed out of the building to render aid and call the police.\n\n“When I got to the hospital, the doctors were like, ‘Well, you’re some lucky lady and you must be somebody special because you have no metal fragments in your body,’” Howard said. The bullets, she said, “went through and through.”\n\nHoward, who was against the “defund” initiative, said there are specific reforms she would like to see, starting with a push to require more officers to live in the city they serve.\n\n(A 2017 Star Tribune report found that just 8% of MPD officers lived in Minneapolis. Chauvin lived in the suburb of Oakdale, where nearly 72% of the residents are White.)\n\n“All Black men are not big and scary,” Howard said. “All Black women are not angry. So, you know, you have to be able to know the community.”\n\nBut she realizes that even with such reforms, improvement would take time.\n\n“I don’t even walk Broadway anymore,” Howard said, while eying the thoroughfare from a distance, close to where she was shot. “I’ve seen the cars speeding up and down when they’re chasing each other. And then when they start shooting, it can come from anywhere. So I don’t even do that anymore. And I never used to be afraid coming over here.”", "authors": ["Rob Kuznia.

The capital recorded 19 new local cases on Sunday, bringing the total in the city since April 22 to 60, according to national health data released Monday morning.\n\n“The city has recently seen several outbreaks involving multiple transmission chains, and the risk of continued and undetected transmission is high. The situation is urgent and grim,” municipal official Tian Wei told reporters Saturday. “The whole city must act immediately.”\n\nThe pressure to contain the outbreak in the capital comes as cases continue to grow in Shanghai, despite a failed weeks-long lockdown that has brought the financial hub to a halt. The city reported more than 19,000 new cases and 51 deaths on Sunday, according to official figures released Monday morning.\n\nThe daily death count marks a record high since city officials first reported fatalities in the city’s ongoing outbreak last Monday, though questions have been raised about whether the numbers account for all fatalities.\n\nIn Beijing, authorities mobilized to curb transmission, placing several residential communities in Chaoyang under “control management,” according to state media, using a term that typically means residents are barred from leaving the area while they undergo testing. A district official on Sunday warned that disruptions to business and work were inevitable in the course of fighting the outbreak.\n\nScreening would be upped in tour groups in the city, after cases were detected among a group of mainly elderly tourists who were now under quarantine, officials said on Saturday. At least one village in a suburban district of Beijing linked to a positive case was also closed down as mass testing was carried out.\n\nThe rush to contain the outbreak comes as fears grow across China that more stringent measures could be in store as the country sticks with a stringent “zero-Covid” policy to eliminate the spread of the virus in each outbreak.\n\nThat policy has faced its most stark challenge since March 1 as the highly transmissible Omicron variant sparked several simultaneous outbreaks. Case counts have ballooned to unprecedented levels in China, driven by large outbreaks in northeastern Jilin province and Shanghai.\n\nLockdowns and enforced quarantines in Shanghai have sparked anger and desperation among citizens, who have struggled to access to food and medical care.

That prompted rating agencies to downgrade Sri Lanka to near default levels, meaning the country lost access to overseas markets.\n\nSri Lanka then had to fall back on its foreign exchange reserves to pay off government debt, shrinking its reserves from $6.9 billion in 2018 to $2.2 billion this year. This impacted imports of fuel and other essentials, which sent prices soaring.\n\nTopping all that, the government in March floated the Sri Lankan rupee – meaning its price was determined based on the demand and supply of foreign exchange markets.\n\nThat move appeared aimed at devaluing the currency to qualify for a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and encourage remittances.\n\nHowever, the plunging of the rupee against the US dollar only made things worse for ordinary Sri Lankans.\n\nWhat does this mean for people on the ground?\n\nFor Sri Lankans, the crisis has turned their daily lives into an endless cycle of waiting in lines for basic goods, many of which are being rationed.\n\nIn recent weeks, shops have been forced to close because they can’t run fridges, air conditioners or fans. Soldiers are stationed at gas stations to calm customers, who line up for hours in the searing heat to fill their tanks. Some people have even died waiting.\n\nOne mother in the capital, Colombo, told CNN she was waiting for propane gas so that she could cook meals for her family. Others say the cost of bread has more than doubled, while auto rickshaw and taxi drivers say the fuel rations are too meager to make a living.\n\nSome are caught in an impossible position – they have to work to feed their families, but must also queue for supplies. One street sweeper with two young sons told CNN she quietly slips away from work to join lines for food, before hurrying back.\n\nEven members of the middle class with savings are frustrated, fearing they could run out of essentials like medicine or gas. And life is made more difficult by frequent power cuts that plunge Colombo into darkness, sometimes for more than 10 hours at a time.\n\nSri Lankans watch a burning bus during a protest outside the President's home in Colombo on April 1. Eranga Jayawardena/AP\n\nWhat’s happening with the protests?\n\nProtesters in Colombo took to the streets in late March, demanding government action and accountability. Public frustration and anger erupted on March 31, when demonstrators hurled bricks and started fires outside the President’s private residence.\n\nPolice used tear gas and water cannons to break up the protests, and imposed a 36-hour curfew afterward. President Rajapaksa declared a nationwide public emergency on April 1, giving authorities powers to detain people without a warrant, and blocked social media platforms.\n\nBut protests went ahead the next day in defiance of the curfew, prompting police to arrest hundreds of demonstrators.\n\nProtests have continued in the days since, though they remained largely peaceful. On Tuesday night, crowds of student protesters surrounded Rajapaksa’s residence again, calling for his resignation.\n\nThe emergency ordinance was revoked on April 5.\n\nA protester outside the President's private residence in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on March 31. Eranga Jayawardena/AP\n\nWhat’s happening with the Cabinet?\n\nThe government’s entire cabinet was effectively dissolved on April 3 due to mass resignations by top ministers.\n\nSome 26 cabinet ministers stepped down that weekend, including the President’s nephew, who criticized the apparent social media blackout as something he would “never condone.” Other major figures including the governor of the central bank also resigned.\n\nFacing an administration in chaos, on Monday the President attempted a reshuffle he hoped would placate the opposition. Four ministers, including a finance minister, were appointed to temporarily run the government, while several others were handed new posts in an attempt to keep the country functioning “until a full cabinet is appointed,” according to a presidential news release.\n\nBut just a day later, the temporary finance minister quit – explaining he had only taken the position due to “multitudes of requests made,” and that he realized afterward “fresh and proactive and unconventional steps need to be taken.”\n\nAnd the reshuffle failed to stop further desertions. The ruling Sri Lanka People’s Front Coalition (also known as the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna) lost 41 seats by Tuesday after members from several partner parties pulled out to continue as independent groups. The coalition was left with only 104 seats, losing its majority in parliament.\n\nWhat has the government said?\n\nPresident Rajapaksa issued a statement April 4 but did not directly address the resignations, only urging all parties to “work together for the sake of all the citizens and future generations.”\n\n“The current crisis is a result of several economic factors and global developments,” the statement read. “As one of the leading democratic countries in Asia, solutions should be found to this within a democratic framework.”\n\nLater that day, when announcing the cabinet reshuffle, the President’s office released a statement saying Rajapaksa “sought the support of all the people to overcome the economic challenge faced by the country.”\n\nOn April 6, Chief Government Whip Johnston Fernando said during a parliament session that Rajapaksa will not resign “under any circumstances.” Fernando is a member of the ruling coalition and is seen as a close ally to the President.\n\nPreviously, Rajapaksa has said he is attempting to resolve the issue, saying in an address to the nation last month that “this crisis was not created by me.”\n\nOn April 1, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa – the President’s elder brother and a former President himself – told CNN it was wrong to say the government had mismanaged the economy. Instead, Covid-19 was one of the causes, he said.\n\nSri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa (center) addresses the nation in Colombo on February 4. ISHARA S. KODIKARA/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nSri Lanka is now seeking financial support from the IMF and turning to regional powers that may be able to help.\n\nDuring last month’s address, President Rajapaksa said he had weighed the pros and cons of working with the IMF and had decided to pursue a bailout from the Washington-based institution – something his government had been reluctant to do.\n\nSri Lanka has also requested help from China and India, with New Delhi already issuing a credit line of $1 billion in March – but some analysts warned that this assistance might prolong the crisis rather than solve it.\n\nThere is still much uncertainty around what comes next; national consumer price inflation has almost tripled, from 6.2% in September to 17.5% in February, according to the country’s central bank. And Sri Lanka has to repay about $4 billion in debt over the rest of this year, including a $1 billion international sovereign bond that matures in July.\n\nAnd the situation has prompted alarm from international observers. Speaking at a news briefing on April 5, Liz Throssell, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed concern over Sri Lanka’s official response.\n\nThe government’s curfew, social media blackout, and police action in breaking up the protests could prevent or discourage people from expressing their grievances, she said, adding that these measures “should not be used to stifle dissent or hinder peaceful protest.” She said the UN was watching “closely,” and warned against “the drift to militarization and the weakening of institutional checks and balances in Sri Lanka.”", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/17/asia/operation-linebacker-ii-50th-anniversary-intl-hnk-ml-dst/index.html", "title": "The Christmas bombings: A US airman recalls the Vietnam War's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt was one of the heaviest bombardments in history. A shock-and-awe campaign of overwhelming air power aimed at bombing into submission a determined opponent that, despite being vastly outgunned, had withstood everything the world’s most formidable war machine could throw at it.\n\nOperation Linebacker II saw more than 200 American B-52 bombers fly 730 sorties and drop over 20,000 tons of bombs on North Vietnam over a period of 12 days in December 1972, in a brutal assault aimed at shaking the Vietnamese “to their core,” in the words of then US national security adviser Henry Kissinger.\n\n“They’re going to be so god damned surprised,” US President Richard Nixon replied to Kissinger on December 17, the eve of the mission.\n\nIn what would become known as “the Christmas bombings” in America and “the 11 days and nights” in Vietnam (no bombing took place on Christmas day), swathes of Hanoi were obliterated.\n\nAn estimated 1,600 Vietnamese were killed amid some of the most harrowing scenes of the conflict, in an operation likened by some to the Hamburg raids of World War II for the sheer scale of the destruction and civilian death toll.\n\nThe devastating losses were not all one way. At the same time, the United States Air Force sustained losses that today would seem unfathomable. Fifteen B-52s – the pride of America’s fleet – were shot down, six in one day alone, and 33 airmen lost.\n\nTragically, some believe all these deaths were largely in vain, with historians to this day debating the extent of the operation’s influence on the wider conflict.\n\nIn the aftermath of the operation, both sides claimed to have come out on top – Washington claiming it brought the Vietnamese back to the table for peace talks and Hanoi painting it as a heroic act of resistance in which it took everything its foe had and still remained standing.\n\nBut if the fog of war made it hard to judge those claims, half a century on it has done little to dim the memories of the the US airmen who can still recall flying through the North Vietnamese air defenses.\n\n“It almost felt like you could walk across the tips of those missiles in the sky there were so many fired at you,” recalled one retired US airman.\n\nThe flak was so bright, he said, you could “read a newspaper in the cockpit.”\n\nA US B-52 bomber flies over Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nDeath at Christmas\n\nThe airman, interviewed by CNN to mark the 50th anniversary of the “Christmas bombings,” recalled a mood at his base that was anything but festive.\n\nTo give the the best cover possible, the bombing missions were conducted at night, with the B-52s flying out of U Tapao, Thailand, and Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. Because those that made it back to base would land in darkness, the crews would not realize until breakfast the next day who among their colleagues had failed to return.\n\n“You’d see the trailer next to yours with doors open on both ends and airmen loading (the occupant’s) personal belongings into a trunk to be shipped back to their families, so you knew that crew didn’t make it,” said Wayne Wallingford, an electronic warfare officer based in U Tapao who flew on seven of the 11 raids B-52s undertook over Hanoi.\n\n“It was pretty sobering to see that.”\n\nWayne Wallingford in front of a B-52 during the Vietnam war. Courtesy Wayne Wallingford\n\nOver the 12-day period that grim ritual was performed 33 times.\n\nBut while the US Air Force’s losses were unprecedented, so too was the carnage caused by the B-52s.\n\n“The resulting physical destruction was staggering: 1,600 military installations, miles of railway lines, hundreds of trucks and railway cars, eighty percent of electrical power plants, and countless factories and other structures were taken out of commission,” wrote Vietnam War historian Pierre Asselin in his 2018 book, “Vietnam’s American War: A History.”\n\n“The Linebacker bombings crippled the North’s vital organs, obliterating the results of its communist transformation, and its ability to sustain the war in the South by extension,” Asselin wrote.\n\nSuch was the devastation that one Soviet diplomat warned that North Vietnam faced becoming “a wasteland.”\n\nA picture released on December 19, 1972, of Vietnamese people carrying victims of the American air raids on Hanoi and North Vietnam. AFP/Getty Images\n\n‘To this day, they smell the bodies’\n\nThe human cost on the ground was almost indescribable.\n\nDuong Van Mai Elliott, a Pulitzer Prize finalist for her novel recounting her family’s experience, “Sacred Willow: Four Generations in the Life of a Vietnamese Family,” said the Christmas bombings were her relatives’ most frightening experience of the whole war.\n\n“The buildings shook,” Elliott said. “They thought they were going to die.”\n\n“Those who survived told me when they went out to look, they found dead bodies lying around,” she said. “To this day, they can still smell the rotting bodies.”\n\nIn one area of Hanoi, Kham Thien, 287 people were killed in one night alone – mostly women, children and elderly – and 2,000 buildings destroyed by US bombs, according to the Vietnamese newspaper, VN Express International.\n\nAn Agence France Presse journalist, who visited Kham Thien shortly after the US bombing, described a scene of “mass ruins … desolation and mourning.”\n\n“On Kham Thien some houses still stand, but many of these are without roofs or windows. Dozens of craters, some 12 yards in diameter and three yards deep, pockmark the area,” Jean Leclerc du Sablon wrote in a dispatch that appeared in The New York Times on December 29, 1972.\n\nOne survivor in particular caught his eye.\n\n“On a pile of ruins, an old woman held her hands to her face and chanted hauntingly, in near religious tone: ‘Oh, my son, where are you now? May I find you to bury you. Americans, how savage you are.’”\n\nNixon’s bid for ‘peace with honor’\n\nThe driving force behind the Christmas bombings was a recently reelected President Richard Nixon, who was keen to wrap up America’s involvement in an unpopular war before the beginning of his second term in January.\n\nNixon had been reelected just over a month earlier on a promise to attain “peace with honor” in Vietnam – where the US had been fighting since 1965 – and was stung when talks with North Vietnam suddenly fell through.\n\nHe warned Hanoi it would face consequences if it did not return to the negotiating table in good faith and ordered Linebacker II even as a new set of demands were being sent to the North Vietnamese.\n\nThe Air Force’s reaction was swift; on December 18, 129 B-52s took off from Guam and Thailand, destination North Vietnam.\n\nWhat was that awaiting the world’s most formidable bombers were the world’s most formidable air defenses.\n\nA B-52 bomber takes off from Andersen Air Force Base in support of Linebacker II. US Air Force\n\n‘America’s fortress’\n\nAt the time, the B-52 bomber was the gold standard of aerial firepower.\n\nThe eight-engine Stratofortress, some of which could carry more than 80,000 pounds of ordnance, first flew in 1954 and was designed to be an intercontinental bomber that could deliver nuclear payloads anywhere in the world.\n\nAlongside intercontinental ballistic missiles and ballistic missile submarines, it formed one prong of the nuclear triad America hoped would deter any possible atomic war with the Soviet Union.\n\nBut in the 1960s it began to take on more conventional bombing missions as the US enlisted its help in its struggle against Soviet-supported communist expansion in Indochina.\n\nThe B-52s were able to fly higher than the naked eye could see, making its attacks both physically and psychologically devastating as its massive payloads would arrive seemingly from nowhere.\n\n“(Nixon) wanted maximum psychological impact on the North Vietnamese, and the B-52 was airpower’s best tool for the job,” historian T.W. Beagle wrote in a 2001 report for the US Air Force’s Air University Press.\n\nStill, as formidable as the B-52s were, the tactics they employed hadn’t changed much since World War II.\n\nAnd for some of their crews, that would prove fatal.\n\nA picture released on December 19, 1972, of American B-52 air raids on Hanoi and North Vietnam shows a North Vietnamese antiaircraft missile. AFP/Getty Images\n\nFly into the danger zone\n\nNorth Vietnam’s air defenses were backed by Soviet-made SA-2 antiaircraft missiles, capable of shooting a 288-pound warhead to altitudes of 60,000 feet at more than three times the speed of sound.\n\nUS aircrew said they looked like telephone poles with lights and would illuminate the entire night sky.\n\nOn the first night of Linebacker II, North Vietnam fired 200 of them at the attacking US bombers and at least five of those missiles found their targets.\n\nThree B-52 were brought down, and two others were damaged.\n\nAs if that were not daunting enough, the crews back at U Tapao were left in no doubt that more casualties were expected.\n\nEtched into Wallingford’s memory are the words of a general that day.\n\n“He said, ‘Well, we thought we were going to lose a lot more of you than we did,’” Wallingford said. “That wasn’t a very motivational speech.”\n\nWayne Wallingford, then and now.\n\nAn open US playbook\n\nThe disastrous first day of the B-52s might have hit morale in U Tapao and Guam, but it had the opposite effect in Hanoi.\n\n“We all feared the B-52 at first because the US said it was invincible,” Nguyen Van Phiet, a North Vietnamese missile gunner credited with downing four B-52s during Linebacker, told Smithsonian magazine in 2014. “But after the first night, we knew the B-52 could be destroyed just like any other aircraft.”\n\nOn the second night, the B-52s fared better with only two damaged out of 93 flying and none lost.\n\nBut by night three, the North Vietnamese gunners had seen the US playbook and knew it as well as their US opponents.\n\nThe bombers would fly in long columns over predetermined tracks and after releasing their payloads would make banked turns to head home – at which point their electronic jamming equipment (meant to thwart antiaircraft batteries) would be facing skyward, leaving them vulnerable.\n\n“We were told for the last two minutes of the bomb run to stay straight and level which means you are a sitting target,” Wallingford said.\n\nOpening the doors to the bomber’s cavernous bomb bay increased its radar signature even further, he said. “It’s kind of a losing proposition.”\n\nTaken together, this meant the raids were “so predictable that any enemy would be able to knock you down kind of like the arcade at the carnival,” Ron Bartlett, another B-52 electronic warfare officer, told a Distinguished Flying Cross Society podcast.\n\nOn night three, six B-52s crashed to the ground.\n\nA picture released on December 19, 1972, of a North Vietnamese antiaircraft gun. AFP/Getty Images\n\nThose losses did not go down well with the American public or Nixon, who “raised holy hell” about the bombers taking the same routes every night and who feared the heavy loss of America’s mightiest warplanes would “create the antithesis of the psychological impact (he) desired,” according to Beagle.\n\nFrom the following night, the bombers were told to approach their targets from varied altitudes and directions; and not to fly single file or over targets they’d just hit.\n\nOver the final seven days of bombing, only six more B-52s were shot down.\n\nWas it all in vain?\n\nAt some point after day eight of the bombings, North Vietnam informed the US it was ready to resume peace talks in Paris.\n\nThis justified the operation, Nixon claimed. But many experts have since suggested this would have happened anyway and that a more patient Nixon could have avoided the horror and bloodshed on both sides.\n\nThey say that by late 1972 Hanoi’s war effort was already on shaky ground. Resources were low, and it would not have been able to sustain its war effort much longer.\n\n“By the time of Linebacker II, the North Vietnamese were prepared to meet the demands outlined in Paris to get the United States out of the war,” wrote Brian Laslie, command historian at the US Air Force Academy, in his 2021 book “Air Power’s Lost Cause.”\n\nAsselin, meanwhile, believes the North Vietnamese Politburo agreed on December 18, just hours before the bombing began, to let Washington know they would return to the peace talks.\n\n“Unfortunately, before it could relay its decision to the White House, it was already too late; Nixon had reached the end of his tether. At 8 p.m., Hanoi time, that same day, the United States commenced its most savage bombing of the North to date,” Asselin wrote.\n\nWinners and winners (and losers)\n\nWhat is not in dispute is that the Paris Peace Talks resumed on January 8, 1973, and an accord was signed on January 27 that ushered in the beginning of the end to US involvement in the war.\n\nIt was signed not only by the US and North Vietnam, but also by the South Vietnamese who had been convinced by Linebacker that, “if North Vietnam attacked again the US would return to bombing Hanoi,” said Peter Layton, a fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia and a former Royal Australian Air Force officer.\n\nWith the accord behind them, both Washington and Hanoi then claimed themselves the victors of Operation Linebacker II.\n\nAirman Wallingford and others are emphatic about a US victory.\n\n“It was the operation that ended the Vietnam conflict and that freed our 591 POWs,” he said. (Those American prisoners of war were released in February and March after the accords were signed.)\n\nBut even in America, some had their doubts.\n\nRobert Hopkins, a former US Air Force pilot, cautioned against falling into the “Linebacker II was a success trap,” saying that for the B-52 pilots it “deeply hurt morale for years to come.”\n\nThere was a more immediate problem, too.\n\nThree years on, with the Communist forces largely replenished and US forces largely out of Vietnam, Hanoi launched the large scale invasion of the South that led to the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975.\n\n“Linebacker II ended the American phase of the war, but its impact only lasted three years. Linebacker II did not bring lasting peace,” Layton said.\n\nIn Hanoi, “the story of the events of late December 1972 was a tale, not of massive loss and destruction, but of heroic resistance by Northerners,” wrote the historian Asselin.\n\n“In fact, the toll on the US forces had been such that it had forced Nixon to beg Hanoi to resume the peace talks, and to unilaterally and unconditionally end the bombing,” he wrote.\n\nOr as Kissinger, the US national security adviser of the time, was reported to have said:\n\n“We bombed the North Vietnamese into accepting our concessions.”", "authors": ["Brad Lendon"], "publish_date": "2022/12/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/30/asia/seoul-itaewon-halloween-crush-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Itaewon: What we know about the deadly Halloween disaster in ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nMost weekends, the narrow alleys of Itaewon, the neon-lit nightlife district in South Korea’s capital Seoul, are busy with partygoers and tourists.

Some even fly into Seoul from other countries in the region for the festivities.\n\nBut for the past two years, celebrations were muted by pandemic restrictions on crowd sizes and mask mandates.\n\nSaturday night marked the first Halloween since the country lifted these restrictions – lending it particular significance for many eager participants in Seoul, as well as international visitors including foreign residents and tourists.\n\nHotels and ticketed events in the neighborhood had been booked solid in advance, and large crowds were expected.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWitnesses told CNN there was very little – if any – crowd control before the mass of people turned deadly.\n\nVideos and photos posted to social media show people crammed together, standing shoulder to shoulder in the narrow street.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter returns to Itaewon's narrow alley one day after the Halloween disaster.

One witness described seeing a police officer shouting during the disaster – but some revelers mistook him for another partygoer.\n\nThe cause of the crush is still under investigation, though officials said there were no gas leaks or fires on site.\n\nWho were the victims?\n\nThe casualties were young, mostly in their teens and early 20s, authorities said. Known for its nightlife and trendy restaurants, Itaewon is popular among backpackers and international students.\n\nAmong the 154 dead were at least 26 foreign nationals, according to authorities, with victims from countries including the United States, China, Iran, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Japan, Australia, Norway, France, Russia, Austria, Vietnam, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.\n\nAll but one of the victims have been identified, South Korea’s Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said in a briefing on Monday.

That number could include multiple reports for the same person, or reports filed Saturday night for people who have since been found.\n\nPolice said there is no active search for those reported missing as they believe no one went missing from the scene; rather, they said the missing person reports have been used to help identify those who died.\n\nEmergency services treat injured people in Seoul on October 30.

When asked whether she had seen any officials trying to limit the number of people entering the alley, she replied: “Before the incident, not at all.”\n\nAnother eyewitness described the situation getting “worse and worse,” saying they could hear “people asking for help for other people, because there were not enough rescuers that can just handle all that.”", "authors": ["Sophie Jeong Gawon Bae Paula Hancocks Hilary Whiteman Jessie Yeung", "Sophie Jeong", "Gawon Bae", "Paula Hancocks", "Hilary Whiteman", "Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/09/08/gander-newfoundland-september-11-terror-attacks-kindess-come-from-away/631329001/", "title": "On 9/11, how Gander, Newfoundland, welcomed 6,700 strangers", "text": "GANDER, Newfoundland — They still don't know what all the fuss is about.\n\nSixteen years ago, this small Canadian town on an island in the North Atlantic Ocean took in nearly 6,700 people – almost doubling its population – when the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in New York and Washington forced 38 planes to land here.\n\nTheir simple hospitality to the unexpected house guests drew worldwide accolades and even inspired a Broadway musical.\n\n“Everyone looks at us and says that’s an amazing thing that you did, and the bottom line is I don’t think it was an amazing thing, I think it was the right thing you do,” says Diane Davis, 53, a now-retired teacher who helped 750 people housed at the town's elementary school.\n\nIn a world today seemingly fraught with division, terrorism and hate, they’d do it all over again. Kindness is woven into the very fabric of their nature — they don’t know any other way to live.\n\n“What we consider the most simple thing in life is to help people,” says Mayor Claude Elliott, who retires this month after serving as the town’s leader for 21 years. “You’re not supposed to look at people’s color, their religion, their sexual orientation — you look at them as people.”\n\nTo give you a glimpse of life here, start with this: Many Ganderites don’t lock the doors to their homes or cars. Everyone says hello to everyone. People know their neighbors. “My love” or “my dear” adorn every other sentence — except the Newfie accent makes the “my” sound like “me.”\n\nStill, there’s a wariness here: Not for the town itself, nor its future, nor the anchor of civility it represents. Instead, there’s a concern for the rest of the world, especially the U.S., as it faces terrorism, rogue nations and violent protests in the streets.\n\n“I'm scared at the way we're going and what the world will look like in 10 years,” says Elliott, 67. “If we keep on going, we’re going to set our world back 100 years.”\n\nA sinking feeling\n\nWhen Garry Tuff, then acting manager of safety and security for emergency response services at Gander International Airport, saw the second plane hit the World Trade Center, he knew his town of 10,000 people would be impacted. The airport here marks the closest point between Europe and the U.S. and is a preferred emergency landing spot for medical and other emergencies.\n\nThe 38 planes came “fast and furious” into the airport a short while later.\n\nAfter figuring out how to park all the planes, some of which later started sinking into the pavement because of their weight and the warm temperatures, officials spent the next 24 hours unloading luggage and people. Passengers faced intense scrutiny as they passed through customs. “Everybody was a suspect,” says Des Dillon, 75, then the manager of the Canadian Red Cross in Gander.\n\nBut everyone was a guest, too. Beyond the basics of food and water, some passengers on board needed medicine. Many left prescriptions in checked, inaccessible luggage. Pharmacists in town worked around the clock, calling dozens of countries to fill prescriptions.\n\nThen, there were the smokers on board, unable to get a fix for hours. “We bought every bit of nicotine gum that was in town,” Tuff says.\n\nWelcome to Gander, casserole city\n\nTo say this town of 10,000 people and its surrounding communities welcomed the passengers and crew from nearly 100 countries with open arms is an understatement. The town all but shut down for the “plane people,” inspiring the Tony-award winning Broadway musical Come From Away.\n\n“We did not know how we would be affected, if these people were staying, if the people who were coming were good people or not so good people,” says Linda Sweetapple, 54, business manager and partner at Sweetapple Accounting Group. “We just knew that we had to make room for them and take care of them. They were here, and they needed our help.”\n\nAs the planes, still packed with passengers, sat for hours at the airport, the town bustled with activity. Volunteers readied makeshift shelters — every school, gym, community center, church and camp, any place that could fit a planeload of people. Gander’s 500 hotel rooms were reserved for pilots and flight crews.\n\nBus drivers in the middle of a nasty strike laid down picket signs. Donations of toiletries, clothes, toys, towels, toothbrushes, pillows, blankets and bedding piled up. For security reasons, passengers weren’t allowed to take checked bags.\n\nGander residents began cooking — a lot. Grocery store shelves went bare. The Walmart ran out of nearly everything — underwear was a particularly hot commodity — and the local hockey rink transformed into the world’s largest refrigerator.\n\n“It was like casserole city,” says Reg Wright, 43, president and CEO of Gander International Airport.\n\n‘Poster child for hospitality’\n\nStuck on planes for up to 31 hours since taking off from Europe and in the age before smartphones and social media, many passengers didn’t know exactly what caused their diversion to this tiny Canadian province. Those who did still couldn’t fathom the terror attacks in the U.S. without seeing them.\n\nWhen passengers finally saw the destruction, Gander Police Constable Oz Fudge, 62, remembers the gasps.\n\n“You hear this ‘huh’ when the plane hit the towers,” says Fudge, the town’s police constable. “That sound I hear all the time, of the shock that’s on their faces as they’re standing there looking at this TV and the look of loss on their faces.\n\n\"I’ll live with that for the rest of my life.\"\n\nThe outpouring of kindness in the town only multiplied over the next five days. Gander residents took passengers sightseeing, moose hunting, berry picking and barbecuing. They entertained with music, stopped anyone walking down the street in case they wanted a ride and brought strangers into their homes for showers or even as guests for a few nights. They refused to accept money, though passengers later donated thousands to the town.\n\n“They couldn’t comprehend what we were doing,” says Dave Blundon, 67, who took in one of the families. “The way they looked at you — they almost wanted to touch you to make sure you’re real.”\n\nRobert Steuber, 55, stranded with his wife and elderly father-in-law after their Paris to St. Louis jet diverted, never felt like an outsider.\n\n“That whole community is the poster child for how hospitality and just a sheer act of humanity should be because they had such a high level of open arms, and come in and welcome and here’s my house,” says Steuber, whose St. Louis family eventually ended up with the Blundons. “It just absolutely floored me.”\n\nThe 'come from aways'\n\nIsrael, Austria, Spain, Poland, France, the Philippines, Iran, Italy, England, Germany, Thailand, Belgium, Ukraine, Africa, Hungary, Uganda, Senegal, Russia, United Arab Emirates and just about every state in the USA. The “come from aways,” as Newfoundlanders call anyone not from the island, were from all over the world, and despite the intense situation, no one in Gander batted an eye — prejudice against anyone is an entirely foreign concept here.\n\nToday, the crosswalk in front of Gander’s town hall is painted as a rainbow, and churches raised thousands of Canadian dollars to welcome four Syrian refugee families into the community, with a fifth scheduled to arrive next year. Many here don’t understand the division and hate in other parts of the world.\n\n“One thing this world is lacking today is common sense, that’s going out the door. We have to set more of an example and show the world we can all live in harmony regardless of what we are,” Elliott, the mayor, says.\n\nThat lesson wove its way into and changed Kevin Tuerff’s life. Sixteen years after his Air France flight from Paris to New York diverted to Gander, Tuerff, 51, is a character in the musical, author of the book Channel of Peace: Stranded in Gander on 9/11 and the force behind a Pay It Forward 9/11 movement that urges everyone to perform acts of kindness each year.\n\nGander is like a second home to him. “They are a shining beacon for how America once was kind to strangers, immigrants and refugees, and we need to get back that way,” he says.\n\nYet, over and over again, residents here say what happened in Gander isn’t unique, that anyone would lend a hand in a crisis, even pointing to residents in Texas and around the U.S. who helped during Hurricane Harvey.\n\n“No matter where you go people are good. I truly believe that in my heart. There’s 1% arseholes everywhere and if this happened where you live, you would help,” says Karen Mills, 54, manager of the Comfort Inn in Gander. “But Newfoundlanders, we’re a different breed in a lot of ways.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/08"}]}

The watch will stay in effect until 8:00 p.m. CDT.\n\nOverall, much of the central and eastern United States remains at risk for severe thunderstorms Tuesday from Texas to Wyoming and as far east as Pennsylvania and the Carolinas, according to the Weather Prediction Center. More than 13 million people in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky were at \"enhanced risk\" of seeing storms capable of unleashing \"very large hail\" and strong tornadoes.\n\nScattered supercell thunderstorms were forecast to spread across southern and eastern Indiana into western Ohio into late Tuesday. Supercells are the least common type of thunderstorm and tend to produce severe weather, including damaging winds, large hail and sometimes tornadoes, according to the weather service.\n\nIn addition to Chicago and Indianapolis, other metro areas at greatest risk for severe weather on Tuesday included Cincinnati, Columbus and Louisville, the Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nTuesday's foul weather comes a day after strong storms battered the Plains region on Monday, spinning up multiple tornadoes that killed at least one person, destroyed buildings and knocked out power to thousands of households.\n\nThe threat of severe weather is forecast to continue across the Ohio Valley and mid-South regions on Wednesday, the Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The violent weather outbreak has caused nearly 250 incidents of severe weather since Monday, including more than a dozen tornadoes and large hail, according to AccuWeather.\n\n∎ At 7 p.m., more than 50,000 customers were without electricity across the region that saw storms over the previous 24 hours, the database maintained by USA TODAY. That included nearly 31,000 customers in Michigan and roughly 7,000 each in Missouri and Oklahoma. It did not include another 45,000 customers without electricity in Colorado after winds as high as 80-90 mph on Monday.\n\n∎ Windy conditions and lower humidity could also pose a risk for critical fire weather across southeast Colorado, the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle region and much of New Mexico.\n\n∎ Two school districts in northeastern Oklahoma, Bartlesville Public Schools and Barnsdall Public Schools, canceled classes on Tuesday citing power outages and road closures. Both communities were ravaged by a powerful tornado on Monday night.\n\n∎ Oklahoma's governor, Kevin Stitt, will travel to Barnsdall Tuesday afternoon to survey the damage to the small town: \"Devastating images coming out of Barnsdall, OK, this morning,\" the governor posted on X. \"First responders spent the night executing search and rescue operations.

Hold them in your prayers!\"\n\nTornadoes hit Oklahoma: 1 person dead, 7 injured, dozens of homes damaged\n\nOn Monday, at least 17 tornadoes were spotted across the Plains region, with the most damage occurring in Oklahoma where multiple people were injured and one person in Barnsdall, a small community about 40 miles north of Tulsa, was killed, KOTV reported.\n\nThe northeastern Oklahoma communities of Barnsdall and Bartlesville experienced a damaging tornado that caused injuries, with at least seven people injured in Barnsdall, CBS News Texas reported.\n\nOklahoma Highway Patrol reported around 30 to 40 homes were damaged in the Barnsdall area, which was also hit by a tornado on April 1, according to the state's Department of Emergency Management. Officials also reported a natural gas leak in Barnsdall.\n\nCrews from numerous jurisdictions responded to areas throughout northeast Oklahoma to assist with medical transport, traffic control and search and rescue operations. Other counties reported flash flooding and damaged structures. Oklahoma was hit with tornadoes just last week that devastated some parts of the state, leaving at least four dead and 100 injured.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa has a crew on the ground doing damage assessments along the track of the Barnsdall tornado and expects to have a report available later Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nSlew of tornadoes slam southwest Michigan Tuesday\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency in four counties after a slew of tornadoes barreled through the southwestern part of the state and left a trail of damage in its wake.\n\n“My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight’s severe weather in southwest Michigan,” Whitmer said. “State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nTwo \"large and extremely dangerous\" tornadoes were confirmed in Michigan shortly after 6 p.m., the weather service said. One hit south of Kalamazoo near Portage, moving east, and the other was near Burlington, about 9 miles northwest of Coldwater moving northeast.\n\nCity officials said Tuesday evening that two tornadoes were believed to have touched down in Portage, causing severe damage to residential and commercial properties. The city said several people were displaced, multiple trees were down on roads, and there were reports of gas leaks.\n\nA woman taking cover from the tornado in Portage was hit by debris as she got out of her car and her leg was broken, according to the weather service. After the first tornado in Portage, a FedEx facility in the area collapsed.\n\n“Our thoughts are with those affected by the tornado in Portage, Michigan, and we are grateful there were no serious injuries resulting from the damage to our facility at 6701 Portage Road,\" FedEx spokesperson Shannon Davis said in an email to USA TODAY. \"We continue to assess the damage, and we are implementing contingency plans to lessen any potential impacts on service.\"\n\nSt. Joseph County Undersheriff Jason Bingaman confirmed multiple places across the southwest Michigan county were damaged Tuesday, the site of another confirmed tornado.\n\n\"At the moment, we are focused on life safety missions using all available resources, then we will begin preliminary damage assessments,\" Bingaman said.\n\nSeven structures, mostly homes, were damaged in Sherwood Township, Branch County Emergency Manager Tim Miner said, adding that there were no deaths or serious injuries.\n\nThe weather service also issued tornado watches for southeast Michigan counties but said the chance of tornadoes slamming that part of the state was unlikely.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has tracked 1,219 tornadoes in Michigan since 1950, killing 248 people and causing more than $1.2 billion in property damage. Eighteen twisters swept through the state in 2023 and caused two deaths, according to the NOAA.\n\nTornadoes hit other Plains states overnight\n\nSeveral states in the Plains region were hit with tornadoes including two each in Iowa, Kansas and South Dakota and one each in Missouri, Nebraska and Tennessee, according to preliminary information from the Storm Prediction Center.\n\nThe storms developed Monday afternoon and through the evening after the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center issued a series of dire warnings for severe weather in an area that stretched from Texas to the Dakotas.\n\nHow to be safe during a tornado warning\n\nWhile there's no such thing as guaranteed safety, the weather service says there are things people can do to increase their chances of surviving a deadly tornado.\n\nProtect yourself from flying or falling debris, the single biggest life-threatening hazard.\n\nSeek shelter in the closest, safest interior or underground room.\n\nAlways avoid windows. Don’t go to the windows or doors to look outside.\n\nCover yourself with thick protective coverings, such as a mattress, sleeping bags and thick blankets or other protective coverings.\n\nWear a helmet, if you have one, to protect your head from debris.\n\nUS weather watches and warnings\n\nNational weather radar\n\nContributing: Jana Hayes, Dale Denwalt and Cheyenne Derksen, The Oklahoman, Kylie Martin, Detroit Free Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2024/05/28/tuesday-weather-forecast-thunderstorms-wind-hail/73874728007/", "title": "Texas braces for more severe weather after deadly weekend of storms", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of severe weather news for Tuesday, May 28. For the latest, please see our story for Wednesday, May 29.\n\nFierce storms swept over Texas and the southern Plains on Tuesday, uprooting trees, overturning semi-trucks, damaging buildings and knocking out power to thousands – the latest outbreak of severe weather to hit the central U.S. following a series of deadly storms that killed at least 22 people over the holiday weekend.\n\nThe warm, moist air that's fueled one of the most active periods for tornadoes in recent years will linger over the Plains region, bringing thunderstorms capable of spawning twisters across the central U.S. this week, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAt least one storm-related death was reported in Texas on Tuesday after two homes under construction collapsed under the force of hazardous winds and rain.\n\nDallas County officials issued a disaster declaration Tuesday. Judge Clay Jenkins posted on X that the storms will likely result in \"a multi day power outage for a significant number\" of utility customers in the region.\n\nMore than 800,000 homes and businesses across north-central Texas were without power Tuesday afternoon as up to 2.5 inches of rain fell in some areas. Dallas County, the second most populous county in Texas, reported most of the outages with about 320,000 utility customers in the dark.\n\nNetBlocks, a firm that tracks cybersecurity, said live network data showed sharp drops in internet connectivity across the state as the weather service warned at least one more thunderstorm complex will develop in West Texas Tuesday afternoon. The system is expected to move into north-central Texas overnight and into Wednesday morning, bringing risk of hail, high winds and localized flooding.\n\nThe cluster of storms is expected to lash southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana throughout the afternoon. Meanwhile, a fresh round of strong storms could develop across west Texas on Tuesday afternoon and evening, the Storm Prediction Center said. The flooding and storms could extend from the Texas Panhandle to the western Gulf Coast.\n\n16-year-old dead after Texas homes under construction collapse\n\nMagnolia Fire Department Division Chief Jason Herrman told USA TODAY that one person died after two houses under construction collapsed Tuesday afternoon in the wake of a brutal storm that ravaged Magnolia, Texas. Crews were working to stabilize a third house that partially collapsed, Herrman said, in the town that is about 45 miles northwest of Houston.\n\nThe Montgomery County Sheriff's Office confirmed a 16-year-old boy working on the construction site died in the collapse. Workers noticed the house began to shift during the thunderstorm, a preliminary investigation found, and all but one person were able to get out before it crashed down.\n\nThe sheriff's office said that it responded to the call at around 12:25 p.m. local time. The boy was pronounced dead on the scene. Next of kin has been notified but authorities said the victim's name will not be released.\n\nThe fire department has also received several calls about downed power lines, broken windows and fallen trees, including one that collapsed on a residence. Herrman said he was not aware of any other storm-related deaths in Magnolia on Tuesday.\n\nWeather officials issued tornado and thunderstorm advisories throughout the Dallas and Fort Worth areas, citing reports of winds of over 70 mph and warning residents to brace for dangerous conditions. \"If you’re in the warning area or know someone there let them know to take cover! Stay off the roads,\" the weather service office in Fort Worth said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nA ground stop at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport was lifted Tuesday while another one at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport continued into the evening, the Federal Aviation Administration reported on its system status website.\n\nSchool districts throughout north-central Texas either canceled classes for the day or delayed the first bell by a few hours. The University of Texas at Dallas closed its campus until 12 p.m. local time. In a post on X, the school urged students, staff and faculty to \"stay off campus while we assess damage.\"\n\nOfficials for the city of Forney, just east of Dallas, asked residents to conserve water as the pump station and backup generators experienced \"electrical issues caused by the storms,\" a post on the city's Facebook page said. Kaufman County, which encompasses Forney, canceled court for the day and delayed the opening of all non-emergency departments until 10 a.m. local time.\n\nThe storms also interrupted the state's primary runoff election day Tuesday, knocking out power at several voting centers. Dallas County officials announced polling stations would be open an extra two hours until 9 p.m. local time so voters had time to cast their ballots amid the widespread outages and hazardous weather.\n\nIntense heat wave to linger over southern US, forecasters say\n\nMeanwhile, the intense heat wave that's burdened the Gulf Coast for the last week will linger across the region and parts of southern Texas with \"feels like\" temperatures up to 115 degrees, the weather service said. High temperatures are also expected to remain above average with near daily record highs throughout central and southern Florida over the next few days.\n\nThe oppressive heat set new daily high records across the Sunshine State on Memorial Day. In Melbourne and Fort Pierce, on the Atlantic Coast, temperatures of 98 degrees were recorded, matching the warmest May temperature ever recorded in Fort Pierce and reaching the second highest temperature recorded in Melbourne.\n\nStorms threaten central US into the midweek\n\nTuesday's storms are expected to continue into the night, and while they will diminish in strength they could remain capable of triggering floods across eastern Texas and Louisiana, the weather service said. Meteorologists say there is a possibility storms could develop across the Lone Star State on Wednesday.\n\nThe danger, however, will shift north into the upper Plains region, particularly along a corridor spanning from Montana and North Dakota to Colorado, Nebraska and Kansas. The weather service warned that the storms pose a threat of \"severe hail and wind\" that will appear and develop late Wednesday afternoon and evening.\n\nOn Thursday, storms are forecast to sweep across the central and southern Plains through the day and into the night, renewing threats of damaging wind, hail and floods in northern Texas and western Oklahoma. The system may include a few supercells, the most powerful thunderstorm type, according to the weather service.\n\nImmense damage in the wake of storms across Texas, central US\n\nThe continued threat of severe weather follows a weekend of deadly storms, which left over 20 people dead and hundreds of homes destroyed.\n\nAt least eight people died in Arkansas, seven in Texas, including two children; five in Kentucky and two in Oklahoma amid tornadoes that tore across communities, toppling trees, overturning cars and flattening buildings, authorities said. In Texas, at least 200 homes and buildings were destroyed and 120 were damaged over the weekend.\n\nEarlier in May, eight people in the Houston area were killed in storms that unleashed winds over 100 mph. Last Wednesday, a tornado touched down in Temple, Texas, ravaging the small city north of Austin and leaving several people with minor injuries. Also this month, hundreds of people had to be evacuated from eastern Texas in a deluge that took the life of a 4-year-old boy and led to historic river flooding.\n\n\"The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,\" Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement Sunday.\n\nTens of thousands of and businesses were without power on Tuesday morning.

Iowa State Police confirmed that there were multiple deaths after the tornado almost completely flattened the town of more than 2,000, the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nSgt. Alex Dinkla, spokesperson with the Iowa State Patrol, said at a news conference Tuesday night that authorities were working to confirm the exact number of those killed or injured, but estimated at least a dozen people were hospitalized.\n\nSeveral other tornadoes were reported to have touched down in Iowa on Tuesday, including a \"large and dangerous\" one near Fontanelle that was racing northeast at 60 mph, the National Weather Service said. The weather service is urging people in tornado-warned areas to take cover. \"You are in a life-threatening situation,\" the weather service said.\n\nOverall, more than 25 million people from Nebraska to Michigan live in the path of a powerful storm system and face a \"probable\" threat of tornadoes as well as heavy rain, hail and damaging winds, according to the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center.\n\nAccuWeather warned that areas between northern Missouri and southern Wisconsin are at high risk for severe thunderstorms into Tuesday night.\n\n\"We’re concerned about damaging winds and tornadoes. No weather event is the same, but this does have the same kind of earmarks as the severe weather threat back on April 26. There were more than 100 tornadoes reported that day,” AccuWeather meteorologist Bernie Rayno said.\n\nA tornado watch was issued Tuesday afternoon for much of eastern Nebraska and most of Iowa, along with portions of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. This means that weather conditions are prime for tornadoes to form there, the Storm Prediction Center said. Much of Iowa was under a \"particularly dangerous situation\" tornado watch, an alert used only in the most extreme situations.\n\nSevere thunderstorms have prompted reports of road flooding in at least seven counties in Iowa Tuesday afternoon. The weather service received a report of 3.5 inches of rain in Mason City, Iowa, in Cerro Gordo County. Flooding also was reported in Bremer and Grundy counties.\n\nThe storm system was expected to reach peak intensity – with the formation of supercells, the most powerful thunderstorm type – in the afternoon and early evening as it reaches the Missouri and Mississippi valleys as well as the Lake Michigan area.\n\nThe latest wave of storms across the central U.S. over the weekend and early this week have spun up twisters and dropped damaging hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter. On Monday, possible tornadoes were reported in Colorado and Nebraska, though damage appeared to be limited. A day earlier, at least four people were injured in Oklahoma and dozens of buildings were damaged in storms that swept the Plains region.\n\nTornadoes track through Iowa amid powerful thunderstorms\n\nMultiple rounds of thunderstorms spread across Iowa on Tuesday, resulting in a dangerous tornado outbreak. By Tuesday evening, residents in western and central Iowa communities were trying to clean up and assess the damage.\n\nDrone footage on social media showed destroyed homes, flipped cars, uprooted trees and downed power lines in Greenfield. Local authorities have limited traffic in and out of Greenfield, according to former Iowa State Rep. Clel Baudler.\n\n“Ambulances are running north and south like crazy,” Baudler said. “It’s all rescue and recovery right now.”\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital was also damaged and the hospital has been evacuated, a MercyOne spokesperson told the Des Moines Register. Dinkla said patients who were already receiving treatment at the hospital were transported to other hospitals.\n\nA curfew is in effect from 10 p.m. to at least 7 a.m. Wednesday in Greenfield, according to Dinkla.\n\nGeoff Greenwood, a spokesperson for MidAmerican Energy, said Tuesday that the Des Moines utility was aware of several wind turbines \"which took a direct hit by a large tornado\" in Adair County and were damaged or destroyed.\n\nVideos posted on social media showed a tornado striking one turbine after another, including one turbine near Prescott in Adams County falling to the ground on fire.\n\nNational Weather Service volunteer weather spotters across Iowa also reported infrastructure damages, high winds, and hail in other communities. Gov. Kim Reynolds has authorized a disaster emergency proclamation for 15 counties: Adair, Adams, Cass, Clay, Hardin, Harrison, Jasper, Kossuth, Marshall, Montgomery, Page, Palo Alto, Pottawattamie, Tama and Warren.\n\n'House started popping'\n\nCarl and Valerie Faust were in the path of the tornado and lost their home in Greenfield. After hearing the wind pick up and getting a call from their son, they went to their basement.\n\n\"I got down five steps to the basement, and the house started popping,\" Carl Faust said.\n\nIt took about 40 seconds from start to finish for the tornado to tear through not just their home, but the whole town, Carl Faust said. Their neighbors came to check on them soon after.\n\n\"We'll get up in the morning,\" he said. \"We'll look it all over with a fresh mind and fresh eyes and we'll start attacking it all.\"\n\nTornadoes reported in Wisconsin as many counties remain under tornado watch\n\nTens of thousands of homes and businesses were without power in central Wisconsin on Tuesday evening as a storm continued to track east across the state. Three rounds of storm systems passed through the state and brought damaging winds as high as 60 to 80 miles per hour.\n\nMany Wisconsin counties remained under a tornado watch until midnight. The National Weather Service office in Green Bay said there were \"reports of a tornado near Unity\" in Clark and Marathon counties.\n\nA tornado was confirmed shortly before 7:50 p.m. about 13 miles east of Abbotsford moving northeast at 80 mph, according to the weather service. Abbotsford is a city about 34 miles west of Wausau.\n\nElsewhere, the weather service office in Milwaukee said at about 7 p.m. that a \"strong rotation\" was seen on radar crossing the Wisconsin River near Spring Green.\n\nCentral US faces more severe weather this week\n\nBy Wednesday morning, the center of the system will head into southern Canada. However, a trailing cold front will \"become nearly stationary across the southern Plains where the next phase of severe weather and excessive rainfall is forecast to emerge,\" the weather service warned, adding that the weather threats, including thunderstorms, will expand into the mid-Mississippi Valley on Wednesday night.\n\nOn Thursday, persistent storms capable of unleashing hail and \"a couple of tornadoes\" could lash Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and parts of Texas, the weather service's Storm Prediction Center said. Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms will be possible across the central Plains into South Dakota and across the mid-Atlantic and Northeast coastal areas.\n\nIt's already been a rough spring for tornadoes: There have been more than 830 preliminary reports of tornadoes so far this year, well above the historical average of 626 tornadoes at this time of year, AccuWeather said.\n\nStorm-related death toll rises to 8 in Houston\n\nAn eighth person has died following a series of storms that tore through the Houston area on Thursday, leaving widespread damage in its wake, including mass power outages amid an intense heat wave.\n\nOfficials discovered the body of a man they believe died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning, multiple outlets reported, citing the Houston Fire Department.\n\nSamuel Peña, the fire chief, took to X on Monday, calling carbon monoxide poisoning a \"silent killer.\" He said his department has responded to 80 poisoning-related calls since last Thursday, including one in which four children were hospitalized because of a running generator, he said.\n\nAs authorities have been rushing to get the power back on across the city, many schools remain closed because of outages and damage. Officials also have warned against traveling because of debris from smashed windows downtown and damaged traffic lights.\n\nRising temperatures and record power use\n\nMeanwhile, temperatures have risen sharply. Through Friday, the afternoon heat index, or feels like temperature, is forecast to reach triple digits, prompting a warning from weather and local authorities, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, more than 136,000 utility customers still had no power, according to a USA TODAY outage tracker. That is down from over 946,000 customers without service in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi on Friday.\n\nPower use in Texas broke the record for the month of May on Monday and will likely top that high over the next week as homes and businesses keep their air conditioners cranked up to escape the spring heat wave.\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) said power demand hit a preliminary 72,261 megawatts on May 20, which topped the previous record for the month of May, 71,645 megawatts set in 2022.\n\nUS weather watches and warnings\n\nNational weather radar\n\nContributing: Victoria Reyna-Rodriguez, and Kate Kealey, Des Moines Register; David Clarey, Emmett Prosser, and Drake Bentley, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel; Jamie Rokus, USA TODAY Network - Wisconsin; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/03/texas-weather-tornadoes-flooding-weekend-weather-forecast/73552764007/", "title": "Dangerous weather batters Texas: A foot of rain, tornadoes and more", "text": "Drenching rain swamped southern Texas Friday morning, leading to dangerous flash flooding throughout the region, including in the Houston metro area.

That’s more than any other country. In fact, it’s more than Canada, Australia and all European countries combined.\n\nWithin the US, every state has had at least one tornado, and some have dozens each year.\n\nThe US is special in terms of producing so many tornadoes, especially violent ones.\n\nIn the US, the average number of tornado fatalities per year is 73. But in Europe, where the tornadoes are usually much weaker, the fatalities are estimated to be between 10 and 15 annually.\n\nSome states are deadlier than others\n\nTexas on average has 140 tornadoes every year – the most of any state. Kansas, Florida, Oklahoma, and Nebraska round out the top five.\n\nBut the total number of tornadoes does not always tell the whole story. For example, despite Alabama having on average 42 tornadoes per year – more than three times fewer than Texas – it is at the top of the list for tornado fatalities.\n\nAlabama averages 14 tornado fatalities per year, almost double the next highest – Missouri with eight deaths per year.\n\nThe time of day and the topography where the tornado occurs makes a big difference in the fatality rate.\n\nThe topography in Alabama and other Southern states often includes rolling hills, plateaus, and many more trees than the Plains states like Kansas, Texas, and Nebraska, where a tornado often can be seen from miles away. The more likely a tornado can be seen often leads to the tornado being reported faster, allowing more time for people to be warned and seek shelter.\n\nSouthern states such as Tennessee, Kentucky and Arkansas also see more tornadoes overnight versus any other state. This can lead to higher fatalities, since many people are sleeping and unaware that a tornado is approaching.\n\n“Tornadoes in the Southeast tend to be more dangerous than their Great Plains counterparts,” says Brandon Miller, CNN Meteorologist. “There are a number of reasons for this, some weather and some geographic. Southeastern tornadoes often travel faster, moved by a faster jet stream.”\n\nAll of these factors can lead to higher fatality rate in Southern states compared to the Plains. But all of these states have a few things in common: the ideal atmospheric conditions for tornadoes to form.\n\n“The basic ingredients for severe thunderstorms that can make tornadoes are warm, moist air near the ground, relatively dry, cool air aloft (about 10,000 to 30,000 feet), and horizontal winds in the environment the storm forms in that increase as you go from the ground up and change direction with height, blowing from the equator near the ground and from the west aloft,” says Dr. Harold Brooks, senior scientist with the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory.\n\nLow pressure systems in the US pull warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry air aloft from the Rocky Mountains or the High Desert in the southwest. The states that fall in between those two regions end up being in the ideal location for severe weather to ignite.\n\n“No place else in the world has the large warm water on its equatorward side with a wide high range of mountains extending from north to south to the west of it,” Dr. Brooks said. “All the other tornado prone regions have at least one feature suboptimal.”\n\nCNN Weather\n\nThe US leads every other country for tornadoes\n\nOther countries experience tornadoes, including Germany, Australia, South Africa, eastern China, Japan, Bangladesh, Argentina, and more.\n\nEurope as a whole is comparable to the size of the US, but there is a vast difference in number of tornadoes and tornado fatalities.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2020, the US averaged a preliminary total of 1,173 tornadoes per year, and Europe around 256. However, Dr. Pieter Groenemeijer, Director of the European Severe Storms Laboratory (ESSL), cautions that the European number may be on the low side.\n\n“Weaker tornadoes are likely still under-reported in some countries, such as France and the UK,” Groenemeijer says.\n\nEuropean Russia (which is the part of the country west of 58 degrees East longitude), tops the list at 86 tornadoes annually. Germany comes in second with an average 28 tornadoes annually.\n\nThe peak density of tornado reports coincides with the high population density over Belgium, the Netherlands, and northern Germany, according to a study on severe storms in Europe published in December 2020.\n\nThe study also reports that thunderstorms are twice as frequent over the United States, with as many as four times more storm reports, compared to Europe.\n\nCNN weather\n\nOne thing most countries have in common is the time of day that tornadoes occur, which is most frequently during the afternoon and early evening. But the peak season is not the same. In the US, spring is the peak for tornado activity. For central and northern Europe the main tornado season is in summer, whereas it is autumn for the western and central Mediterranean region, and winter in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nOutside of the US, Canada actually ranks second on the list for most tornadoes, with an average of 100 per year.\n\nTornadoes are not limited to the Northern Hemisphere. Australia has dozens every year, and South Africa also reports annual occurrences. South America, much like other continents, has its own tornado hotspot, known as “pasillo de los tornados.” This tornado corridor includes Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and a portion of Brazil.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand, tornadoes are relatively rare there. On average, around seven to 10 moderate to strong tornado events are reported in New Zealand every year.\n\nSouthern Hemisphere tornadoes typically rotate clockwise, which is the opposite of how tornadoes primarily spin in the Northern Hemisphere.", "authors": ["Allison Chinchar"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/09/tennessee-north-carolina-tornadoes-video-photos/73625143007/", "title": "Severe weather, tornadoes hit Tennessee, Carolinas: See photos ...", "text": "At least three people were killed overnight as powerful storms ripped through the central and eastern United States, bringing torrential rain, hail and even tornadoes.\n\nParts of Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, and the Carolinas were all pummeled into Thursday morning as severe weather continues to cause widespread damage throughout a large swath of the United States amid a multi-state tornado outbreak that began May 6.\n\nMore than 22 million people in eight states had been under a tornado watch Wednesday evening in portions of eight states: Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee.\n\nThe damage appeared to be the worst in Tennessee and North Carolina, where three people were killed.\n\nA 22-year-old man died in Claiborne County, Tennessee, after a tree fell on his vehicle around 10:30 a.m. Wednesday, authorities said.

Extreme weather events, including tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and extreme temperatures can all be deadly.\n\nTo determine the states with the most dangerous weather, 24/7 Wall St. compiled state by state fatality rates attributable to weather from the National Weather Service, a component of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We totalled all weather-related deaths from 2011 through 2015 and adjusted the five-year total for every 1 million state residents. The five-year period was used because weather fatalities are susceptible to large year-over-year fluctuations. The total value of damage caused by weather events also came from the NWS. Population and poverty figures came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 5 year American Community Survey.\n\nThese are the states with the most dangerous weather.\n\n1. Alabama\n\n> 5-year fatality rate: 61.1 (per million residents)\n\n>Total fatalities 2011-2015: 295\n\n>Total damage 2011-2015: $4.4 billion\n\n>Poverty rate: 18.9%\n\nRoughly 85% of all weather-related fatalities in Alabama in the last half decade occurred in 2011. That year, the state was the hardest hit by the weather event dubbed “The Tornado Super Outbreak of 2011.” In a four-day period in late April that year, tornadoes killed more than 230 people and injured thousands in Alabama.\n\nPartially because they have fewer resources to prepare for disastrous weather conditions, people living in poverty are more likely to be killed by extreme weather. In Alabama, a state with the fifth highest poverty rate in the country, more people have died due to weather in the last five years than in any other state.\n\nThe States Least Prepared for Natural Disaster\n\n2. Missouri\n\n> 5-year fatality rate: 43.5 (per million residents)\n\n>Total fatalities 2011-2015: 263\n\n>Total damage 2011-2015: $3.5 billion\n\n>Poverty rate: 15.6%\n\nMore than two-thirds of the total weather-related fatalities in Missouri in the last five years happened in 2011. That year, the city of Joplin was devastated by an EF5 tornado, the most powerful classification. The twister killed more than 160 people and injured over a thousand. 2011 was also the most costly year due to weather-related disasters in Missouri in the last half decade. Due largely to the tornado that all but destroyed Joplin, the estimated damage in Missouri that year was nearly $3.3 billion. The Joplin tornado ranks as one of the deadliest in U.S. history.\n\n3. Nevada\n\n> 5-year fatality rate: 36.1 (per million residents)\n\n>Total fatalities 2011-2015: 101\n\n>Total damage 2011-2015: $133.0 million\n\n>Poverty rate: 15.6%\n\nNevada is one of only a handful of states with more than 100 weather-related deaths in the last five years. It also has the third highest weather-related fatality rate in the country. The driest state in the country, much of Nevada is a desert. In 2013, 42 people were killed and another 576 were injured due to extreme weather in Nevada. That same summer, the state was in the middle of a heat wave that had swept across the Southwest, and multiple cities in the state reported near record high temperatures. Partially due to the heat wave, 2013 the deadliest year in the last half decade in Nevada.\n\n4. Wyoming\n\n> 5-year fatality rate: 34.5 (per million residents)\n\n>Total fatalities 2011-2015: 20\n\n>Total damage 2011-2015: $45.5 million\n\n>Poverty rate: 11.6%\n\nUnlike many of the other states on this list, destructive natural disasters are relatively uncommon in Wyoming. However, because it has the smallest population of any state, even a single weather-related fatality can have a dramatic effect on the overall rate. Over the last five years, 20 people have died because of weather in Wyoming, fewer than in the majority of other states. However, when adjusted for the population, the state’s weather-related deaths per capita is one of the highest in the country. Nearly three-quarters of all weather-related deaths in the state in the last five years were due to avalanches in the Teton, Snake River, and Wyoming Range.\n\n25 Cities to Find Great Jobs\n\n5. Arkansas\n\n> 5-year fatality rate: 30.8 (per million residents)\n\n>Total fatalities 2011-2015: 91\n\n>Total damage 2011-2015: $1.2 billion\n\n>Poverty rate: 19.2%\n\nWeather-related death rates are at least two times higher in poorer areas, according to the CDC. In Arkansas, which has the fifth highest weather-related death rate of all states, the poverty rate is also far higher than the national average. The state’s 19.2% poverty rate is fourth highest in the country.\n\nThe Mississippi River forms Arkansas’ eastern border, and when the river flooded to historic levels in 2011, the state was hit hard. Agriculture is the state’s biggest industry, and the 2011 flooding cost millions in crop damage. Flooding killed 18 people in Arkansas in 2011 alone.\n\n6. Oklahoma\n\n> 5-year fatality rate: 27.8 (per million residents)\n\n>Total fatalities 2011-2015: 107\n\n>Total damage 2011-2015: $3.3 billion\n\n>Poverty rate: 16.9%\n\nThe five-year weather related death rate in Oklahoma is nearly three times the corresponding national rate. Weather events have claimed 107 lives and cost more than $3.3 billion in property and crop damage in the state during that time. For Oklahoma, 2013 was by far the worst year for weather in the last five. An EF5 tornado, the most powerful classification, touched down in Oklahoma that year, causing devastation along a 20 mile stretch of the state and claiming 24 lives. In 2011, the state was in the midst of a record-breaking heatwave, which devastated crops and led to multiple deaths. The state has also battled a severe and costly drought for much of the last five years.\n\n7. Mississippi\n\n> 5-year fatality rate: 26.4 (per million residents)\n\n>Total fatalities 2011-2015: 79\n\n>Total damage 2011-2015: $2.6 billion\n\n>Poverty rate: 22.6%\n\nEvery five years, there are an average of 26.4 deaths due to weather events for every million people in Mississippi, the seventh highest such rate in the country and more than double the corresponding national rate of 9.4 fatalities per 1 million residents. Of the last five years, 2011 was the deadliest in Mississippi. Several natural disasters of historic proportions hit the state that year — disasters that contributed to a total of 40 weather related fatalities.\n\nOver a four-day period in late April, 2011, hundreds of tornadoes touched down in the Southeastern United States, killing scores of people in several states, including Mississippi. In addition to the tornadoes, the Mississippi River flooded to levels not seen since the 1930s. The 2011 flood, while not as deadly as the tornadoes, cost an estimated $3.2 billion, more than any other flood in the Mississippi River Valley in at least the last three and a half decades.\n\nMore on states with the most dangerous weather\n\nThe number of Americans killed by weather events and conditions varies widely from state to state. Geography, climate, and even economic status play a role in a particular state’s weather-related death rate. In order to determine the states with the most dangerous weather, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed state by state fatalities attributable to weather from 2011 through 2015 from the National Weather Service. Each of the states with the most dangerous weather had a five-year fatality rate that was more than double the national rate during that period.\n\nExtreme heat is the most common cause of weather-related fatalities in the United States. Since 1988, there have been 3,806 heat-related fatalities compared to 830 deaths attributable to extreme cold. Recent trends suggest that the problem is likely to get worse. Four of the last five years rank as the hottest on record.\n\nMany of the states with the most dangerous weather, including Alabama, the state with the highest weather fatality rate, have high fatality figures due to a devastating series of tornadoes that tore across the Southeastern U.S. in late April 2011. Hundreds of lives were lost to more than 200 tornadoes, which wreaked havoc over a four-day period. Oklahoma, the state with sixth highest weather-related fatality rate, lies nearly in the center of Tornado Alley, an area notorious for the regularity with which tornadoes touch down.\n\nIn addition to extreme temperatures and powerful storms, flooding is one of the deadliest weather conditions in the United States. Heavy spring time rains, when combined with melting snowpacks, can lead to catastrophic flooding, particularly in areas along the Mississippi River. In fact, three of the seven states with the most dangerous weather are situated along the banks of the Mississippi. An average of more than 80 deaths are attributable to flooding every year in the United States.\n\nWhile geography and climate play a central role in dangerous weather, poverty amplifies its negative effects. According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, weather-related death rates are “2 to 7 times as high in low-income counties as in high-income counties.” This is likely because those living below the poverty line to not have the means to prepare for, or adapt to, extreme weather events and conditions, according to the CDC. It is perhaps no coincidence that the poverty rate is as high or higher than the 15.6% national rate in each of the states on this list except for Wyoming.\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Essien\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nMemories of our medical school years at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine still linger – lifelong friends, memorable professors, caring for sick patients across the Bronx. And finally, a decade removed from graduation, our monthly student loan payments.\n\nLiving in New York City was not cheap, along with the $50,000 per year of tuition (now up to $61,688) it cost to attend Einstein. And so like many medical students across the country, we took out large loans to support our dreams of becoming doctors. Nonetheless, our education at Einstein undoubtedly established our present passions as physician researchers dedicated to advancing health equity and diversifying the physician workforce.\n\nWhen we saw recently that former Einstein professor Ruth Gottesman had committed $1 billion to help provide free tuition in perpetuity for all students, we immediately began to imagine what this gift would mean for training doctors of diverse backgrounds – doctors who could represent the Bronx, a county whose residents are 44.3% Black and 56.6% Hispanic, and provide the best care for patient populations most in need.\n\nRegrettably, the latest data on medical school diversity is dismal: 5.7% of all doctors in the United States are Black while 7% are Hispanic, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\nBlack, Hispanic students face barriers to medical schools\n\nWhen we were at Einstein, Black and Hispanic students made up only 10% of the student body. A large part of the underrepresentation of minority groups in medicine is financial barriers to applying to medical school, due to decades of structural racism resulting in wealth gaps.\n\nA study we published in the Journal of American Medical Association's Health Forum last April showed just how important these financial barriers are. We found that Black and Hispanic students were more likely to report limited access to financial resources and higher pre-medical debt burden. These students, in turn, were up to 18% less likely to apply to and matriculate at medical school compared with white students.\n\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court ruling last summer banning affirmative action in higher education, institutions have been brainstorming how to preserve racial and ethnic diversity in their classrooms.\n\nInequality in health care cost lives.Medical school needs race-conscious admissions.\n\nOne of these solutions is to eliminate economic barriers on the pathway to medical school, which offering free tuition to students certainly addresses.\n\nEliminating medical school costs as a barrier for students who never considered medical school as an option will provide an opportunity for them to choose a career that could potentially change their family’s financial trajectory. These are students who will ultimately become doctors who can communicate with their patients in their native language, understand and relate to patients who must choose between paying for rent or prescription medications, and recognize the myriad structural barriers that students less privy to these forms of adversity may not appreciate.\n\nWe know that this understanding can both improve patient experience and health outcomes.\n\nDiverse medical workers help reduce health disparities\n\nFree tuition might also encourage students to pursue high-need but traditionally lower-paying specialties such as primary care after graduation.\n\nDuring our training at Einstein, the patients we served suffered the highest rates of devastating complications from chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure. In the Bronx, 16% of patients have diabetes while 32% have hypertension.\n\nThrough this $1 billion gift, Einstein now has a unique opportunity to train a racially and ethnically diverse physician workforce committed to providing care to communities like the Bronx and helping mitigate these health disparities and combat medical racism.\n\nMedical racism:I'm a Black midwife who knows too many of us are dying during pregnancy. This must stop.\n\nWe are not naive to believe that philanthropy alone will improve physician diversity and health equity. New York University’s medical school became more competitive after it implemented free tuition in 2018, and the risk remains that economically and educationally privileged students will disproportionately climb to the front to take advantage of this benefit.\n\nThus, to ensure diversity, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine must continue to prioritize holistic medical school application reviews, community education investments, and targeted recruitment of students underrepresented in medicine.\n\nBeyond Einstein, we need federal commitment to eliminating tuition burden for pre-medical and medical students, especially those attending schools without the same access to philanthropy.\n\nFinally, with the alleviation of medical school debt, Einstein should develop more dedicated tracks for primary care training and for students committed to practicing in the underserved communities after graduation.\n\nAs proud Einstein alums, we are thrilled for the generations to come that will reap the benefits of Ruth Gottesman’s donation. This outsized gift personifies our teaching at Einstein to address root causes of structural inequities, including in education. Our alma mater is now well-positioned to develop future physicians from the community it serves and to widely transform health equity in the Bronx.\n\nWe hope other schools will follow.\n\nJessica Faiz is an emergency medicine physician and assistant professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.

The building to be marketed as \"Detroit's business school\" would be located on property owned by the family and near the new Red Wings arena under construction on Woodward Avenue north of downtown Detroit. It would be south of the university’s main Midtown campus, the person said.\n\nLocated on the southwest corner of Woodward and Temple Street, it would be the university's first new construction for its business school outside of the university’s Midtown campus. It was unclear how quickly construction would begin, but the school is expected to be completed by 2018.\n\nTo help connect the new business school to other university facilities, a Wayne State shuttle will loop back and forth with the main campus. That would be similar to a bus linking the main university to its medical campus. The Wayne State police department will also patrol the building and grounds at the new business school site, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nPart of the reason for the move, according to a person briefed on the plan, is to bring graduate business students closer to the growing professional community in downtown. Those students might be better able to pursue a degree part-time if classrooms were closer to their downtown workplaces, this person said.\n\nThe school would be renamed the Mike Ilitch School of Business for its largest benefactor, according to the person familiar with the family's plans. An official announcement could come as soon as this week, two sources said.\n\nAnother person familiar with the donation confirmed on Tuesday the broad outline of the plan to fund a new school near the arena construction site by one of Detroit's most prominent corporate citizens.\n\nThe school would be one part of a larger redevelopment effort by the Ilitches and others in the northern greater downtown area.\n\nThe new business school could bring an estimated 3,000 university students, faculty and staff into the heart of downtown, according to those briefed on the plans. It could also serve to help bridge the gap between two rebounding neighborhoods — downtown and Midtown — soon-to-be linked through the new M-1 light-rail line.\n\nGround broken for new Red Wings arena\n\nA message left for the family company’s spokesman was not immediately returned on Tuesday. Wayne State spokesman Matt Lockwood declined to comment.\n\nBut when rumors of a collaboration between the Ilitches and Wayne State for a new business school first surfaced in January, Doug Kuiper, a spokesman for Ilitch Holdings, told several news organizations in a statement that “as longtime neighbors and partners in Detroit’s revitalization, we’re excited to be discussing new opportunities to collaborate with Wayne State in the District Detroit.”\n\nLast year, Christopher Ilitch, son of Little Caesars founders Mike and Marian Ilitch and president and CEO of Ilitch Holdings, parent company to Little Caesars, announced a $650-million redevelopment plan for a new Wings arena and larger entertainment district covering a mostly vacant stretch on the northern edge of downtown.\n\n“I should start by saying, ‘Howdy neighbors. It’s good to be here,’ ” Chris Ilitch said at a Wayne State lecture last year entitled “Investing in Detroit.”\n\nOne downtown, two empires: Mike Ilitch and Dan Gilbert reshape Detroit\n\nThe arena district has been billed as one of the city’s boldest and most significant developments since the Renaissance Center of the 1970s. The sweeping investment could create as many as 2,000 new residential units, dozens of shops, walkable European-style streets and a multipurpose arena.\n\nSupporters of the Wayne State expansion into downtown envision the new school, along with the arena complex, as another prominent symbol of the Ilitches' role in the city’s economic rebirth. The arena is on schedule to be finished in the fall of 2017, company officials said earlier this month.\n\nThe development site for the arena and business school building across roughly dozens of blocks is already anchored on the southern end by the Fox Theatre, Comerica Park and Ford Field.\n\nCurrently, the school, with 2,400 undergraduate and 850 graduate students and 85 faculty members, is housed in the Meyer and Anna Prentis Building on the university's Midtown campus.\n\nStarting with one pizza shop in 1959, Mike and Marian Ilitch built their Little Caesars pizza business into one of the nation’s biggest, then branched out into sports and entertainment. Christopher Ilitch now heads the family ventures under the umbrella known as Ilitch Holdings with more than $3 billion a year in revenue.\n\nA proud Mike Ilitch says he is just a part of the community\n\nIn addition to the Red Wings and Little Caesars, the most important brands within the Ilitch network include the Detroit Tigers and Olympia Entertainment.\n\nThe gift from the longtime Detroit businessman and philanthropist would be one of the state’s largest single contributions to any university in recent times.\n\nThe University of Michigan based in Ann Arbor is in the midst of a $4-billion fund-raising campaign, which includes raising $1 billion for student aid. The campaign was kicked off by a $200-million gift from real estate developer and Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross. Half of the gift was targeted for the business school and the other half was targeted to the athletic department.\n\nAt Michigan State University in East Lansing, through Aug. 31, more than $1 billion has been committed toward a $1.5-billion campaign goal.\n\nThe Ilitches’ gift would be part of Wayne State’s $750-million fund-raising campaign. The university intends to seek additional support from university alumni and friends to complete the new facility, according to a person briefed on the plan. In 2014, the Ilitches donated $8.5 million to the Wayne State University surgery department to aid innovation at its medical school.\n\nFree Press Staff Writer John Gallagher contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2016/09/17/ilitch-2014-med-school-gift-tied-one-doctor/90120092/", "title": "Ilitches' $7 million Wayne State med school gift tied to one doctor", "text": "David Jesse\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nIn 2014, Mike and Marian Ilitch made a $7-million gift to the Wayne State University medical school. But the gift — which is to be paid in five yearly installments of $1.4 million — came with a condition: If Dr. Donald Weaver, the chairman of the department of surgery, left the university for any reason before the gift was completely paid, the remainder of the gift could be canceled.\n\nThe condition is unusual, but not unique, several experts said. It also highlights a shift in donations that has taken place over recent decades.\n\n►Related:Ilitches' Wayne State gift comes with strings\n\n►Related: Ilitch family to give $40M for new WSU business school\n\n“There was a day when a benefactor would give us a dollar and say use it for the good of the university,” said Audrey Kintzi, vice president for development and alumni relations at St. Mary's University of Minnesota and a member of the board of directors of the Association of Fundraising Professionals. “Now they want to give their gifts where they can see impact. That’s not a bad thing.”\n\nBut the shift means donors are very getting specific about how they want their gift spent, as this gift agreement between Wayne State and the Ilitches — along with a more recent agreement for a $40-million gift for a new business school at Wayne State — show.\n\nThe Ilitches, through a spokesman, declined to comment.\n\nThe medical school gift created the Ilitch Chair for Surgical Innovation and established an unrestricted fund to support research and development in surgical technologies.\n\nThe gift agreement spells out how the gift, combined with a $1.25-million allocation from the School of Medicine’s budget spread out over five years, would help the surgery department grow.\n\n►Related: Wayne State MBA enrollment grows 85% over 2 years\n\n\"We've made this gift to support the lifesaving work of Dr. Weaver and his team at Wayne State University,\" Mike Ilitch said in a news release announcing the gift. \"We think of this as an investment in the future of health care that will support a great educational institution and benefit the people of Detroit, the state of Michigan and beyond.\"\n\nThe gift agreement calls for the Ilitches to make five annual payments of $1.4 million, beginning on June 30, 2014.\n\nBut then the one condition on the gift comes: “If Dr. Weaver (the head of the department) ceases to be affiliated with the university prior to the final installment due date, the donors shall have the option to discontinue future installment payments.”\n\nDonors and universities say such agreements are needed to protect everyone's interests — including the donor. For example, a recent gift to the University of New Hampshire of $4 million from a former librarian who died had one small condition on it — that at least $100,000 be spent at the library where the donor had worked for decades. The university honored that request, and then used $1 million of the gift for a new football scoreboard.\n\nThere’s nothing illegal about the condition inserted into the Wayne State/Ilitch agreement, but it does raise some issues, experts said.\n\n\"For me, it’s a problem, or a potential problem, because the medical school must keep that person to keep the gift,” said Doug White, the former director of the nonprofit management master's degree program at Columbia University in New York City. His most recent book is \"Abusing Donor Intent,\" about a donor's family's lawsuit against Princeton University. “That smacks of taking a deduction to provide a personal benefit. If they wanted to accomplish that objective, I'd have suggested they keep that language out of the gift agreement, for all to see, including the IRS, and have an oral understanding of the goal. That way, if the doctor turned out to be a bad guy, the school would have some ability to make a decision without considering the gift.\"\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service defines a charitable donation as a gift given with the expectation of no equal value in return. That precludes someone from giving money for a scholarship to be used by one student, experts said.\n\n“It’s not that (restrictions like this) are unethical, but they are in that gray area,” Kintzi said. “The question that is asked is, 'Do the donors really want to support this program, or just one person?' I do believe that most benefactors really want to do good (and) donors do have the right to have some control of their investments.”\n\nThat’s how Wayne State looked at the gift.\n\n\"Michael and Marian Ilitch have made a transformative investment in the Department of Surgery at our medical school,\" Wayne State President M. Roy Wilson said in a release announcing the gift. \"Their commitment will help continue the department's legacy of achievement. It also will advance research, which will inform the future of surgery and position Wayne State as a leader in health care innovation.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/03/04/ut-austin-fundraising-campaign-largest-among-texas-universities/9342270002/", "title": "University of Texas launches $6 billion fundraising campaign", "text": "Correction: This story has been updated to correct the name of the site at the Blanton Museum named in honor of a gift from the Moody Foundation.

The campaign also includes a $1 billion goal to fund scholarships and student support programs.\n\n“At this moment, we face incredible opportunities as we pursue our goal of becoming the world’s most impactful public research university,” UT President Jay Hartzell said in a news release. “We will accomplish this by continuing to attract incredible people, by taking advantage of our unique place in Austin and Texas, and by focusing on transformative pursuits.

We drive better outcomes.

However, the portion of UT's budget funded by the state has decreased from 34% during fiscal 1990-91 to 10% during fiscal 2020-21, forcing UT increasingly to rely on other sources.\n\nKevin Eltife, chairman of the UT System Board of Regents and a former Republican state senator, said the fundraising campaign will help supplement the support that UT receives from state leaders, including Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, House Speaker Dan Phelan, R-Beaumont, and the Legislature.\n\n“On behalf of the Board of Regents, we are grateful for all the philanthropic support already provided and are confident that this fundraising effort will ensure a future where the University of Texas continues to produce Longhorns that change the world,” Eltife said in a news release.\n\nHartzell planned to publicly launch the fundraising campaign Friday evening at an on-campus celebration on the Main Mall with fireworks, a food festival, a pep rally and a concert with the Black Pumas.\n\nThe new campaign hopes to double the $3 billion raised during UT’s last fundraising campaign, known as “The Campaign for Texas,” which ended in 2014. The school received donations at the time for student scholarships, renovations of campus buildings and for university research, including the Dell Medical School and the Livestrong Cancer Institutes.\n\nThe university already has surpassed the previous campaign by raising more than $3.3 billion from 240,000 donors during the quiet phase of the new campaign, which began in September 2016. The previous gifts include a $100 million donation from the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation to help students from low-income families and $130 million from the Moody Foundation for the Moody Center, the arena scheduled to open on campus next month that is replacing the Erwin Center.\n\nUT’s fundraising campaign goal also is one of the largest by any public university in the U.S. Texas A&M University currently holds the record for the state’s largest higher education fundraising campaign after raising $4.25 billion over a nine-year campaign that concluded in February 2021.\n\nMore:Texas State University launches $250M fundraising campaign, aims for Tier One status\n\nVarious other public universities have launched similar ambitious fundraising campaigns seeking to raise billions of dollars to support faculty and students. The University of California Berkeley launched a fundraising campaign in 2020 with a goal of $6 billion, while the University of Washington received $6.3 billion during a 10-year campaign that ended in 2020.\n\nBeyond the $1 billion goal for scholarships, UT did not name any specific funding goals. Rabenold said each of UT’s colleges and schools have different priorities for the fundraising campaign, such as an undergraduate business building known as James J. and Miriam B.

It has been updated to reflect the current status of the legislation.\n\nCNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed into law a $1.7 trillion yearlong federal government spending package on Thursday, after the House and Senate passed it last week.\n\nThe legislation includes $772.5 billion for nondefense discretionary programs and $858 billion in defense funding. That represents an increase in spending in both areas for fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe sweeping package includes roughly $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and NATO allies, an overhaul of the electoral vote-counting law, protections for pregnant workers, an enhancement to retirement savings rules and a TikTok ban on federal devices.\n\nIt also provides a boost in spending for disaster aid, college access, child care, mental health and food assistance, more support for the military and veterans and additional funds for the US Capitol Police. And the legislation contains several major Medicaid provisions, particularly one that could disenroll up to 19 million people from the nation’s health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nHowever, the law, which runs more than 4,000 pages, left out several measures that some lawmakers had fought to include. An expansion of the child tax credit, as well as multiple other corporate and individual tax breaks, did not make it into the final bill. Neither did legislation to allow cannabis companies to bank their cash reserves – known as the Safe Banking Act – or a bill to help Afghan evacuees in the US gain lawful permanent residency. And the spending package did not include a White House request for roughly $10 billion in additional funding for Covid-19 response.\n\nThe spending law, which will keep the government operating through September, the end of the fiscal year, is the product of lengthy negotiations between top congressional Democrats and Republicans.\n\nCongress originally passed a continuing resolution on September 30 to temporarily fund the government in fiscal year 2023, which began October 1.\n\nHere’s what’s in the law:\n\nMore aid for Ukraine: The spending law provides roughly $45 billion to help support Ukraine’s efforts to defend itself against Russia’s attack.\n\nAbout $9 billion of the funding will go to Ukraine’s military to pay for a variety of things including training, weapons, logistics support and salaries. Nearly $12 billion will be used to replenish US stocks of equipment sent to Ukraine through presidential drawdown authority.\n\nAlso, the law provides $13 billion for economic support to the Ukrainian government. Other funds address humanitarian and infrastructure needs, as well as support European Command operations.\n\nEmergency disaster assistance: The law provides more than $38 billion in emergency funding to help Americans in the west and southeast affected by recent natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding and wildfires. It will aid farmers, provide economic development assistance for communities, repair and reconstruct federal facilities and direct money to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund, among other initiatives.\n\nOverhaul of the electoral vote-counting law: A provision in the legislation aims at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election, the first legislative response to the US Capitol insurrection and then-President Donald Trump’s campaign to stay in power despite his loss in 2020.\n\nThe changes overhaul the 1887 Electoral Count Act, which Trump tried to use to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe legislation clarifies the vice president’s role while overseeing the certification of the electoral result to be completely ceremonial. It also creates a set of stipulations designed to make it harder for there to be any confusion over the accurate slate of electors from each state.\n\nFunding for January 6 attack prosecutions: The law provides $2.6 billion for US Attorneys, which includes funding efforts “to further support prosecutions related to the January 6 attack on the Capitol and domestic terrorism cases,” according to a fact sheet from the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe package also gives $11.3 billion to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including for efforts to investigate extremist violence and domestic terrorism.\n\nThe funding measures are part of nearly $39 billion for the Justice Department.\n\nRetirement savings enhancements: The law contains new retirement rules that could make it easier for Americans to accumulate retirement savings – and less costly to withdraw them. Among other things, the provisions will allow penalty-free withdrawals for some emergency expenses, let employers offer matching retirement contributions for a worker’s student loan payments and increase how much older workers may save in employer retirement plans.\n\nTikTok ban from federal devices: The legislation bans TikTok, the Chinese-owned short-form video app, from federal government devices.\n\nSome lawmakers have raised bipartisan concerns that China’s national security laws could force TikTok – or its parent, ByteDance – to hand over the personal data of its US users. Recently, a wave of states led by Republican governors have introduced state-level restrictions on the use of TikTok on government-owned devices.\n\nProtections for pregnant workers: The law provides pregnant workers with workplace accommodations – such as additional bathroom breaks, stools or relief from heavy lifting duties – needed for healthy pregnancies. It will prevent them from being forced to take leave or losing their jobs, as well as bar employers from denying employment opportunities to women based on their need for reasonable accommodations due to childbirth or related medical conditions. Also, another provision in the package guarantees workplace accommodations – particularly time to pump – for more nursing workers.\n\nChanges to Medicaid and other health care programs: The law phases out the requirement that prevented states from disenrolling Medicaid recipients as long as the national public health emergency was in effect in exchange for an enhanced federal match. This continuous coverage measure was enacted as part of a Covid-19 relief package passed in March 2020 and has led to a record 90 million Medicaid enrollees, many of whom may no longer meet the income requirements to qualify.\n\nUnder the law, states will be able to start evaluating Medicaid enrollees’ eligibility and terminating their coverage as of April 1. The redetermination process will take place over at least 12 months. Also, the enhanced federal Medicaid funding will phase down through December 31, 2023, though the states will have to meet certain conditions during that period.\n\nUp to 19 million people could lose their Medicaid benefits, according to estimates, though many would be eligible for other coverage.\n\nAlso, under a provision in the law, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, will offer 12 months of continuous coverage for children. This will allow the 40 million children on Medicaid and CHIP to have uninterrupted access to health care throughout the year.\n\nIn addition, the law makes permanent the option for states to offer 12 months of postpartum coverage for low-income mothers through Medicaid, rather than just 60 days. More than two dozen states, plus the District of Columbia, have implemented the measure, which was available on a temporary basis through the American Rescue Plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Another seven states are planning to implement the option.\n\nPlus, the package provides more money for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The funds are intended to speed the development of new therapies, diagnostics and preventive measures, beef up public health activities and strengthen the nation’s biosecurity by accelerating development of medical countermeasures for pandemic threats and fortifying stockpiles and supply chains for drugs, masks and other supplies.\n\nIncreased support for the military and veterans: The package funds a 4.6% pay raise for troops and a 22.4% increase in support for Veteran Administration medical care, which provides health services for 7.3 million veterans.\n\nIt includes nearly $53 billion to address higher inflation and $2.7 billion – a 25% increase – to support critical services and housing assistance for veterans and their families.\n\nThe law also allocates $5 billion for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, which provides additional funding to implement the landmark PACT Act that expands eligibility for health care services and benefits to veterans with conditions related to toxic exposure during their service.\n\nBeefing up nutrition assistance: The legislation establishes a permanent nationwide Summer EBT program, starting in the summer of 2024, according to Share Our Strength, an anti-hunger advocacy group. It will provide families whose children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals with a $40 grocery benefit per child per month, indexed to inflation.\n\nIt also changes the rules governing summer meals programs in rural areas. Children will be able to take home or receive delivery of up to 10 days’ worth of meals, rather than have to consume the food at a specific site and time.\n\nThe law also helps families who have had their food stamp benefits stolen since October 1 through what’s known as “SNAP skimming.” It provides them with retroactive federal reimbursement of the funds, which criminals steal by attaching devices to point-of-sale machines or PIN pads to get card numbers and other information from electronic benefits transfer cards.\n\nHigher maximum Pell grant awards: The law increases the maximum Pell grant award by $500 to $7,395 for the coming school year. This marks the largest boost since the 2009-2010 school year. About 7 million students, many from lower-income families, receive Pell grants every year to help them afford college.\n\nHelp to pay utility bills: The package provides $5 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Combined with the $1 billion contained in the earlier continuing resolution, this is the largest regular appropriation for the program, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. Home heating and cooling costs – and the applications for federal aid in paying the bills – have soared this year.\n\nAdditional funding for the US Capitol Police: The law provides an additional $132 million for the Capitol Police for a total of nearly $735 million. It will allow the department to hire up to 137 sworn officers and 123 support and civilian personnel, bringing the force to a projected level of 2,126 sworn officers and 567 civilians.\n\nIt also gives $2 million to provide off-campus security for lawmakers in response to evolving and growing threats.\n\nMore money for child care: The legislation provides $8 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, a 30% increase in funding. The grant gives financial assistance to low-income families to afford child care.\n\nAlso, Head Start will receive nearly $12 billion, an 8.6% boost. The program helps young children from low-income families prepare for school.\n\nMore resources for children’s mental health and for substance abuse: The law provides more funds to increase access to mental health services for children and schools. It also will invest more money to address the opioid epidemic and substance use disorder.\n\nInvestments in homelessness prevention and affordable housing: The legislation provides $3.6 billion for homeless assistance grants, a 13% increase. It will serve more than 1 million people experiencing homelessness.\n\nThe package also funnels nearly $6.4 billion to the Community Development Block Grant formula program and related local economic and community development projects that benefit low- and moderate income areas and people, an increase of almost $1.6 billion.\n\nPlus, it provides $1.5 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which will lead to the construction of nearly 10,000 new rental and homebuyer units and maintain the record investment from the last fiscal year.\n\nMore support for the environment: The package provides an additional $576 million for the Environmental Protection Agency, bringing its funding up to $10.1 billion. It increases support for enforcement and compliance, as well as clean air, water and toxic chemical programs, after years of flat funding.\n\nIt also boosts funding for the National Park Service by 6.4%, restoring 500 of the 3,000 staff positions lost over the past decade. This is intended to help the agency handle substantial increases in visitation.\n\nPlus, the legislation provides an additional 14% in funding for wildland firefighting.\n\nWhat’s not in the law\n\nEnhanced child tax credit: A coalition of Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates pushed hard to extend at least one provision of the enhanced child tax credit, which was in effect last year thanks to the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Their priority was to make the credit more refundable so more of the lowest-income families can qualify. Nearly 19 million kids won’t receive the full $2,000 benefit this year because their parents earn too little, according to a Tax Policy Center estimate.\n\nNew cannabis banking rules: Lawmakers considered including a provision in the spending bill that would make it easier for licensed cannabis businesses to accept credit cards – but it was left out of the legislation. Known as the Safe Banking Act, which previously passed the House, the provision would prohibit federal regulators from taking punitive measures against banks for providing services to legitimate cannabis businesses.\n\nEven though 47 states have legalized some form of marijuana, cannabis remains illegal on the federal level. That means financial institutions providing banking services to cannabis businesses are subject to criminal prosecution – leaving many legal growers and sellers locked out of the banking system.\n\nCovid-19 response: Lawmakers did not include a White House request for an additional $10 billion in funding for Covid-19, which would have been aimed at continued access to and development of vaccines and therapeutics, among other things. Earlier in the year, the Biden administration unsuccessfully pushed for $22.5 billion in extra funds.\n\nFBI headquarters: There was also no final resolution on where the new FBI headquarters will be located, a major point of contention as lawmakers from Maryland – namely House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer – pushed to bring the law enforcement agency into their state. In a deal worked through by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the General Services Administration would be required to conduct “separate and detailed consultations” with Maryland and Virginia representatives about potential sites in each of the states, according to a Senate Democratic aide.\n\nAfghan Adjustment Act: Also not included in the spending bill was the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would have helped Afghan allies who run the risk of deportation from the US. It would have given those evacuees a pathway to lawful permanent residency before their temporary status, known as humanitarian parole, expires in 2023. Many congressional Republicans raised concerns about vetting and other issues, but the legislation’s supporters, including former US military leaders, argued those worries have been addressed.\n\nLegislation to extend and expand Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who worked with the US during the war there and want to come to America is included in the spending bill.", "authors": ["Tami Luhby Katie Lobosco", "Tami Luhby", "Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/michigan/2016/08/27/donors-kalamazoo-promise/88998458/", "title": "Donors promise $70M to aid Kalamazoo, but at what cost?", "text": "Matthew Dolan, Detroit Free Press\n\nKALAMAZOO — When Mayor Bobby Hopewell approached one of the city's wealthiest patrons about helping plug a looming budget gap, he received an unusual response.\n\n\"He told me we were not thinking big enough,\" Hopewell said of his series of meetings this spring with William D. Johnston, a personal friend and chairman of a privately held wealth management company.\n\nThose conversations turned into one of the nation's most unusual philanthropic initiatives, officially unveiled last month and poised to help remake government finances in the southwest Michigan city of 74,000. It also could set a precedent for a new type of government funding.\n\n► Related: Understanding a new 'Kalamazoo Promise'\n\n\"This is investing in a city in a way that's never been done before,\" Kalamazoo City Manager Jim Ritsema said.\n\nCity officials say Johnston, together with his friend, retired drug company CEO William Parfet, pledged $70 million over the next three years to help solve a number of vexing municipal finance problems and also pay for lowering the property tax rate.\n\nThe idea of a municipal-led foundation isn't groundbreaking in the nation, or even in Michigan. Cities and towns across the country have solicited private funds to make up for cutbacks in government programs from parks to music to art to youth sports programs. Philanthropy's role in cities like Grand Rapids and Detroit are also credited with helping rejuvenate civic life. In Detroit's case, a coalition of foundations helped engineer a bankruptcy deal to secure city pensions and safeguard the city's premier art collection.\n\nKalamazoo's wrinkle on the idea, boosters say, builds on the city's success with its decade-old Kalamazoo Promise, the universal tuition-free college scholarship program awarded to every qualified graduate of the city's public school system. Its donors are anonymous, but their ambitions remain large.\n\n►Related: $5 million, legislation sought for Flint Promise scholarship\n\nFinancing property tax reductions and closing operating budget holes, however, is a far different proposition than donating to pensions, saving city-owned art or anonymously paying for college tuition.\n\nSome raise concerns that the new model could help displace the traditional role of government. It also potentially gives the wealthy donors more power over local government operations than perhaps was ever intended in an American-style democracy.\n\nOthers worry that the gift could be a way of pushing a political agenda that seeks to lower taxes outside the electoral process. But supporters say it's really the opposite: a mark of trust in government's ability aided by philanthropy to help solve long-standing community problems.\n\nExperts in philanthropy stress that city leaders must take precautions before diving headfirst into a financial deal with some of the city's wealthiest citizens. And even then, others question whether it's the best use of donor dollars.\n\n\"I'm critical and here's why,\" said Dr. Leslie Lenkowsky, professor emeritus of public affairs and philanthropic studies at the School of Philanthropy at Indiana University. \"The ultimate value of philanthropy is to do things that government can't or won't do.\"\n\nIt's philanthropy's independence that also allows it to make a unique contribution to the public good, he said. \"We have a pluralistic notion of the public interest and some of that we run through government. But not all of it.\"\n\nKalamazoo City Commissioner David Anderson, who has served on the body for 11 years, praised the idea as \"jaw-dropping\" and \"astounding\" but added, \"I think obviously there are a couple of problems. The strongest one is the perception of leverage being created for just a few rich people. So it has to be clear in the agreement that this is not a quid pro quo.\"\n\nHow it works\n\nThe millions would seed a new Foundation for Excellence while helping to cover a growing annual budget shortfall, projected at $2.75 million by 2021. The initial donation would also pay for slashing property taxes by one-third, eliminate the need for a new income tax and fund programs to reduce poverty and bolster youth employment, among other ideas.\n\nIt was Ritsema and Hopewell who approached Johnston and Parfet in a series of private meetings starting in February about the creation of a foundation to aid the city without raising taxes.\n\nThose discussions were sparked after a blue ribbon panel of residents, businesses, nonprofits and education experts in December issued a report on the city's finances but failed to endorse a new city income tax, a measure that many saw as the quickest way to raise much-needed cash.\n\nBefore the foundation can get going, there will be public hearings, and the plan would have to be approved by local elected officials. The foundation would also try to raise an additional $300 million to $500 million endowment over the next three years to keep reducing property taxes until they're at half of heir current levels and provide new money for some government programs into perpetuity.\n\nThe Kalamazoo deal isn't inked yet, and some elected officials say they'll need to read the fine print before signing off on what would a historic tie-up between city government and Kalamazoo's richest benefactors. Donors and city leaders say the foundation will be run with strict performance metrics in place to ensure it remains on track.\n\nBut there are still many unanswered questions about the details of its philanthropic plans and its founders. The motivations of the donors, for example, remain mysterious. Parfet and Johnston did not return requests for comment and have not spoken publicly about the reasons for their proposed largess.\n\nNeed for tax reform?\n\nFor some, the donation looks like a novel, albeit last-ditch attempt through local charitable efforts to help overcome a statewide and systemic problem of inadequate financial support for local government.\n\n\"Michigan is unusually restrictive on revenue options for local government and also has a highly fragmented local government structure,\" said Timothy Bartik, senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, a nonprofit, independent research organization in Kalamazoo.\n\nUnlike most states, Michigan has no local option sales tax, and the state restricts how much localities can boost property tax. Kalamazoo, for example, has nearly half of all of its property off the tax rolls thanks to nonprofit organizations such as health care institutions and colleges.\n\n\"The combination particularly hampers cities that have little new land to develop, as one of the few ways you can raise property tax revenue is from new development,\" Bartik said. \"Revenue sharing has been cut back by quite a bit. Local income taxes are one option for cities but are more problematic both politically and economically when you have a highly fragmented local government structure.\"\n\nAs a result of all this, many local governments are under severe financial strain and struggle to figure out how to finance local services\n\nThe latest check of the state's pulse isn't especially encouraging. After five years of steady statewide improvement, fewer Michigan communities report that they are better able to meet their fiscal needs this year.\n\nA University of Michigan survey released last week polled top elected and appointed officials in the state's 1,856 units of local government. This year, 31% reported they were better able to meet financial needs. That is down from 38% last year saying they were better able to meet fiscal needs. The number of those who said they were less able to meet financial needs also grew in this year's report compared with 2015 results.\n\n\"For the first time since the end of the Great Recession, the trend of more and more local officials reporting gradual improvements in fiscal health overall has reversed,\" Thomas Ivacko, administrator and program manager of the university's Ford School's Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy, said. \"The reversal includes jurisdictions of every size and type.\"\n\nOverall, nearly half — 45% — of jurisdictions report no significant change in their fiscal health from last year. But most worrisome were county governments, 19% of which said their fiscal stress was high. That was up from 3% in 2015, Ivacko said.\n\nKalamazoo's philanthropic strategy is an approach that might help some communities that have lots of local wealth with an intense interest in the local community, Bartik said.\n\n\"But it raises the issue: Are there needed statewide policy reforms to deal with the overall local government finance problem?\" the economist said.\n\nFunding big ideas\n\nAccording to draft plans in Kalamazoo, the initial $70.3 million would be spent across three years on three priorities: $7.6 million on budget stabilization, $32.7 on reducing property taxes to 12 mills from 19.2705 mills today and $30 million on investing in aspirational ideas such as new ways to alleviate poverty and provide better services to children.\n\nThe investments would be driven by an ongoing community decision-making process known as Imagine Kalamazoo 2025, the city’s master plan update process. Together with other money raised by the foundation in the future, the plan also calls for reducing the property tax eventually to 10 mills, which officials say would make Kalamazoo more competitive with its immediate neighboring cities and towns.\n\nThe plan calls for Kalamazoo’s elected leaders to direct the use of funds independently, but details still need to be worked out and approved by the city's commission. Public meetings before the commission on the issue are expected in September. The goal is to prepare the necessary documents to gain formal approval by the end of the year.\n\nAaron Dorfman, president and CEO of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, which bills itself as the nation's only independent watchdog of foundations, said he's concerned about the personal benefit to the donors of such a large gift.\n\n\"Would the donors be better off making a donation rather than having to take a tax hit\" from a future income tax?\" Dorfman said. \"If so, that's no way to do policy.\"\n\nIt''s all part of the inherent danger \"when donors decide what should be a democratic decision,\" he said.\n\nMattie Jordan-Woods, executive director of the Northside Association for Community Development, believes opposition to the plan makes little sense at this point.\n\n\"I do not understand saying no, unless they are asking you to do things that's not right,\" said Jordan-Woods, who is 60 and has lived and worked in one of the city's predominantly African-American and lower-income neighborhoods for more than 30 years.\n\n\"I think that there are a lot of people who really love the city and that's what we have here,\" she said. \"I love the city too, but I don’t have any money.\"\n\nCritics \"keep saying, it’s a tax write-off\" for the donors, she said. But Jordan-Woods had a response for the skeptics.\n\n\"Well, they still don't have to give it here,\" she said. \"And they are.\"\n\nRip Rapson, president of the Troy-based Kresge Foundation, which pledged $100 million for a so-called Grand Bargain to help Detroit speed an exit from the nation's largest municipal bankruptcy, said there's \"not much to fault in the kind of courage it takes for such a big risk.\"\n\nPhilanthropy's track record\n\nThough the donors aren't talking, one of their largest joint endeavors has been on public display at the city's Western Michigan University.\n\nIn 2011, Parfet, then the chairman and chief executive officer of MPI Research and the great-grandson of W.E. Upjohn, donated a 330,000-square-foot building in downtown Kalamazoo to serve as the future home of the university's medical school.\n\nThe property was on the original plot of land acquired by W. E. Upjohn to begin the Upjohn Co. and housed at the research facility where Motrin, Xanax and Rogaine were developed. Today, Parfet is also chairman of Gov. Rick Snyder's political action committee.\n\nOn March 11, 2014, the university announced the new medical school would be named for Dr. Homer Stryker, an alumnus and founder of Stryker Corporation. The move honored the once-anonymous donors of a $100-million gift — one of the largest single gifts in the history of higher education — from Stryker's granddaughter, Ronda Stryker, and her husband, William Johnston, who was also a university trustee and heads up Greenleaf Companies as chairman. The university's website lists Johnston's home as Portage, which is just outside Kalamazoo.\n\nForbes' wealthiest Americans list last year included two members of the Stryker family, whose company makes replacement joints and other medical devices. Ronda Stryker is worth $3.7 billion, placing her 159th.\n\nMany Kalamazoo leaders say they welcome the latest generosity from the offspring of the Upjohn and Stryker families, and are loath to look a gift horse in the mouth without cause.\n\n\"I'm excited about the opportunity,\" City Commissioner Erin Knott. \"There is just wide support for this.\" She added the city's challenge will be raising the related foundation endowment, estimated between $300 and $500 million.\n\n​ Kalamazoo Promise\n\nThe Kalamazoo Promise blazed a new trail for place-based philanthropy and earned the city a national reputation, but the program is still working to improve success for the city's poorest and nonwhite students, who have lagged in completing college degrees.\n\nStill, the enormity of the ongoing gift and the attention it has received \"helped stabilize the community. I think it has brought the community together,\" said Promise executive director Bob Jorth.\n\nThe 10-year program has spent more than $80 million so far to allow 4,200 students to attend college. Studies have shown its effect on boosting the city's college attendance rates, public school population and some property values. But it's less clear how much the program may have directly fueled the city's population growth and business climate.\n\nThe population of the city saw a decline in the 1980s because of the loss of manufacturing jobs, particularly in the automotive industry, mirroring statewide trends. Globalization forced downsizing and job losses at Upjohn, the area’s largest employer, which would eventually merge with Pharmacia and later acquired by Pfizer, then the world’s largest pharmaceutical company.\n\nIn the last five years, Kalamazoo's population has grown slightly, by 2.4% between 2010 and 2015, according to the U.S. Census. Almost half of all residents occupy homes they own. Almost 90% of adults over the age of 25 have a high school degree or higher, but only one-third have college degrees or higher. About 35% live in poverty, census figures show.\n\n“The Kalamazoo Promise has shown us what is possible when we, as a community, ask ourselves, ‘What can we do for our community? What can we do to address a challenge?’ ” Hopewell. said “This will provide an opportunity for this community to unite around a common vision to truly make Kalamazoo a city of promise.”\n\nContact Matthew Dolan: 313-223-4743 or msdolan@freepress.com.

Alfred Taubman's $100-million gift to the A. Alfred Taubman Medical Research Institute in 2011. The single largest gift to U-M is $200 million from developer Stephen Ross for athletics and the Stephen M. Ross School of Business in 2013.\n\nRead more:\n\nColleges' challenge: Dealing with demanding donors\n\nU-M wants to strip name of ex-president from building\n\nThe gift brings the Rogels' total giving to U-M to $188.5 million. That makes the couple the second-biggest donor to U-M, trailing only Ross, who has pledged more than $378 million. Their giving has supported the Kenneth G. Lieberthal and Richard H. Rogel Center for Chinese Studies in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts; the Rogel Medical Scholars at the Medical School, and the Rogel Award for Excellence, providing need-based support for more than 540 undergraduate students since 2000.\n\nThe cancer center, ranked No. 12 in the nation by U.S. News and World Report and consistently in the top 10 in research funding from the National Cancer Institute, will be renamed for the Rogels, who are donating the money to help bring in researchers for new collaborations in research.\n\n\"This is about the people who work there ... and dream there and take care of the patients there,\" Richard Rogel told the Free Press on Wednesday afternoon. \"I've had the chance to get to know the researchers, to be in their labs. This will help them continue their work and to bring in new scientists. It's an amazing institution.\"\n\nRichard Rogel is president of the Colorado-based investing firm Tomay Inc. He is the founder, former chairman and CEO of the Preferred Provider Organization of Michigan, which was the first in the country to provide a PPO health insurance plan. He graduated as the valedictorian of his 1970 class at what is now the U-M Stephen M. Ross School of Business and received an honorary doctor of laws degree in 2009.\n\nThe gift also comes from the Rogels' personal history with cancer. Richard Rogel lost his father to pancreatic cancer. Susan Rogel's daughter, Ilene, died 5½ years ago from an aggressive form of lung cancer at age 50.\n\nWith few treatments available to help Ilene, “it made us want to do more to help with the fight against cancer,” said Richard Rogel. “It’s as simple as that.\n\n\"Does this solve all the funding needs? No, but it brings attention to the work the center is doing.\"\n\nRichard Rogel said he likes the way Michigan Medicine researchers work together.\n\n\"I call Michigan ‘Collaboration U’ because so many different units work together to solve problems,” Rogel said. “Putting all this brain power and excitement together is going to help us find a cure for cancer. It will make people’s lives better.\"\n\nThe gift will be split into six areas:\n\nPioneering cancer research and technology: This will provide competitive grants to research teams developing new approaches and technologies to advance early cancer detection, monitoring and treatment.\n\nCollaborative networks: This will establish a signature program that brings international luminaries in the cancer field to U-M for six to 12 months. They will develop new projects that will continue after they leave, creating a collaborative network focused on advancing and applying cancer knowledge.\n\nCutting-edge scientists: This will provide support to retain or recruit dynamic researchers to pursue high-risk, high-reward projects.\n\nScientific freedom: This will create a suite of endowed professorships in cancer research, tied to research funds that will convey U-M’s commitment to discovery and innovation.\n\nPromising new researchers: This will support the development of independent research careers for a cohort of highly motivated, advanced postdoctoral cancer research scientists whose work shows signs of great promise.\n\nScholarship support: This will offer scholarships to enable medical students and other predoctoral trainees to develop the skills and knowledge they need to make lasting contributions to the health of individuals and populations, including those with cancer.\n\n“This generous gift brings major new opportunities for our cancer center to dramatically increase the pace of generating important advances in the cancer field,” Eric Fearon, director of the cancer center, said in a news release.. “We will be able to develop and apply selected discoveries for new approaches to reduce the burden of cancer and improve quality of life for cancer patients and survivors, as well as assist in building the careers of the next generation of cancer researchers and clinicians.”\n\nU-M has a long history of significant cancer research discoveries, including identifying a genetic alteration seen in 50% of all prostate cancers. This is now helping oncologists direct treatment and identify cancer stem cells, the small number of cells in a tumor believed to fuel its growth and spread.\n\n“I deeply appreciate Richard and Susan Rogel’s unwavering devotion to this commitment,\" U-M President Mark Schlissel said in a news release. \"Their wonderful gift will further elevate the life-changing impact of our cancer center, while advancing the amazing work of our faculty and students and inspiring new hope for millions of patients around the globe.”\n\nContact David Jesse: 313-222-8851 or djesse@freepress.com.

But on a Saturday morning in March of last year I walk into room 6104 of the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. The space is too small, the table too big and the air never seems to move.\n\nThis is an organ transplant support group, and everybody here knows sickness intimately and speaks of it openly. They talk about constipation and catheters like most people talk about the weather. I look around to see if anyone else is about to hyperventilate.\n\nTwo of us are waiting for transplants, and we say almost nothing. Everyone else has already received one, and they don't stop.\n\nI don't want to know about hard times and doubt. I have no interest in drug protocols and risk factors. I want to stop being a diabetic. I want to take control of my health. I want to grow old and read books and take walks with my wife. I want to see our little girl, Lucy, now 7, walk down the aisle. I want to be well. I have no interest in the truth.\n\nBut the truth is sitting right in front of me. She has long brown hair and her coat is zipped up to her chin. Her skin is gray and she looks so tired. She does not say a word until she is asked to introduce herself and tell everybody why she is here. Her voice is raspy.\n\nShe says she has been on the wait list for a pancreas for more than a year. Nobody wants to be listed for a year. After 365 days, you have to go through the listing process again, meaning more medical tests and more blood work and more judging. You can be delisted. This woman had just been put on a \"hold\" meaning she was temporarily off the list.\n\nHer doctors said her heart had grown too weak. They gave her medicine and said it might make her healthy enough to get back on the list, but you could tell she does not really believe them. She says she might go visit her sister in Florida and the room goes quiet. Finally she exhales and says: \"Anyway.\"\n\nAll I can think is that she is one fewer person waiting for a pancreas in front of me. I never learn her name.\n\nThe decision to try to get a transplant started with the complicated math sick people do when they dare. These are word problems really: If John is a 48-year-old man with four children, one wife and two dogs, and he has been living with type-1 diabetes for three decades, how many good years does he have left?\n\nI started asking myself this question in my 20s. I asked it more intently at 30 when I married Laura and we started having children. I thought I would ask it less as the children grew older, but I am wrong. As they started to become teenagers, instead of feeling like I had done my job and sent them on their path, I only wanted more time with them. They still need me. I still need them.\n\nAs I, and they, grow older, my questions become more specific and more complicated. Will I be able to make vaguely inappropriate toasts at their weddings? Will I be able to babysit their children? When will I become a burden to my family?\n\nI began to not like the answers. The math no longer worked.\n\nInstead of watching them graduate from college, I was going to become their admissions essay as they detail the pain and embarrassment of taking care of their sick dad.\n\nI was becoming consumed with the fear of getting sick. I was terrified of being a middle-aged man who sticks around a little too long, drains the life force from his family and then finally has the decency to die.\n\nSo I made a choice. I wanted a pancreas transplant.\n\nI was a freshman in high school when I suddenly felt tired and thirsty and had to pee all the time. After about a week, I heard my mother speaking quietly on the phone to her friend Jan, saying she thought it was diabetes. She made a doctor's appointment for me.\n\nThe doctor, an older guy, told me I had juvenile diabetes because my body stopped making insulin. He seemed to know little about the disease beyond that. He said I could expect to have a \"normal life\" until I was about 30 years old. I can still hear him saying it.\n\nI did my best to control the disease. I gave myself insulin shots for 22 years and then used an insulin pump for 12 years after that. At the turn of each decade of my life, when I turned 20, 30, 40, I asked myself and God for 10 more good years. To hell with that doctor.\n\nI knew complications would come. I could cite the statistics like I used to rattle off the batting averages of my beloved Red Sox.\n\nDiabetics die from heart disease and stroke at twice the rate of other people. More than 60 percent of leg and foot amputations not related to an injury are due to diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of new blindness. Nerve damage happens in 60 percent to 70 percent of people with diabetes. People with diabetes are at high risk for gum disease.\n\nIn my future, I saw a footless, blind and impotent man having a stroke. And my gums would hurt.\n\nAfter we got married, Laura and I lived in Phoenix for 14 years. My doctor there was tough and smart and forced me to be disciplined. I saw her four times a year for 14 years. At each appointment I asked her about a transplant. Each of those 56 times, she would shake her head, smile and say: \"Maybe later.\"\n\nMy control, she said, was too good to justify the risk of a transplant. But I felt that control begin to wane no matter how hard I worked.\n\nIn my mid-40s, I was sticking my finger 10 times a day, drawing blood and testing my glucose levels. I ate right, exercised and was disciplined. Managing this disease was consuming my life, but my lows were getting lower and my highs were getting higher.\n\nWhen low, I could not think clearly, could be irrational and \"difficult\" – the nice way of putting it. Laura bore much of this and I could see the way my kids looked at me. Our son Theo, in particular, was wired in to how I was feeling. I could see him giving his mother a look and hear him whispering in her ear. \"Is Dad all right?\" \"Is Dad getting low?\"\n\nMore dangerous, when very low, I could lose awareness and then consciousness. I had been to emergency rooms.\n\nIn a healthy person, blood sugar levels, a measurement of the amount of glucose in the blood, should be in the fairly tight range of 60 to 90 milligrams per deciliter. My blood sugars began dropping down to the 30s and 40s. They were spiking into the 250s.\n\nI was damaging my body.\n\nI read everything I could to find ways to control my blood sugar better and stay healthy. Alpha-lipoic acids might protect my body from cell damage, so I should eat spinach. Polyphenols would promote glucose control and vascular health, so I should try green tea and dark chocolate.\n\nDr. Oz told me to eat cinnamon.\n\nBut nothing worked, and I didn't like green tea. I no longer wanted to stay the course and evaluate my options. That was a path of diminishing returns. The only way to stop being a diabetic is to get a pancreas transplant.\n\nPancreas transplants are not experimental, but they are not common. In 2013, there were 16,894 kidney transplants performed in this country and only 256 pancreas transplants.\n\nThe failure rate in the first year for a transplanted pancreas is about 10 percent. I did not care. Life after transplant would require a handful of drugs every day for the rest of my life to suppress my immune system. I did not care.\n\n******\n\nIn early 2012, Laura was hired as managing editor of The Enquirer, and I was hired as a reporter. So we moved to Cincinnati, put the kids in school, bought a home and I found a doctor.\n\nDr. Marzieh Salehi at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center worked with me to gain control. She tried to eliminate my low blood sugars and the highs but nothing was working.\n\nAt my second appointment, I told her I wanted a transplant, and I waited for her to shake her head, smile and say: \"Maybe later.\" She didn't say that.\n\nIn December 2012 I have my first meeting with the UC transplant team. This is my first time in Room 6104. I arrive early, taking a seat at the front. I will know the most, I will ask the smartest questions, I will \"win\" a transplant. At the orientation, one of the patients, a woman in a black beret and a purple track suit, falls asleep during the meeting. I figure I have her beat.\n\nI meet Dr. Tayyab Diwan. He is 38, handsome and confident. His suit is tailored, his eyebrows are perfect and he is the smartest guy in the room. It would be easy not to like him. I like him right away.\n\nDr. Diwan tells me about the surgery, that I will keep my original pancreas because it still performs some vital functions. He says all surgeries come with risk and that this is a long and fairly complicated procedure. He asks if I have any questions. I have three.\n\n\"If you had a family member in my spot, would you recommend this surgery?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Would you recommend he do it here?\"\n\n\"There are a couple of places I would recommend. This is one of them.\"\n\n\"Can you do this surgery?\"\n\nThe question amuses him. \"A pancreas transplant? Yes, of course I can do this surgery.\"\n\nI know enough. I want a transplant, and I want this guy to do it.\n\n******\n\nBefore I will be considered for a transplant, I need a series of tests to measure my health. My heart is checked, my circulation, my lungs, and even my teeth. A transplant recipient must be sick enough to need one and well enough to withstand one. It is not a fine line, but it is not too wide either. All my results and my medical records will be evaluated by the transplant team at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Christmas passes and then New Year's Day. This wait is excruciating and Laura and I tell nobody. On January 10, 2013, my phone rings while I am at work. I am listed.\n\nNow that I am on this list, I start doing a different kind of math, looking for a pattern, an \"x\" and a \"y,\" so I can calculate a probable timeline. Trouble is, the list is not linear — it is not like taking a number at the deli.\n\nTo receive a pancreas, somebody must first die. And that person has to die suddenly, and he or she has to die while still healthy. In all likelihood, that means a victim of a car crash.\n\nWhen nobody is looking, I look up numbers on traffic fatalities.\n\nTraffic safety improvements including air bags, car designs and seat belt usage have dropped the fatality rate – reducing the number of potential donors. In 2013, 923 people died in traffic fatalities in Ohio, the lowest number since the state started keeping statistics in 1936. I feel like I should not know these statistics, not like this. And that I should be happier about it now that I do.\n\nOther factors include tissue matches and blood types. The person who dies has to be a donor and close.\n\nThe process includes so many variables, each completely independent of the other, it feels more like randomness. Actually it feels more like Chaos Theory, which says seemingly random events have an underlying order. But there is no order I can see.\n\n******\n\nOn the morning of May 13, the day after Mother's Day, my phone rings.\n\nThe voice on the line is calm. \"We have a pancreas for you.\"\n\nI am at my desk in the newsroom. This transplant will change my life, save my life, change our kids' lives. But all I can think about is her tone. This is not an imperative sentence. It is not exclamatory, either. It's a simple declaration: \"We have a pancreas for you.\"\n\nI go to tell Laura; she knows when she sees my face. We race home, pack a bag and write a note to the kids. They will see it when they get home from school.\n\nAt the hospital, I learn the pancreas is being flown in, but nobody will say from where. After 4 hours, I am wheeled into an elevator and down for surgery. This is happening.\n\nI meet the anesthesiologist. I meet with Dr. Diwan, who tells me he will check the pancreas as soon as it arrives. I ask him how he will know if the pancreas is not good. Will it look funny? Will it smell funny? Will it be like chicken that has gone bad in the refrigerator? He puts his hand at the foot of my bed and tells me to try to relax.\n\nJust as I am about to be wheeled in for surgery, Dr. Diwan walks through the curtain and says he doesn't like this pancreas. An artery to the organ does not look right. \"Let's not do this,\" Diwan says. \"Wait for the right one.\" I am listening to hear if this is the start of a debate we get to have. It is not.\n\nI look around the room, at the machines, my wife, the nurses. I ask Diwan if I should just put my pants on and go home. \"Yes.\"\n\nFrom that day forward I am anxious. Every morning I am sure is the day. Every time the phone rings I map out routes to the hospital in my head. I also feel tethered; I have to be able to arrive at the hospital within one hour of receiving a phone call telling me there is a pancreas for me.\n\nI miss my father's 80th birthday party in Massachusetts. We cannot take the kids on vacation. We miss our annual trip to Fenway Park. My sister's husband is sick in Chicago; we cannot drive up to help her out. I get to know every corner of Cincinnati, and I grow to love the city, but the leash feels tight.\n\nWorse, I am just absent. I have always thought being a good dad is easy. It means being present and paying attention. It means sitting down in the kitchen while Theo has a bowl of cereal with chocolate milk and chatting about school. It means watching a football game with Henry and talking if he wants to talk, being quiet if he want to be quiet. It means kicking the soccer ball in the front yard with Luke or walking with Lucy to Graeter's so she could get a scoop of cookies-and-cream.\n\nI am not doing enough of that anymore. I am always preoccupied. I am waiting for the phone to ring.\n\nThe longer I wait, the more desperately I want the phone to ring, and it makes me feel guilty.\n\nI know somebody has to die for me to get a pancreas. The donor already seems like a ghost to me.\n\nBut I can imagine the donor's family. They are waiting for a call they do not want. Worse, they don't even know they are waiting. But that phone is going to ring, and a stranger on the line is going to tell them about an accident or a stroke or a suicide attempt.\n\nI know what those calls are like. I received one once.\n\nMy sister Maura died in a car accident when she was a junior in college and I was a freshman. We were the youngest of five children and close. She was spending a year in Europe and had left me as her emergency contact – a silly thing we did because we both thought it more likely to be arrested than get in an accident.\n\nSo I got the call from the State Department telling me my sister was dead. And then I had to call my dad. He said nothing at first. That call was the hardest and worst thing I ever had to do. Now, every day I am hoping somebody will get the same call. I am losing my humanity while I am hoping to be made whole.\n\nOn the Fourth of July, thunderstorms make driving awful. I hear an ambulance and I wonder about the condition of the person inside. I am becoming a ghoul.\n\n******\n\nThe summer passes, the kids go back to school, the Red Sox win the World Series. The weather begins to cool and the rain starts to fall. My listing anniversary is beginning to loom, and I am afraid of what this waiting is doing to me and to Laura and the kids.\n\nI tell Laura that I regret being listed and that, when we get to one year, when it is time for more tests and to be reassessed, that I won't do it. It is all too much, too selfish.\n\nOn the night of Friday, Nov. 1, All Saints Day, my phone rings at 10. Laura is upstairs putting Lucy to bed. I am in the kitchen with Theo and Luke. Henry is out with friends. It has to be Henry.\n\nThe woman on the phone has a calm voice and a southern accent. \"We have a pancreas for you.\"\n\nShe asks how I am feeling. I tell her I am fine. She asks if I have a fever, I do not.\n\nTheo and Luke, apparently, have listened intently to every call I received for the past 11 months. They stand right next to each other. They look at each other and then at me. They know right away.\n\n\"Is this it? It that the hospital?\" I nod my head and try to concentrate.\n\nThey stand on the stairs, each holding the other's arm, looking like they are boxing each other out for a rebound.\n\n\"Can we tell Mom?\"\n\n\"No,\" I say to them, \"not yet.\"\n\nThe woman on the phone asks if there is a problem.\n\nShe tells me to come in. She wants to know if I could be there in an hour. I tell her I can be there in 15 minutes. She tells me to drive safely and to report to the emergency room and then the sixth floor.\n\n\"Go tell your mother,\" I say to the boys.\n\n******\n\nLaura and I rush to the hospital, and then we wait. I cannot eat or drink, it feels impossible to sleep and it turns out I have very difficult veins to insert an IV into. I am grumpy and anxious and my arms hurt. A nurse tells us the donor \"is downstairs.\" I am no longer grumpy I just feel like a jerk.\n\nThe next morning, Kathy Daley, the transplant social worker, comes to my room. I think maybe she has come just to see me because she is that terrific. Turns out this is the first Saturday of the month and there is another transplant meeting. This is a special one: The family of a previous donor will be there.\n\nI walk down the hall with my IV stand and return to Room 6104.\n\nA couple sits at the end of the table. They are about my age. They sit quietly and then begin slowly, sharing the story of their daughter who died in an RV accident five years earlier. The mom has notes.\n\nHer daughter's name was Ellie and she was 10. They donated her organs because it felt right. \"That's what Ellie would want,\" the mother said. \"Her love language was gift-giving.\"\n\nOne by one we go around the room to thank them. It is the same group from last time, minus the woman who had been put on hold. I wonder what happened to her.\n\nWhen my turn comes, I want this family to know what it means to me. I want them to know that I have four children and a wife. I want to tell them what their gift probably meant to a person just like me.\n\nBut I can't do it. I can't say any of that. I say \"thank you\" and stop. I do not want to cry in front of them. I want them to be happy. And they have brought their daughter, Ellie's little sister. I wonder if she looked like Ellie. I wonder if she could remember her.\n\nI won't cry in front of this little girl. I stand up in my hospital gown and try to leave, but my IV stand gets stuck on the chair, and I have to yank it free. I get to the door, say thank you again and leave.\n\nAt 10 o'clock that night, they wheel me in for surgery.\n\n******\n\nTwo days earlier, on Oct. 31, at 4:40 a.m., a 27-year-old woman got into her car in North Bend. She took a right on Stephens Avenue. Then a left onto Lawrenceburg Road. She was driving alone and headed to the early shift at the post office. There were cornfields on both sides of the road.\n\nShe passed four silos, and the road began to bend left. Then back to the right again. She was just half a mile from her home when the back end of her 14-year-old Nissan began to slide out. The road was wet and her tires were old. It was 58 degrees.\n\nShe began to spin counterclockwise. She crossed the center of the road, now sideways, in the dark, at the mercy of chance and physics.\n\nShe was wearing a seat belt, but the utility pole was sitting just off the road.\n\nDoctors would declare her brain-dead 12 hours later. She was a healthy woman with a strong body and a devastating head injury. A perfect organ donor. She was a wife and the mother of four children. Her heart kept beating.\n\nI see a light and hear sounds. I do not know where I am. I fall back to sleep and wake again. Now I can distinguish voices and beeps. I am in a hospital.\n\nI reach out for Laura, I know she will be there. In all the world I want to know only one thing. Did it work?\n\n\"Yes,\" Laura says, \"it worked.\"\n\nFor the first time in 35 years, I am not a diabetic. I fall back to sleep, a new pancreas working inside of me.\n\nThe following morning I am in the surgical intensive care unit. I have a central line in my neck, an IV in my arm, a catheter in my penis, a tube down my nose, a drainage tube coming from my stomach. My incision is held together by 20 metal staples, and I am wearing \"medical mittens\" so I cannot pull any of it out.\n\nThe nurse tells me to get up. \"Like, stand up?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she says, \"you must walk.\"\n\nLess than 12 hours after surgery, I walk through the SICU, singing a song from the \"The Brady Bunch\" which falls into my head: \"I think I'll go for a walk outside, yeah, the summer sun's calling my name.\" The drugs apparently agree with me.\n\nI say hello to each person I come across in the hallway like this is the greatest day in the world. I am standing up and I am walking. I am not taking insulin. This is easy.\n\nOver the next few days I learn that having a catheter is bad, and that getting it out is worse. I also learn the benefits of morphine. I am not permitted to eat or drink anything in the first six days after surgery. I have an IV to hydrate me and give me medicine. I feel tired but good.\n\nDr. Diwan visits every day and each time asks me how I am feeling. One the third day I tell him I feel great; that I am not a diabetic anymore. I begin to cry and am immediately embarrassed. He nods his head, his face unreadable. He has seen success and he has seen failure. He puts his hand again at the foot of my bed, I realize this is a thing he does. He looks at Laura and then me and says, slowly, \"This is going to be a hard road.\"\n\n******\n\nI wrote a story once about a little girl named Amber who had cancer. Her mother noticed that Amber's vital signs got better when her sisters were in the room. When my kids come to visit for the first time, I understand. Lying in my hospital bed, I can close my eyes and hear them and pretend I am at home.\n\nLaura has warned the kids that I was sick, that I have tubes coming out of my neck and nose and arm and stomach, that I am not regular old dad.\n\nHenry, 15 at the time, doesn't visit the first day. I think he does not want to see me sick. I think he figures I would not want him to see me sick. I had told him I would be fine and that is good enough for him.\n\nTheo, 12, does not want to look at me, but he wants to be near me. He stands next to the bed, places his hand on my head and looks away. He wants me to know he is close.\n\nLuke, 11, walks in and gives me a hug. I do my best not to cry.\n\nLucy, 7, looks at me, assesses the room and starts asking the nurse questions. What's that blue thing? What is in that tube? Where is his old pancreas?\n\nEvery couple of hours my blood sugar gets checked – the easiest way to make sure my new pancreas is still working. Two days after surgery, I start the day at 79, but then start creeping up: 79, 85, 112, 146. This feels like diabetes to me. I know this feeling. I hate this feeling.\n\nThis increase can mean only one of two things: my blood sugar is rising because of the trauma my body is experiencing or my pancreas is starting to fail.\n\nDoctors and nurses are confident it is the first scenario. And, yes, they have actual training and experience, but I'm sure they are wrong. I begin to worry.\n\nTwo hours later, another blood sugar test. This time, I am 112. I fall asleep while Laura sits next to the bed.\n\nDoctors are pounding me with anti-rejection medicine. My immune system is being suppressed so that my body will not reject the new organ. Three or four days in, and I begin to feel lousy from no food, bad sleep and heavy drugs. I tell Laura I feel like I made a mistake. I start to cry, again. I am 48 years old, and I have cried five times since I was a kid. I cried at the birth of each of our children. I cried when my sister died. I cry this day and tell Laura I fear I have made a mistake. For the first time I question why I did this. Dr. Diwan tells me the drugs will make me emotional.\n\nLaura opens her computer and reads emails and entries from friends on Facebook. People are thinking of me. People are sending their thoughts. And people are praying. I mean, really praying.\n\nJennifer Wheeler tells me a group of Mormons in Mesa, Ariz., are praying for me. Rachel Greene has a friend of hers write my name on a piece of paper and put the piece of paper in the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. Father Tom O'Hara, a longtime friend, says a prayer for me while saying Mass at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. The children of the Goodykoontz family and the Pichler family and the Fleury family all add me to their bedtime prayers. A group at a Methodist Church makes a prayer blanket for me. A Jewish temple in Phoenix prays.\n\nI have never been a person who prays, but these prayers make me feel cared for, lighter. I don't know yet how much I will need them.\n\n******\n\nI spend one week in the hospital. A week of optimism followed by certainty that I was failing, that my new pancreas was not going to work and I would let everybody down.\n\nMy parents come to visit and they look so worried. On their last visit, my father kisses my head and my mother stands next to the bed just looking at me. They are worried. I decide right then I need to get a mirror so I can see what I look like. It must be awful.\n\nThe kids come every night. Henry starts coming too. He is quiet and sweet and a little bit nervous. I am sicker than he expected: I am pale, I have already lost a lot of weight. Each night Laura takes the kids home and then returns. She is always here, sitting at my bed, trying hard to look not worried. She watches everything. I need her.\n\nThe doctors and nurses had told me I would feel awful after the surgery, but I thought the rules would not apply to me. I am exhausted and hungry and my cheeks are hollowing out, but I begin to make progress. Thursday the tube in my nose comes out and I get to have something to drink. Friday I get chicken broth. Saturday I am allowed real food. I order a ham and cheese omelet, and it tastes so good. It feels like I am in Paris.\n\nLater this morning, one week after surgery, Dr. Diwan tells me I will go home the next day. That seems preposterous but he says the pancreas is working and that my body is handling the drugs well. I tell him how awful I feel, and he says that is normal for a person who had major surgery and is on a new drug protocol. Our positions are changing. I am beginning to think this will not last, he is beginning to think it will.\n\nAt 3:30 I take my first shower since my surgery a week earlier. I want to make myself look better before I go home.\n\nI still have a central line in my neck and a drainage tube in my stomach. Laura helps me cover them with an adhesive plastic. I take the shower and return to the room feeling weak and tired. I cannot get the plastic off my neck without pulling at the central line and need Laura to help untangle me.\n\nNow I am standing naked in the middle of the room. I am dripping wet. I have lost so much weight. I feel awful and pale and dizzy. I am tired and I am wearing flip-flops.\n\n\"Get out!\" I tell my wife.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Get out, close the door!\"\n\n\"John, no, you need help.\"\n\n\"Get out. I've lost so much. I have no dignity left.\"\n\nThen I cry again.\n\nI feel awful about everything. That she has to see me this way. That I have become so pathetic. That I have done this to us. That I am sick and she has to take care of me.\n\nLaura smiles and leaves the room. I put on clothes, real clothes and sit for a while. When she comes back I tell her I am sorry.\n\nLaura, kindly, says this is me becoming human again, a little spark of the actual me. That night I feel better. My sister Sally comes to visit from Toronto. Laura, Sally and I, plus all the kids, sit around the room while Theo, Luke and Lucy ask us riddles from a book.\n\nLater, Sally takes the kids home. Laura climbs into my hospital bed and we watch TV. She puts her head on my chest and falls immediately asleep. I turn off the television so I can hear her breathing.\n\n******\n\nThe next morning I walk out of the hospital. The air is crisp, the sun is shining and I cannot quite stand up straight because of the six inches of metal stitches running up my belly. I was nervous about going home, but now I am excited. Lucy comes down the stairs to the front door. Doctors have told me I cannot lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk for at least six weeks. I cannot pick her up, but she stands on the stairs while I kneel down and hug her. I try to cry silently, but she notices. She says: \"Dad?\" She has never seen me cry. A moment later, louder and more worried: \"Mom?\" Laura tells her these are tears of joy.\n\nThe boys and I watch football and I eat some macaroni and cheese, and then take Henry to his high school football banquet. It is a great day. I am better than I expect. I am better than the kids expect. The next day, Monday, I feel even better. I get a haircut, I go grocery shopping, which means I actually do something useful for the family.\n\nI will go to the post-transplant clinic three times a week for the first few months. I'll get my blood drawn and wait for my results to come back. I will be weighed and talk to the nurses and doctors and social workers and the pharmacist. I get the sense that doctors and nurses just want to get a look at me. The first day, my numbers look good.\n\nTwo days later, Wednesday, Nov. 13, my pancreas is still working, but I no longer feel good. There will be no grocery shopping or getting a haircut today. I just feel weak and tired. I figure it is my weight. I have lost 16 pounds in the 11 days since the surgery and am down to 161 pounds. I have been feeling nauseated and cannot eat. Maybe the drugs are getting to me, too.\n\nAfter my blood draw, they let me go home. They say they can call me with the results. It almost feels like the flu. Great.\n\nThe kids are back in school, and I have insisted that Laura return to work. The house is quiet. I try to read and then I try to watch TV. I can't do either.\n\nLate that afternoon, as the sun is beginning to set, Dr. Gautham Mogilishetty calls me. He is smart and funny and likeable. He combines what he knows from test results with what he can see with his eyes.\n\nI am struck right away by how serious he sounds. He gets right to it: \"Your bone marrow is beginning to wake up. It is beginning to make cells that we believe will be used to create antibodies to look for your pancreas.\"\n\nHe is explaining something to me but I feel so tired. I am looking for a word that makes sense, something I can grab on to. Then he says it, the only word I don't want to hear: \"This is the start of rejection.\"\n\nMogilishetty says I need to get back to the hospital immediately. \"We should not wait,\" he says. \"We would like to cut off the head of the snake.\"\n\nThis is the news I have been both dreading and expecting. My body is turning against itself.\n\nAt the hospital I learn the medical field's double-word trick. Mogilishetty tells me that I am experiencing \"rejection,\" but that this is not \"rejection-rejection.\"\n\nEven though this is just one \"rejection,\" I will be treated with an aggressive drug therapy. It starts with plasmapheresis, which will remove the plasma portion of my blood where the antibodies are located. After the plasmapheresis, I will receive a drug cocktail of Rituximab and Bortezomib which will combat things on a cellular level. I am told this is a form of chemotherapy, but it is not \"chemotherapy-chemotherapy.\"\n\nI will later realize that it does not matter how many times they say the word, those drugs will make me feel awful. Even awful-awful.\n\n******\n\nIt is unusual to start plasmapheresis at this time of night, so a man needs to be called in. Lying in the bed, waiting, I begin to understand the scope of what is happening. My own body is trying to betray me. Nurses are hovering and Dr. Mogilishetty stays late. I get sent downstairs to get a port inserted into my chest because I need a series of treatments.\n\nJoseph shows up with a machine that looks like it could be used in dialysis and in fact is. He is an older guy, bald-headed and reminds me immediately of Scatman Crothers. He tells me I am in his prayers and the prayers of his entire family. He puts his hand on my foot and says: \"They know about you, and they are praying for you, too.\" I believe him.\n\nThe machine makes a rhythmic noise. I see the blood leave me and then come back. Joseph sits and watches the machine. Laura is there, watching him watch the machine. I am afraid, but I am tired. I fall asleep.\n\nThe next day I am released again. The beginning of a revolving door for me. This anti-rejection treatment calls for four treatments over nine days, and doctors warn that the side effects will accumulate. By Friday I can't eat, read or sleep and Lucy has a violin recital. This is my chance to let her know I can still do dad things. If something is important to her it is still important to me. I got this pancreas transplant so I could be there for her, so I will take her to this recital.\n\nIt's somewhere on the University of Cincinnati campus and I don't know where. Now Lucy is getting nervous about the time, and I park on the wrong side of campus. We run to the building and I am sweating through my coat. We make it, but barely. Her instructor gets her on stage, and I collapse on the chair. I am terrified at how much it takes out of me.\n\n******\n\nAfter my second treatment, I begin to lose faith. The anti-rejection treatment is more powerful than I knew. I am exhausted and cannot sleep, I have diarrhea and cannot eat. I begin to feel less than human. I am surviving, but that's it. I am back home but I can see the way the kids are looking at me. It feels like I am watching the world through a tube, and the tube is getting longer. I never expected to be this sick. It does not make sense to me.\n\nIt is mid-November and I know that if I am going to lose this pancreas, it is probably going to be now. Then, my blood sugar starts to feel high. I am certain the efforts to stop the rejection have failed. At 7:30 that night, my blood sugar is 252. It should not be above 150. Thirty minutes later, I am at 269.\n\nLaura is crying, the kids hear us whispering and I feel like I have failed, that I have let everyone down. All the people who prayed for me wasted their time.\n\n\"I won't do this again,\" I say to Laura.\n\nI need to talk to Dr. Amit Govil. He is in charge of my post-transplant care and he is smart and compassionate. He is a man of faith and science. \"When I am here, I believe in medicine,\" Govil will tell me. \"But I do believe in karma.\"\n\nGovil agrees that a blood sugar level of 269 is far too high, but he tells me I am looking at just one indicator of a pancreas' health, and he is looking at many. These feel like empty words to me. I go to bed, exhausted and defeated.\n\nI wake at 3:42 in the morning. The house is silent and asleep. I slip out of bed, walk downstairs and sit at the dining room table. I have a blood-test strip in my hand. One drop of my blood will tell me everything. But I do not want to use it. I already know the pancreas has failed.\n\nI sit at the table thinking what words I can say to Laura to express my gratitude and how sorry I am. What will we tell the kids? They have been through so much. How do I explain this to all of our friends, all the people who prayed for me?\n\nThen I start composing a letter in my head to the unknown family of the person who had donated the pancreas. I have taken this gift and ruined it. I have failed them. I do not know the words to tell them that I appreciate their gift and that I have screwed it up. How do I write a letter to this family to say thank you and I'm sorry at once? Will it be like another death for them?\n\nIf my blood sugar is high, the pancreas has failed and I am diabetic again. I feel like I am the only person awake in the world.\n\nWhy have I done this? I had been healthy, or healthy enough, and now I am up in the middle of the night composing a letter in my head.\n\nI take the test.\n\nMy blood sugar is 103. The pancreas is working. I sit at the table and cry. I am embarrassed. And relieved. I climb back into bed and tell Laura I am fine.\n\n******\n\nI still can't eat. Laura keeps asking me what I want, she says she can make anything in the world. But I cannot get myself to eat. A friend who knows I am sick and not eating brings me brownies laced with marijuana. I hope the pot will stop my nausea and spur my appetite.\n\nAn hour later I learn that pot is much stronger than it was 20 plus years ago. I do not get high, I get very high. I do want to eat, but I am not capable of making food. I go to the kitchen and become a sitcom. I am hungry and giggling and cannot figure out how to make food. I eat chips because I can open a bag. I text Laura and ask her to come home. I tell her I ate too much brownie.\n\nI decide pot is not for me. I am always tired and always cold. Each day I get up, put on a hat and scarf, a T-shirt, long-sleeved shirt, and a sweater, long underwear and pants, and go downstairs and sit on the big orange chair in the family room. I will stay there until I go back upstairs for a nap. I have lost 20 pounds in 20 days. I am coughing worse than ever. It is a hacking cough that begins to hurt my back. The next day I break.\n\nOn Friday, Nov. 22, after my blood draw, I put my coat over my head under the fluorescent light and fall asleep in the exam room. Jane Revollo, the transplant pharmacist, wakes me, and I start coughing and cannot stop. Then I cannot catch my breath. Finally the room is quiet, I hear the white paper crinkling underneath me. I am not in control of anything. I start to cry. I do not feel like much of a man. I say: \"You have got to help me.\"\n\nRevollo knows me by this point. She looks at me, writes something down and says she will help me. A string of doctors and nurses comes in and asks me questions. They order an X-ray for my lungs. I have pneumonia.\n\nFor the first time I begin to think I might actually die. Not suddenly and dramatically, but just kind of become a sick guy who eventually catches something and fades away. It doesn't feel scary to me, just kind of pathetic.\n\n******\n\nThat weekend, the kids start very getting nervous around me which makes me feel awful. They don't want to make noise in the house. They are checking to see how much I am eating and drinking. I mix my food up on the plate like I'm avoiding eating my vegetables; I fool nobody. Each time I cough, the kids look at me anxiously. Laura is becoming a caretaker. I had this transplant so they would never have to see this. I am a fool.\n\nOur friend Megan comes to visit. She takes me to a doctor's appointment, sits with me, holding my hand while I close my eyes and fall asleep. She is quiet for perhaps the first time in her life. I am sicker than she expected.\n\nOn Monday Nov. 25, three days before Thanksgiving, I wait again for my blood tests. Mogilishetty walks into the room and pauses. He gives me a hard look and says: \"We need to readmit you. You look awful.\"\n\nI am back in the hospital, and I am not sure what I will be thankful for. The new pancreas, certainly, but it feels like I am getting sicker, not better. Turns out I have pneumonia and it is in both lungs, and it is bad. The doctors bombard me with antibiotics for two days and on Wednesday allow me to go home.\n\nMy family was coming in for Thanksgiving because we were going to have so much to be thankful for. I ask them not to come, which feels like a defeat. Every year I cook the turkey at our house and make a big production out of it. I look for the latest methods, I consider brining and dry-salting, going with super-high temperatures or going low and slow. This year I just kind of stick it in the oven. When it is done, I ask Henry to carve. He is gracious and grabs the knife, but this feels sad to me. I should be able to cut a turkey, but my hands shake from the drugs and I am just so tired. I cannot do it.\n\nDuring grace, we say a prayer for the person who gave me her pancreas. That night I start getting an odd pain in my lower abdomen.\n\nThe next 10 days are more of the same. My weight is now into the low 150s and I remain cold from morning till night. Laura buys me a heating pad to sleep with, which means I am now officially elderly. On Dec. 6, a Friday, I have another appointment. When I am finished I walk through the basement at the UC Medical Center.\n\nBy now I know each of the 226 steps to the lobby. But this day I cannot make it. I see a bench across from a vending machine. It is only 72 steps to that bench, and I have to concentrate to get there. Now I am sitting, and I am despondent. I am more than a month out of surgery, and I feel worse than I ever have.\n\nDr. Govil happens past the bench and stops. \"Can you not walk from here to there?\" Govil says, pointing to the lobby. \"Today I cannot,\" I tell him. He says he will arrange a meeting with all the doctors on Monday. It is time, he says, for me to get better. He says not to worry, but he looks back when he walks away. He looks worried.\n\n******\n\nTwo days later, at 3 a.m. Sunday, I wake to a stabbing pain. I have not ever felt a pain like it. I am doubled over in bed, and Laura begins to panic. She has never seen me like this. She wants to take me to the emergency room.\n\nI say, let's wait. I have an appointment with all doctors on Monday. This night in bed, when the pain stops, I tell her that sometimes I think about going off my anti-rejection medicine. My body would turn on the new pancreas, the organ would fail and I would go back to being a diabetic. This now feels like control. Laura reminds me that I am not thinking clearly. I remember the person who died and gave me this gift and realize I could never do that.\n\nAt 5, the pain returns. Laura says we are going to the ER. I am admitted and assessed. I am asked to rate my pain level on a scale of one-to-10. Out of pride I have never said anything above a four. This morning I say \"10.\" Doctors put me on Dilaudid which is described as \"hospital heroin.\" After the drugs I relax, and get scans of my abdomen.\n\nA couple of hours later, the ER doctor comes to my bed and says: \"Your pancreas does not look right.\" It is swollen and surrounded by a \"fluid.\" This is called pancreatitis and stranding. That's all he knows. They are going to send me upstairs when a room is available. The words echo in my head: \"Your pancreas does not look right.\"\n\nThis is my fifth stay on the sixth floor. My children are seeing me as weak and old. I tell Laura I am sorry for sitting in a chair all day. I tell her I hate that orange chair. Some person gave me a pancreas and I am blowing it. The kids try to stay quiet in the house and they never squabble anymore because they don't want to bother me. What kind of dad is that?\n\nThe same night, in our home, Lucy has had enough as well. She tells Laura she is afraid and confused. She thinks they are going to take my pancreas back. Laura picks her up and they both cry.\n\nI know my pancreas has failed inside of me. But three days later, the pain goes away and the hospital releases me. Govil says my pancreatitis was likely because of an imbalance caused by a fast arterial flow to the organ and a slow venal flow from it. Perhaps my body finally achieved balance. He smiles.\n\nBut I still cannot eat. For my weigh-ins, I start keeping my coat on, and I wear boots to my appointments because I do not want to see the scale drop below 150. But I know the truth. I am 6 feet 1 inch tall, and my weight is now in the 140s. All I am is sickness. Until the day I wasn't.\n\n******\n\nWhen the change finally happened, I did not even notice it. For a few days in a row, I didn't get better, I just didn't get worse. And then I stayed there until the morning of Dec. 20.\n\nI wake that morning with a feeling I cannot recognize: I sit at the edge of the bed and realize I am hungry. By the middle of the day I don't just want to eat, I want to eat a cheeseburger from Terry's Turf Club. We go that night, and Laura smiles through the whole meal. Terry's makes a delicious burger, and a big one. And I eat the whole thing. With bacon. I feel like an actual human being, and I am eating a cheeseburger.\n\nThe next day is the first of winter and the shortest day of the year, but at 11 in the morning the sun comes out and the temperature begins to rise. I decide when I see the sun that I am going to ride my bike. I love to ride. I am not a serious rider. I don't wear a racing shirt or obscene shorts. I just love the feeling of a hard, 45-minute ride.\n\nI promise Laura that I will just go a mile or two and turn around the moment I feel tired. Theo needs convincing, too. I tell them I need to start doing things to actually get stronger, that waiting around will not do it. Theo gives me the green light and Laura relents.\n\nI bring out my bike and go into the house for my helmet. When I return, our neighbor, Horst, has his bike parked next to mine. He walks out the door, his pants legs already rolled up. I see that his jeans are lined. \"I will come with you,\" he says.\n\nI make an effort to say no. Horst puts on his helmet. We turn out of the driveway. Horst stays behind me. The sun is strong, the wind is brisk and I am propelling myself, dependent on nobody. I go faster than I should.\n\nI make it to Delta Avenue, all of 1.2 miles and my legs are burning, my lungs gasping. Horst says maybe we turn around now.\n\nI turn around and Horst stays behind me, saying nothing. I am not sure if he is protecting me from traffic or just letting me be alone.\n\nI understand now the network of people who have helped me. Not just my family, but my neighbors, and my co-workers, my friends close and far. They have brought food and prayed and dropped by. They have called and emailed and driven our children to school.\n\nAfter the ride, I walk into the kitchen, out of breath and already limping. Theo is glad to see me. Henry smiles at me, and Luke asks if I need Mom. Yes, I say, tell her I am back.\n\n******\n\nOn the morning of Christmas Eve, Laura reminds me that we have a large dollhouse that needs to be built for Lucy. I go up to our room, lock the door and open the box for the Barbie beach house. This dollhouse has four stories and an elevator and a three-car garage and outdoor staircases and a working toilet.\n\nMore than 60 pieces are held together by 119 screws. Teeny tiny little screws.\n\nMy hands still shake from the medicine, and they always will. I need to focus when I pick up a glass to drink, but I am going to do this. Placing the screws on the head of the screwdriver is difficult. Getting them in the holes feels impossible.\n\nI call Henry up to help and he says he is glad to help. He sticks out his hand for the screwdriver and I change my mind. This is something I need to do. I am the dad, I make the presents for Lucy. It takes me half a day and it nearly breaks me, but I do it. I am so proud of myself.\n\n******\n\nChristmas morning feels normal. We wake up early, go through stockings and then down for presents. Lucy loves her dollhouse. We eat a big breakfast and then, late in the morning, the house gets quiet.\n\nI begin to see what I have gained. I had spent so much energy the past 35 years trying to manage my diabetes, and I am not doing that any more. I had a series of bad breaks after surgery, but I have remarkable care. I have a family that loves me. I have made it through, and so has this pancreas. It is working. I felt my body coming back to life.\n\nOn December 30, I get my blood drawn again. Now I am well enough to appreciate all the people who have taken care of me. Three days a week Brian Lewis has been sticking a needle in my arm. When you are sick, when you are getting poked and prodded and going from appointment to appointment, you begin to appreciate people who do their job well. The ones who make you feel human. He is one of them.\n\nLewis is known in the hospital as a good \"stick\" man. He glides that needle in and it doesn't even hurt and he treats me like a human being. Today I can finally appreciate it. I thank him, Lewis smiles and says: \"Nothing to it but to do it.\"\n\nDr. Mogilishetty walks into the exam room for another routine appointment. He stops again at the door and looks at me. Looks at my eyes. He asks me how I feel. I tell him I feel strong. I tell him about the burger and the bike. He says my blood work looks good. He looks at me again and tells me, \"It is time for a change.\"\n\nHe tells me this is no longer about survival, he says now I am in recovery. I can eat what I want, do whatever I feel capable of doing. He tells me to stay away from sick people, to gain weight and to get stronger. I ask if I am still restricted about what I could pick up. \"Pick up what you want,\" Mogilishetty says.\n\nThat day, for the first time since I left for the hospital I pick up Lucy. It feels like I had never done it before. It feels like I did it yesterday. Later I find Theo. He still lets me pick him up sometimes. Just before, he says: \"Are you sure?\" I am sure.\n\n******\n\nOne month later, The Enquirer arranges a photograph of me and all the people who helped to take care of me at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Dr. Diwan and Dr. Mogilishetty are here. Dr. Govil and Dr. Cuffey. Crazy Kathy, Sweet Jane, Brian Lewis, the woman who called me to tell me I got a pancreas. People whose names I never even knew. People who took care of me when I was so sick I could not remember how well they treated me, but I know they did. I take Lucy with me because I want her to know them. All of them.\n\nI am going to stand in front of them and show them that I am healthy. They are going to see what they have done with their medicine and their compassion. I am going to tell them how they changed me and made me better. That I believe in my future and that I am not afraid anymore.\n\nI am going to thank them and I am not going to cry, because I am strong. I want them to be proud of me. And then, before I can say a word, I start to cry.\n\nI tried again and I stopped. They all looked at me. Dr. Diwan says I cannot blame this on the medicine any more. I try again. I want them to know that they have changed everything for me. But I cannot do it.\n\nI turn, instead, and introduce them to Lucy.\n\nHow to donate\n\nIf you would like to become a donor, or to learn more about organ donations, people in Ohio or Kentucky can go to the following websites:\n\nwww.donatelifeky.org | www.donatelifeohio.org\n\nFor Arizona residents:\n\nSign up online at www.DonateLifeAZ.org, call 1-800-94-DONOR, or check the box to become a donor when applying for a driver's license or state ID at the Motor Vehicle Division.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/06/16"}]}

Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2016/03/03/restaurants-offer-entrees-side-history/81260896/", "title": "Restaurants offer entrees with a side of history", "text": "Patricia Talorico\n\nThe News Journal\n\nSeveral Delaware restaurateurs have rescued, repurposed and restored old buildings in recent years for charming eateries that retain their architectural history, character and sense of place.\n\nNot only is there a story to tell in these significant structures – important to history buffs – there’s also a good meal to be found. It’s like getting a side of education along with the entree.\n\nBut that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be time-traveling.\n\nWhile many historic elements of the buildings have been carefully preserved, blending the old with the new means the amenities are modern. And forget about raising a tankard and forking through “ye olde” cuisine.\n\nThe menus at the majority of these dining spots tend to be contemporary. Though some, such as Jessop’s Tavern, located in a 342-year-old building in Historic New Castle, do strive to maintain authenticity. Colonial fare at the 114 Delaware St. restaurant includes shepherd’s pie as well as Dutch pot roast.\n\nChef Patrick D’Amico, whose RM Hospitality Group opened Middletown’s Metro Pub & Grill in December, is currently renovating the town’s former Delaware Trust building on West Main Street. D’Amico and his partners plan to maintain the architectural integrity of the 1918 building including its arched windows, brick walls and columns. A former bank vault will become a wine cellar and tasting room. The original upscale, fine-dining concept has changed to Italian since D’Amico announced the project last year. He is hoping to open the eatery this summer.\n\nNew Delaware restaurants coming soon\n\nCantwell’s Tavern in Odessa, The Inn at Duck Creek in Smyrna and Lewes’s new Heirloom are some of the most recent restaurants to open in renovated historic buildings.\n\nHere’s more about these new, or newish, restaurants – one in each of Delaware’s three counties – where you can get supper, sip a libation and soak up local history.\n\nNew Castle County\n\nCantwell’s Tavern\n\n109 Main St., Odessa; (302) 376-0600. Visit www.cantwells-tavern.com/\n\nHistory lesson:\n\nSleepy Odessa, once known as Cantwell’s Bridge, is the town that time forgot. Tucked away at the crossroads of U.S. 13 and Del. 299, it can be easy to miss while zooming along the much more well-traveled Del. 1. The Historic Odessa Foundation, looking to lure more tourism dollars to this historic gem, knew it needed a destination restaurant. Plans were made in 2010 to renovate the stately Cantwell’s Bridge Hotel, later known as the Brick Hotel. The 1822 Federal building, which began operating when James Monroe was president, housed travelers for about 100 years. The space was leased about four years ago to restaurateur Robert Ashby, who has experience with beloved historic buildings. In 2002, Ashby renovated the Deer Park Tavern, a Newark landmark since 1851.\n\nGet cozy:\n\nModeled on an early 19th-century style tavern, Cantwell’s Tavern, which opened in late 2011, offers regional fare. One of our favorite dishes at lunch was baked oysters ($11.99), five juicy oysters topped with hot, gooey mozzarella, fresh jalapeños and tangy onion baked jam. You can grab a table near one of the six gas fireplaces, the most requested area, or belly up to the bar in the tavern for craft beers, cocktails and hearty dishes like crabcake sandwiches ($13.99), rib eye cheesesteaks ($13.99) and Caesar salad with salmon ($18.99). Look down: All flooring on the first floor is original. Look around: Walls on the first and second floor are adorned with photos, paintings and newspaper clippings celebrating Odessa’s history. The historical documents are especially interesting such as one listing rates for innkeepers in New Castle County that includes the cost of everything from gin and brandy to “inferior wines” and ale to oats, corn and hay.\n\nGo exploring:\n\nDu Pont family member/preservationist H. Rodney Sharp and his descendants restored multiple properties in Odessa and the town offers some of the best examples of Colonial homes in the state. Sharp, who married Isabella Mathieu du Pont, the sister of the modern DuPont Co. founder Pierre S. du Pont, once taught school in Odessa. He roomed at the Brick Hotel and later purchased it.\n\nTake a tour of the Historic Homes of Odessa, which includes the Collins-Sharp House, built about 1700. It is one of Delaware’s oldest structures. The Georgian-style Corbit-Sharp House, dating back to 1774, was built by William Corbit, who owned a tannery on the Appoquinimink Creek. The house remained in the Corbit family until 1938, when it was acquired by Sharp. The Sharps also owned Gibraltar, a Wilmington estate at 2505 Pennsylvania Ave., well-known for its gardens designed by pioneering landscaper Marian Cruger Coffin.\n\nThe Historic Houses of Odessa are open March through December from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays, and 1 to 4:30 p.m. on Sundays. Monday visits are by reservation only. Cost is $10 for adults; $8 for seniors and students: and free for children younger than 6. The visitors center is in the old bank, circa 1855, next to Cantwell’s Tavern. Visit www.historicodessa.org.\n\nKent County\n\nInn at Duck Creek\n\n2 N. Main St., Smyrna; (302) 389-6700. Visit www.theinnatduckcreek.com\n\nHistory lesson:\n\nThe quaint town of Smyrna on the southern bank of Duck Creek, the dividing line between New Castle and Kent counties, was once a thriving community of merchant vessels and shipbuilding. Two major thoroughfares in town formed what was known as Duck Creek Crossroads and later called the Four Corners. Smyrna’s historical district off U.S. 13 has been bypassed by travelers mostly since Del. 1 opened in stages from 1991 to 2003. The Inn at Duck Creek is made up of three adjoining 18th-century buildings at Four Corners, or East Commerce and North Main streets. It was rehabbed by owner Edward H. Ide. In late December, business partners Howard Johnson and Donna Ignasz and investor Robin Burris opened the 100-seat eatery that includes farm-to-table dining and a casual tavern.\n\nGet cozy:\n\nThe restaurant has five gas fireplaces in its six dining rooms, which are named for town residents. A tavern was created in what had once been Vance Cole’s barber shop for nearly 50 years. The buildings have housed an antique shop, a beauty shop and served as apartments. The restaurant’s bottom floor showcases the Governor’s Room. Check out the portrait over the fireplace of Smyrna resident William Temple who, at age 32 in 1846, became the youngest governor to serve the state. Ignasz says visitors love to take a walking tour through the building, especially those who had been Cole’s customers or who had previously lived in the building. “We had people who lived here from 1966 to 1972 and they wanted to book their anniversary dinner in their [former] bedroom.”\n\nThe farm-to-table menu from chef Christopher Rauber, formerly of Bouley in New York and the Gladstone (N.J.) Tavern, includes burgers with house-cut fries ($12) at lunch or a half sandwich ($10) with a choice of side salad or cup of soup. At dinner, there’s seared duck breast, confit medallions, butternut squash, pinot noir cranberries and duck jus ($26) along with cedar smoked salmon with horseradish crème fraîche, roasted potato, roasted root vegetables ($24).\n\nBrews at Blue Earl�s a cure for cabin fever\n\nGo exploring:\n\nThere about 500 historic buildings in Smyrna, a mix from the Colonial and Victorian eras, and the town has retained much of its character. Check out the Smyrna Museum at 11 S. Main St. The Painted Stave on West Commerce Street is the state’s first standalone distillery. It’s housed in the former Smyrna Theater, which opened in 1947. Blue Earl Brewing, the state’s seventh brewery, has been serving beers in the Smyrna Business Park since last spring. Odd Fellows Café, a small Main Street eatery, is located in a 19th century building. The Drunk’n Baker is a family-owned bakery across from the Inn at Duck Creek. The 145-year-old Smyrna Opera House, closed down after a 1948 fire, re-opened in 2003 as a performing arts center.\n\nSussex County\n\nHeirloom\n\n212 Savannah Road, Lewes; (302) 313-4065. Visit www.heirloomdelaware.com\n\nHistory lesson:\n\nThe rich history of Lewes dates back to 1631, when this first European colony in Delaware was established by Dutch whalers who called it Zwaanendael. The Savannah Road mansion that now houses Heirloom restaurant came 268 years later. The Victorian structure on one of the town’s main thoroughfares was built in 1899, two years before the assassination of President William McKinley. It was once the home of dentist J.B. Robinson. (The restaurant’s bar area was his office.) It had been a residential home since the 1940s when owner Meghan Lee purchased the property. Heirloom opened in late December.\n\nDogfish's Calagione, chef Cameron up for 'Oscars of food'\n\nGet cozy:\n\nThere’s no sign out front for now, though the Heirloom name is etched on the front door of the 70-seat eatery next to the Ocean Retreat Day Spa and Hair Studio, the big, purple rambling Victorian house. Lee has renovated Robinson’s former home and introduced a warm, stylish, feminine decor that’s not over-the-top girly. “It’s a look I love,” says Lee, who prefers to keep the design simple to let the beauty of the historic home shine. Soft votive candles, mismatched china and flowers grace the wooden tables made by youths in Wilmington’s Challenge Program, a vocational training program. Floors, fireplace and trim are all original. Lee, a Chester County, Pennsylvania, native, worked with Aimee Olexy at Talula’s Garden in Philadelphia, and the restaurateurs have similar tastes. Heirloom, open daily at 5 p.m., has some touches reminiscent of Olexy such as a top-notch selection of cheeses and a 12-seat farm table surrounded by cheery cherry red chairs. The bold and ambitious menu from executive chef Jordan Miller, who has worked at kitchens in Baltimore, right now includes sweetbreads, bone marrow, steak tartare and more. It changes with the season. Start with bottled water flavored with fresh mint leaves, and warm slices of sourdough bread studded with caraway, fennel, sesame and pepita seeds. Slather on homemade butter made with heavy cream from the Lewes Dairy. We noshed on housemade mozzarella with arugula and persimmons ($11), excellent charred octopus and fried potatoes ($16), flavored with, of all things, butterscotch (it works!), and buttery rich foie gras ($20) paired with maple-brandy poached pears and apples. Chocolate pot de creme ($11) with dulce de leche and salted peanuts is a decadent way to end the meal, but save room for the complimentary homemade marshmallows.\n\nGo exploring:\n\nThere’s much to see in Lewes when it comes to historical and architectural interest. Start at The Lewes Historical Society’s campus between Second and Third streets at Shipcarpenter Street. The shingled Ryves Holt House at Second and Mulberry streets, built about 1665, is believed to be the oldest house in the state. Take a stroll through St. Peter’s Episcopal Churchyard at 211 Mulberry St., where four Delaware governors are buried. It’s also the final resting place for Margaret Huling, born in 1631. A much more recent addition is the Crooked Hammock Brewery, where we stopped in for a beer. The funky new spot features reclaimed items like bar stools made from tractor seats. A beer at the 16989 Kings Highway restaurant is named for Richard Mootz. The World War II veteran and Sussex County resident was an inspiration for one of the “Monuments Men,” a group that worked during the war to recover Europe’s stolen art and cultural items.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 orptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter@pattytalorico Read her blog atwww.delawareonline.com/blog/secondhelpings\n\nSome other historical eateries:\n\nThe Brick Hotel on The Circle in Georgetown.

John Riley takes his health seriously.\n\nDiagnosed with cancer in 2014, the military veteran and pastor with Smyrna First Presbyterian Church is vigilant about check-ups and his overall well-being, but hasn't seen a primary care doctor in the last year.\n\nThat hasn't been by choice; his doctor's office has had issues hiring another physician after his left. Though he enjoys working with the nurse practitioner, he said, he would like to see a doctor.\n\n\"It's more than just an interview problem,\" Riley said.\n\nRiley's issues are not unique.\n\nDelaware is plagued with numerous health care issues. There are shortages of psychiatrists and dentists, and the general health of the state's population is less than stellar, ranking 32nd in the nation, according to the United Health Foundation. But one of the most urgent problems, experts say, is the cost to the state for providing care.\n\nTotal health care costs amount to $8 billion each year, about 25 percent more than the national average. Care associated with diabetes accounts for $1.1 billion alone.\n\nDoctors, hospital officials, insurance companies, patient advocates and policy analysts are now working to change Delaware's costly and very sickly path.\n\nBolstered by a $34 million federal grant, stakeholders from a public-private partnership called the Delaware Center for Health Innovation have put together a health care transformation plan and are in the process of rolling it out over five years. So far, $8.287 million has been spent on research, an IT plan and new recommendations for primary care doctors.\n\nDelaware was one of 28 states to receive such grant money, which was allocated from appropriations authorized by the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The center coordinates the work of five committees made up of community leaders, insurers, doctors and patients to evaluate all facets of Delaware's health care sector.\n\nPart of the effort includes revamping how physicians get paid for diagnosing and treating patients, increasing behavioral health resources, recruiting more medical professionals and creating 10 \"healthy neighborhoods\" to support health outreach already being done in the community.\n\nThere will be public meetings in all three counties through October to discuss the initiatives.\n\n\"We want to make sure we are engaging the public,\" said Matt Swanson, chairman of the Delaware Center for Health Innovation, at the first meeting held at the Cheer Community Center in Georgetown on Tuesday.\n\nA case for change\n\nIn white papers posted on the Delaware Center for Health Innovation website, preliminary estimates show the state could save more than $700 million annually by financing health information technology, new payment models and resources that support doctors. But a $350 million investment will be needed over 10 years before savings come through.\n\n\"You are going to see over the next year or two the results as the design work is translated into action,\" said Wayne Smith, president of the Delaware Healthcare Association, which represents the state's hospitals. \"We have high hopes for care management for population health, for physician integration and payment reform.\"\n\nSmith, however, warned that since there is so much change occurring at one, there is the possibility of unintended consequences, especially around payment reform.\n\nSTORY: Data sharing tech cuts cost, bolster innovation\n\nSTORY: Delaware insurers request Obamacare rate hikes\n\n\"I think a big issue that still needs to be resolved is access to patient data. We have an environment where we are being asked to take on more risk for outcomes. In order to properly assess risk, we need better access to patient data,\" he said.\n\nHealth care claims data in Delaware is considered private, and only insurers have access to the sensitive information. But legislation working its way through the General Assembly would create an all-payer claims database based on every insurance claim made for healthcare. Though insurance companies have concerns about the bill, it passed the state Senate unanimously on Thursday. The database would give providers a general picture of the population, said Tom Brown, senior vice president of Nanticoke Health Services and one of the leaders of the new payment models.\n\nProviders would then know the difference in cost of services and what ZIP codes have a prevalence of a certain illness or procedure, such as knee replacements. Then they could to budget and negotiate with insurance companies to financially support a specific population's care.\n\n\"In order to arrive at a negotiated price, we really need to know what the experience has been,\" Smith said.\n\nThe state also has piloted a physician scorecard which includes benchmarks a physician should discuss with a patient, such as HPV vaccinations, high blood pressure medication adherence and screening and screening follow-ups for clinical depression.\n\nIdeally, insurance companies would base reimbursements on how well doctors and their patients are following the guidelines.\n\n“We strongly believe we need to change the payment model to place more emphasis and reward on quality outcomes,” said Tim Constantine, president of Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware. He added that he does not anticipate the changes to result in monthly premium increases to consumers. In fact, it may do the opposite, by helping reduce duplicative testing with incentives for physicians to keep patients healthier.\n\nA new program, debuting in all Highmark plans in January, for example, will provide financial incentives for physicians to hire additional staff, implement electronic medical records and have practices stay open later if they hit similar quality measures.\n\nTo comply with scorecard benchmarks, Dr. Harry Anthony, a primary care doctor and medical director of the Nanticoke Physician Network, said Nanticoke Memorial Hospital's seven primary care practices have each hired a care coordinator. The coordinators work with higher-risk patients, with chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. They make sure patients come to appointments, run educational programs, negotiate prescription costs and coordinate transportation when necessary.\n\nSo far it has worked. Anthony said recent hospital quarterly data showed the number of high-risk patients seen regularly by the office reduced by 20 to 30 percent.\n\nPatients are healthier under the model, but not without some cost. The offices did need to spend $30,000 to hire each care coordinator, he said, and not every office is going to be able to lay out the financial capital.\n\n\"That is going to be much harder for small practices to do that,\" he said. \"I think in today's day and age, it's getting more difficult to survive as a solo, small practice.\"\n\nFor the last two years, the state has been working to retrain Delaware's current health workforce on how to best coordinate a person's care, said Kathy Janvier, vice president and campus director at Delaware Technical Community College's Stanton/George Campus and chair of the center's workforce committee.\n\n\"This is a plan to change healthcare that involves much more than what happens in the provider's office,\" she said.\n\nEducating the workforce is only one step; educating the community on care coordination is another.\n\nLeaders from the Delaware Center for Health Innovation plan to meet with local groups from the first three designated \"healthy neighborhoods\" to help brainstorm ways to improve the overall health of the community, tackling topics such as maternal and child health, mental health and addiction and chronic disease prevention and management.\n\nThe first three neighborhoods encompass the Wilmington/Claymont area, Smyrna/Dover area and western Sussex County. Often communities face barriers beyond not having adequate health insurance. Lack of food, stable housing and employment are major issues.\n\nRiley runs a weekly food pantry program in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture out of Smyrna First Presbyterian Church and regularly interacts with people grappling with drug addiction and diabetes.\n\n\"We try to give them food in order to maintain life itself,\" he said. \"If they have any other needs we make them aware of any other federal programs. We do what we can. Of course it's just one stop along the way of many to restore people to full health.\"\n\nOn a recent Wednesday, donated apples, cheese, raisins and bread covered the cafeteria of Smyrna First Presbyterian Church. Linda, of Smyrna, who declined to give her last name because she was concerned about her job, practically danced her way inside, handing her three granddaughters and a friend, bags upon bags of food.\n\nIt's time to make some apple pie, she said.\n\nLinda can't imagine her life without the food pantry. Since she and her husband took in her daughter and granddaughters three years ago, her house became full quick, and she is the only one currently working.\n\nMaking sure the girls are healthy, fed and clothed is a priority, even if it means shelling out $500 for new clothes so they won't get made fun of at school and visiting a food pantry weekly.\n\n\"I went out in my car and cried,\" Linda said of the first time she picked up donated food. \"This helps me so much.\"\n\nSTORY: Bayhealth breaks ground on new Milford health campus\n\nSTORY: Hepatitis C - Delaware's hidden epidemic\n\nNew resources\n\nDelaware is short of seven primary care providers, four psychiatrists and 31 dentists to meet standard workforce requirements set by the Health Resources and Services Administration.\n\nA subcommittee within the Delaware Center for Health Innovation is looking at how to increase medical educational opportunities and eliminate barriers in licensing and credentialing so Delaware can become an attractive state to practice medicine.\n\nThough the state has relationships with other institutions such as Temple University and Thomas Jefferson University hospitals, the fact that Delaware does not have a medical or dental school poses challenges with health care recruitment.\n\nThe challenges, especially with the recruitment and hiring of hospital-based psychiatrists, are not unique to Delaware, said Sharon Kurfuerst, senior vice president of Health Services Operations for Christiana Care Health System. Such professional shortages happen in waves. Years ago, there were shortages in nurses, now there is a lack of psychiatrists, she said.\n\nEven with less psychiatrists, the state is pushing to integrate behavioral health services into the primary care offices to get people mental health services faster and keep people out of the emergency rooms.\n\nChristiana Care began integrating behavioral health consultants in 2014, Kurfuerst said, and now has specialists in the hospital's 12 primary care offices, heart and vascular offices, cancer care and women's health.\n\nAn initial behavioral health screening is free. Then patients can schedule follow-ups.\n\nSo far, 4,600 patients have had consultants, and the hospital has logged 11,000 individual treatment sessions. Previously staff would see 2,000 patients on average annual for behavioral health needs.\n\nIntegration into neuroscience offices may be next, she said.\n\n\"It also helps reduce the stigma around accessing behavioral health,\" Kurfuerst said.\n\nLewis, 61, was in denial of his anxiety for the longest time. Lewis, who declined to give his full name because he works as a counselor, consistently had gone to the emergency department thinking he had heart or other related health issues, only to find out after tests, that physically nothing was wrong.\n\nAt a primary care visit with Christiana Care he decided to take the next step and see a psychologist. After some self-care tips, he learned how to breathe deeply to calm his body and what triggered his anxiety in the first place.\n\n\"I feel much better about myself,\" he said.\n\nOver the next six months the Delaware Center for Health Innovation will continue to introduce the new health plan to the public through community forums. The plan is fluid and can change with input. The next forum will be held in Dover July 11.\n\nHealth care reform effort in Delaware\n\nThe Delaware Center for Health Innovation was formed in 2014 after the state acquired a $34 million federal grant to help reform how patients receive care and to lower the costs over five years. Delaware's health care costs are 25 percent higher than the national average, something experts say is unsustainable. In the first year Delaware was allotted $12,259, 694 for start-up activities. About $3 million could be carried over into next year if the feds approve.\n\nBetween Feb. 1, 2015 to Jan. 31, 2016 the state spent:\n\n$1,050,000 for population health initiatives\n\n$2,361,029 for clinical upgrades\n\n$1,912,500 for new payment methods and outreach\n\n$1,476,500 for new health tech development\n\n$383,475 for workforce and education research and planning\n\n$372,475 for patient engagement research\n\n$731,000 for overall management resources\n\n$886 for travel\n\nTotal $8,287,865\n\nCarryover $3,971,829\n\nWhere's your doctor?\n\nDelaware's doctors are spread disproportionately across the state's three counties.

He was previously lieutenant governor.\n\nCriminal justice reform has been a prominent topic this year, in the General Assembly and among candidates for public office. It should be.\n\nThere has been hard work and progress over the last several years – including significant drops in both overall prison population and the number of pretrial detainees – but our state’s criminal justice system remains in need of change.\n\nBail reform fights mass incarceration, seeks more fairness to the poor.\n\nAs I near the end of my term as Attorney General, I have a perspective on what the state has accomplished, where it has fallen short, and where the best prospects for reform are going forward.\n\nOne way to measure criminal justice reform is to see if Delaware is putting fewer residents behind bars without jeopardizing public safety. By that measure, Delaware is behind other states, but we have made significant progress over the last few years.\n\nI was a judge. I know our bail system needs reform\n\nIn 2014, the annual count of the Department of Correction facility population was 6,885. Since then it has dropped each year, down to 6,108 in June of this year. That’s a decrease of 11 percent in four years.\n\nThe drop in pre-trial detentions is even more pronounced — falling from 1,537 in 2014 to 1,033 in 2018, a reduction of 33 percent.\n\nSupport juvenile justice reforms\n\nThese numbers are not an accident. While we are not yet where we want to be — Delaware still has a higher per-capita incarceration rate than the majority of other states — these statistics are evidence that progress can be made, and an indicator of where future efforts should be focused.\n\nHow have we improved?\n\nIn 2011, Gov. Jack Markell created the Delaware Justice Reinvestment Task Force, which I chaired. One of the first things we realized was that about 23 percent of Delaware’s prison population were pre-trial detainees who hadn’t yet had their day in court.\n\nWe recommended that the magistrates who set bail needed a more scientific process for who was and was not detained before a trial. We convinced the General Assembly to pass a law requiring state courts to begin using an “objective risk assessment instrument.”\n\nThe assessment only generates and explains a number; magistrates must still apply their judgment to the facts before them.\n\nStill, the assessment has provided magistrates usable information about a person’s risk factors, which has gotten concrete results. And Delaware is currently working to further improve the tool.\n\nSoon after the new assessment was implemented in January 2014, the pre-trial population began to drop, and as mentioned has now fallen 33 percent. Today, pre-trial detainees make up 17 percent of the prison population instead of 23 percent.\n\nAre there still people who are detained when there may be a safe alternative? Probably – no system is perfect. And, under Delaware’s current system, prosecutors rarely know at the outset if someone is unnecessarily detained, since they are usually not present when bail is set.\n\nThat is why our office, the Department of Correction and the Office of Defense Services are currently working on a system to routinely survey the state’s pre-trial population. The goal is to determine if there are any new detainees being held on low bail for low-level offenses whose cases should be immediately reviewed by state prosecutors for possible bail adjustment petitions.\n\nAnother significant change was the 2016 reform of Delaware’s “three strikes and you’re out” habitual offender law.\n\nFor decades, this law resulted in automatic life-without-parole sentences for many three-time felons, including people whose felonies were either drug crimes or property crimes. As a result, Delaware had many inmates serving life without parole sentences.\n\nThe Sentencing Project reported that, in 2016, 11 percent of Delaware’s total prison population was serving life sentences without a chance of parole — triple the national average. We needed a new approach.\n\nIn the past, Delaware Department of Justice had opposed efforts to scale back Delaware’s habitual offender statute, but in 2015 we recognized the need and led an effort to reform it. It was a tough debate, but a reform bill was ultimately passed, led by Sen. Karen Peterson, Rep. JJ Johnson, and senior staff from the Department of Justice and the Governor’s Office.\n\nMinimum mandatory sentences were eliminated altogether for offenders whose third felony was a drug crime. They were scaled back dramatically from mandatory life sentences for those whose third offense was a lower-level felony.\n\nExcept for drug crimes, every third-time felony that had previously resulted in a mandatory sentence would still result in a mandatory sentence. But the sentences were more tailored to the actual crimes, rather than being automatic life sentences.\n\nSince this reform, dozens of inmates serving life sentences as habitual offenders have filed applications to have their sentences reviewed. Some have already been released or transferred to work release programs.\n\nOne other reform made in 2012 was a significant increase in the amount of “good time” inmates can have taken off their sentences if they participate in programs designed to reduce the odds of their re-offending upon release. Previously, inmates could not earn more than 100 days of “good time” per year. Now, inmates can earn up to 160 days of good time per year.\n\nThere are limits on inmates’ ability to earn good time, and those convicted of some crimes are not eligible to earn it at all. But the overall effect of the 2012 amendments is that inmates who have good prison records and participate in programs that will reduce their risk of re-offending now have an opportunity to serve shorter prison sentences.\n\nSome reforms are already on the table\n\nNationwide, much of the energy in criminal justice reform recently has been in eliminating cash bail. Legislation starting that process was introduced in the last Delaware General Assembly, but it did not pass.\n\nI support eliminating cash bail. It is important to me and to other law enforcement officials that people who are significant risks to public safety or flight risks get detained — but those who aren’t should not be kept in jail.\n\nI hope and expect that, under a new attorney general, the Department of Justice will continue to actively participate in efforts to eliminate Delaware’s cash bail system\n\nThere is no guarantee that eliminating cash bail will reduce the number of individuals being detained prior to trial. Some advocates who championed the elimination of cash bail in California were dismayed by the law that was passed, and now believe it will actually increase rather than decrease the state’s pre-trial detainees.\n\nThe concern is without cash bail, magistrates must make up-or-down decisions on detaining individuals who are arrested — whereas with bail, they can set different levels of bail as a condition of release.\n\nWithout cash bail, magistrates could decide to free more people before trial. Or they could decide it is less risky to detain people who previously would have been set free on bail, causing the pre-trial population to rise.\n\nNone of this means we should keep the cash bail system – we should not. But we should not assume eliminating cash bail will significantly decrease Delaware’s pretrial population.\n\nAnother current debate in Delaware concerns minimum mandatory sentences. The politicization of this issue has made it difficult to have a needed, specific discussion.\n\nWe should not eliminate minimum mandatory sentences altogether, as some have advocated. There are some serious crimes – using the most extreme and obvious example, murder – where an automatic prison sentence is completely justified after a conviction.\n\nBut it is fair to rethink whether all the crimes that currently carry minimum mandatory sentences should carry them. It is also worth revisiting the duration of some of our minimum mandatory sentences.\n\nIt is also fair to revisit whether the state should have multiple criminal offenses with minimum mandatory sentences that apply to the same offense.\n\nThese are hard discussions. They need to be had in public, with the participation of legislators, victim advocates, law enforcement, reform advocates, and others who have an interest in our criminal justice system. That type of respectful, inclusive, and candid public debate is what we did in reforming the minimum mandatory sentences associated with the state’s habitual offender law, so it can be done.\n\nWhat reforms should be next\n\nThere are two more areas where we could reduce our prison population without jeopardizing public safety. The first relates to probation violations.\n\nIn 2012, 39 percent of inmates admitted to level 5 prisons were there for violating the terms of their probations for past crimes. About 87 percent of those violations were not due to new crimes, but rather for things like missed appointments, curfew violations or failed drug tests.\n\nI have repeatedly – and unsuccessfully – asked legislators and reform advocates to focus on this issue. Based on the statistics, reforming the probation violation process holds promise, but the reforms are likely to be challenging.\n\nChanges may include foregoing probation in many cases, or funding potentially costly alternatives to sending people back to prison for probation violations. For example, Delaware could create secure treatment facilities for individuals who violate probation by failing drug tests.\n\nThe second area: Our state is underinvesting in three fights that would drive down the crime rate:\n\nPolice will tell you many crimes arise from the opioid epidemic, whether it’s property crimes committed by those seeking to fund addiction or crimes committed by drug dealers. Yet Delaware continues to underfund intensive drug treatment.\n\nIntervening with children in poverty — from infancy all the way through high school — helps them avoid the criminal justice system. Yet Delaware has declined to enhance its interventions like home visitation, pre-school, and after-school and summer programs as the state's economy and tax base have rebounded.\n\nRe-entry programs can help prevent ex-offenders from committing new crimes and ending up back in prison. Yet, with few exceptions, Delaware has invested few if any new dollars in them.\n\nHard decisions to be made\n\nThe future steps in criminal justice reform are clear to some of us who have spent a lot of time looking at how the state can do better. Some are already underway.\n\nBut clear does not mean easy.\n\nThere are hard decisions to be made about whether the state wants to reduce the minimum punishments for some of its most serious crimes — decisions that should be made after a real public debate, with the input of everyone affected including the victims of those crimes.\n\nThere are concrete investments that must be made – in children living in poverty, in alternatives to jail for those who violate probation, in quality re-entry services, in intensive drug addiction treatment. Making those investments will mean asking some Delawareans, at least in the short term, to either pay more or forego other government services.\n\nI hope the state will focus its energies in these areas, so that we can see the real progress of the last four years continue and expand.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/05/31/unauditable-delaware-unemployment-fund-brings-risk-experts-say/73911635007/", "title": "'Unauditable' Delaware unemployment fund brings risk, experts say", "text": "Karl Baker\n\nSpotlight Delaware\n\nThis story was produced by Spotlight Delaware as part of a partnership with Delaware Online/The News Journal.

In late March, a federal watchdog stated that Delaware's Medicaid office had paid monthly premiums to health care companies on behalf of people who had already died.\n\nWeeks before that, Delaware's pension office stated that it needed to drastically change how it pays retired legislators, after learning that a law passed in 1997 governing their pension payouts \"was never codified.\"\n\nReaction to auditor's report\n\nWhen asked for reactions to the auditor's March report, the accounting experts each noted that such faulty recordkeeping could mean that unemployment officials won't know if a Delaware company is failing to pay its share into the state fund.\n\n\"We know what's in the bank, but we don't know what's owed by whom and to whom,\" said IrfanBora, a professor of governmental accounting at Rutgers University.\n\nMichael Granof, an accounting professor at the University of Texas, pointed to a section of the auditor's report that noted that state officials' determination of whether a company is \"doubtful\" to pay into the system is flawed.\n\n\"It means you can't rely on the financials,\" Granof said.\n\nAnd, Justin Marlowe, a professor of public finance at the University of Chicago, said such poor management can leave the unemployment system vulnerable to cyberattacks.\n\nIt could also impact Delaware's credit rating, which determines the cost the state must pay to borrow money, he said.\n\nThough the unemployment fund has a lot of money, credit rating agencies judge governments based on what the industry calls \"internal controls,\" he said.\n\n\"A government can have all the resources in the world, and all of the political leadership and all of the policy priorities completely aligned, but if there’s no effective management to actually execute that plan, then none of that matters,\" said Marlowe, who also serves as director of the Center for Municipal Finance.\n\nStill, Bora noted that the size of Delaware's unemployment fund was substantial, meaning it's likely to keep paying jobless Delawareans in the near term, even if a flood of new claims come amid a future economic downturn.\n\n\"It's not like it's bankrupt,\" Bora said.\n\nThe unemployment office's response\n\nThe head of Delaware's unemployment insurance division acknowledged in early April his office was not able to answer certain questions from outside auditors about \"specific payments\" his office had made — leading to the \"unauditable\" conclusion.\n\n\"We just weren't able to get through that entire process in time before that report was issued,\" said Daryl Scott, director of the Division of Unemployment Insurance at the Delaware Department of Labor.\n\nAsked whether he can verify that Delaware companies are properly paying into the system, Scott said his office has records of what companies owe, based on their self-reporting of unemployment tax.\n\nTraditionally, Scott's office audits \"a certain number\" of those self-reports, but he indicated that those oversight activities have dwindled.\n\n\"The auditing function – that's an area where we had high turnover during the pandemic and we're rebuilding that team as well,\" said Scott, while noting that finding qualified accountants has been challenging.\n\nScott said the origin of much of the problems in his division began during the COVID pandemic response, when the federal government piled a dozen new programs and large pots of money onto his office to manage.\n\nFinally, he stressed that the total amount of money within the unemployment fund is accurately reported. And, it's also substantial, he said, after Gov. John Carney recently injected $240 million from federal COVID-19 relief money into the fund.\n\n\"We have bank records,\" he said.\n\nA spokesman at the Delaware Department of Labor said the unemployment fund currently sits at $344 million, down from $385 million last June.\n\nWhile Scott pointed to COVID as one reason for his office’s faulty finances, Delaware State Auditor Lydia York challenged that premise. In her March report, York said the stresses from the pandemic do “not excuse the failures of management that followed.”\n\nIn a subsequent interview in April, York also questioned whether the record-keeping \"anomalies\" have allowed some Delaware companies to not properly pay into the system.\n\nFinally, York agreed with Scott that his office needs more accountants, even as it is a particularly challenging time to hire them.\n\nBut, she also noted that the federal government has provided Delaware with cash to reform and upgrade the unemployment division’s management of the hundreds of millions of dollars that sit in the fund for jobless Delawareans.\n\n\"I really remain hopeful that we will be able to sort this out with enough time,\" she said.\n\nGet stories like this delivered to your email inbox by signing up for the free newsletter at spotlightdelaware.org/subscribe.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/us/gun-control-laws-2022/index.html", "title": "These are the gun control laws passed in 2022 | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nSeveral high-profile mass shootings and a sustained rise in gun violence across the United States in 2022 have spurred law enforcement officials and lawmakers to push for more gun control measures.\n\nPresident Joe Biden in June signed into law the first major gun safety legislation passed in decades. The measure failed to ban any weapons, but it includes funding for school safety and state crisis intervention programs. Many states – including California, Delaware and New York – have also passed new laws to help curb gun violence, such as regulating untraceable ghost guns and strengthening background check systems.\n\nThe year 2022 is the second-highest year of mass shootings in the United States on record, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit tracking gun violence incidents across the country.\n\nThere have been at least 647 mass shootings through December 31 this year. The country saw 692 mass shootings in 2021, the worst year on record since the Gun Violence Archive began tracking mass shootings in 2014.\n\nThe Gun Violence Archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.\n\nThere is a direct correlation in states with weaker gun laws and higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides, suicides and accidental killings, according to a January study published by Everytown for Gun Safety, a non-profit focused on gun violence prevention.\n\nNot everyone agrees increased gun control is the answer. Some Americans advocate for their right to keep and bear arms, enshrined in the Constitution, while others argue gun control measures save lives and do not infringe citizen rights.\n\nAmid the debate, some lawmakers have forged ahead with passing gun control laws.\n\n“States continue to lead on gun safety, passing new and innovative policies that we will work to replicate across the country while continuing to secure significant investments in community violence intervention programs,” said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, which has been fighting for gun safety measures since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut, which killed 20 children and six educators.\n\n“This progress and our electoral victories in November shows that the gun violence prevention movement is stronger than ever and sets the stage for continued progress in the new year,” Watts continued.\n\nHere is a summary of the state and federal laws approved in 2022:\n\nFederal legislation\n\nOn June 25, Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act after the House and the Senate approved the measure. The package represents the most significant federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994.\n\n“God willing, it’s going to save a lot of lives,” Biden said at the White House as he signed the bill.\n\nThe package includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs, which can be used to manage red flag programs, as well as for other crisis intervention programs such as mental health, drug and veteran courts.\n\nRed flag laws, approved by the federal measure, are also known as Extreme Risk Protection Order laws. They allow courts to temporarily seize firearms from anyone believed to be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nThe legislation encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which would provide a more comprehensive background check for people between 18 and 21 who want to buy guns.\n\nIt also requires more individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income to register as Federally Licensed Firearm Dealers, which are required to administer background checks before they sell a gun to someone.\n\nThe law bars guns from anyone convicted of a domestic violence crime who has a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law, however, allows those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalifornia was ranked the top state in the nation for gun safety in 2021. It has the strongest system in the nation for removing firearms from people who become prohibited from having them, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom in July signed a package of five bills on gun safety after they were passed by the California State Senate.\n\nOn July 1, Newsom signed AB 2571, which prohibits the gun industry from marketing firearm-related products to minors, as well as AB 1621, which further restricts ghost guns, including the parts used to build them.\n\nOn July 12, the governor signed AB 1594, legislation establishing a firearm industry standard of conduct to promote “safe and responsible firearm industry member practices,” the bill states.\n\nAlso included in the package is AB 2156, signed on July 21, which cracks down on the manufacture of firearms by prohibiting any person, regardless of federal licensure, from manufacturing firearms without a state license. It also prohibits unlicensed individuals from using 3D printing to manufacture any firearm or precursor part.\n\nThe last bill, signed on July 22, is SB 1327. It allows private citizens to bring civil action against anyone who manufactures, distributes, transports or imports assault weapons or ghost guns, which are banned in the state.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis signed House Bill 22-1086, or The Vote Without Fear Act, on March 30.\n\nThe law prohibits a person from openly carrying a firearm within any polling location or central count facility.\n\nIt also bans individuals from open carrying within “100 feet of a ballot drop box or any building in which a polling location or central count facility is located,” while election activity is in progress, according to the legislation. Violations are punishable by a maximum $1,000 fine, up to 364 days imprisonment in the county jail, or both.\n\nDelaware\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney on June 30 signed a package of gun safety bills including legislation to prohibit assault weapons, regulate high-capacity magazines and strengthen background checks.\n\nThe Delaware Lethal Firearms Safety Act of 2022 prohibits the manufacture, sale, offer to sell, transfer, purchase, receipt, possession or transport of assault weapons in Delaware, subject to certain exceptions, according to HB 450.\n\nThe package also includes legislation to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase or possess a firearm from 18 to 21, ban the use of devices which convert handguns into fully automatic weapons and hold gun manufacturers and dealers “liable for reckless or negligent actions that lead to gun violence,” the bill states.\n\nIllinois\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed two bills to address secure storage of firearms and regulating ghost guns.\n\nOn May 18, the governor signed HB 4383, which prohibits individuals from selling or possessing ghost guns and ensures all firearms are serialized, allowing law enforcement to better trace them.\n\nPritzker later signed HB4729 on June 10, which requires the Department of Public Health to develop and implement a two-year public awareness campaign focused on safe gun storage, which includes sharing information about safe gun storage, the bill says.\n\nMaryland\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced on April 8 he would allow Senate Bill 387, which bans the sale or possession of ghost guns, to become law without his signature, noting it doesn’t go far enough in taking “decisive action to hold violent criminals accountable.”\n\nThe bill, which took effect on June 1 after bipartisan support, expands the definition of “firearm” to include an unfinished frame or receiver. It requires the Secretary of State Police to maintain a system to register firearms imprinted with serial numbers and “prohibits a person from purchasing, receiving, selling, offering to sell, or transferring an ‘unfinished frame or receiver’ or a firearm unless imprinted with specified information,” the bill states.\n\nThe law also requires the governor to allocate $150,000 in the annual state budget to fund registration proceedings.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on July 5 signed seven gun safety bills, six of which were part of his Gun Safety 3.0 package he introduced to the state legislature in April 2021.\n\nThe package includes legislation which would allow the state’s attorney general to sue members of the firearm industry for violations stemming from the sale or marketing of firearms, the bill states.\n\nAlso included in the package is legislation to regulate the sale of handgun ammunition, developing a system of electronic reporting of these sales; and require training prior to the issuance of a gun purchaser identification card with a validity date of 10 years.\n\nAnother bill in the package mandates firearm owners who become state residents to obtain a Firearm Purchaser Identification Card and register out-of-state acquired handguns, according to the bill.\n\nOn December 22, Murphy signed another gun safety bill strengthening the state’s firearm licensing laws and established a list of ‘sensitive places’ where concealed carry is prohibited, including playgrounds, bars and restaurants serving alcohol, train stations, and polling places.\n\nNew York\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul signed a package of bills and an additional piece of legislation to address a wide range of gun safety issues.\n\nHochul signed a gun safety package on June 6, which includes bills requiring microstamping on handguns, strengthen the state’s extreme risk and firearm purchase permit law, raise the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21 and enhance information sharing between state, local and federal agencies when guns are used in crimes.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court decision on June 23 to strike down a New York gun law enacted more than a century ago which places restrictions on carrying a concealed handgun outside the home, Hochul signed legislation to strengthen the state’s gun laws and bolster restrictions on concealed carry weapons.\n\nThe law, which takes effect on September 1, will expand eligibility requirements in the concealed carry permitting process, restrict the carrying of concealed weapons in sensitive locations and establish state oversight over background checks for guns and regular checks on license holders for criminal convictions, according to the legislation.\n\nOregon\n\nIn the November 2022 US midterm elections, Oregon voters enacted a gun safety ballot measure, Measure 114, which strengthens background checks and prohibits the sale and transfer of ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds.\n\nThe measure also closes the “Charleston Loophole,” which allows gun purchases to move forward by default after three days even if a background check has not been completed. It requires state police to complete background checks on individuals before a gun sale or transfer is made.\n\nRhode Island\n\nRhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee signed three gun safety bills on June 21. They prohibit high-capacity magazines, ban the open carry of rifles and shotguns in public and raise the legal age to purchase firearms or ammunition from 18 to 21, with exceptions for law enforcement officers.\n\nOne of the bills also changes the definition of “rifle” and “shotgun” consistent with federal law.\n\nVermont\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott signed into law a package on March 25 banning firearms from hospital buildings and prohibits the transfer of firearms between unlicensed people.\n\nThe governor vetoed a similar bill, S.30, in February which would have closed the “Charleston Loophole.”\n\nThe new law, S.4, addresses the policy by extending the time period to seven days for the federal government to complete a background check before an individual can purchase a firearm. It also strengthens protections for victims of domestic violence, according to the bill.\n\nWashington\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee signed three gun safety bills into law on March 23.\n\nHB 1705 prohibits the manufacture, sale, purchase or possession of ghost guns, while HB 1630 prohibits the open carry of firearms at local government meetings and restricts them at school board meetings and election-related locations.\n\nThe third bill, SB 5078, prohibits high-capacity magazines, defined as an “ammunition feeding device with the capacity to accept more than 17 rounds of ammunition,” the bill states.", "authors": ["Emma Tucker"], "publish_date": "2022/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2018/05/23/lawsuit-would-change-way-delaware-schools-funded/590963002/", "title": "Lawsuit: Delaware schools are leaving children in poverty behind", "text": "There is no doubt in Jessica Antwi's mind that Delaware's education system is unfair.\n\nHer son, 10-year-old Tylan Raburnel, was held back a year and is in fourth grade at Stubbs Elementary School in Wilmington, where 86 percent of students come from low-income families and more than 85 percent are black.\n\nTylan's backpack comes home empty every night and he doesn't have the tools to study at home and improve, Antwi said.\n\nShe feels like he isn't learning enough during the school day to do well. Unlike some other parents, Antwi can't afford to hire a tutor.\n\nTylan often comes home with stories about classmates who have been suspended. He's had issues with no father at home.\n\nAbout 44 percent of the school's students were suspended last year, according to the state.\n\nClearly, Christina School District doesn't have enough resources to support students struggling with mental or behavioral problems, Antwi said. She thinks the school does the best with what it has, but there just isn't enough money.\n\nJeffers Brown, her son's principal, pointed to several workshops that teach staff how to cope with students' emotional and behavioral issues.\n\nEven so, \"I feel like the children are very aggressive,\" Antwi said. \"I feel like the teachers are kind of scared of the students. There's a level of fear.\"\n\nGiving students and teachers in so-called high-needs schools the support they need takes money, and a lawsuit filed by two civil rights groups — Delawareans for Educational Opportunity and the Delaware NAACP — demands the state change how it funds education. It claims the system provides more support for children who are well off than it provides for children living in poverty.\n\nThey are working with the Community Legal Aid Society and the American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware, which says the state's education system is not providing an adequate education to all students.\n\nThe lawsuit, similar to ones filed in 45 states, seeks to have more money given to schools with large numbers of low-income students, special education students and English language learners.\n\nThat funding would allow school districts like Christina to invest in tools that could help those students succeed, as districts in New Jersey now do. And it could keep experienced teachers from fleeing jobs in those schools that can be overwhelmingly stressful.\n\nACLU-DE legal director Ryan Tack-Hooper said despite the best efforts of teachers, families and school staff, the current education system fails too many Delaware children.\n\nEven if the lawsuit is not successful, similar cases in other states have had a significant impact and raised public awareness of the issues.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, funding inequities harm students from low-income families, students with disabilities and students who are learning English. Schools struggle to hire specialists who can help them, and test scores for disadvantaged students are far below state standards set by the Delaware Department of Education in its new Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, plan.\n\nAt Stubbs, for example, less than 5 percent of fourth-graders were at grade level in math last year and only about 6 percent were proficient in English language arts.\n\nAntwi said often students' home lives are blamed for poor performance at school.\n\n\"There’s this perception that these kids come from a poor community and that their parents don’t care,\" she said, making it clear that she would do anything possible to help her son succeed. \"But where you live doesn't define who you are.\"\n\nShe also wishes her son got more homework, so she could help him study at night, but the school is moving away from that.\n\n\"Homework is viewed as an end-all be-all by most of our parents,\" her son's principal said. \"Our kids have been working diligently on the two new curriculums we implemented this year during school hours. They are very scripted and may not call for homework assignments. Only the lower grades receive homework packets every week.\"\n\nTylan has been attending Stubbs for about three months and previously attended Carrcroft Elementary School in Brandywine Hundred.\n\nPavia Fielder, who recently retired from a 16-year stint as a teacher at Warner Elementary School in the Red Clay School District, and now substitute teaches in New Castle County, said the problems aren't isolated to one school or one school district.\n\nShe sees a sharp contrast between schools that serve large amounts of low-income students and those that don't. Often, the inequities exist not between school districts, but within school districts, she said, between schools in the city or low-income neighborhoods and in the wealthier suburbs.\n\n“I see it in all of the districts. I see it everywhere,\" she said. “Some schools have what they need, but these (low-income) schools never get what they really need. When is that going to happen?\"\n\n'Not perfect, not unconstitutional'\n\nIn a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, lawyers for Carney and the state Education Department argue that Delaware's Constitution doesn't guarantee students a fair or \"adequate\" education system. It only promises a \"general and efficient\" one that achieves maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense.\n\n\"Delaware’s education system is not perfect, but it is not unconstitutional,\" the motion to dismiss says.\n\nIn a reply brief filed this week, ACLU and Community Legal Aid lawyers argue the framers of Delaware's Constitution sought to prepare children to engage in democracy and be productive citizens.\n\nDelaware is failing to do that, the brief says.\n\n\"This failure is the result of policies and practices that deprive public schools of the resources and organizational structure needed for all children to receive necessary services and support,\" it says.\n\nThe Education Department had no comment on the case. Gov. John Carney's office pointed to new investments outlined in his proposed 2018 budget and said they will give students more support.\n\nThey include $16.5 million to help improve education in the five struggling Christina School District schools in Wilmington and $6 million for the Opportunity Grants program that assists schools serving high poverty and non-English speaking students — a three-fold increase over the current allocation.\n\nCarney believes that all Delaware children deserve a quality education, said Jon Starkey, a spokesman for the governor. \"He is committed to investing in Delaware's schools, and providing additional support and resources for schools serving low-income children, English learners and students with special needs.\"\n\nCritics say the new investments proposed by Carney won't have a significant, lasting impact.\n\nMany schools in Delaware do not have the money to pay for smaller class sizes, expanded school time, highly qualified specially trained teachers, technology, effective family engagement and partnerships with health, family welfare and specialized education service providers.\n\nMike Griffith, a senior school finance analyst for the Education Commission of the States, said Delaware's education funding system only exists in six other states: Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Mississippi, Tennessee and Virginia.\n\nIt's top-down, and many states have moved away from that model, he said. The state basically determines how many teachers, principals, nurses, etc. a school qualifies for and sets aside money to fill those positions. Districts can \"cash in\" some of those positions, but then only get a portion of the total salary to use for other purposes.\n\n“Your system doesn’t allow there to be dollars, money dollars,\" Griffith said. \"It allows there to be teachers.”\n\nThat can really hamper schools, he said in a 2016 Q&A with the Rodel Foundation of Delaware.\n\n\"The big thing in Delaware is that the current system doesn’t allow for flexibility in the new areas where education is now being taken,\" Griffith said. \"Digital learning, for instance, is one of the biggest growth areas in education, as is dual and concurrent enrollment. In a more flexible system, you can say we’re going to use these funds to pay for teachers and for these enrollment opportunities for our students.\n\n\"Today we see more and more kids splitting time between virtual learning environments and brick-and-mortar school environments. Your system is built strictly on that brick-and-mortar idea. It’s not flexible for modern learning.\"\n\nThe lawsuit says tying money to teachers creates other problems, such as staff instability.\n\nSince high-poverty schools have a large proportion of students with extra needs but lack the resources to address them adequately, they are difficult places to work. Teachers with more seniority often choose to teach elsewhere, which leaves relatively inexperienced staff serving those disadvantaged students.\n\nThe annual rate of teacher turnover at high poverty schools is much higher than the statewide average of 15 percent. For example, at Bayard Middle School in the Christina School District, about 30 percent of teachers changed last year and in the 2015-16 school year, turnover was more than 60 percent, according to the lawsuit.\n\nFielder, who worked at Warner Elementary for 16 years and has been certified as a teacher in Delaware since 1999, had more experience than many of the teachers there. Fifty-six percent have been teaching for nine years or fewer, according to the state Education Department. Twenty-four percent have been teaching for four years or fewer.\n\n\"Every single year, we had teachers that would leave before October,\" Fielder said. \"And definitely, if they made it through the school year, they were gone. They were looking for something that wasn't so intense.\"\n\nAs the result of the Charter School Act and Neighborhood Schools Act, which requires students attend the school closest to their homes, Warner has been effectively re-segregated, according to the lawsuit. Only 1.8 percent of students there are white.\n\nBy contrast, Heritage Elementary School, in the same school district but outside the city of Wilmington, is 72 percent white.\n\nFielder said she couldn't blame the teachers who left Warner, because it was a tough place to work. There were students dealing with serious trauma, and not enough support staff to help them deal with their needs.\n\n“It’s a serious, serious problem that all schools are dealing with, but not in the magnitude and numbers that the priority schools are dealing with,\" she said, referring to the state's lowest-performing schools.\n\nWarner, where 16.7 percent of fourth-graders were proficient in English last year and 8.9 percent were proficient in math, is one of them.\n\n“Unless we really just have some real conversations about what’s going on,\" Fielder said, \"I don’t see how it will change.”\n\nSetting precedent\n\nThe lawsuit has provoked some conversation already, though it is unclear if the issue will actually be taken up by Chancery Court Judge Travis Laster.\n\nIn other states, judges have refused to hear such cases, arguing that they do not have jurisdiction over legislative funding formulas. And when cases are heard, it can take an average of seven years for them to wind their way through the court system, Griffith said.\n\nAs of now, there are only four states — Hawaii, Mississipi, Nevada and Utah — that haven't faced litigation over their school funding formula.\n\n“In most cases, the resort to litigation or to lawsuits is the last resort,\" said David Sciarra, executive director of the Education Law Center in New Jersey. “What’s happening in Delaware is systematic of what you see in states across the country.\"\n\nSciarra said his organization has tracked multiple school funding cases and they often serve as an important catalyst for change.\n\nIn about 60 percent of the lawsuits, the court sided with the plaintiffs, according to SchoolFunding.Info. Most cases point to academic and graduation standards that states began adopting in 1989 and to low test scores to argue states aren't fulfilling their responsibilities.\n\n“You have states — every state now actually — prescribing standards that schools, teachers, students have to meet,\" Sciarra said. \"But if the resources aren’t there, all this talk about closing achievement gaps among legislators is frankly hollow.\"\n\n“The kids that get hurt by that the most, or harmed by that failure, are the ones that have the greatest need. And you just see that play out from state to state to state.”\n\nThere have been several school funding lawsuits in New Jersey, he said.\n\nIn 1973, the New Jersey Supreme Court declared the state’s school funding formula was unconstitutional because it violated the “thorough and efficient education” requirement of the state Constitution. Since that decision, the Supreme Court has issued more than a dozen school finance opinions.\n\nA new funding formula was created in 2008 and is considered a national model, even though since it was only fully funded in 2009 school districts have been getting less than the court says they should. Even so, for several years now, New Jersey has been ranked near the top in the nation for student achievement.\n\n“The graduation rate of all poor people in New Jersey is higher than the national average for all children,\" Sciarra said.\n\nPennsylvania is also in the middle of a school funding lawsuit, which could have implications for Delaware, Sciarra said. While Pennsylvania courts had maintained they didn't have jurisdiction over school funding, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 2017 reversed that and said it would take up the issue.\n\nThat opened the door for a school funding overhaul in Pennsylvania. It highlights a fundamental shift in legal strategy for education funding lawsuits and outlines one potential path the school funding case can take in Delaware's Chancery Court, Sciarra and other experts said.\n\n\"That's probably going to loom large over (Delaware's) case,\" Sciarra said.\n\nA possible solution?\n\n\"We spend a lot on public education, that's a line you hear a lot,\" said Eve Buckley, who has two children at Shue-Medill Middle School in Newark. “I think the main thing is we’re not spending the money in a smart way. We’re not directing it where the needs are.”\n\nOver the years, she's seen programming cuts and class size increases at Shue-Medill, she said.\n\nAbout 40 percent of students there are classified as low-income and 16 percent have special needs, according to the state Education Department. About 6 percent are English-language learners.\n\nBuckley said the school no longer has a French teacher and that it doesn't have a shop teacher or librarian.\n\nThough she personally can afford to enroll her children in private lessons, she knows many families cannot.\n\n\"We don't feel that our kids are being hugely adversely impacted because we trek them to all kinds of things after school,\" she said, adding that she and her husband are both on the faculty at the University of Delaware. \"But for a lot of their classmates, it's just not an option. We're not investing in those children in the way that we should be.\"\n\nWendy Lapham, spokeswoman for Christina School District, said principals have to make hard decisions about staffing based on available teaching units, student interest and enrollment.\n\n\"Since many of the resources dedicated to students needing additional support come from a variety of sources ... it is not accurate to assume that resources intended for the general student population are redirected to students that need additional support,\" Lapham said.\n\nShue-Medill Principal Michele Savage said the school offers Spanish classes, and plans to offer Mandarin Chinese in 2019-20.\n\n\"We do not offer shop class because of the impact of the funding/staffing cuts,\" she said.\n\nAbout 46 states provide additional financial support for English language learners, giving the schools that serve them more money so they can hire specialized staff and teachers. There are 35 states that provide additional financial support for low-income children.\n\nDelaware does neither, and also does not provide special education funding for students with disabilities in kindergarten through third grade. (The Joint Finance Committee, last Tuesday, recommended $2.9 million to support students in kindergarten through third grade who require the lowest category of special education services, such as reading support or physical therapy. That would need to be approved by the full Legislature as part of the state budget process.)\n\nThe lawsuit is scattered with examples of what that means in under-resourced schools in Delaware.\n\nSpecial education specialists managing individual education plans in the Christina School District have caseloads of more than 100 students, the lawsuit says. There are 46 English language learners at Kirk Middle School but only one ESL teacher. At Smith Elementary School, two fifth-grade classes had 36 students in them as of Oct. 31.\n\nIn the fourth grade, there were classes of 29, 30 and 32 students, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThere is no reading specialist at Seaford High School, where many students live in poverty and more than 65 percent are not proficient in English language arts. In one third-grade special education class at Highlands Elementary School in Red Clay, all 12 children had to share one computer, according to the lawsuit.\n\nOne proposed solution to equity issues has been to institute a needs-based funding formula, which gives a bigger piece of the pie to disadvantaged students.\n\nThink about it this way. Every student would start with roughly the same amount of funding, depending on their grade level. Then, students who need special help would get extra funding.\n\nThe total amount of money Delaware spends on education could stay the same in a needs-based model but would be redistributed.\n\nSuch a change would likely be controversial, because school districts with relatively few low-income students and English language learners, like Appoquinimink, could stand to lose money. Some of the state funding they currently receive would likely be shifted to poorer school districts like Christina.\n\nMoney raised via referendum and local property taxes would not be affected.\n\nIt's something that has been argued for by the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission, a state advisory committee established by former Gov. Jack Markell in 2015 to come up with ideas to improve education in the city.\n\nBut Carney has said he is not in favor of needs-based funding, in part because it gives extra money to districts without holding them accountable for how they use it. He has said there is neither the financial nor political support for such a measure.\n\nOther politicians have questioned whether there's enough evidence that needs-based funding works. Some studies show money can have a positive impact on academic outcomes and others show that it doesn’t.\n\nSometimes school districts spend the extra money on the wrong things, experts say. But when they spend money on the “right” things, test scores and outcomes improve, research shows.\n\nOne study published by the Washington Center for Equitable Growth found that the achievement gap between students in high- and low-income districts shrank by roughly 20 percent after spending increased. In states with no school-funding reform, the gap grew.\n\n“School finance reforms are perhaps the largest national effort we have made to increase equality of educational opportunity since the school desegregation movement,” the study’s authors wrote. “There have been dramatic improvements in equality of school funding over the last two decades, many spurred by a series of state court rulings demanding more adequate school funding. We show that these reforms translated into sharp and immediate increases in funding in low-income districts.”\n\nIn a study conducted by The National Bureau of Economic Research in 2015, researchers looked at long-term outcomes such as educational attainment and students’ income after graduation.\n\nIt said low-income students from schools that got more money were less likely to be poor as adults. They were 10 percentage points more likely to graduate high school and earned about 10 percent more at work.\n\nThe study looked at all students, but for non-impoverished children, the funding benefits were found to be “statistically insignificant.” The research is intended to show that while some benefits of increased funding may not necessarily translate into higher test scores, they can still improve students’ overall outcomes.\n\nThe extra funding was spent on changes such as smaller class sizes, more guidance counselors, higher teacher salaries and longer school years.\n\nWhile some states have made significant investments in early childhood education, as Delaware has, research shows that some of the benefits fade by the time those students leave third grade. Lackluster funding in elementary school can negate some of the positive effects.\n\nSiawaa Antwi, Tylan Raburnel's older sister and a junior at Freire Charter School in Wilmington, isn't sure Delaware is giving students what they need at all.\n\nAs a member of TeenSHARP, which prepares high school students of color for top colleges, she's come to realize how underprepared she is and how hard she'll have to work to secure her future. TeenSHARP has summer programs that help teens get up to speed, but she worries she'll be unable to catch up.\n\nFreire, a fairly new school where 72 percent of students are African-American and about 52 percent are low-income, does not have advanced placement or international baccalaureate classes, she said.\n\nPaul Ramirez, co-head of school at Freire, said the school did have its first dual-enrollment class this year. AP classes will come next year when the school has its first 12th-graders, he said.\n\n\"AP classes themselves aren't a huge cost burden,\" he said. \"More to the point, I do think that the per-student funding rate only covers the basics of what we offer, and we're able to provide a lot of the rich programming we have at the school only by seeking funding from other sources. \"\n\nSiawaa worries about her brother, she said. Growing up in Wilmington, she knows what can happen to kids who get held back in school and don't get the education they need.\n\n“I was just having this conversation with my mom, and I think it’s really messed up because you can't make up for 12 years of a bad education,\" Siawaa said. \"You can’t make it up over a summer.”\n\nShe said Tylan's father isn't involved in his life and her father killed himself, which has left the family struggling. While Siawaa admits changes in circumstance have led to her brother to act out in school, she can't help but feel the education system is failing him and that schools should have more counselors and psychologists to help children coping with trauma.\n\n\"It's like a domino effect,\" she said. \"You go to a bad elementary school, you go to a bad middle school, you go to a bad high school. How do you get into a good college and get a good job?\"\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\nNCCo council votes down property tax increase\n\nDelaware lawmakers eye state workers bonuses\n\nCrimes, but little prison time in accused arsonist's past\n\nOriginal lawsuit\n\nMotion to dismiss\n\nACLU and Community Legal Aid's response\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

It's good. The historical framing, the acknowledgment of race, class, and geography as compounding forces, the impact on children, the costs of continued inertia, the recommendations for immediate action, the call for comprehensive planning – it's all here. This report addresses what is now three generations of a largely failed experiment for children who could least afford it.\n\nThe 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision centered on achieving equity for a young Delaware girl, Shirley Bulah of Hockessin. The Bulah family knew that Shirley deserved better than the education she was receiving at Hockessin Colored School 107 (c), a one-room schoolhouse with outdated, hand-me-down books that had an inferior curriculum compared to schools that her white peers attended; no transportation support; and a teacher who could rely on very little professional supports other than what he or she had learned in what was likely an equally segregated and under-resourced college. In cases brought by the Bulah family and the Belton family of Claymont, Attorney Louis L. Redding and Delaware Chancery Court Judge Collins Seitz challenged the segregation that sustained this inequity. The Delaware cases were the only ones included in the historic Brown decision where the lower court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, and as such, set the precedent for the court's actions. While the segregation of schools was struck down in public law 60 years ago, the inequality of educational opportunity has persisted for three generations of students who were supposed to be the beneficiaries of these historic rulings.\n\nThis is not what Chancellor Seitz, Attorney Redding, or the U.S. Supreme Court intended.\n\nA Window into More of the Same\n\nIn chairing the Wilmington Education Advisory Committee, I have learned a great deal about public education reform in Delaware and have been humbled by its profound and troubled history – and its equally troubled present. Indeed, the last eight months are a window into the last 60 years. It has been a period of vigorous disagreement over how best to serve children who – because of where they come from, what they look like, and/or the financial and social circumstances of their families – need more support in the way of resources to learn effectively in school, and by extension, to succeed in life.\n\nThe adults who teach these students generally believe strongly in their potential. They exhibit a passion and personal devotion that compels them to do their very best in the classroom and also to spend their own time and money to do much more than is required. I have heard countless stories from teachers who wash their students' clothes, feed them when they are hungry, provide their parents with advice, and connect both parents and children to services that help them deal with the very real trauma they face at home and in their neighborhoods.\n\nMany of these educators believe that being held accountable for the performance of these students on standardized tests is unfair. They argue that the tests are flawed and focus on factors that do not address the developmental needs of these children or the actual learning of content and life skills. They point to the many challenges these students face: hunger, homelessness, institutionalized racism, violence, \"broken\" family structures, poverty, lack of access to quality health care, and the intergenerational effects of parents who themselves are under-educated and under-prepared to role model \"achievement\" for their children. A great many teachers have said to me that for students who live with these challenges, the very fact that they can get to school every day is – in many cases – a sheer miracle. Given what I have heard and seen, those miracles are regular occurrences. Even so, they should never be used to justify low expectations of student achievement and thereby cast a very long shadow over the prospects of poor children and the communities they come from. High expectations for all our children still has to be the standard and teachers must be given the tools and support to help all their students succeed.\n\nWith parents, we commonly mistake intergenerational poverty for parental neglect, suggesting that poor parents are ill-equipped to be educational advocates and \"first teachers\" for their kids. I don't doubt that there are cases where this argument holds, and in those cases it is difficult for educators to do their jobs and for children to learn. But this is not typical. Low-income parents certainly have barriers to success, some of which are systemic while others are of their own doing, but like any other parents, their priority is giving their children the best possible educational options they can afford. For many parents, the schools they attended and where they often were deemed unteachable are the very same schools their children now attend. The stigma attached to this kind of scenario cannot be overstated, but it does not make parents indifferent or make student failure a foregone conclusion. Virtually all agree that parent engagement is critical to student success.\n\nPoliticians and civic leaders often center their views on education around which constituencies speak with the loudest voices. Business leaders often propose that change can be accomplished by applying simple, logical business practices backed by a stronger resolve by education leaders who focus on measuring success. They want results, but many don't know what goes on in our schools or in the lives of our students. Preaching best business practices and a focus on data to a beleaguered inner-city teacher is hardly a recipe for success.\n\nFor all the contending views and stakeholders, few disagree with the guiding principle of putting students at the center of everything we do and giving teachers the resources and support to meet student needs. Acting on this principle is quite a different matter. There is never enough money – incremental or reallocated. Some think we already spend too much, while others can't conceive of making improvements without a great deal more. There are so many competing interests and priorities within the existing system that getting agreement is never easy. There is rarely enough political will to actually sustain changes that might have a lasting, positive impact. After 60 years of failed reforms, innovations, and experiments, there is fatigue among many within the public education system and an embedded and growing public skepticism about most proposals for improvement.\n\nThis state of affairs gave Delaware a 20-year pass on implementing any part of Brown, despite its clear role in the ruling, and led to 40 years of failed reforms that continue to favor inertia over change.\n\nA Way Forward\n\nThe members of the Wilmington Education Advisory Committee believe the action agenda in our report offers a way forward. We propose a comprehensive package of changes that builds upon the recommendations of previous task forces addressing the challenges of improving Wilmington education. Implementing the recommended changes will clear away 60 years of institutional and policy underbrush that currently limits improvements in student learning outcomes. Our recommendations are not a panacea, but they are necessary steps on a more positive path for public education in Wilmington. We are convinced that the proposed path will better serve our students by supporting the continuous improvement of our schools and will lead to much higher levels of quality across the entire Wilmington public education system.\n\nThe starting point is to repair the governance of Wilmington public education that has evolved into an arrangement that is simply irrational and indefensible. As of fall 2015, there will be 19 separate governing units responsible for delivering public education to approximately 11,000 Wilmington children with no unified plan, few efforts at collaboration, and virtually no requirements to function as a coordinated public education system. It is irrational to have responsibilities for Wilmington public education fragmented to the extent that there is one district with fewer than 200 students and literally no schools in the city, and another district that is one of only four discontinuous districts in the nation (out of 14,000 school districts) that has 20 miles of interstate highway separating one part from the other. We believe that a rational solution is for the Colonial and Christina Schools Districts to no longer serve Wilmington students. We propose that the Red Clay Consolidated School District should take responsibility for those Wilmington schools and students. This transition should begin immediately, recognizing that it will take a few years for the process to be completed in an effective and non-disruptive manner for the students, their families, and their educators.\n\nChanging district lines will not automatically translate to higher student achievement, but it will remove obstacles that limit our capacity to focus our full capacity and efforts on student success. It will give greater responsibility to a single district for improving the education of the vast majority of Wilmington children. To fulfill that responsibility, Red Clay will need the will, the money, and an improved approach to addressing the challenges of schools with high concentrations of low-income children.\n\nEqually irrational is the notion that the state with the nation's third-highest percentage of students enrolled in charter schools, most concentrated in Wilmington, had approved a growth in charter enrollment of 90 percent over the next five years with no plan for its charter schools or for how they should connect with the other parts of the public education system.\n\nWe cannot continue to operate and fund at taxpayer expense two largely disconnected and often competing public education systems (three, if we consider the separately governed vo-tech schools). This arrangement will not support educational improvement for all of our students. We need a statewide strategic plan for the development of public education that includes the desired number, type, and mix of charter, district, and vo-tech schools, and also a charter consortium that supports the sharing of best practices among charters and between charters and district schools.\n\nOur report also calls upon the state to activate its existing infrastructure and reallocate its resources to better address the needs of low-income students in Wilmington and across Delaware. To be clear, this is more than a Wilmington problem. According to the Southern Education Foundation, in 2013, 51 percent of Delaware children qualified as low income based on their eligibility for the Free and Reduced-Price Lunch program. Addressing the needs of these children and their families and providing the needed supports for schools with high concentrations of low-income students is a statewide challenge and needs to be met in a comprehensive manner.\n\nDelaware needs to develop and implement a comprehensive plan that can mobilize existing statewide institutions, policies, and resources toward the common objective of addressing the needs of children in poverty and supporting the schools in which those children are educated. Today, existing state programs and agencies are largely dormant and disconnected. By way of example, the council on higher education presidents, a forum in which one would think the university and college presidents throughout Delaware could come together and put their collective resources toward support for a statewide Pre-K-to-college plan, has not met in years. This is one of many examples where we simply are not optimizing the systems and resources we have in place.\n\nWe also believe that the system for funding public schools is antiquated and no longer effectively serves student needs. We propose changes that will ensure that the most challenged schools are well-resourced and adequately support the needs of their students.\n\nThis includes attracting and supporting the best teachers in the toughest classrooms. We need to change the state's funding formula to better address the needs of all Delaware schools with large concentrations of low-income students and English language learners. We also are proposing a close review of the revenue base that supports Delaware in general and its public education system in particular. It is a well-known fact that the foundations of public education funding are weak at both the state and local levels. It is a grave concern that property reassessment has not been done in New Castle County since 1983, Kent County since 1986, and in Sussex County sometime between 1972 and 1974.\n\nFinally, let us not forget the voices of the people whose children are most affected. Throughout our review process, we have heard calls for a re-imagined Wilmington School District. In my view, this is a largely nostalgic reaction to a time that once was, where Wilmington communities were still racially segregated but were also multi-income and made up of professionals of color living in close proximity to the working poor. Today, those communities are different. Suburban flight among all races has left most Wilmington communities with significantly fewer resources than existed 40 years ago and, equally problematic, with many fewer role-models of achievement. You couldn't build a Wilmington School District today without recognizing its immediate economic peril and the concentrated challenges that such a school district would face. We don't surmise any more success in that construct than what exists today. Instead, we believe that the Wilmington city government should mobilize representative voices for their community's children, and that the proposed City Office of Education and Public Policy should bring those voices to the forefront, particularly for those parents who otherwise simply cannot navigate the complexities of the current ill-constructed system.\n\nThe Time to Act Is Now\n\nWhat gives us even greater optimism is the community support we have received for the recommendations in our interim report. In our public comment period, we received input from thousands of Wilmington and Delaware citizens through meetings, public events, and social media. We met with politicians and decision-makers at every level of government, education leaders from districts and charters, and a host of community partners, parents, and students.\n\nNo one has told us that the path of the last 60 years is sustainable, appropriate, or fair.\n\nTo change that path, we need a broad-based, cross-sector coalition to act boldly and without equivocation, right now, on the recommendations of the Wilmington Education Advisory Committee. The time to act is now.\n\nDr. Tony Allen is the chairman of Governor's Wilmington Advisory Committee on Education, the Whitney M.

Parents whose children were not identified as victims in videotapes that alerted authorities to Rodriguez never learned of the abuse until they read about the 21-year-old's guilty plea and sentencing in The News Journal this week. That lag, they say, robbed them of the chance to determine if anything happened to their children.\n\n\"I just want to make sure I do what I need to do as a parent, but now they took that away from me,\" said Nicole Rittenhouse, a mother who withdrew her 6-year-old son from Kidz Ink II's after-school program this week. \"And they seem to think there is nothing wrong with that.\"\n\nNow, Rittenhouse and others are calling for legal action and a change in Delaware law that would force the state and day care administrators to notify not just law enforcement but also parents whose children attend a facility if any abuse or neglect occurs.\n\nThe parents hope to find support in a state that has made significant reforms in the aftermath of the massive and horrific child sex abuse case of former Lewes pediatrician Earl Bradley.\n\nSenate Majority Whip Nicole Poore, D-New Castle, said she would be open to legislation if more information about the incidents at Kidz Ink II shows a gap in protecting children in Delaware.\n\n\"If there was legislation that was needed, I would have to believe you would see us all come together,\" she said. \"We never ever want to see any of our kids harmed in any way.\"\n\nThe co-owner of Kidz Ink. – a day care chain with six locations statewide – has defended the way his staff handled the sexual abuse and the lack of notification to parents who sent their children to the Porter Road day care in Bear.\n\nWhile walking beneath surveillance cameras that dot nearly every corner of his day care, Phil Kitson explained that his staff notified authorities in July of 2015 as soon as video came to light showing Rodriguez kissing and hugging a student in a classroom. Rodriguez was immediately fired and the staff gave police all available video from the server that covered approximately one to two weeks, he said.\n\n\"We could have fired him and not notified the agencies, and then the situation would have continued, but we felt it was a kiss that was totally inappropriate,\" Kitson said. \"Fortunately, we were able to apprehend a sex offender.\"\n\nKitson said he wishes he had been able to notify parents, but that he was instructed not to by Delaware State Police. Doing so could \"taint\" the investigation, especially if parents were to plant any sex abuse accusations against Rodriguez in their children's minds, he was told.\n\nDelaware State Police Master Cpl. Jeffrey R. Hale said police do not prohibit day care centers from discussing ongoing investigations, but \"do explain that anything that is discussed may jeopardize the outcome of the investigation.\"\n\nSTORY: Divorce filing details split of Kathleen, Hunter Biden\n\nSTORY: More resignations, reassignments at Delaware prisons\n\nHale said the safety of the children who attended the day care was always of the utmost importance. The children were not in danger once Rodriguez was arrested and dismissed, he said.\n\n\"Through the course of our investigation we were unable to identify any additional victims and at this time do not have any reason to believe that there are any [more],\" Hale said.\n\nSome parents still wonder what the scope of the state police investigation was and whether the video turned over to police was enough to determine the full extent of the abuse – especially because it spanned only a brief period of time and took approximately 18 months for the parents to learn of it.\n\n\"How did we even know to ask?\" Rittenhouse said.\n\nA jungle gym castle\n\nInside Kidz Ink II on Friday, it was business as usual, despite a particularly difficult week in which Kitson was fielding parent inquiries and had to sign the withdrawals of two students.\n\nToddlers went down for naps after lunch, while older children walked in line to a room filled with balls and a teal-colored jungle gym castle.\n\nThe upstairs classroom where Rodriguez supervised school-age children before and after school every day was filled with shamrock cutouts for St. Patrick's Day. Cameras blinked in two corners of that room.\n\nRodriguez started working at Kidz Ink II on Dec. 10, 2012. No red flags showed up on his background check, drug test or reference check, according to Kitson.\n\nThe first hint of trouble with Rodriguez came on July 28. Food was left out in one of the classrooms, and the staff wanted to find the culprit.\n\nThey turned back the video footage – and caught something worse.\n\nThe video showed Rodriguez seated in a chair while he hugged and kissed a child standing between his open legs, according to information Deputy Attorney General Jan van Amerongen relayed to a judge at sentencing.\n\nThe staff member reported the incident to the state's abuse hotline, turned over all available video and confronted Rodriguez about it the next day.\n\nRodriguez refused to look at the footage but denied kissing the boy on the lips, stating he had kissed only the top of the head, according to an affidavit of probable cause signed by a state police investigator.\n\nThe kiss violated day care policy so Rodriguez was fired.\n\nA letter was sent home only to those parents whose children were in the classes that Rodriguez worked in. The letter – a standard practice at the day care whenever staff leaves – said Rodriguez no longer worked at Kidz Ink but did not explain why.\n\n\"If you have any questions or concerns please contact a member of our administrative team,\" the letter said.\n\n'Bad touches'\n\nState police launched their own investigation into the videos, and as part of that, reviewed all surveillance footage. The police were able to identify three children who appeared to be inappropriately touched by Rodriguez, according to van Amerongen.\n\nThe three, all age 7 at the time of the indictment, were interviewed by the Children's Advocacy Center of Delaware.\n\nOne disclosed during the interview that Rodriguez had reached \"deep down inside his swimming trunks and pinched his penis\" at a birthday party at a home in June 2015, the affidavit said.\n\nKitson said while he feels for the parents whose children were abused, it is a violation of day care policy for parents to use staff members at private birthday parties or other events outside the facility.\n\nAt the birthday party, the boy said, \"Ouch,\" and Rodriguez said, \"It was an accident,\" according to the affidavit. He went on to describe the kisses and pinching as \"bad touches\" and said \"it felt weird.\"\n\nThis was enough evidence for police to arrest Rodriguez on Aug. 12, 2015. The police did not, however, let the public know of the arrest.\n\n\"At the time of the arrest of Anthony Rodriguez in August of 2015, the Delaware State Police were still conducting an on-going and active investigation and attempting to determine if Rodriguez had committed any further crimes against other day care attendees,\" Hale said. \"A news release was not crafted so as to not jeopardize the continuing investigation.\"\n\nThe first public word of the sexual abuse came in November of 2016 when the office of Attorney General Matt Denn sent a press release saying Rodriguez, a day care worker, had pleaded guilty to sexual solicitation of a child and two counts of second-degree sexual abuse of a child by a person in a position of trust.\n\nFew parents knew of that press release until three months later when Denn's office sent another saying Rodriguez had been sentenced to 12 years in prison and was ordered to register as a Tier 3 sex offender.\n\nKoala bear hugs\n\nThe late notice left some parents outraged.\n\nOne mother, who asked that her name not be used because her son is still in the day care, has been ticking through all the possibilities for when and where her child could have had contact with Rodriguez. Even though she knows her son was not in his classroom, she said her son took a particular liking to Rodriguez and would often cling to his legs like a \"koala bear.\"\n\nAt the dinner table one night this week, she casually asked her son if anybody at day care had ever inappropriately touched him. He answered \"no.\"\n\n\"He said, 'If someone tried to do that, I would yell and kick,'\" she said. \"So, hopefully, we got the right reaction.\"\n\nBut, she still wishes they could have had that conversation in 2015 – not now.\n\nThe mother is planning to move her son and has interviewed three day cares this week but is finding it difficult to secure a spot on short notice. She and other parents said they wouldn't feel the need to pull their children had the day care communicated with them sooner about Rodriguez's arrest.\n\n\"Had I known over a year ago that this had happened, but that they were taking the right actions, I wouldn't have pulled him,\" Rittenhouse said. \"This could have happened anywhere, and I understand that.\"\n\nKitson and Dawn Thompson, a spokesperson for the Delaware Department for Children, Youth and Their Families, have defended the lack of notification, saying it is not required under state law.\n\n\"As required by our regulations, the facility reported the incident to our child abuse reporting hotline and law enforcement, then took immediate action to protect children at the day care from future harm,\" Thompson said.\n\nKitson is confident that no other children were sexually abused and has reassured parents that most of their children were not in the same classroom as Rodriguez.\n\n\"He was never in a room where he had to change a diaper or change a kid,\" Kitson said. \"He never was with young kids.\"\n\nGuy D'Andrea, a lawyer at Laffey, Bucci & Kent LLP, questioned whether Kitson's actions have been enough. He is trying to talk to the victims' parents and the parents of those who weren't notified by the day care to determine if a civil lawsuit is warranted.\n\n\"We want to make sure all of the known abuse victims are known – not to the public – but to us,\" he said. \"It is to make the child whole, but also to hold them accountable for what they allowed to occur.\"\n\n\"The abuser is to blame, but oftentimes they are allowed or emboldened because those who employed them don't do anything about the abuse,\" he explained.\n\nAside from a civil lawsuit, Rittenhouse said she believes the day care failed on a moral level that can be corrected only by ensuring state law is changed and this never happens again.\n\n\"There has to be some kind of moral obligation to let me know so I could do what needed to be done,\" she said.\n\nContact Jessica Masulli Reyes at (302) 324-2777, jmreyes@delawareonline.com or Twitter @JessicaMasulli.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/08/31/delaware-pensioners-new-medicare-advantage-plan-blue-cross-blue-shield/65461519007/", "title": "What Delaware state pensioners need to know about new Medicare ...", "text": "Starting next year, the state will be offering Delaware state retirees a new type of Medicare plan, which has sparked a number of questions and concerns among retirees.\n\nWhat follows is an explanation of the Medicare Advantage plan and why state officials believe it will help save money – despite the unease among many.\n\nWhat is Medicare Advantage?\n\nMedicare Advantage, also referred to as Medicare Part C, consists of Medicare plans available through private companies. It’s often seen as a cost-saving alternative to a traditional government health insurance plan.\n\nNearly 40% of beneficiaries nationwide get their coverage through a Medicare Advantage plan, according to AARP.\n\nThe Delaware plan is being offered through Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield Delaware, which is the largest insurer in the state. There are about 25,000 state retirees.\n\nMedicare approves the plans offered by private companies, and requires them to cover everything that Medicare Parts A and B cover, which is hospital coverage and doctor and outpatient services.\n\nMany Medicare Advantage plans, according to the AARP, cover prescription drugs too, in addition to other services Medicare might not traditionally cover, like dental, hearing or vision care.\n\nFor Delaware's plan, retirees must be enrolled in the Medicare Advantage plan in order to receive the benefits of Medicare Part D, which is prescription drug coverage. State officials attribute this to requirements made by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nOne of the often major differences between Medicare Advantage plans is that they can have a provider network and “may charge more or not cover doctors or facilities outside of a plan’s network,” according to AARP. Medicare covers any doctors and health care providers that accept Medicare.\n\nDelaware officials maintain that this will not apply to state pensioners and their spouses. They say Delaware retirees will continue to see and receive care from any doctors and hospitals that accept Medicare.\n\nWhy (and how) did Delaware make this decision?\n\nMany states and cities have transitioned to Medicare Advantage as a way to control ballooning health care and pension costs. For years, Delaware has struggled with its health care costs, especially at a time when the state's residents are becoming older and sicker.\n\nIn 2019, Gov. John Carney signed an executive order that re-established a committee to study state retiree benefits. In February, the state awarded Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield Delaware a three-year contract to provide the Medicare Advantage plan.\n\nThe General Assembly, this June, also voted to approve putting 1% of the previous year's budget into a trust fund for retiree healthcare. Yet Rep. John Kowalko, a Newark Democrat who is one of the most vocal opponents of the Medicare Advantage plan, said he believes he and fellow lawmakers were unaware at the time of how significant the changes to Medicare would be.\n\nAs of now, Delaware has $10 billion of unfunded liability for retiree healthcare. There’s concern among state officials that this will continue to grow, ultimately hurting Delaware’s financial future.\n\nClaire DeMatteis, secretary of the Department of Human Resources,said that if the state does “nothing” by 2050 the retiree unfunded liability is estimated to grow to about $33 billion.\n\n“If we enact some very minor reforms in retiree health care benefits,” she said, “and keep up with this 1% toward the retiree health care trust fund by 2050, we could reduce that liability to just $3 billion.”\n\nNationwide, states struggle with unfunded liability for both pensions and health care benefits. As Pew explains it, unfunded retirement liabilities mean “states have set aside less than is needed to cover the expected full costs of benefits earned by their employees.”\n\nWhen compared to public pensions, many states specifically have set aside “far less to cover the long-term costs of retiree health care liabilities,” according to Pew.\n\nJoanna Adams, pension administrator for the state’s Office of Pension, said the unfunded liability grows because, right now, Delaware pays for health care expenses each year through the budgetary process. The state saves money by Highmark taking on more of the risk when it comes to health insurance.\n\n“The concept is now you're able to save for the future,” she said. “One of the trends that's happening across the nation is some public pension funds are not offering health care in the future. Maybe all new hires starting at a certain date are no longer eligible for health care.\n\n“We're trying to avoid that situation here.”\n\nWhat does the Delaware Medicare Advantage Plan consist of?\n\nState officials say the Medicare Advantage plan has been specifically “customized” to state pensioners. It’s called the Highmark BCBS Delaware Freedom Blue PPO Medicare Advantage Plan. It’s replacing the Medicfill Medicare Supplemental Plan.\n\nCoverage, officials say, will remain the same for Medicare services and prescription drugs. Pensioners will also have access to the same doctors that accept Medicare. Here’s a break down of the benefits, per the state:\n\n$0 co-pay for visits with your doctor\n\n$0 deductible for medical services\n\n$0 cost for skilled nursing facility services\n\n$0 cost for nationwide in and out-of-network coverage with out-of-network providers receiving the 100% Medicare allowable reimbursement for services provided\n\n$0 cost for lab and imaging\n\n$0 cost for emergency room and urgent care services\n\nFull and immediate coverage for pensioners with pre-existing conditions\n\nThe Medicare Advantage plan also includes other benefits like the Silver Sneakers fitness program membership and home meal service after a hospital discharge.\n\nDeMatteis said the main priority when negotiating its plan with Highmark was to make sure that Delaware retirees would be able to keep their current health care providers.\n\n“This is not some off-the-shelf Medicare Advantage plan,” she said. “This Medicare Advantage plan was custom designed for state of Delaware pensioners – to get them the same coverage that they previously had under the Medicare supplement plan.”\n\nHow much do I have to pay?\n\nIt depends on when you retired and how long you’ve worked for the state.\n\nState officials say the premiums for the Medicare Advantage will be cut in half. According to state data, premiums are estimated to go from $459.38 to $216.18.\n\nHere’s a full breakdown of the Medicare Advantage rates that would go into effect on Jan. 1, 2023.\n\nHere's what the rates were previously:\n\nWhat are the concerns with Medicare Advantage?\n\nThis change has caused significant distress among some lawmakers and retirees.\n\nKowalko, who is retiring from the legislature at the end of this term, has come out the hardest against the changes. He believes state officials are misleading the public, and has called upon lawmakers to “act to ensure that this contract is shelved” so state retirees can return to the current plan for the time being.\n\nBut it’s unlikely that will happen.\n\n“Medicare Advantage plans are great for healthy retirees,” he wrote in an Op-Ed for Delaware Online/The News Journal. “They will fail older retirees who will need to fight battles for medical care while they are ill. We can do better for the people who served this state.”\n\nKowalko, in an interview, said he has serious issues about how this Medicare Advantage plan involves prior authorization, a process insurers use to determine if they will cover a procedure, service or medication.\n\nHighmark reports having a 92% approval rate. The 8% denial rate, some of which are related to the level of care, is concerning to Kowalko.\n\n“Do you think a Silver Sneakers Program … is going to make up for the denial of benefits for a needed CAT scan,” Kowalko said, “or denial of access to a good cardiologist as a opposed to a mediocre cardiologist?”\n\nConcerns about prior authorization have also been raised on the federal level. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, this April, published a report that found that there have been “widespread and persistent problems related to inappropriate denials of services and payment.”\n\nThere have been times, the inspector general found, that Medicare Advantage beneficiaries have been delayed or denied access to services, even though the requests meet Medicare coverage standards.\n\n“Beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage may not be aware that there may be greater barriers to accessing certain types of health care services in Medicare Advantage than in original Medicare,” the report said.\n\nFollowing this report, the American Hospital Association sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice, asking it to create a fraud task force to investigate this issue. The American Medical Association also agreed with the findings of the federal report.\n\nWhen asked about this report, Delaware officials pointed to an analysis by AHIP, a trade association for health care insurers, that focused on how the inspector general's report is based on a limited sample of prior authorization denials issued in one week in June 2019 – 33 of which raised concerns for the Office of the Inspector General.\n\n“Medicare Advantage plans have a responsibility to use prior authorization in areas prone to waste and abuse to protect seniors from unsafe, unnecessary, costly, low-value care,” the organization wrote.\n\nDeMatteis, the secretary of the Department of Human Resources, said pre-authorization has been a part of health care for decades.\n\n“We have to show our retirees this works,” she said. “This is how health care works. It's not meant to be punitive. It's not meant to delay services. It is a check to make sure that services are medically necessary. And it's how we perform health care in America today.”\n\nShe added that in response to these issues the state is “building in performance guarantees for Highmark.” This will consist of the insurer providing quarterly reports to the state about the denials, the rate of appeals being overturned and the services being approved, she said.\n\n“We're going to track this and monitor this very closely as we do any contract but particularly because of the concerns of approval rates,” DeMatteis said. She said pensioners will also be able to provide their feedback about their experience.\n\n“I am confident that when we look back on this year, we'll see health care work,” DeMatteis added. “It's still the best health care that we could possibly offer our pensioners.”\n\nEnrollment begins Oct. 3 - 24.

John Carney is looking at the potential use of emergency powers to issue a universal mask mandate in Delaware schools, but did not say for sure at a press conference Thursday whether or not it will happen.\n\nHe did say, however, that the state will \"need to make a decision pretty quickly\" as the 2021-22 school year approaches.\n\nWhile districts await Carney's potential order, one of Delaware's largest public school districts will require masks for all students and staff, regardless of their vaccination status.\n\nThe Christina School District board announced during a Tuesday meeting that it would be following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to begin the 2021-22 school year.\n\nChristina, which had one of the earliest board meetings in August, is the first public district to announce plans for the upcoming school year.\n\nOther districts either haven't yet announced plans or have board meetings scheduled for next week or the week after – when plans are likely to be announced and discussed.\n\nThose meetings and decisions, however, could come after Carney issues an order. Delaware's emergency order ended Tuesday, July 13. The expiration of that order freed school districts to make their own decisions on policies like face coverings.\n\nWhile further guidance is coming prior to the school year, Red Clay – Delaware's largest district – was requiring students in summer programs to wear masks as of last week.\n\n\"We are monitoring CDC and state guidance on the issue and will provide our guidance prior to the start of the new school year,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nDuring the Tuesday night meeting, Christina Superintendent Dan Shelton said the district did not run into many problems with masks among students and that \"adults\" were responsible for making it an issue.\n\nHe also acknowledged that the science and recommendations have not been consistent and that policies for the district could change \"on a day-by-day, hour-by-hour basis.\"\n\nChristina schools will be open for in-person learning to start the 2021-22 school year, and Carney and Dr. Karyl Rattay, the director of the Division of Public Health, reiterated the desire for all schools to be open in 2021-22.\n\n\"We can’t afford another year (like 2020),\" Carney said.\n\nThe Christina district, said board member Claire O'Neal, has committed to following the recommended guidance since the pandemic began.\n\nPublic comment Tuesday night did not include a debate over masking.\n\nBut the mask vs. no mask conversation has dominated headlines and school board meetings almost nationwide in recent months.\n\nBUS DRIVER SHORTAGE: School officials are trying everything to fight bus driver shortage, even paying parents\n\nDuring a Milford school board meeting Monday night, for example, four people spoke during public comment – all with concerns about masking. Three people spoke out against masks and one person in favor.\n\nOne who spoke against masking called the face coverings a \"political tool.\"\n\n\"I think any reasonable person who looks at the science and sees past the politics would come to the conclusion that our kids are not at danger,\" said a man who said he had three elementary-aged children.\n\nHe asked the Milford board to see past the politicization and to not require masks.\n\nA woman with a child under 12 said she was comfortable \"yielding to people in this world who have done their research\" in medical school \"and haven’t done their research on Facebook and YouTube.\"\n\n\"Children under 12, like my daughter, are not yet eligible to be vaccinated,\" she said. \"The mask is protecting her. As a member of a society, we have a responsibility to each other that goes beyond our own desire.\"\n\nThe burden, the mother said, should be on the state to make a decision and not left to the Milford board.\n\nZONING LINES: One community in Magnolia makes its plea to the Caesar Rodney School District over an imaginary line\n\nAnother woman said parents should get to decide whether their child wears a mask or doesn't.\n\nBoard members in Milford did not respond to any debates over masking, as it was not on the meeting agenda.\n\n\"We saw very little spread in our schools last year,\" Rattay said. \"Masks work.\"\n\nThe CDC reversed course in late July, announcing recommendations that all grade school students, teachers and staff be masked, regardless of their vaccination status, during the 2021-22 school year as worry over the delta variant heightened.\n\nThat came less than three weeks after the agency announced that vaccinated teachers and students wouldn't need to wear masks inside school buildings this fall, and two months after the agency lifted mask requirements in most public settings for vaccinated people.\n\nDelaware in late May adopted the CDC's guidance that at the time removed all social distancing restrictions and made masks optional for everyone – vaccinated and unvaccinated.\n\nCarney stopped doing weekly virus-related press conferences but held one Thursday morning as the delta variant has resulted in a rapid increase in cases and hospitalizations over the last six weeks.\n\nCarney did not announce any new mandates or sweeping changes Thursday other than alluding to the potential for statewide school mask mandates.\n\nThere had previously been competing advice from the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics, adding to the uncertainty for schools.\n\nBoth institutions expressed the need for schools to fully reopen, but the Academy of Pediatrics, in guidance issued after the July 9 CDC recommendations, said those in schools should be masked.\n\nRestrictions and safety measures have varied across state and county lines. In California, for example, the state health department still requires masks indoors in K-12 schools when children are present, regardless of vaccination status.\n\nIn neighboring Arizona, lawmakers banned school districts from instituting mask mandates. Similar laws were passed in Iowa and Texas.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has been critical of COVID-19 restrictions, signed an executive order making face masks optional across the state in schools and leaving it up to parents.\n\nAs of Thursday, 44% of people aged 12 to 17 in Delaware have been vaccinated. That percentage represents the lowest share among all age groups in the state, according to the state's online vaccine tracker – though only 45.7% of people aged 18 to 34 have been vaccinated.\n\nOfficials anticipate at least the Pfizer vaccine could be approved for children younger than 12 in September or October.\n\nDelaware officials last month announced a $15 million partnership between the state's health and education departments and a California-based company to bring rapid antigen coronavirus tests to schools around the state in an effort to \"prevent transmission and keep schools open,\" the health department said in July.\n\nThe tests will be free to students and staff. Parents and guardians will have to give permission for children to be tested.\n\n\"I know that there's a lot of individuals who think, 'Well, kids are not at risk; kids aren't, you know, going to have a lot of problems from this.' But first of all, for probably the first half of this pandemic, most kids weren't in school and then when kids were in the school setting, they were all wearing masks and they were socially distanced and we saw very little spread,\" Rattay said.\n\n\"If they all wear masks, then we'll be able to limit spread, but it's hard to get all kids back and keep them as far apart as 6 feet and so there is going to be some level of risk especially for unvaccinated individuals.\n\n\"To be able to test on a regular basis is going to help prevent the in-school spread.\"\n\nContact reporter Jeff Neiburg at jneiburg@delawareonline.com.

Yields are going to be significantly below average.” Ashley Ravenscraft, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Huntsville, said portions of Lawrence and Morgan counties have been characterized as “abnormally dry” since June 21. In Limestone County, 60% of the county has been in a moderate drought since June 28. From June 21 through last Monday, Decatur received only 0.24 inch of rainfall, and Moulton had 0.53 inch, Ravenscraft said. Athens, she said, had 1.78 inches of rain in that span, but she attributed the higher number to pop-up showers the past several days. Ravenscraft said the average rainfall in July is 4.49 inches. “Typically, around this time of year you’re getting some kind of rainfall from either tropical systems or your summertime storms or a weaker disturbance that will come through and produce some rain. This is typically one of our wettest months out of the year,” she said.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: A family had given up hope of finding their blind, elderly golden retriever who wandered away from their home three weeks ago, but a construction crew found Lulu in salmonberry bushes after initially confusing her for a bear. Lulu was barely alive after being found Tuesday, but she is being nursed back to health at home with her family, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reports. “She means everything,” owner Ted Kubacki said. “I have five daughters, and they’re 4 to 13 years old, so they’ve spent every day of their life with that dog.” The Kubacki family searched for weeks after Lulu wandered off June 18. “She’s just so helpless, and you kind of imagined that she can’t get real far because she can’t see,” he said. It didn’t help when the family was the subject of a terrible joke when someone claimed they found Lulu a few days into the search. “We put the kids to bed and got a text saying, ‘We found your dog,’ or ‘I have your dog,’ and we’re like, ‘Oh my god, this is incredible,’ ” he said. “Then the person texted me, ‘Just kidding.’ This happened, yeah; that was all part of this terrible story.” Once Lulu did make it back, Kubacki, a grocery store employee and sole provider for his family of seven, then worried about the veterinarian’s bill. But his fears were unfounded, as Sitka residents donated hundreds of dollars to cover Lulu’s recuperation bills.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An attorney with the state attorney general’s office told a judge Friday that a 2021 “personhood” law that gives all legal rights to unborn children can’t be used to bring criminal charges against abortion providers. The comment from Assistant Solicitor General Kate Sawyer came during a hearing where attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona and an abortion rights group representing abortion providers were seeking an injunction blocking the law. They said abortion providers are worried that prosecutors will bring charges for crimes like assault and child abuse under the law, which U.S. District Judge Douglas Rayes declined to block last year. That decision came before the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 24 ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that said women have a right to seek an abortion. The battle over Arizona’s “personhood” law – one of several in Republican-led states that aim to grant all rights to fetuses – is playing out despite all abortions being halted in the state. Arizona providers stopped providing the procedure because of concerns that a pre-1901 law that bans all abortions may now be enforceable, as Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich declared June 29. That law has been blocked since 1973, but Brnovich has vowed to go to court to remove that injunction.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Supporters of initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana and scale back casino gambling submitted thousands of signatures Friday in the hopes of getting their proposals on the Arkansas ballot. Friday was the deadline for groups to turn in the signatures needed to qualify for the November election. Proposed constitutional amendments need at least 89,151 valid signatures from registered voters. The proposal’s ballot title and popular name will also need to be approved by the state Board of Election Commissioners. More than 192,000 signatures were submitted for the recreational marijuana proposal to allow people age 21 and older to possess up to 1 ounce of cannabis. Arkansas voters in 2016 voted to legalize medical marijuana in the state. More than 103,000 signatures were submitted for the other proposed amendment to repeal part of a casino gambling amendment voters approved in 2018. The proposal would remove Pope County as one of the counties where a casino is allowed. Casinos have already been set up in the three other counties spelled out in the 2018 measure. State officials will check the petitions to determine whether enough valid signatures were submitted or if the groups qualify for an additional 30 days to collect signatures.\n\nCalifornia\n\nYosemite National Park: A wildfire threatening the largest grove of giant sequoias in Yosemite National Park more than doubled in size in a day, and firefighters were working in difficult terrain Sunday to protect the iconic trees and a small mountain town. Campers and residents near the blaze were evacuated, but the rest of the sprawling park in California remained open, though heavy smoke obscured scenic vistas and created unhealthy air quality. “Today it’s actually the smokiest that we’ve seen,” Nancy Phillipe, a Yosemite fire information spokesperson, said Sunday. “Up until this morning, the park has not been in that unhealthy category, but that is where we are now.” More than 500 mature sequoias were threatened in the famed Mariposa Grove, but there were no reports of severe damage to any named trees, including the 3,000-year-old Grizzly Giant. A sprinkler system set up within the grove kept the tree trunks moist, and officials were hopeful that the steady spray of water along with previous prescribed burns would be enough to keep flames at bay, Phillipe said. The cause of the Washburn Fire was under investigation. It had grown to nearly 2.5 square miles by Sunday morning, with no containment. Beyond the trees, the community of Wawona, which is surrounded by parkland, was under threat, with people ordered to leave late Friday.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis barred state agencies Wednesday from arresting or extraditing anyone seeking or providing reproductive care in Colorado, where the right to abortion was codified in state law this year. Polis issued an executive order that prohibits state agencies from cooperating with out-of-state civil or criminal investigations related to seeking, obtaining or providing reproductive health care – unless the alleged activity would be illegal in Colorado. The Democratic governor also ordered the Department of Regulatory Agencies to develop rules designed to protect licensed professional workers who could face disciplinary action or the loss of a professional license due to potential sanctions imposed by another state. Polis’ order comes as other liberal governors vow to fight out-of-state law enforcement actions following the Supreme Court’s June decision to revoke the constitutional right to abortion. Polis also directed state agencies to work to “protect people and entities who are providing, assisting, seeking, or obtaining reproductive health care in Colorado.” Colorado was the first U.S. state to decriminalize abortion in 1967, and Polis this year signed into law a bill codifying that right.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: The family of a Black man paralyzed when a police van without seat belts braked suddenly asked federal authorities Friday to file civil rights charges against the officers involved. The driver was taking Randy Cox, 36, to a police station in New Haven on June 19 for processing on a weapons charge when he braked hard to avoid a collision, police said, causing Cox to fly headfirst into the wall of the van. His family said he remains paralyzed from the chest down. Cox’s mother, two sisters and civil rights attorney Ben Crump spoke before meeting with U.S. Department of Justice officials in New Haven on Friday, arguing that Cox’s constitutional rights were violated. “You ask yourself, was it cruel and unusual punishment to put him in the back of that police transportation van with no seat belt, knowing that if you’re speeding, if you slam on the brakes, that somebody is going to be seriously injured?” Crump said. Cox’s supporters say the police mocked his cries for help and accused him of being drunk. Video shows the officers dragged him by his feet from the van and placed him in a holding cell at the police department before paramedics finally took him to a hospital. Cox remains hospitalized and unable to speak because of his breathing tube. Hundreds of protesters led by Crump, members of Cox’s family and the local NAACP staged a march Friday evening in New Haven to the city’s police headquarters.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A man convicted earlier this year of a felony hate crime for what authorities say was the persistent harassment of a Black female employee in Gov. John Carney’s office has been sentenced to four months in prison. Matthew Gregg will also be required to complete community service, anger management, and mental health and substance abuse counseling. The 27-year-old Hockessin man was arrested Dec. 10, 2020, on charges of harassment and terroristic threatening. According to court documents, Gregg called the receptionist in Carney’s office 160 times between Nov. 20 and Dec. 10, 2020. In those calls, Gregg targeted the woman with racist and sexist slurs, according to court documents. Gregg also threatened to kill the receptionist and throw a brick at the governor’s head, according to the Department of Justice’s sentencing memorandum. Deputy Attorney General Nicole Mozee wrote that Gregg was upset about COVID-19 mandates Carney put in place but that none of his calls to the governor’s secretary actually protested those mandates. The Department of Justice argued that not sentencing Gregg to time in prison would unduly depreciate “the severity of the offense.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that $2 million will be invested in order to improve the quality of school breakfast in D.C., WUSA-TV reports. Additionally, there will be an expansion of schools participating in the school breakfast program with 104 public and public charter schools across the district, according to a press release. State Superintendent Christina Grant said not every eligible food-insecure student participates in the program. “We are excited to support schools in increasing student participation in the school breakfast program, leading to increases in health and academic outcomes,” Grant said. Nearly 18 local education agencies that serve students from pre-K through 12th grade and have a population where at least 75% have eligibility for free or reduced-price meals were awarded school breakfast grant funds from the Office of the State Superintendent of Education. “With this investment, we can support more families, get more students connected to the student breakfast program and build healthier classrooms and communities,” Bowser said.\n\nFlorida\n\nBig Pine Key: They weren’t in a “Yellow Submarine,” but hundreds of people spent time below the waves Saturday for a music festival off the Florida Keys. The Beatles hit and other ocean-themed songs like the theme to “The Little Mermaid” were part of the entertainment during the Lower Keys Underwater Music Festival. The divers and snorkelers, many dressed as mermaids and sea creatures, enjoyed music played through waterproof speakers dangling from boats floating above the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The festival took place at Looe Key Reef, about 6 miles from Big Pine Key. The event at the continental United States’ only living coral barrier reef raised awareness on how divers can protect the reef by not touching corals or leaving litter underwater, using mooring buoys instead of anchoring when boating, respecting dive flags, and other ways of minimizing environmental impacts. Participants swam among marine life and coral formations and described the music as ethereal, a bit muted, but emanating from all directions.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state could have more than $5 billion in surplus revenue after the just-concluded budget year, following another big month for tax collections in June. The state Revenue Department announced Friday that it collected more than $33 billion in taxes in the year ended June 30, up 23% from about $27 billion the year before. Georgia planned to spend more than $54 billion in the just-ended budget year, including federal money, lottery proceeds, and other fees and taxes that state agencies collect. Lawmakers boosted that number by $4.5 billion during a midyear budget revision that included bonus payments and pay raises for state employees and teachers but will still substantially undershoot total revenue for the year. Final numbers won’t be clear until the state closes it books on the budget year, which usually happens around Labor Day. The bulging bank account could allow the state to further cut taxes or expand services. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has already extended a temporary waiver on gas taxes through the middle of August, and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has been calling on Kemp to extend the gas tax holiday through the end of the year. Kemp can make that move as long as lawmakers later ratify it.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The governor ordered the U.S. and state flags to be flown at half-staff to honor former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, calling the assassinated ex-leader a friend of the islands. Because flags were already at half-staff honoring victims of an Independence Day parade shooting near Chicago, Hawaii Gov. David Ige said the flags would be lowered in Abe’s memory from sunrise to sunset Sunday. Abe, 67, was assassinated on a street in western Japan by a gunman who opened fire on him from behind as he delivered a campaign speech – an attack in a nation with some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere. Police at the shooting scene arrested Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, a former member of Japan’s navy, on suspicion of murder. “This senseless act of violence has taken the life of a true friend of Hawaii,” Ige said in a statement. “In our multiple meetings, we shared stories of our past, embraced our common culture, and continued the quest for reconciliation and partnership that has developed between the United States and Japan.” Ige’s flag order applies to the Hawaii State Capitol, state offices and agencies, and the Hawaii National Guard.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A site targeted with antisemitic vandalism last month is now slated to get a mural supporting human rights. Boise Parks and Recreation Director said the city’s Department of Arts & History would be tasked with handling the mural in a tunnel next to the Idaho Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial, the Idaho Press reports. The graffiti left on the site in December was part of a string of antisemitic incidents in the city in recent years, according to the newspaper.\n\nIllinois\n\nWheaton: A former suburban Chicago man sought for 22 years after fleeing the country to avoid trial on a charge of concealing a homicide has been captured and returned to DuPage County, prosecutors said Friday. Romulo Mendoza, 46, was arrested last month trying to reenter the U.S. on the southern border, the DuPage County State’s Attorney’s Office said without specifying the location. He appeared Thursday before a judge, who set his bond at $1 million. On Feb. 4, 2000, Mendoza and two roommates, Carmelino Gomez and Pedro Garcia, were allegedly drinking alcohol in their Bensenville home and began arguing over an electricity bill. Gomez grabbed Garcia from behind and put his arm around his neck, killing him, authorities said at the time. Gomez and Mendoza allegedly then loaded the body in a car and dumped it at a rural location, where a passerby discovered it the next day. The two were arrested two days later. After posting $2,000 bond on May 31, 2000, Mendoza failed to appear for his next court date. Gomez pleaded guilty in September 2000 to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A federal judge has allowed an Indiana law largely banning a second-trimester abortion procedure to take effect following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Judge Sarah Evans Barker’s order signed Thursday lifted the injunction she issued in 2019 blocking the state law against the dilation and evacuation abortions. The law took effect immediately, according to the state attorney general’s office, and is the first tightening of Indiana’s anti-abortion laws since the Supreme Court decision. Indiana could have more sweeping abortion restrictions by next month, as the Republican-dominated Legislature is scheduled to begin a special legislative session on July 25. Barker granted a request from the Indiana attorney general’s office to lift her order, writing that the Supreme Court’s decision in June overturning the 1973 landmark ruling that made abortion legal nationwide removed the “linchpin holdings” for her analysis. The Republican-backed legislation prohibits doctors from performing what it calls “dismemberment abortion” except to prevent serious health risk or save the woman’s life. A doctor violating the law could face a felony charge, punishable by up to six years in prison.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two police officers are taking the unusual move of suing six people who participated in a 2020 protest in Des Moines after the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, accusing them of assault. All six people were arrested during the July 1, 2020, protest, and five already pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts of assault on a police officer and/or interference with official acts. One of them, Indira Sheumaker, was later elected to the Des Moines City Council. The lawsuit, first reported by Axios Des Moines, was filed by Peter Wilson and Jeffrey George as individuals and not as representatives of the Des Moines Police Department. They are seeking an unspecified amount for actual and punitive damages. It will likely be met with skepticism by the court, said Robert Bloom, a professor at Boston College Law School, who noted that the claims of assault and battery appear to be applying criminal complaints to a civil action. Experts also note that Iowa is among several states that have adopted what’s known as the “fireman’s rule,” which holds that firefighting and policing are inherently dangerous jobs and generally bars emergency responders from suing or collecting damages for injuries that occur in the course of their duties.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A gubernatorial drought declaration covers the entire state, and for the first time, the 2022 annual Kansas Water Authority report acknowledged the role of climate change while recommending mitigation and adaptation strategies. Internationally, climate scientists warn of a “code red for humanity.” As farmers harvest a drought-ravaged wheat crop after a heat wave killed cattle, discussion of what governments can do to help remain divided over the role of climate change. Bipartisan support exists for adapting to persistent droughts, water shortages and wildfires, but there is less appetite to make mitigating climate change central to the government response. In Topeka, the Legislature authorized a special water committee to meet in the coming months. The move comes after an overhaul of the state government’s approach to water issues was watered down. The Kansas wheat harvest is more than halfway done, USDA reports show, putting it ahead of schedule. Wheat farmers expect a largely drought-induced drop in yield of 100 million bushels, equating to more than $1 billion in lost production. An abnormally dry winter and spring meant much of the state’s what crop did not get the precipitation it needed. More recent rains in May and June came too late for most fields to make a difference.\n\nKentucky\n\nBarbourville: A school district has banned middle and high school students from using backpacks, saying the move is meant to address safety concerns. The Lexington Herald-Leader reports that Knox County Schools will implement the policy when students return to school in August. School spokesperson Frank Shelton says the policy will prevent students from using a bag to conceal items. “That is one less method that a student has to bring something into the building,” Shelton said. “With school safety on the minds of many due to recent school and public gathering shootings, we hope that our students and families see this as one more measure we are taking to protect students.” The policy will not apply to elementary school students.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state can now enforce its ban on almost all abortions under a judge’s order issued Friday amid a flurry of court challenges to state “trigger” laws crafted to take effect when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The decision came the same day President Joe Biden issued an executive order to protect access to abortion in states where it is still legal and mitigate the potential penalties women seeking the procedure may face after the high court’s ruling June 24. Days after the Supreme Court decision, Louisiana District Judge Robin Giarrusso issued a temporary restraining order banning enforcement of the state legislation in response to a lawsuit filed by a north Louisiana abortion clinic and others. State District Judge Ethel Julien said Friday that she did not have the authority to extend the restraining order because she had concluded the suit should not have been filed in her court. She said the suit’s claims that provisions in the law are unconstitutionally vague and inconsistent are matters involving legislation and therefore should be heard in state court in the capital, Baton Rouge. The ruling was a victory for Attorney General Jeff Landry and lawyers for the state, who argued that the lawsuit had been improperly filed in New Orleans.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The federal government hasn’t done enough to protect a rare species of whale from lethal entanglement in lobster fishing gear, and new rules are needed to protect the species from extinction, a judge has ruled. The government has violated both the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act by failing to protect the North Atlantic right whale, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled Friday. The whales number less than 340 in the world and have been declining rapidly in population in recent years. Boasberg’s ruling was a victory for conservation groups that have long sought to save the whale and a new challenge for lobster fishermen who have fought back against tightening restrictions on where and how they can fish. Boasberg ruled that the court’s findings “do not dictate that it must immediately shutter the American lobster fishery” but instead said the parties must propose potential remedies to the threat faced by whales. The ruling “may seem a severe result for the lobster industry” and the government, but no one “operates free from the strict requirements imposed by the MMPA and ESA,” Boasberg wrote. Environmental groups celebrated the ruling, while some members of the fishing industry took a more measured approach.\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: The U.S. Army says it is making progress in the long-running effort to address groundwater contamination at part of Fort Detrick that was used as a test site for the Army’s biological warfare program. The Army has been studying the groundwater problems on and around the “Area B” portion of the Maryland base for over a decade. Joseph Gortva, chief of Fort Detrick’s Environmental Management Division, recently told the Frederick News-Post he is “cautiously optimistic” the Army will complete field work at the site within the next two years. It will likely take another year or two beyond that for officials to finish a report summarizing what they’ve learned, the newspaper reports. Then the Army would move to the “feasibility study” phase of the cleanup. That would involve evaluating potential methods of addressing the contamination. The cleanup process for the site’s groundwater has been in the “remedial investigation” phase since 2010, the newspaper reports. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated the Area B groundwater as a Superfund site. Most drinking water wells near Fort Detrick have been closed, according to the newspaper.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNantucket: A fire ripped through a historic landmark on Nantucket on Saturday morning, leaving the centuries-old structure heavily damaged. Firefighters battled the blaze that tore through the Veranda House inn, which dates back to the late 17th century. The inn is located in downtown Nantucket. Multiple firefighters from around the Cape Cod area headed to the island to help battle the flames, the Yarmouth Fire Department said on Facebook. Firefighters were still working to suppress the fire as of noon Saturday, Nantucket police tweeted. People were urged to avoid the area. Massachusetts State Police sent troopers to assist Nantucket authorities with the investigation, David Procopio, a state police spokesperson, told The Boston Globe. Photos and videos posted online showed smoke billowing into the sky above the downtown area. About 185 customers were without power because of the fire at about 8:45 a.m., according to National Grid. All but seven had their power restored by 11 a.m. The inn, which was built in the late 1600s, boasts 18 rooms and suites, according to its website.\n\nMichigan\n\nSturgis: Production of baby formula has resumed at the Abbott Nutrition factory whose February shutdown over contamination contributed to a national shortage, a company spokesman said. Damage from severe thunderstorms including flooding had forced the Sturgis plant to halt operations in mid-June, just two weeks after restarting production with additional sanitizing and safety protocols. Production of EleCare, a specialty formula for infants with severe food allergies and digestive problems, was restored at Sturgis following a July 1 reboot, said Abbott spokesman John Koval. “We are working to restart Similac production as soon as we can. We’ll provide more information when we have it,” he said via email. Abbott recalled several leading brands of formula in February, including Similac. That squeezed supplies already been strained by supply chain disruptions and stockpiling during COVID-19 shutdowns. The shortage was most dire for children with allergies, digestive problems and metabolic disorders who rely on specialty formulas. President Joe Biden’s administration has since eased import rules for foreign manufacturers, airlifted formula from Europe and invoked federal emergency rules to prioritize U.S. production.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: A program that allows people to cross into remote areas of Canada without reporting to border officials is expected to resume in the coming days. The Canada Border Services Agency told Minnesota Public Radio News that it has notified stakeholders that the program will restart soon and that the reopening date will be posted on its website once it has been confirmed. Resuming the program that was suspended in May 2020 as COVID-19 took hold will provide an economic boost to resorts and businesses in northern Minnesota, including those that offer canoe trips into Quetico Provincial Park. The park’s website said that the program was set to resume Friday and that the Canadian border agency would begin to accept applications in the coming weeks. The suspension of the remote permits for more than two years has had “a huge impact on us and the Boundary Waters,” said Mike Prom, co-owner of Voyageur Canoe Outfitters at the end of the Gunflint Trail. It will likely be a few weeks before canoeists begin crossing the border into Quetico, Prom said, since it typically takes about three weeks to receive the permits in the mail. He said travelers may also be able to drive to the border to get permits.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A man has been indicted on a murder charge a year after a former legislator was shot to death while she was doing yard work in a rural area where her sister-in-law had died. Republican former state Rep. Ashley Henley, 40, was killed in June 2021 outside the burned-out mobile home where her sister-in-law, Kristina Michelle Jones, was found dead in December 2020. Henley and other relatives contended Yalobusha County authorities were doing too little to examine possible criminal charges in Jones’ death. Relatives erected a homemade sign at the site with photos of Jones under the phrase “I was murdered.” Yalobusha County coroner Ronnie Stark said Henley had been mowing grass at the home site before she was killed. A man who had lived near Jones, Billy Lamar Brooks, was indicted in February on a charge of maliciously setting fire to the home of Jones and Terry Henley. Court records show that on June 30, a grand jury filed a new indictment against Brooks to add a murder charge in the death of Ashley Henley. The Associated Press reached Brooks’ attorney, Bradley Peeples, by phone Saturday, and he declined to comment on the case. Court records show Brooks made a court appearance Thursday, and Circuit Judge Smith Murphey set his bond at $250,000.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The city’s Board of Aldermen has given initial approval to creating a $1 million fund to help St. Louis women get abortions in other states in the wake of a near-total state abortion ban that went into effect June 24. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the measure passed Friday would allocate federal American Rescue Plan Act funds for transportation, child care and other logistical help for women who travel to states where abortion remains legal. A vote on final passage is set for this week. Alderman Joe Vaccaro opposed the plan and called it a political stunt that will tie up some of the city’s pandemic aid funds in a lengthy court fight. Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt already has said he will sue to try to block the measure and one proposed in Kansas City to use city employee health insurance to help with employee travel for out-of-state abortions. Schmitt, who is seeking the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Roy Blunt, said the St. Louis ordinance would violate a state law barring public money from being used to perform or assist an abortion not needed to save the life of the mother. Supporters say the money would only be used to provide access to abortion.\n\nMontana\n\nYellowstone National Park: It could take three to five years to replace roads damaged by flooding last month in Yellowstone National Park, but temporary fixes are expected to be in place within months, park Superintendent Cam Sholly said Friday. Sholly spoke after surveying damaged areas of the nation’s first national park with U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland. The flooding prompted the evacuation of more than 10,000 people from the park and prompted its temporary closure. Parts of Yellowstone and two of its five entrances remain closed. Haaland also met with Gov. Greg Gianforte to tour flood damage in Gardiner, Montana. The town is a gateway to Yellowstone and dependent on its tourism but was cut off when the road into the park washed out in flooding that began June 12. A temporary road from Gardiner to the park headquarters in Mammoth Hot Springs has been built for essential travel and some guided tours. It potentially could be opened to visitors before winter, park officials said. A similar temporary fix is planned for washed out roadway at the park’s northeast gate near Cooke City, Montana. Federal officials have offered $50 million in emergency funding for the work.\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: Republicans fired their longtime party chairman at a tumultuous state convention that highlighted divisions within the party driven by activists who support ex-President Donald Trump and want to take the party further to the right. After convention delegates voted to remove Chairman Dan Welch on Saturday, most of the other state party leaders resigned, including Executive Director Taylor Gage, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Republicans were sharply divided during this spring’s gubernatorial primary battle between two conservative candidates: the eventual winner, Jim Pillen, and businessman Charles Herbster, who was endorsed by Trump. The race to replace Gov. Pete Ricketts, who couldn’t run because of term limits, became more controversial after eight young women accused Herbster of groping them. Herbster denied the allegations, describing them as a politically motivated attack. He filed a defamation lawsuit against one of his accusers, state Sen. Julie Slama, who responded with a lawsuit of her own accusing Herbster of sexual battery. Herbster has refused to endorse Pillen, who is still expected to win in November over Democratic state Sen. Carol Blood because the state strongly favors Republicans.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: A couple was found secretly keeping a cache of weapons and living with their two kids at a children’s museum where they worked, authorities said. A janitor at the Children’s Museum of Northern Nevada was arrested late last week, KRNV-TV in Reno reports. The 41-year-old man has been charged with child neglect and endangerment and possession of a suppressor and a short-barrel rifle. Authorities discovered the arsenal in a storage room, they said. A police report listed an AK-47 rifle, three handguns, a pistol, ammunition, knives and a Taser that could have been reached by a child. The stash also included drug paraphernalia like a bong and a used marijuana joint. Officials realized the family was living in the museum after the man’s 2-year-old child was spotted walking nearby unsupervised, the Carson City Sheriff’s Office said. It was not the first time police interacted with the man over his child being left alone. But this time, the toddler’s older sister gave deputies the museum as their address. Authorities, along with a museum board member, then walked through the property and saw signs people had been living there. Sleeping bags, mattresses, clothes and food were among the items found in areas off-limits to visitors, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: Joseph Raymond Goulet, a veteran who landed on Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, on D-Day, has died. The New Hampshire resident died July 4. He was 99. Born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, to parents who emigrated from Canada, Goulet voluntarily enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II, according to an obituary. His math and organizational skills led him to the Army Service Forces – now the Army Quartermaster Corps. When Army officials realized that Goulet spoke and read French fluently, he was sent to the Army’s 1st Infantry Division to use those language skills to connect with local French leaders and help open routes to the Army’s objectives inland following the invasion. On June 6, 1944, he landed with the first wave of the 1st Infantry Division at Omaha Beach but never ended up having to use his French language skills. During the rapid advance toward Germany, Goulet drove trucks loaded with fuel, ammunition and other needed supplies to the advancing front lines. He became part of what became known as the “Red-Ball Express,” which ran truck convoys nonstop regardless of the enemy, the weather or other obstacles. After the war, he worked at several jobs in the electrical supply industry before retiring and relocating permanently to New Hampshire.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The New Jersey Economic Developmental Authority announced Friday that it will allocate $17.5million in grants to 30 nonprofits across the state to support restaurants and families through the latest phase of its Sustain and Serve NJ program. The program, launched in December 2020, offers grant funding to nonprofit organizations who purchase meals from New Jersey restaurants that have struggled during the COVID-19 pandemic. The organizations then distribute these meals at no cost to those in need to help address food insecurity across the state. The program has allocated $52.5 million over three phases to eligible organizations that have purchased more than 3.5 million meals from more than 400 restaurants from every county in New Jersey, according to the press release. Gov. Phil Murphy allocated $10 million from the federal American Rescue Plan and about $7.5 million from the state to fund Phase 3 of the program. To be eligible for the Phase 3 grant, applicants must be a 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(19) nonprofit organization that demonstrates the capacity to purchase at least 1,500 meals meals in bulk costing at least $25,000 from New Jersey restaurants. They also must demonstrate increased costs during the pandemic, among other criteria to be eligible for the funding.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nFarmington: Months after the withdrawal of legislation that proposed the Navajo Nation recognize marriage equality through repealing and amending tribal laws, a new bill is bringing back that recommendation. The legislation seeks to end the ban on same-sex marriage under the Diné Marriage Act and repeal the section of the Navajo Nation Council resolution from 2005 that forbids couples of the same gender from marrying on tribal land or having their marriage recognized. The bill also proposes to amend other provisions in tribal law to conform with the repeal, including those that address spousal rights to property and employee benefits under the tribal government. Delegate Eugene Tso recently introduced the legislation. It is now eligible for consideration by four standing committees, then the Navajo Nation Council. Tso sponsored the previous bill but abruptly withdrew his sponsorship in April, citing the need to retool the legislation amid mixed reaction from delegates and the public. In an interview July 1, Tso said he wants the bill to go to the council at the summer session.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo improperly used state resources for a book he received $5.1 million to write, according to a report by a law firm. New York’s soon-to-be-disbanded ethics commission, the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, voted Thursday to make the report public. It had sought the investigation by the law firm to learn more about how the book deal was approved and the role played by the commission itself. The report says the ethics commission failed to assert itself as a watchdog agency against the governor and should have asked for more information from Cuomo’s office. Cuomo had already written 70,000 words of what was expected to be an 80,000-word book before he submitted a request seeking approval by the Joint Commission on Public Ethics for the book in 2020. That meant Cuomo wrote and publicized the book at a time when it interfered with his responsibilities as a governor leading the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the report said. In December, the commission ordered Cuomo to turn over money from his book, “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic.” Cuomo has filed a lawsuit accusing the commission of violating his rights and showing bias against him.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court will accelerate appeals over the constitutionality of a law that gave adults with child sexual abuse claims another two years to seek civil damages. A majority of justices agreed last week to hear the case of three former Gaston County student-athletes who are suing a coach who was convicted of crimes against team members, as well as the county school board, rather than let the intermediate-level Court of Appeals rule first. A divided panel of three trial judges dismissed the lawsuit last December, ruling unconstitutional a portion of the law that revived for two years only – 2020 and 2021 – the ability of someone otherwise too late to sue for child sexual abuse claims. Before the 2019 law called the SAFE Act, such abuse victims effectively had until age 21 to file such a lawsuit. The plaintiffs appealed. In a 4-3 decision announced Tuesday, the Supreme Court decided the case should bypass the Court of Appeals. The court’s registered Democrats composed the majority. Chief Justice Paul Newby, writing a dissent for the three Republican justices, said they would have allowed Court of Appeals review first and lamented that multiple bypass motions have been allowed by the court over the past few months in other cases.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Dozens of teachers from around the state got a cultural education from American Indian tribes last week. More than 250 educators attended the North Dakota Indian Education Summit on Thursday and Friday at the Capitol in Bismarck, where they participated in breakout sessions and took in cultural presentations, such as Native American dancing in traditional regalia. Some of the breakout sessions included teaching Indigenous culture successfully in today’s schools and implementing Native American topics into schools’ curriculum. “I think it’s important that we learn about the diversity of our students and have a better understanding of where they’re coming from and gain the knowledge they have so much to give back to us as educators,” said teacher Tami Hauglie. One of the summit’s objectives is to unify the education system in North Dakota to bring different cultures together, organizers said. Courtney Davis Souvannasacd, an outreach coordinator with the National Resource Center on Native American Aging at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks, told KFYR-TV it wasn’t until later in her life that she was exposed to cultural ceremonies. “And so I still I have a lot to learn,” she said. “And I’m just happy that my children are able to experience that new environment that is open, welcoming, and inclusive of that where I try to chip away at obstacles or barriers that might be in the way, and it’s not always easy.”\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A former Cincinnati City Council member was convicted Friday of federal charges of bribery and attempted extortion but was acquitted on four other counts. Democrat P.G. Sittenfeld, 37, had maintained his innocence against allegations that he agreed to accept $40,000 in payments to his political action committee to “deliver the votes” in the City Council for a proposed downtown real estate development. He had been considered a top contender to run for mayor before he was indicted in November 2020. “We’re obviously very disappointed; that’s about all I can say right now,” Charlie Rittgers, Sittenfeld’s attorney, said as he left the courthouse. “P.G., well he’s crushed. He’s crushed.” It’s not yet known if Sittenfeld will appeal the verdict or what type of sentence he’s facing. The jury got the case Wednesday afternoon and deliberated more than 12 hours over three days before reaching its mixed verdict. Sittenfeld was found guilty of single counts of bribery and attempted extortion but was acquitted of two counts of honest services wire fraud and single counts of attempted bribery and extortion. Sittenfeld dipped his head and slumped forward in his seat after hearing the verdict, while his wife and at least one other woman in the packed courtroom started to cry.\n\nOklahoma\n\nAnadarko: Native American tribal elders who were once students at federal Indian boarding schools testified Saturday about the hardships they endured, including beatings, whippings, sexual assaults, forced haircuts and painful nicknames. “I still feel that pain,” said 84-year-old Donald Neconie, a former U.S. Marine and member of the Kiowa Tribe who once attended the Riverside Indian School in Anadarko, about 80 miles southwest of Oklahoma City. “I will never, ever forgive this school for what they did to me. It may be good now. But it wasn’t back then.” As the elders spoke, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, herself a Laguna Pueblo from New Mexico and the first Native American Cabinet secretary in U.S. history, listened quietly. The event at the Riverside Indian School, which still operates today but with a vastly different mission, was the first stop on a yearlong nationwide tour to hear about the painful experiences of Native Americans who were sent to the government-backed boarding schools. Although most closed their doors long ago, and none still exist to strip students of their identities, some still function as schools, albeit with drastically different missions that celebrate the cultural backgrounds of their Native students. Among them is Riverside, one of oldest, which opened in 1871.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Backers of a proposed initiative that would require people to secure permits to buy firearms say concern about recent mass shootings have buoyed their effort, and they have enough signatures to place it on the November ballot. The Rev. Mark Knutson, a chief petitioner of the initiative, delivered signatures Friday afternoon to the Oregon secretary of state’s office in Salem, accompanied by students and other volunteers. Election officials, who work under Secretary of State Shemia Fagan, will verify that the signatures are from registered voters. Proponents of the measure say they’ve seen surging interest in the possible November ballot question following recent mass shootings, and they hope the move to put the gun issue before voters catches fire in other states. “Let’s go across the nation and go from grief and despair and mourning,” Knutson said. “We just need to take action. If people are afraid, if neighbors are being shot, if our children are in fear – if we don’t take action, what are we doing?” The initiative supporters needed to deliver at least 112,080 registered voters’ signatures by the Friday deadline to get on the ballot, Knutson said. Proponents say they delivered 161,545 signatures. It would ban large-capacity magazines over 10 rounds – except for current owners, law enforcement and the military – and require a permit to purchase any gun. The state police would create a firearms database.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday rejected three bills passed by the Republican-majority Legislature, vetoing measures regarding transgender athletes in school sports and poll watchers. He also struck down the Human Services Code, blowing a hole in the state budget as lawmakers were trying to finish the annual flurry of votes that accompany the annual spending plan. Wolf had previously warned he would strike down the bill to prohibit transgender athletes from playing sports that align with their gender identity. In his veto message, he said the bill would have “a devastating impact on a vulnerable population already at greater risk of bullying and depression.” He also vetoed a bill – sponsored by Franklin County Sen. Doug Mastriano, the GOP’s nominee for governor – to let all registered voters of Pennsylvania serve as poll watchers in any precinct in the state. “This bill does nothing to increase access to voting,” he wrote. “Instead, this bill undermines the integrity of our election process and encourages voter intimidation.” Wolf’s third veto was based on a provision in the Human Service Code that would have prohibited a state agency from contracting with a vendor of financial management services.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A national women’s rights organization is fighting back against the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of the Roe v. Wade abortion ruling through federal court in the state. The Elizabeth Cady Stanton Trust has filed a lawsuit asking the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island to recognize the Equal Rights Amendment as a valid and enforceable 28th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, thus affirming women’s equal rights under the law. “We hope that the little state of Rhode Island will make the biggest decision in the history of women’s rights. The timing has never been more urgent,” said Wendy Murphy, a longtime ERA strategist who works with the Elizabeth Cady Stanton Trust. The lawsuit is one of three the organization filed after the Supreme Court’s draft ruling overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked. The group, named for Stanton, a leading women’s rights activist in the 1800s, filed similar lawsuits in Michigan and New York, all with the aim of getting the courts to establish equal protection under the law regardless of sex. “The goal of the lawsuit is to get the Equal Rights Amendment in the Constitution,” said Murphy, a co-director of the Women’s and Children’s Advocacy Project at New England Law.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Pastor John Gray of Relentless Church was hospitalized Thursday night with a saddle pulmonary embolism, according an Instagram post by Gray’s wife, Aventer Gray. “My family and I stand in need of a miracle,” Aventer Gray wrote in her post. A saddle pulmonary embolism is a rare type of blockage of an artery in the lungs that can be life-threatening, according to the National Library of Medicine. “To place this in perspective,” Aventer Gray posted, “the doctor said that people have come into the hospital dead with this exact scenario (John) walked in with.” Along with the embolism, Aventer Gray wrote that more blood clots were also found in her husband’s lungs. She wrote that he will need to undergo two types of surgery due to the pressure on his heart. John Gray came to Greenville in 2018 from Houston, Texas, where he served as an associate pastor under megachurch leader Joel Osteen. Gray took over the Redemption Church congregation and buildings and rebranded the church as Relentless Church when Redemption pastor Ron Carpenter announced he was moving his ministry to California. The post sparked an outpouring of support from members of Gray’s congregation, other faith leaders and celebrities alike.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Skateboarders and their fans dropped into downtown Sioux Falls for the national skateboard festival Innoskate over the weekend. Innoskate, created in 2013 by USA Skateboarding and the Smithsonian’s Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation, celebrates the intersection of invention and creativity in skate culture, according to the Smithsonian. Crowdgoers were treated to panels during Saturday’s activities on Native American skateboarding culture on the Pine Ridge Reservation, what diversity and inclusion looks like in skateboarding, and discussions about skateboarding in the Olympics. There were also trick competitions and skateboard workshops. “Pine Ridge is literally the mecca of skateboarding,” said Kyle Mesteth, 36, who founded the Ground Control Skate Park on the reservation. “You could just travel within an hour and hit four skate parks.” Mesteth spoke about how important skateboarding has become on the reservation and how he has watched it grow since he started skateboarding in the mid-1990s. One of the first skateparks on the reservation, the Toby Eagle Bull Memorial Wounded Knee Skate Park, opened in 2011. “We see a very bright future for our skaters because of the skate park,” he said. “We see results because of it.”\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The city’s hospitality and tourism industry experienced a bounce-back last year, with the hotel occupancy rate and total visitors returning to near pre-pandemic figures, according to Memphis Tourism’s annual report. The nonprofit organization often touts 2019 as a record year for the local industry. Then in early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered that promising trajectory for hospitality and tourism due to restrictions that decreased national and international visitation. In addition to the usual tourist draws like Graceland and the National Civil Rights Museum, 2021 also saw the return of a scaled-back Memphis in May World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest. While COVID-19 restrictions remained in place for large parts of 2021, the availability of vaccines and loosening of local restrictions, along with other factors, saw the optimism from the end of 2019 return for those in hospitality and tourism. “Everybody saw the dramatic impact and how important the visitor economy is to a community,” Memphis Tourism CEO Kevin Kane said. “Everybody is really anxious to get that back as soon as they can.” More than 4.1 million hotel rooms were sold in Shelby County, or about 93% of the total hotel demand from 2019. Memphis outpaced the national average by about 5%.\n\nTexas\n\nUvalde: The mayor on Friday disputed a new report that alleges authorities missed chances to quickly end the massacre at an elementary school, again reflecting the lack of definitive answers about the slow law enforcement response to one of the deadliest classroom shootings in U.S. history. Mayor Don McLaughlin said that no Uvalde police officer saw the gunman outside Robb Elementary School before he went inside and that none of them had an opportunity to fire on the shooter. His comments contradict a critique of the decision-making by law enforcement that was released last week by tactical response experts at Texas State University. The differing accounts and public rebuke of the report reiterated how, more than six weeks after the May 24 shooting, questions remain about how and why police armed with rifles and bulletproof shields waited more than an hour before confronting the gunman in a fourth grade classroom where 21 people were killed, including 19 children. It also widened a rift between Uvalde officials and the state, particularly the Texas Department of Public Safety, which had troopers on the scene and has directed much of the blame to the local school district police chief.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The city, already a draw for outdoors enthusiasts, is opening a new trail this week, and officials say they expect it could help fight crime, too. The Temple Springs Trail, which will connect 700 East to Red Hills Parkway along the cliffside on the north end of the central part of the city, is set for an official opening Wednesday. The trail is open to pedestrians and cyclists and adds to the city’s growing network of multiuse trails. This particular trail was not initially in the city master plan but was later approved by the City Council after it was picked as a potential location, said Joe Nelson, the city’s parks and planning landscape architect. The project was brought to the city’s attention by the St. George Police Department, which had dealt with crime and homelessness in the area, Nelson said. “It was a kind of magnet for homeless camps and just kind of crime,” Nelson said. “It was a kind of a hot spot for that. The police had a really hard time getting into the site to surveil it, and so they were the ones that actually said, ‘Hey, we need to clean up this site and put a trail through it so we can have eyes on the site.’ ” A grand opening will be held at 9 a.m. Wednesday. Parking will be available east of the water tank in two parking lots, and biking is also encouraged.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A 21-year-old man died after he was shot in the head, police said Friday, as the city contends with an increase in gun violence in recent years. The shooting took place about 7:40 p.m. Thursday in the Old North End neighborhood. No suspects were in custody, but police said they believed that the parties knew each other and that the shooting was not random. Police identified the victim as Hussein Mubarak, of Burlington. After the shooting, police were told the suspect may have fled north into a wooded area. A search by police that included dogs and a drone was unsuccessful. In a statement, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said the shooting death was the first homicide in the city in more than two years. “Yet it is one of many recent gunfire incidents, part of a very disturbing trend that has dramatically increased since 2020,” Weinberger said. Last month, Weinberger, city police and the county prosecutor said reducing gunfire episodes in Vermont’s largest city was a top priority. At the time, city officials said there had been nearly 40 instances of gunfire in the city since the beginning of 2020. Previously, the city averaged about two a year.\n\nVirginia\n\nBristol: The state’s first casino has opened for business in a temporary space inside a former shopping mall. The Bristol Casino will be open 24/7, offering 870 slots, 21 tables and a sportsbook. A line of customers wrapped around the building as they waited for Friday’s grand opening, TV station WDBJ reports. “We had to come and save my sister from spending all her money,” Christiansburg resident Cheryl Hubbard told the station. “And spend all of his,” she joked, pointing to her husband. In 2020, the Virginia General Assembly approved legislation to allow developers to build large casino resorts in five cities – Norfolk, Bristol, Portsmouth, Danville and Richmond – in what supporters billed as a way to boost struggling economies. Potential operators had to first clear a voter referendum. That happened in every city but Richmond, which rejected the initiative last year. But city officials have mounted an effort to bring the issue back a second time. Bristol voters overwhelmingly approved their referendum, and the project got its license earlier this year. Developers eventually plan to open a $400 million resort and Hard Rock casino, with a hotel, restaurants, bars and lounges, and a concert venue. The full-scale project is expected to open in 2024 and employ 1,200 people.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state Commission on Judicial Conduct has admonished a King County District Court judge for implying in court that a defendant would be raped in prison if he didn’t change his behavior. The Seattle Times reports Judge Virginia Amato, who was elected in November 2018, presided over the arraignment of a man charged with misdemeanor domestic violence assault and resisting arrest last August, according to the stipulation, agreement and order of admonishment signed June 24 by the commission’s executive director, J. Reiko Callner. Before imposing conditions of release, Amato noted the man’s alleged crimes happened while he was on probation, the order says. The man had no felony convictions and could not be sent to prison for misdemeanors, yet Amato is quoted in the order as telling him he was setting himself up “to be Bubba’s new best girlfriend at the state penitentiary.” “That may hopefully give you a graphic image to think about … and if you think I’m kidding, I’m not,” she reportedly said. A confidential complaint was filed in October with the commission, which is responsible for reviewing and acting on complaints of judicial misconduct, and Amato was served with a statement of allegations in December, the order says.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Recovery Point West Virginia held its grand opening and ribbon-cutting ceremony Thursday for the Point Cafe, Huntington’s newest community resource center. The Point Cafe opened after a few years of planning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reginald Jones, Recovery Point’s executive director, said officials originally applied for a grant in 2019 from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to fund the cafe at a different location, but a “year of unavailability” led to the project coming to fruition later than expected. Now that the cafe is open, Jones said the location will be a safe space and a free, therapeutic environment for anyone seeking recovery to find resources, make connections and join support groups. The cafe will offer a variety of workshops and classes, including art and yoga. He said the cafe will also be a resource for the greater community of Huntington by holding cooking, financial literacy and computer courses; conducting barista training; and offering resume-building assistance, among other services. “The idea came to us as an organization, Recovery Point, from looking at what the needs are of the community and trying to find a niche to fill those gaps,” Jones said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A divided state Supreme Court ruled Friday that parents suing the Madison School District over its gender identity policies must disclose their names to opposing attorneys, but they don’t have to be revealed to the district or be made public. The 4-3 ruling comes after a Dane County Circuit Court judge in 2020 temporarily suspended portions of the district’s guidance on gender identity that a group of unnamed parents and a conservative law firm sued to overturn. The case centers on a policy the district adopted in 2018 that calls for district personnel to call students by their preferred names and pronouns but not to disclose students’ gender identities to anyone outside, including their parents. Some parents sued in 2020, alleging the policy violates their right to parent their children as they see fit and their right to religious freedom. The Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty and the Arizona-based Alliance Defending Freedom, both conservative law firms, are representing the parents. The firm’s attorneys asked Dane County Circuit Judge Frank Remington to allow them to proceed without revealing the parents’ names out of fear they would be subject to retaliation and harassment.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Energy companies bid more than $22 million to secure drilling rights on about 110 square miles of public lands in the West late last month, during the first onshore oil and natural gas lease sales since President Joe Biden took office. Leases on about 90 square miles went unsold in the U.S. Bureau Land Management online auctions that included parcels of federal lands in seven states. Oil and gas produced from the leases will be subject to a royalty rate of 18.75%. That’s up from 12.5% and the first royalty increase since the 1920s. Most of those sold were in Wyoming, where companies paid more than $13 million for parcels totaling about 105 square miles. The auctions came as federal officials try to balance efforts to fight climate change against pressure to bring down high gas prices. Critics of the leasing program pointed to unsold parcels in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana and Nevada as further evidence oil companies have enough leases and drilling permits already stockpiled to last them for years. But with several prior lease sales still tied up in court challenges from environmentalists, some companies had concerns going into the sale that they might not be able to drill on leases they acquired, said Ryan McConnaughey, vice president of the Petroleum Association of Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}]}

Delaware went undefeated en route to Colonial Athletic Association titles her junior and senior years, won the first NCAA Tournament game in its history in 2012 and reached the NCAA’s Sweet 16 in 2013.\n\nDelle Donne finished her career as the No. 5 scorer in NCAA Division I history with 3,039 career points, despite missing 22 games due to illness or injuries, and was the No. 2 choice in the 2013 WNBA draft.\n\nThe 2008 graduate of Wilmington’s Ursuline Academy, where she was consensus national player of the year as a senior, had decided to attend UD after first accepting a basketball scholarship to perennial NCAA powerhouse Connecticut. But Delle Donne stayed less than two days at UConn in June of 2008, first citing basketball burnout for her departure before later realizing detachment from home and family was at the root of her unhappiness.\n\nShe enrolled at Delaware later that summer and played volleyball as a UD freshman on a team that reached the NCAA Tournament. Delle Donne was a CAA All-Rookie team pick. She announced a return to basketball the following spring.\n\n“If somebody told me that in five years I would be the No. 2 draft pick going to the Chicago Sky to play my professional career I would have told you you were crazy,” Delle Donne said the night of the WNBA draft, reviewing her five years at Delaware. “When I left Connecticut I told myself that basketball’s not going to be in my future. It’s been such a growing experience for me.”\n\nNow 29, Delle Donne is in her sixth WNBA season and second with the Washington Mystics. Washington was down two games to zero in the best-of-five WNBA finals going into Wednesday’s Game Three in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nDelle Donne returned from a knee injury suffered during the Eastern Conference finals against Atlanta, missing just one game, to spark Washington to its first WNBA final. She had 17 points, her 13th straight game in double digits, in a 75-73 loss at Seattle Sunday.\n\n“We’re glad to be home,” she said Tuesday. “What better place to take care of business than at home ... They took care of home court. Now we’ve got to do the same.”\n\nOther UD Athletics Hall of Fame inductees:\n\nHerb Beck – Three-time All-American becomes just the second offensive lineman to be inducted, after 1999 enshrinee Conway Hayman.

Baylor, who had been serving as the DIAA’s sportsmanship committee chairman, is a Navy veteran who served 23 years in the Delaware State Police, was director of human resources and training at NKS Distributors, then became Delaware City police chief and then its town manager.

But Still will enter the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame with two master’s degrees, a national reputation as an advocate for cancer-stricken families and, most importantly, a healthy daughter.\n\nLeah Still was 4 when, in June 2014, she was diagnosed with stage 4 pediatric neuroblastoma, a cancer that kills roughly half of the children whose bodies it invades. Leah underwent surgery, chemotherapy, a stem cell transplant, radiation treatment and other therapy.\n\nLess than a year later, with Still frequently putting his NFL ambitions aside to remain at his daughter’s bedside, doctors said Leah was cancer-free, though treatment continued. Now 11, she remains in remission.\n\n“She’s six years cancer-free,” Still said by phone from Houston, where he lives with Leah, who is in the sixth grade; wife Asha; and younger daughter Aria.\n\nStill earned a master’s degree in business administration at the University of Houston after having played his final NFL season in 2016 with the Houston Texans. He has now completed a second master’s degree in applied positive psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n“The way I’m going to use my degrees,” he said, “is to help provide caretakers, institutions and communities with the tools to help children flourish. Children who are battling cancer are part of that community.”\n\nSPRING TAKEAWAYS: Defense comes out on top in Delaware Blue-White game\n\nBeing an advocate for families coping with cancer has been Still’s livelihood since Leah was stricken and will continue to be.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed, “There was no playbook,” Still said, using a football reference, for how a family was supposed to deal with such a difficult, multi-faceted challenge. He has made it his life’s work to help others through that challenging process.\n\nThat is done through his Still Strong Foundation, which raises funds to help families whose children are being treated for cancer. Still and Leah have also partnered with United Therapeutics to launch “Braving NeuroBLASToma,” which provides resources for those families.\n\n“Since we went public with Leah’s story,” Still said, “it’s been rewarding because I always wanted to give a purpose to our pain. To see the amount of families we’ve been able to impact just by sharing our story and then starting our foundation, and then making partnerships like we have with United Therapeutics, it’s been crazy.”\n\nStill, who grew up in Edgemoor, was a three-sport start at Howard. He was named the 2007 state Lineman of the Year in football, won two state indoor titles in the shot put and started for the Wildcats' basketball team.\n\nFAMILIAR TRANSFER: La Salle’s Ray joins friend on UD basketball team\n\n“One of the biggest takeaways from going to Howard was surrounding myself with amazing athletes,” said Still, adding that made him a more versatile athlete trying to keep up with them. “... I found lifelong friends during that time.’’\n\nHe never knew any former pro athletes to emulate, hatching his own ambitions “off of sheer willpower” and determination, he said.\n\nStill earned a football scholarship to Penn State and went on to be named a first-team All-American and Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year as a senior in 2011. He graduated with a degree in criminal law and justice.\n\nAfter being chosen in the second round of the 2012 NFL draft by the Bengals, Still was plagued by hamstring and other injuries in his NFL career.\n\nBeing with Leah through her medical battles kept him away from football, and the Bengals put him on the practice squad to start the 2014 season so he could continue to receive his pay while not having to be present for games. He was then elevated to the active roster and appeared in a career-high 12 games in 2014.\n\n“Of course, I wish this didn’t have to happen to Leah or my family,” Still said. “But it did so it was always trying to find the good, or recycle our pain in a way that could really make a difference.”\n\nSNOW DAY: Wilmington High great inducted to hall of fame\n\nLeah made it “out of the darkness” of cancer, Still said. Now helping others feel some rays of light are a daily goal.\n\n“I was just talking to a father not too long ago that an oncologist put me in contact with,\" Still said. \"Just being able to sit with him on Zoom for like an hour and be a sounding board, a safe space for him to be able to release some of the emotions he’s dealing with on how he can go about this journey with his daughter. If we didn’t go through it, I wouldn’t be able to provide that type of peace for families battling cancer.”\n\nStill and fellow inductees will be enshrined Thursday, May 12, during the 46th annual hall of fame banquet at the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. Social hour and a silent auction will begin at 5:30 p.m. and be followed by dinner and the ceremony at 6:45.\n\nTickets are $65 with tables of eight available for $490.

The deadline for reserving tickets is May 9.\n\nThe other 2022 inductees:\n\nJULIET BOTTORFF: The Tatnall School distance phenom was the state’s top cross-country runner from 2006-08 and was equally dominant on the track, setting nine state individual records while excelling at every distance from 800 to 3,200 meters and establishing a slew of state relay marks as well. That included anchoring Tatnall’s winning distance medley relay team in the Championship of America at the Penn Relays. Bottorff then went to Duke, where she was 2011 NCAA 10,000-meter outdoor champion and a two-time All-American at that distance as well as in the 5,000 and in cross country. Bottorff was two-time ACC champ in the 5,000. After college she was a top 10 finisher at several distances on the track and in road racing in U.S. championship events.\n\nKATELYN FALGOWSKI: Falgowski began playing for United States field hockey teams while attending St. Mark’s High, made her senior debut at age 17 in the 2006 World Cup and went on to become Delaware’s first and only three-time Summer Olympian, appearing in the 2008, 2012 and 2016 Games.

Falgowski also starred at the University of North Carolina, where she won two NCAA titles, set a still-standing school record for career assists (83), was a two-time first-team All-American and National Player of the Year as a senior in 201. Falgowski sparked the U.S. to a gold medal at the 2015 Pan American Games and a fifth-place finish at the 2016 Olympics.\n\nDAVE FREDERICK: Frederick was an all-conference football and basketball player at Bishop Egan in Philadelphia’s Catholic League and then played football at Temple University. He was hired as a teacher and coach in 1975 at Cape Henlopen High and guided the Vikings to Division II boys track and field outdoor state titles in 1976 and 1978, the school’s first cross country state championship in 1977 and indoor track state championships in 1984 and 1985. He was state indoor track coach of the year in 1984 and 1985. In 1982, Frederick began writing a weekly column at The Whale, a Sussex weekly, then moved to The Cape Gazette in 1993. His often-humorous musings about the people, places and events in around Lewes have been a staple for area readers and Frederick also authored an anthology of short stories “In A Class By Myself.”\n\nJOE HOLLOWAY: Three years after his induction to the Harness Racing Museum and Hall of Fame, Holloway now joins his home state sports hall. The 1974 Salesianum School and 1978 University of Delaware graduate was introduced to harness racing in his early teens by family friend Rev. Francis Tierney, a part-time driver at Brandywine Raceway, and worked as a groomsman. By age 16 he was racing trotters himself and went on to become one of the nation’s most successful drivers and trainers. Holloway was U.S. Harness Writers Association Trainer of the Year in 1995 and trained seven Breeder’s Crown winners from 1994 through 2015, including three-time winner Jenna’s Beach Boy, which set several world mile records. Among the many other big winners he trained were, most recently, 2016 Horse of the Year Always B Miki. Holloway joins his brother Jack, the former William Penn High wrestling coach, as an inductee.\n\nBOB KING: King won state cross country titles as a Howard junior and senior over 2.3-mile Rockford Park loops in 1957 and 1958, his 10:48 time in 1958 not surpassed by anyone else for more than a decade. He was also state 880 and low hurdles champion in track to spark Howard to three New Castle County and state championships. He then starred at Morgan State University, where he captained relay teams that prevailed at major meets throughout the northeast, including the Penn Relays and Millrose Games. King later returned to Howard as coach, guiding the Wildcats to boys and girls state titles before becoming an administrator and principal. The 3:14.2 his 1984 Wildcats ran at the Penn Relays remains the state 1,600-meter relay record. In 2001, King revived the dormant Wednesday night summer youth developmental track meets at Baynard Stadium that were later renamed in his honor.\n\nKHADIJAH RUSHDAN: The St. Elizabeth High graduate was the first Delaware high school athlete in any sport to be named first team All-State five times, doing so from 2003 through 2007. Rushdan was state Player of the Year three times and sparked the Vikings to the 2007 state championship as a senior. She averaged 11 points, three steals and a team-leading six assists for the U.S. gold medalists at the 2006 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship. Rushdan graduated with a state record 2,464 career points and was named a McDonald’s and Parade All-American. Rushdan then starred at Rutgers, where she was first-team All-Big East as senior, played in a school record 135 games and scored 1,288 points. Rushdan had a brief pro career before going into coaching.\n\nBOB SHILLINGLAW: Shillinglaw coached an NCAA record 654 lacrosse games while serving as University of Delaware coach for 37 seasons from 1979-2017 after a three-year stint at Massachusetts Maritime. Shillinglaw guided the Blue Hens to 15 conference titles and six NCAA Tournament berths, including the 2007 Final Four. His 310-303 record at Delaware makes him one of just two college coaches to win 300 games at one school. Shillinglaw was national Coach of the Year in 1979 and 2007 and conference Coach of the Year five times. He was also head coach for Team USA when it downed Canada in the inaugural World Cup of Lacrosse in 1999. Shillinglaw was also instrumental in lacrosse’s growth in the First State, which had just two boys high school teams when he arrived and this spring has 40. He established the Delaware Lacrosse Foundation Regional Chapter in 1980 and assisted with starting the Delaware Youth Lacrosse Association, serving as its president for 37 years and creating its Hall of Fame.\n\nGENE THOMPSON: Thompson was boys basketball coach at Wilmington High from 1976-77 through 1998-99, after which the school closed. He guided the Red Devils to the 1978, 1983 and 1988 state championships. His teams included seven first-team All-State players, five second-team picks and three state Player of the Year selections. Thompson also advocated tennis as a youth sports activity and received the U.S. Tennis Association’s National Community Service Award in 1998. Thompson was state Coach of the Year in basketball (1978), tennis (1978) and track and field (1994), when his Red Devils were Division II state champions. He returned to his native Virginia in 2005 to coach men’s tennis at Virginia State University and was also an assistant women’s basketball coach and served as interim men’s coach.\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

They are available by contacting Brian Strusowski at bstrusowski@verizon.net or 302-753-9052 by Nov. 11.\n\nThe 2022 inductees:\n\nJuliet Bottorff\n\nThe Tatnall School distance phenom was the state’s top athlete in cross country, indoor track and outdoor track as a senior in 2008-09, completing a career in which she set nine state individual records and excelled at every distance from 800 to 3,200 meters. Bottorff anchored Tatnall’s winning distance medley relay team in the Championship of America at the Penn Relays as a senior. She then went to Duke, where she was 2011 NCAA 10,000-meter outdoor champion and a two-time All-American at that distance as well as in the 5,000 and in cross country. Bottorff was two-time ACC champ in the indoor 5,000, setting an ACC record in 2013. She also was on the 2010 USA world junior cross-country team. After college, she had six top-10 finishes at USA championship races.\n\nCelina Emerson\n\nEmerson was All-State in the 200 and 400 meters and in all the sprint relays at Delcastle from 2007-10 and state MVP as a senior when she sparked the Cougars to indoor and outdoor state team titles. She set state records in the 400 and on 4 x 100 and 4 x 200 relay teams. Emerson was then a four-time All-American at Connecticut running the 400 and 4 x 400. She set a UConn school mark of 52.79 in the 400, was ECAC 400 champ outdoors in 52.86 and indoors in 53.39, won a Big East 400 in 53.17, the New England Championships in 54.40 and also took second in the American Athletic Conference meet in 52.80. She was also on 4 x 400 teams that won the AAC and set a 3:37.61 school record.\n\nJernail (Hayes) Radford\n\nThe Glasgow High speedster set state records in the 55-meter hurdles indoors and 100 and 300 hurdles outdoors while piling up 14 state championships. Radford was state MVP in 2005 and 2006. She then went to Seton Hall University and was an eight-time Big East champion, winning the 400 hurdles, 500 meters and 4 x 400 relays. She was also two-time NCAA All-American – in the open 400 and 400 hurdles -- and set the school mark in the 400 hurdles. Radford’s success continued as a professional, as she was 2014 world indoor champ and 2012 world indoor runner-up in the 4 x 400 relay.\n\nChristina Hillman\n\nHillman showed her prolific talents while attending St. Thomas More, winning three state titles in both the shot put and discus and 2011 New Balance Nationals indoor and Penn Relays and 2012 USA Junior Olympics shot-put titles. She set and still holds the national 17-18-year-old division and Junior Olympics record of 53-10. She was also second at the 2011 U-18 Junior Pan American Championships and fourth in the 2012 World Junior Championships. Hillman then went to Iowa State, where she was a seven-time All-American, highlighted by her 2014 indoor and outdoor NCAA championships in the shot put. She also won Big 12 indoor and outdoor shot-put titles in 2014 and won indoors again in 2016. At NCAAs, Hillman placed second and fourth (indoors) and fourth and sixth twice (outdoors). Her school records of 59-6 indoors and 58-2 outdoors still stand.\n\nJimmy Walsh\n\nWalsh has been a fixture on the First State running scene for more than 40 years, having run his first Boston Marathon – and seventh marathon overall -- as a 25-year-old in 1985. The 1978 Delcastle High grad later held the state-resident 5K road-race record in the 30-39 age class for 18 years. He has also been an influential coach, guiding Saint Elizabeth to 22 Catholic Youth Ministries cross country titles in the last 28 years. Walsh also served as president of the Delaware Sports Club, for which he long led weekly running sessions on the Tower Hill School track, and founded the annual Delaware Open Cross Country Championship, which will be held for the 38th year Nov. 26 at Brandywine Creek State Park.\n\nDelaware Sports Hall of Fame seeks 2023 inductee nominations\n\nThe Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame will hold its annual public nomination event for 2023 induction candidates Sunday, Nov. 13, at the New Castle Presbyterian Church’s Christian Education Building at 25 East 2nd Street in New Castle at 2 p.m. Those nominating a candidate have five minutes to speak and highlight the person’s accomplishments that make he or she worthy of induction.

That team, which was crowned CIAA, NAIA and NCAA champions in 1963, was inducted into the UMES Hall of Fame on Friday, Feb. 19, along with six other individual inductees.\n\nThe 1963 track team is just the second team to ever be inducted into the UMES Hall of Fame. Four of its members are deceased, but the five who are alive – Skinner, Russ Rogers, Richard Davis, Bob Brown and James Liggins – were able to attend the ceremony on Friday night.\n\nThose members will receive rings commemorating their accomplishments from that memorable season. In addition to their victories, the team netted 11 All-American honors. Throughout that season, they were covered and highlighted by the Baltimore Sun, the Washington Post, the Philadelphia Inquirer, the New York Times and Sports Illustrated.\n\n“Everybody respected us,” Skinner said. “We didn’t lose too many races.”\n\nUMES Athletics announces 2016 Hall of Fame Class\n\nAmong the other inductees, three of them had one thing in common. Thomas “Tee” Trotter, Jana Millin and Barnabas Togom were all at UMES at the same time for two years, in 2003 and 2004.\n\nTogom, a distance runner for the Hawks’ track and field and cross country teams, graduated from UMES in just two and a half years. He earned a degree in computer science and has taught at UMES and at public schools in Somerset County.\n\n“I was the last one to be kicked out of the library at night,” Togom said. “I would take my books with me and read on the bus and in the hotels during trips.”\n\nThe Kenyan native was named the Mid Eastern Athletic Conference’s most outstanding performer in 2004 and was named the UMES Mail Athlete of the Year in 2003.\n\nJoining Togom at UMES during that time was Milin, the first volleyball player to ever be inducted into the UMES Hall of Fame. She was an all-MEAC first team selection for three straight seasons from 2002 to 2004, led the NCAA in aces-per-game in 2004, was the MEAC Rookie of the Year and Player of the Year in 2002, MEAC Player of the Year in 2003 and holds UMES records for career kills and service aces.\n\nA famous story that those who watched Milin play like to tell is from a game when the Hawks faced Norfolk State. During that game, Milin had seven consecutive services aces where she served the ball to the same opposing player each time and knocked her down seven times in a row.\n\nMilin, a native of Croatia, was back at UMES for the first time in 10 years to receive her maroon jacket.\n\n\"Jana was hands-down the most competitive player that I have ever coached\" said Hawks volleyball coach Toby Rens. \"That was very entrenched in her. She was an absolute joy to coach and she made everybody around her better.\"\n\nThe third inductee who starred at UMES during that same time was Trotter, a point guard for the Hawks’ basketball team from 2000-2004. During his time at UMES, he scored 1,923 points, second all-time for the school and first since the Hawks started competing at the Division I level.\n\nTrotter was a prolific scorer and an exceptional free throw shooter. He was considered undersized at just 5-foot-11, but said his eyes used to “light up” when teams would put bigger guards on him.\n\nAfter long journey, Elliott's work pays off for Hawks\n\nComing out of high school, Trotter had originally signed his national letter of intent to play basketball at New Mexico State. But then his father, Thomas Trotter Sr., was hired as the head coach at UMES.\n\n“I was crying, I was mad,” Tee Trotter said. “But then my dad told me girls outnumbered boys here 18-1. I was on board then.”\n\nAnother famous former Hawk, Pat Doughty, was also at UMES during this time. Doughty was the master of ceremonies for the Hall of Fame induction. He is a Pocomoke High School grad and is the public address announcer for the NBA’s Charlotte Hornets.\n\nDoughty said when he auditioned for the Hornets job, he used Trotter’s introduction as a sample.\n\nAlso inducted on Friday were Kirkland Hall, Trent Harris and Nicole Council. Hawks’ Athletic Director Keith Davidson presented Bryant Mitchell with the Spirit of the Hawk award.\n\nHall was already in the Hall of Fame as an athlete, but was inducted this time as a coach. Hall coached seven sports during a 33-year span at UMES and is also a member of the Eastern Shore Baseball Hall of Fame and the MEAC Hall of Fame.\n\nHarris died in September of 1971, but was represented Friday by his son, Robert Trent Harris Jr. Harris was a member of the 1960 Hawks’ men’s basketball team that won the NAIA District Championship. He tallied more than 1,000 rebounds in his career and shot 53 percent from the field as a senior.\n\n“I definitely would have recruited him,” Harris, a basketball coach, said of his late father.\n\nCouncil is the third-ever women’s basketball player to be inducted into the UMES Hall of Fame and finished her Hawks career in 2000 having scored 1,520 points, good enough for third all-time in team history.\n\nCouncil now resides in Smyrna, Delaware, and is an assistant coach for Division II Wilmington University’s women’s basketball team.\n\n“UMES was the best four years of my life and made me into the woman that I am today,” Council said.\n\n410-845-4643\n\nTwitter/Instagram: @primetimeMitch\n\nfacebook.com/mitchell.northam.9\n\nQ&A with David Byrd, Pocomoke High's athletic director\n\nHawks take loss hard after coming up short vs. Spartans", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/22"}]}

The measure failed to ban any weapons, but it includes funding for school safety and state crisis intervention programs. Many states – including California, Delaware and New York – have also passed new laws to help curb gun violence, such as regulating untraceable ghost guns and strengthening background check systems.\n\nThe year 2022 is the second-highest year of mass shootings in the United States on record, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit tracking gun violence incidents across the country.\n\nThere have been at least 647 mass shootings through December 31 this year. The country saw 692 mass shootings in 2021, the worst year on record since the Gun Violence Archive began tracking mass shootings in 2014.\n\nThe Gun Violence Archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.\n\nThere is a direct correlation in states with weaker gun laws and higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides, suicides and accidental killings, according to a January study published by Everytown for Gun Safety, a non-profit focused on gun violence prevention.\n\nNot everyone agrees increased gun control is the answer. Some Americans advocate for their right to keep and bear arms, enshrined in the Constitution, while others argue gun control measures save lives and do not infringe citizen rights.\n\nAmid the debate, some lawmakers have forged ahead with passing gun control laws.\n\n“States continue to lead on gun safety, passing new and innovative policies that we will work to replicate across the country while continuing to secure significant investments in community violence intervention programs,” said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, which has been fighting for gun safety measures since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut, which killed 20 children and six educators.\n\n“This progress and our electoral victories in November shows that the gun violence prevention movement is stronger than ever and sets the stage for continued progress in the new year,” Watts continued.\n\nHere is a summary of the state and federal laws approved in 2022:\n\nFederal legislation\n\nOn June 25, Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act after the House and the Senate approved the measure. The package represents the most significant federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994.\n\n“God willing, it’s going to save a lot of lives,” Biden said at the White House as he signed the bill.\n\nThe package includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs, which can be used to manage red flag programs, as well as for other crisis intervention programs such as mental health, drug and veteran courts.\n\nRed flag laws, approved by the federal measure, are also known as Extreme Risk Protection Order laws. They allow courts to temporarily seize firearms from anyone believed to be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nThe legislation encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which would provide a more comprehensive background check for people between 18 and 21 who want to buy guns.\n\nIt also requires more individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income to register as Federally Licensed Firearm Dealers, which are required to administer background checks before they sell a gun to someone.\n\nThe law bars guns from anyone convicted of a domestic violence crime who has a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law, however, allows those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalifornia was ranked the top state in the nation for gun safety in 2021. It has the strongest system in the nation for removing firearms from people who become prohibited from having them, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom in July signed a package of five bills on gun safety after they were passed by the California State Senate.\n\nOn July 1, Newsom signed AB 2571, which prohibits the gun industry from marketing firearm-related products to minors, as well as AB 1621, which further restricts ghost guns, including the parts used to build them.\n\nOn July 12, the governor signed AB 1594, legislation establishing a firearm industry standard of conduct to promote “safe and responsible firearm industry member practices,” the bill states.\n\nAlso included in the package is AB 2156, signed on July 21, which cracks down on the manufacture of firearms by prohibiting any person, regardless of federal licensure, from manufacturing firearms without a state license. It also prohibits unlicensed individuals from using 3D printing to manufacture any firearm or precursor part.\n\nThe last bill, signed on July 22, is SB 1327. It allows private citizens to bring civil action against anyone who manufactures, distributes, transports or imports assault weapons or ghost guns, which are banned in the state.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis signed House Bill 22-1086, or The Vote Without Fear Act, on March 30.\n\nThe law prohibits a person from openly carrying a firearm within any polling location or central count facility.\n\nIt also bans individuals from open carrying within “100 feet of a ballot drop box or any building in which a polling location or central count facility is located,” while election activity is in progress, according to the legislation. Violations are punishable by a maximum $1,000 fine, up to 364 days imprisonment in the county jail, or both.\n\nDelaware\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney on June 30 signed a package of gun safety bills including legislation to prohibit assault weapons, regulate high-capacity magazines and strengthen background checks.\n\nThe Delaware Lethal Firearms Safety Act of 2022 prohibits the manufacture, sale, offer to sell, transfer, purchase, receipt, possession or transport of assault weapons in Delaware, subject to certain exceptions, according to HB 450.\n\nThe package also includes legislation to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase or possess a firearm from 18 to 21, ban the use of devices which convert handguns into fully automatic weapons and hold gun manufacturers and dealers “liable for reckless or negligent actions that lead to gun violence,” the bill states.\n\nIllinois\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed two bills to address secure storage of firearms and regulating ghost guns.\n\nOn May 18, the governor signed HB 4383, which prohibits individuals from selling or possessing ghost guns and ensures all firearms are serialized, allowing law enforcement to better trace them.\n\nPritzker later signed HB4729 on June 10, which requires the Department of Public Health to develop and implement a two-year public awareness campaign focused on safe gun storage, which includes sharing information about safe gun storage, the bill says.\n\nMaryland\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced on April 8 he would allow Senate Bill 387, which bans the sale or possession of ghost guns, to become law without his signature, noting it doesn’t go far enough in taking “decisive action to hold violent criminals accountable.”\n\nThe bill, which took effect on June 1 after bipartisan support, expands the definition of “firearm” to include an unfinished frame or receiver. It requires the Secretary of State Police to maintain a system to register firearms imprinted with serial numbers and “prohibits a person from purchasing, receiving, selling, offering to sell, or transferring an ‘unfinished frame or receiver’ or a firearm unless imprinted with specified information,” the bill states.\n\nThe law also requires the governor to allocate $150,000 in the annual state budget to fund registration proceedings.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on July 5 signed seven gun safety bills, six of which were part of his Gun Safety 3.0 package he introduced to the state legislature in April 2021.\n\nThe package includes legislation which would allow the state’s attorney general to sue members of the firearm industry for violations stemming from the sale or marketing of firearms, the bill states.\n\nAlso included in the package is legislation to regulate the sale of handgun ammunition, developing a system of electronic reporting of these sales; and require training prior to the issuance of a gun purchaser identification card with a validity date of 10 years.\n\nAnother bill in the package mandates firearm owners who become state residents to obtain a Firearm Purchaser Identification Card and register out-of-state acquired handguns, according to the bill.\n\nOn December 22, Murphy signed another gun safety bill strengthening the state’s firearm licensing laws and established a list of ‘sensitive places’ where concealed carry is prohibited, including playgrounds, bars and restaurants serving alcohol, train stations, and polling places.\n\nNew York\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul signed a package of bills and an additional piece of legislation to address a wide range of gun safety issues.\n\nHochul signed a gun safety package on June 6, which includes bills requiring microstamping on handguns, strengthen the state’s extreme risk and firearm purchase permit law, raise the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21 and enhance information sharing between state, local and federal agencies when guns are used in crimes.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court decision on June 23 to strike down a New York gun law enacted more than a century ago which places restrictions on carrying a concealed handgun outside the home, Hochul signed legislation to strengthen the state’s gun laws and bolster restrictions on concealed carry weapons.\n\nThe law, which takes effect on September 1, will expand eligibility requirements in the concealed carry permitting process, restrict the carrying of concealed weapons in sensitive locations and establish state oversight over background checks for guns and regular checks on license holders for criminal convictions, according to the legislation.\n\nOregon\n\nIn the November 2022 US midterm elections, Oregon voters enacted a gun safety ballot measure, Measure 114, which strengthens background checks and prohibits the sale and transfer of ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds.\n\nThe measure also closes the “Charleston Loophole,” which allows gun purchases to move forward by default after three days even if a background check has not been completed. It requires state police to complete background checks on individuals before a gun sale or transfer is made.\n\nRhode Island\n\nRhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee signed three gun safety bills on June 21. They prohibit high-capacity magazines, ban the open carry of rifles and shotguns in public and raise the legal age to purchase firearms or ammunition from 18 to 21, with exceptions for law enforcement officers.\n\nOne of the bills also changes the definition of “rifle” and “shotgun” consistent with federal law.\n\nVermont\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott signed into law a package on March 25 banning firearms from hospital buildings and prohibits the transfer of firearms between unlicensed people.\n\nThe governor vetoed a similar bill, S.30, in February which would have closed the “Charleston Loophole.”\n\nThe new law, S.4, addresses the policy by extending the time period to seven days for the federal government to complete a background check before an individual can purchase a firearm. It also strengthens protections for victims of domestic violence, according to the bill.\n\nWashington\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee signed three gun safety bills into law on March 23.\n\nHB 1705 prohibits the manufacture, sale, purchase or possession of ghost guns, while HB 1630 prohibits the open carry of firearms at local government meetings and restricts them at school board meetings and election-related locations.\n\nThe third bill, SB 5078, prohibits high-capacity magazines, defined as an “ammunition feeding device with the capacity to accept more than 17 rounds of ammunition,” the bill states.", "authors": ["Emma Tucker"], "publish_date": "2022/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/06/28/states-with-most-guns-per-capita/74211520007/", "title": "Americans bought 5.5 million guns to start 2024: These states sold ...", "text": "Earlier this week, the U.S. surgeon general declared gun violence a public health crisis, issuing a 39 page advisory on initiatives to prevent firearm deaths. The advisory said the rate of firearm-related deaths “reached a near three-decade high in 2021.\"\n\nAbout a third of American's say they personally own a gun, Pew Research data shows. That statistic reflects the deep-rooted culture of gun ownership in the U.S. Another report found that in the first four months of 2024, nearly 5.5. million firearms were purchased in the country.\n\nIt may come as no surprise that Texas - the second most populated state in the nation - accounted for the largest share of firearms purchased by any state, nearly half a million or 9% of all guns sold through April 2024.\n\nData from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was analyzed by SafeHomes.org, a safety product review site, to determine which states had the largest ownership of recently purchased firearms.\n\nNationwide legal gun sales declined slightly last year\n\nNationwide gun sales decreased in 2023, SafeHomes managing editor Rob Gabriele said. About 16.7 million firearms were sold in the U.S. last year, the report said, down 4% from 2022.\n\nFlorida, which passed a law to allow permitless concealed carry in March 2023, saw gun sales go up 1% last year. The Sunshine State was one of only four states to see an increase, with 1,316,471 estimated sales in 2023, according to the report. But that was nothing compared to North Carolina, Gabriele said, which saw a 112% increase in gun sales after their pistol permit law was eliminated in March 2023 by the GOP-led legislature, overriding the Democratic governor's veto.\n\nThe other states to see an increase in SafeHome's report were Illinois (5%), despite a new ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and New Hampshire (3%), which had no new changes in their gun laws.\n\nMeanwhile, the District of Columbia saw a 32% decrease in firearms sales in 2023, Gabriele said, the same year it tightened its firearm background check and registration laws. Other states with recent gun control measures saw their own reductions, including Delaware (18%), and New York (15%). But Louisiana, which didn't see any significant gun control restrictions in 2023, also saw a drop of 15% in firearm sales last year.\n\nAs of July 4, 2024, carrying a concealed gun by a non-felon in Louisiana will be legal without a permit.\n\nWhich states sold the most guns in 2023?\n\nThe states that sold the most guns last year is largely reflected by its population size. The top three states that sold the most guns in 2023 are also the most populated.\n\nAccording to SafeHomes' analysis of NICS data, these are the states with the most firearms sales in 2023:\n\nTexas: 1,347,589 Florida: 1,316,471 California: 1,043,421 Pennsylvania: 841,523 Tennessee: 633,015 Ohio: 583,314 Virginia: 581,698 Michigan: 555,650 Missouri: 520,488 Illinois: 504,452\n\nWhich states sold the most guns, adjusted for population?\n\nAdjusted for population, Montana, Wyoming and Alaska have the highest gun sales rates in SafeHomes' report.\n\n\"These states have strong hunting traditions fostered by rural lifestyles and less rigid gun control laws,\" Gabriele said. \"The pro-gun cultures and the need for self-defense in such remote areas, which abound in predators that could harm livestock, may also contribute to higher gun ownership and sales.\"\n\nThe following states had the highest rate of gun sales, adjusted for population.\n\nMontana: 1,586 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+\n\n1,586 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+ Wyoming: 1,523 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+\n\n1,523 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+ Alaska: 1,514 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+\n\n1,514 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+ Oregon: 1,372 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+\n\n1,372 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+ Alabama: 1,302 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+\n\n1,302 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+ New Hampshire: 1,252 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+\n\n1,252 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+ Tennessee: 1,207 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+\n\n1,207 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+ West Virginia: 1,205 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+\n\n1,205 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+ North Dakota: 1,194 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+\n\n1,194 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+ Idaho: 1,149 sold per 10,000 residents aged 21+\n\nA look at the statistics:Gun violence is a public health crisis, surgeon general says\n\nGun violence reaches an all-time-high\n\nAccording to U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, more than 48,000 people died by gun violence in 2022 - that's an increase of 16,000 deaths compared to 2010. At the same time, firearm-related suicides have increased by 20%, including a “staggering increase” in such deaths among young people, the advisory noted.\n\nMurthy said gun violence demands a public health approach rather than the polarizing political response.\n\nGun violence became the leading cause of death in children and U.S. adults are worried that they or a loved one will become a victim, according to Reuters. More than half of U.S. adults said that they or a family member experienced a firearm-related incident, a 2023 report from KFF found.\n\nContributing: Eduardo Cuevas and Jeanine Santucci", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/01/09/gun-laws-2024-ranking/72085972007/", "title": "2024's new gun laws change the rules of firearm ownership in ...", "text": "Several new laws increasing restrictions around guns go into effect in 2024 and a report released Friday sheds light on how each state stacks up.\n\nEverytown for Gun Safety analyzed the strength and impact of 50 policies related to gun control as well as gun death rates and ranked all 50 states in its annual report.\n\nThe gun violence prevention advocacy group determined California has the strongest gun laws in the country, followed by New York, Illinois, Connecticut, and Hawaii. Mississippi, Idaho, Montana and Georgia were among the states with the weakest gun laws. Arkansas, which is ranked last, Florida, Nebraska and North Carolina were among the states that dropped in the rankings after passing legislation that loosened restrictions on guns.\n\nAccording to the report, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Hawaii, New Jersey and New York have the lowest gun death rates in the country, while Mississippi, Louisiana, New Mexico, Alabama and Montana have the highest.\n\n\"When we look at the rates of gun violence in these states, what we see is a strong correlation between states with gun laws and lower rates of gun violence and the opposite for the states with the weak law,\" said Nick Suplina, senior vice president for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\nThe report comes after new gun control measures went into effect Jan. 1 in states including California, Illinois, Colorado, Washington and Minnesota. New laws in other states like Michigan and Oregon go into effect later this year.\n\nHere's a look at some of the state gun laws in effect or coming in 2024:\n\nCalifornia\n\nA new law in California prohibiting people from carrying firearms in more than two dozen public spaces temporarily went into effect Jan. 1 amid an ongoing legal challenge against it.\n\nThe law, signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in September, was temporarily blocked by a federal judge last month who said it violates the Second Amendment and defies the Supreme Court. A federal appeals court put a temporary hold on the previous ruling, allowing the law to go into effect Jan. 1, but the law was blocked once again Saturday.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado moved from 12th to 11th on Everytown's list. At the beginning of the year, Colorado joined 11 other states in restricting \"ghost guns,\" firearms that are assembled from kits or 3D-printed. The weapons, also known as \"privately made firearms\" don't require background checks and don't have serial numbers, which can make it more difficult for law enforcement to track the weapons.\n\nTwo gun rights groups filed a federal lawsuit against Democratic Gov. Jared Polis challenging the new law the day it went into effect, The Denver Post reported.\n\nIllinois\n\nIn Illinois, which rose from seventh to third on Everytown's list, a new law banning certain high-powered semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines went into effect Jan. 1. The assault weapons ban passed in January 2023, six months after a mass shooting at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park left seven dead and dozens wounded.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in December declined to block the law.\n\nMichigan\n\nIn Michigan, a series of gun safety bills signed by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer after a mass shooting at Michigan State University will go into effect in 2024. The bills include an expansion of background checks, requirements to store guns away from children and a new red flag law. Whitmer also signed legislation in November to temporarily ban people convicted of domestic violence from possessing and purchasing firearms and ammunition. The state moved from 24th to 20th on Everytown's list.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinnesota moved up from 17th to 14th in Everytown's ranking after becoming the 20th state to implement a \"red flag\" law, which allows courts to temporarily take guns from those determined to be an imminent threat to themselves or others.\n\nOregon\n\nA ban on ghost guns will take effect in Oregon in September, according to Everytown. The state dropped slightly to 10th in the organization's ranking as its neighbor Washington moved up to ninth.\n\nWashington\n\nPeople purchasing a firearm in Washington must now complete a background check, wait 10 business days and take a safety training program within five years of the purchase.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nIn West Virginia, ranked 27th by Everytown, a law allowing people with concealed carry permits to bring firearms to public college and university campuses will go into effect in July, according to the group.\n\nMore gun laws could come in 2024\n\nA record-breaking 137 gun safety policies were passed in state legislatures in 2023, according to Everytown. Suplina called the recent legislation on assault weapons \"historic\" and said he expects to see similar bills this year in Virginia, New Mexico and Maine, where 18 people were killed in a mass shooting on Oct. 25.\n\n\"What we're seeing now year over year is success in beating back bad laws and passing good laws,\" he said. \"So I am quite optimistic that in 2024 we will continue the momentum from last year and continue to pass laws that save lives.\"\n\nGun violence decreased, fatal mass shootings increased in 2023\n\nThe number of total gun deaths and injuries dropped in 2023 to 36,335 injured and 42,946 dead, including suicides, homicides and unintentional shootings, according to the most recent data from the Gun Violence Archive.\n\nBut in 2023, there were 39 mass shootings in which four or more people were killed, not including the perpetrator, which surpasses the previous year's record of 36, according to the USA TODAY/Northeastern University/Associated Press Mass Killings Database.\n\nMark Bryant, executive director of the Gun Violence Archive, said the recent decline in total deaths and injuries is \"fairly significant,\" but it's unclear what is causing some forms of gun violence to increase.\n\n\"This is a mixed bag year,\" he said. \"I think we're starting to drift back toward pre-COVID numbers.\"\n\nDo gun control laws save lives?\n\nAccording to a projection from Everytown, if every state had the gun death rates seen in the eight states with the strongest gun safety laws, nearly 300,000 lives could be saved over the next decade.\n\nSean Holihan, state legislative director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence called 2023 a \"historic\" year for the gun safety movement and agreed that while the success of implementation can vary state-by-state, these laws have \"proven that they can be effective.\"\n\n\"There's a noticeable difference in the gun death rate in states that pass these types of laws versus states that haven't,\" said Holihan.\n\nHowever, Billy McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the National Rifle Association, told USA TODAY restrictions on guns penalize lawful gunowners and fail to deter criminals and called Everytown's list \"propaganda.\"\n\n\"A cursory glance at Everytown's 'methodology' reveals a bias: The highest ratings go to states with the most restrictive gun laws. This isn't science; it's an assault on the rights of law-abiding citizens, masquerading as research,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nBryant said ultimately, more data is needed to determine what drove the country's recent decrease in gun violence.\n\n\"It's just too early to say,\" he said.\n\nContributing: Thao Nguyen, Grace Hauck, John Fritze, USA TODAY; Clara Hendrickson, Detroit Free Press; Laurel Demkovich, Washington State Standard; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2020/08/19/delaware-officers-cleared-criminal-wrongdoing-shootings-brandon-roberts-ricardo-hylton-shane-swider/3335727001/", "title": "Delaware officers cleared of criminal wrongdoing in 3 fatal shootings", "text": "Five Delaware police officers involved in three separate fatal shootings were cleared of criminal wrongdoing this month, according to reports issued by the state Attorney General's Office.\n\nIn the three fatal shootings, the reports said the victims were armed and police had instructed them to either \"stop\" or \"drop\" their weapon or to raise their hands.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/23/us/carjackings-rise-major-cities-pandemic/index.html", "title": "Cities see large increases in carjackings during pandemic | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nCarjackings have risen dramatically over the past two years in some of America’s biggest cities.\n\nJust outside Chicago, a state senator’s car and other valuables were taken at gunpoint in December, and a group of children, one just 10 years old, carjacked more than a dozen people. A rideshare driver being carjacked shot his attackers earlier this month in Philadelphia. Last March, a 12-year-old in Washington, DC was arrested and charged with four counts of armed carjacking.\n\n“The majority of it is young joyriders. They’re not keeping the cars. They’re jacking cars to commit another crime, typically more serious robberies or shootings, or joyriding around for the sake of social media purpose and street cred,” said Christopher Herrmann, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “It’s a disturbing trend.”\n\nComprehensive national data isn’t available because the FBI’s crime reporting system doesn’t track carjackings. But large cities that track the crime reported increases in 2020 and 2021, especially as the pandemic took hold of the country.\n\nThe number of carjackings quadrupled in New York City over the last four years, according to data released by the NYPD. The city recorded more than 500 carjackings in 2021, up from 328 in 2020, 132 in 2019, and 112 in 2018.\n\nCarjackings in Philadelphia nearly quadrupled between 2015 and 2021, according to figures released by the city’s police department. They recorded more than 800 last year, up from about 170 in 2015.\n\nIn New Orleans, there were 281 carjackings last year, up from 105 in 2018, the earliest year of available data. The city has also seen a string of carjackings this year, with NOPD reporting 39 as of January 21.\n\nMore than 1,800 carjackings were reported in Chicago last year, the most of any large city, according to data released by police departments to CNN. Chicago’s 2021 tally was the most on record over the last 20 years. Carjackings had been steadily declining in the city after 2001, hitting a low of 303 in 2014, but began to tick upward before skyrocketing to 1,400 in 2020 following the onset of the pandemic. Last year saw more than five times as many carjackings as in 2014.\n\n‘We recognize the fear and uncertainty’\n\n“It is lawless,” said Raymond Lopez, an alderman for Chicago’s 15th Ward. “It doesn’t feel lawless. It is.”\n\nChicago’s clearance rate for carjackings is low, and has further declined during the pandemic. According to the University of Chicago’s Crime Lab, only 11% of carjacking offenses resulted in an arrest in 2020, down from 20% in 2019. Just 4.5% of offenses resulted in charges approved by the State Attorney’s Office.\n\nChicago, a city of 2.7 million people, recorded more than three times as many carjackings as New York, where the population is almost three times higher. Chicago police officials declined to comment.\n\nPhiladelphia police posted a message on Facebook telling residents they were prioritizing the solving of carjacking cases and that more officers had been dedicated to that task.\n\n“We recognize the fear and uncertainty these incidents bring, as the victims in these cases have touched nearly every demographic,” the statement read. “The PPD has deployed additional resources to investigate these incidents and apprehend offenders.”\n\nIn December, Pennsylvania Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D) was carjacked at gunpoint in Philadelphia – a 19-year-old from Delaware was later arrested for the crime. News outlets in Philadelphia have reported more than 100 carjackings have already taken place so far this year.\n\nThere are problems tracking data\n\nMany cities do not have data on carjackings readily available, as police departments will often categorize these crimes as robberies or assaults. It’s difficult to understand the scope of the problem at a national level because the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program, which law enforcement agencies voluntarily submit their crime data to, does not track carjackings.\n\nHowever, more agencies are beginning to track carjackings separately. Dallas began classifying these crimes separately from robberies in their data last year and reported 453 carjackings in 2021. The Metropolitan Police Department in DC last year created a task force dedicated to addressing carjacking and auto thefts. Reports of auto thefts are also up across the country and are more reliably tracked than carjackings.\n\nKim Smith, director of programs at University of Chicago’s Crime Lab, says that tracking crimes in greater detail is a key part of finding solutions.\n\n“I do think it’s important to be as granular as possible when you’re collecting data on crime,” she told CNN. “Who are the victims? Where do things take place? A lot of carjackings are done with a gun. If we’re trying to address gun violence, then we need to be as granular as possible.”\n\nMore detailed reporting also makes it easier to spot trends and patterns – in its 2021 report, “How the pandemic is accelerating carjackings in Chicago,” the Crime Lab found that the majority of carjackings were concentrated in the south and west sides of the city, where gun violence is disproportionately high. The majority of the victims of carjackings were Black or Hispanic.\n\nSmith says she hopes the detail provided in the Crime Lab report can encourage officials in other cities to take a closer look at the circumstances under which these crimes occur. “There’s a lot that surprised us in the analysis, and I do think some of this is a call to action,” she said.\n\nSome ‘emboldened to be repeat offenders’\n\nShifting attitudes toward the juvenile justice system, and Covid-related restrictions aimed at reducing the number of people in county jails or juvenile facilities, has created a situation where accused criminals who’d normally be held in custody are free while awaiting trial, experts told CNN.\n\nThat’s created a “revolving door” situation where “some were emboldened to be repeat offenders,” said Jeffrey Norman, chief of the Milwaukee Police Department. “We saw this on a higher level in 2020 and 2021.”\n\nIn Chicago, Lopez said people arrested and sent home with electronic monitoring sometimes reoffend while awaiting trial for something they’ve been arrested for.\n\n“It’s like the perfect storm, where all these soft on crime policies have come to a head during this pandemic,” he told CNN.\n\nThe Crime Lab’s study of Chicago’s carjackings found that almost half of all carjacking arrestees in Chicago in 2020 were under 18. Between 2019 and 2020, there was a 104% increase in the number of arrestees who were minors. For many of them, it was their first contact with the criminal justice system, according to Smith.\n\nThe increase in carjackings committed by minors underscores the extent to which the pandemic has impacted young people in America – especially in areas that were already struggling. The report states that carjackings occurred with more frequency in areas with poorer internet access and lower school attendance.\n\nSmith noted that kids living in areas with lower internet access had fewer opportunities to engage in school, remote learning and program providers over the past two years. “The impact of the pandemic, I think, can’t be overstated,” she said.\n\nLopez said the choice to not take crime seriously among young teens will have consequences years later when they age out of the juvenile justice system.\n\n“When you have carjackers who are 15 on their third car, that’s a problem,” he said.\n\nNorman, the Milwaukee chief, said it would take a multi-faceted approach to begin addressing the rise in carjackings.\n\n“You’re not going to police your way out of this,” Norman said. “Everyone has to share responsibility when it comes to kids.”\n\nNorman said that the behavior of children in a community were like “canaries in a mine. When a community has issues, kids are falling to particular types of behaviors.\n\n“This is my thing. When a child doesn’t love himself or herself, I worry about the community that has that child. That’s no holds barred behavior that child will be engaged in,” Norman said. “A hungry kid will do whatever it takes to put food in his stomach.”\n\nThe closure of schools and advent of remote learning, the stress within households related to that and economic insecurity, and the pandemic stress on other institutions have all contributed to teens having more free time and less stability in their lives.\n\n“You don’t take care of basic things, you can’t get to self-realization,” Norman said. “Not every kid is out doing things to put food in their stomach. But there are things not being take care of – whether it’s having positive mentorship, or areas of socialization not (being) available.\n\n“It’s sad seeing despair and the lack of resources any normal kid should have,” Norman said. “As the old saying goes, ‘Idle hands are the devil’s work.’”", "authors": ["Peter Nickeas Priya Krishnakumar", "Peter Nickeas", "Priya Krishnakumar"], "publish_date": "2022/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/04/08/coronavirus-shortage-where-has-all-the-toilet-paper-gone/2964143001/", "title": "Coronavirus: Why the toilet paper shortage is about more than ...", "text": "On a recent Friday afternoon in western Iowa, a man was waiting in line to buy toilet paper at a local Dollar General store when another customer started giving the man grief about it, according to local police.\n\nAt issue was the amount of toilet paper being purchased.

Devin Hogue told USA TODAY.\n\nIn the end, neither person was injured, but the initial aggressor was charged this week with disorderly conduct, adding to the recent police blotter over bath tissue.

In California last week, Beverly Hills cops found 192 rolls of toilet paper in a stolen SUV.\n\nNeed money help? We got you:Money advice delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here\n\nAll are symptoms of the shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic – a supply shortfall caused by a surge in demand that goes beyond just panic buying and hoarding.\n\nSo why can't we find toilet paper yet?\n\nExperts say empty store shelves also are caused by a fundamental shift in demand for a certain kind of toilet paper for use at home, as well as kinks in the supply chain between factories and stores.\n\nYet there is hope: Two of the main ingredients used to make toilet paper – paper fiber and water – are in strong supply. Production is being ramped up at American factories operating 24/7. And experts expect a more abundant stock soon on store shelves.\n\n“I can’t give you an exact number, but I will tell you we’re making more than ever,” said Arist Mastorides, president of family care for Kimberly-Clark North America, maker of Cottonelle toilet paper and other paper products. “It’s a significant amount to cover what we think will be used with people traveling less and staying home more.”\n\nThat’s part of the problem right now – not just hoarding and not because people are going to the bathroom more than normal. It’s also because so many consumers are going to the bathroom in different locations from before the pandemic – at home instead of workplaces, which often use a different kind of toilet paper than used at home.\n\nWhat's the difference between toilet paper at home and at work?\n\nOne kind of bath tissue – for the commercial market – often is made of one ply of recycled fiber and generally is found on rollers at businesses and public places. The other kind – retail toilet paper – is often made of two-ply virgin fiber and is generally much softer for use at home.\n\nThis location shift prompted by shelter-at-home rules would lead to an estimated 40% increase over the average daily home usage, according to Georgia-Pacific, which makes Quilted Northern toilet paper and other paper products.\n\nThe demand has “increased on retail, and it’s staying steady or surged in the commercial market” because of use at busy health care facilities and other essential businesses, said Eric Abercrombie, spokesman for Georgia-Pacific, based in Atlanta. Abercrombie said the company still expects commercial-market toilet paper demand to decline as “business and vacation plans change.”\n\nMeanwhile, retail toilet paper demand swelled to unforeseen heights in March, with $1.45 billion in toilet paper sales in the four-week period ending March 29, up 112% from a year earlier, according to IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm. Retail stores couldn’t keep enough supply on the shelves, and the supply chain became strained by the demand.\n\nBathroom supplies:Here are the places where you can still buy toilet paper\n\nNeed toilet paper? Procter & Gamble plant goes into overdrive during coronavirus crisis\n\nThe supply chain for toilet paper “is not built for dramatic shifts and seasonal demand changes,” said Scott Luton, the CEO and founder of Supply Chain Now, a digital media company. “It’s not like pumpkins during the fall and chicken wings during the Super Bowl.”\n\nLuton also notes that repurposing commercial-market toilet paper to retail shelves “is not simple to do,” even with stocks of it sitting untouched in storage rooms of closed businesses.\n\nWhen will toilet paper get to stores?\n\nGetting more product to market is another matter. Georgia-Pacific, for example, has 14 facilities in 11 states making toilet paper. Before it gets to retail store shelves, those packages might first go to a regional distribution center by truck.\n\n“We are working hard to maximize the number of deliveries we can load and ship out of our facilities – you can just load and unload so fast,” Abercrombie wrote in an e-mail. In the last week of March, “our mills and regional distribution centers managed to ship out 120% of normal capacity. We also are working with customers to have direct shipments when possible to reduce distribution time. We currently don’t have any issues with carrier capacity (trucks and trailers) to ship.”\n\nNormally, this is a well-timed process based on consistent demand for a product that does not take long to make in factories. For Kimberly-Clark, the fiber generally comes from trees in North or Latin America and then is transported to American factories in big white sheets. The material then gets dumped into bins with water, where it’s blended and formed into massive rolls to be cut into logs and then smaller individual rolls.\n\n“The whole process happens very, very fast,” said Mastorides, who declined to say exactly how long because of competitive reasons.\n\nThe process also is highly automated.\n\n“So when there is a surge in demand, which we have never seen before, the toilet paper manufacturers cannot keep up,” said Patrick Penfield, professor of supply chain practice at Syracuse. “They would love to be able to supply all the demand, but they would need to expand capacity by buying more equipment. It's very expensive. So really all they can do to minimally increase their capacity is using overtime or maybe adding another shift if they can.”\n\nThe biggest toilet paper makers in the U.S. say their factories are working around the clock to produce record amounts, including Procter & Gamble, which makes Charmin and other paper products. All have the added challenge of keeping their workers healthy during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n“We are prioritizing our bestselling sizes to maximize the amount of product we can ship to retailers,” said Loren Fanroy, a spokesperson for Procter & Gamble.\n\nMastorides of Kimberly-Clark also said it is increasing production by minimizing the different kinds of packages it normally makes, such as four-packs, eight-packs and 24-packs. Some ship directly to retailers, others to distribution centers where they are mixed with other Kimberly-Clark products.\n\n“Our limited assortment is enabling us to get that product through and into our distribution centers faster, and as we work with our retail partners to get that limited assortment, they’re able to build trucks faster,” Mastorides said.\n\nWhat about paper towels?\n\nPaper towels are manufactured in much the same way as toilet paper and by the same companies. But it is not flying off the shelves like toilet paper for a variety of reasons, even if cleaning supplies are at a premium during the pandemic. One reason is that reusable cotton towels often are used instead. Another is that the fear of running out of an essential First World product – toilet paper – spreads through social media and other channels.\n\n“We’ve known for a long time it’s essential for a better life,” Mastorides said. “It’s something they’ve chosen to stock up on.”\n\nRetail customers soon are expected to get more relief as manufacturers increase production, home bathrooms run out of room for stockpiles and at least some commercial-market product is repurposed to meet retail demand.\n\n“It’s really just trying to get that supply chain caught up,” said Abercrombie of Georgia-Pacific. “We took care of the demand we could in terms of existing inventory. We tried to increase operations where we could, and then also trying to smartly manage a distribution to get it out.”\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

It's key to note, researchers say, that infection rates before March 2020 were nothing to celebrate.\n\nOn top of that moderately good news, the Leapfrog Group found other metrics that measure patient safety and satisfaction have fallen significantly, likely because of hospital staffing shortages and other pandemic-era challenges.\n\n\"We're encouraged and relieved to see that infections are rapidly decreasing in hospitals following the spike during the pandemic, but we remain very concerned about a number of major problems in hospitals,\" said Leah Binder, president and CEO of Leapfrog, an independent, national nonprofit founded by large employers and other purchasers.\n\nPatient surveys following hospital visits found declines in experiences for the second year in a row in all states. Particularly significant drops were reported in “communication about medicines” and “responsiveness of hospital staff.\" Preventable errors have been linked to these problems.\n\n\"Hospitals need to take a hard look at what they are unnecessarily continuing post-pandemic that are not helping patients,\" Binder said.\n\nInfection rates fell but could still be better\n\n\"Hospital-acquired\" infections are those considered avoidable if staff wash their hands appropriately and follow other infection-control procedures.\n\nCommon hospital-acquired infections include Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, central line-associated bloodstream infections and catheter-associated urinary tract infections.\n\nLeapfrog, which analyzes hospital safety data twice a year, showed that rates of all three reached a five-year high during the pandemic and remained elevated through last year's ranking before getting better.\n\nThe report released Monday, which included data from 3,000 hospitals nationwide, showed:\n\n◾ 19% of hospitals reduced levels of all three infections,\n\n◾ 66% of hospitals reduced instances of at least one infection and\n\n◾ 16% of hospitals had infection rates that continued to rise or made no improvement.\n\nLeapfrog assigns letter grades to hospitals based on their safety records and ranks states according to their percentage of A-rated hospitals. (Ratings for individual hospitals are available on the organization's website.)\n\nUtah topped the list for the first time, with 52% of its hospitals earning an A grade.\n\nThe District of Columbia and four states ‒ Vermont, Wyoming, Delaware and North Dakota ‒ brought up the rear with no A-grade hospitals.\n\nNationwide, nearly 30% of hospitals earned an A grade, 24% earned a B, 39% earned a C, 7% a D, and less than 1% an F.\n\nTypically, for a state to rank well, a few local hospital systems must focus on safety. \"It's not about money or resources or partisanship,\" Binder said. \"It's about do people actually care so much about safety that they put effort into it. It's elbow grease.\"\n\nThat commitment from top executives has been clear in Utah, she said, but not in Vermont. \"I hope Vermonters will talk to their hospital leaders and ask for that commitment.\"\n\nBinder said she's also concerned about New York, which consistently ranks near the bottom nationally. A large percentage of medical and nursing students pass through New York during their training, so it's a particularly key place for patient safety to be a priority, Binder said.\n\nAdventHealth, a nonprofit, faith-based health system that runs 52 hospitals across six states in the Southeast, as well as Texas, Colorado and Wisconsin, has more A-grade hospitals this year than ever before, said Dr. William Scharf, Advent's executive clinical director of quality and safety.\n\nOut of 42 hospitals examined by Leapfrog, Advent earned an A on 31 and infection levels across the chain have now dropped below what they were before the pandemic, he said.\n\n\"This does not happen by accident,\" Scharf said. Just as construction sites often report days since their last accident, Advent hospitals typically report the number of days since their last hospital-acquired infection.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Advent's hospitals started to see an increase in infections, but decided \"not to accept the new normal of COVID,\" he said, instead focusing on \"back to basics and back to baseline.\"\n\nPatient satisfaction slipping fast\n\nLike most hospitals during the pandemic, Advent relied on visiting nurses and saw a lot of turnover due to burnout. They've made an effort since to hire more staff, move away from agency nurses, improve the benefits package and emphasize the company's supportive culture.\n\n\"We recognized that we had to do something different and we had to do something better,\" Scharf said.\n\nResearch has shown that hospitals that had higher quality ratings and more staff before the pandemic slipped less during that stressful time.\n\nIn many hospitals, though, turnover, particularly the departure of experienced nurses, remains very high and compassion fatigue has set in, said Dr. Pablo Moreno Franco, chair of the Department of Critical Care Medicine at Mayo Clinic Florida and a member of Leapfrog's advisory board.\n\n\"Some of the staff that has remained may not have the same level of resilience and tolerance they once had,\" Franco said.\n\nExperienced nurses are often the ones to raise patient safety issues, challenge the system and suggest improvements, he said. Newer nurses, particularly those trained during the pandemic, may not have as much hands-on, front-line experience or know how to communicate as effectively with patients face-to-face, he said, because of the distance and technology that was necessary during the pandemic.\n\nPatients themselves have also changed, he and Binder said. \"A lot of industries have said that people are crabbier, more short-tempered,\" Binder said.\n\nData shows an increase in patient violence toward staff, \"which does not create the conditions for a therapeutic relationship,\" Franco noted. \"We need to be compassionate to them so we can get compassion back.\"\n\nThe expansion of telemedicine and artificial intelligence offers tremendous opportunities for creativity, including options like virtual nurses to provide standardized information to patients, Franco said. However, government and patient safety advocates need to help ensure these advances are implemented carefully so as not to add stress to already maxed-out hospital workers.\n\n\"If we try to bring too much technology too quickly that upsets the staff as well as the patient,\" he said.\n\nStill, Franco said, he remains optimistic that the post-pandemic rebound is just beginning.\n\n\"We do hope that the combination of creativity with precise execution and better use of technology can help us not only get to pre-pandemic levels but get even better by learning from these lessons.\"\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Inside the ship’s towering command center, the crew tries to re-engage the system but no luck. The nearly 100,000-ton ship is adrift.\n\n“Captain, we are on a collision course with the bridge support,” announces the officer of the watch, who recommends dropping its anchor. No change. A desperate call goes out to the shore to stop traffic from crossing the bridge.\n\nThe captain realizes the hard truth: The Dali is “at the point of extremis,” he says – the point of no return.\n\nThe crew watches helplessly as the bridge looms larger and larger until, just four minutes after the alarm sounded, their vessel slams into one of its main support columns.\n\n“At this point there is absolutely, certainly nothing that we could do on our own,” said Chief Mate Kevin Calnan from inside California State University Maritime Academy’s 360-degree mission simulator during an eerily vivid replication of the Baltimore bridge disaster.\n\nThe state-of-the-art simulator – one of just three of its kind nationwide – showed how a total loss of power on a container ship the size and weight of the Dali could turn it into an uncontrollable weapon of mass destruction – a transformation counted in precisely calculated currents and breezes, velocity and minutes, not hours.\n\nMoments after the Dali struck it, the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed into Patapsco River, killing at least six construction workers, likely causing billions of dollars in damage and forever altering the Baltimore skyline.\n\nAlthough such disasters are rare, the conditions that could cause them are frighteningly common, according to a USA TODAY analysis of U.S. Coast Guard maritime incident data, which includes any reportable maritime event involving a death or injury, collision, grounding, environmental harm, or the loss of power and propulsion.\n\nMap: Where ships have struck bridges, lost power\n\nThis map shows issues categorized as \"major\" or \"significant\" marine casualties and “serious marine incidents” in U.S. Coast Guard incident investigation reports that mention a freight ship, freight barge, tank ship, tank barge or ocean cruise vessel striking a bridge. It also includes cases where ships lost power, propulsion or steering within two kilometers of a highway bridge over navigable waters. Don't see a map? Click here.\n\nAt least 6,000 times in the past 22 years – an average of more than five times a week – crews on board massive cargo ships, oil tankers, container barges and even cruise vessels have reported what befell the Dali: a loss of power, loss of propulsion, loss of steering, or some combination of the three, a USA TODAY data analysis reveals.\n\nAt least 900 of them occurred near bridges identified by the U.S. Department of Transportation as spanning navigable waters. The vast majority were classified as routine but a dozen were labeled major or significant.\n\nSome damaged both the ships and the structures they hit. Others left crew members with broken bones or other injuries. But most, including cases remarkably similar to what happened last month in Baltimore, have never been made public, buried deep in a federal database.\n\nOften the dividing line between major and routine came down to a last-minute effort by the crew or rescue teams.\n\nThe Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge had an earlier close call, in 2018\n\nOn March 16, 2018, the bulk carrier Strategic Alliance lost power and propulsion on the Delaware River just north of the Commodore Barry Bridge, a 2.6-mile span connecting Philadelphia to New Jersey and carrying more than 41,000 vehicles a day.\n\nThe Singapore-flagged vessel, about half the size of the Dali, dropped anchor in the channel without incident early that Friday morning and was able to regain propulsion and generator power after clearing its clogged cooling water strainers of debris. Nearly two years later, the Dali-sized container ship Maersk Chicago lost power in New York’s Lower Bay Channel as it approached the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge late on a Wednesday night.\n\nRoughly 500 feet from the country’s longest suspension span – crossed by nearly a quarter-million vehicles a day – the ship was adrift with no steering, no propulsion and no engine. Fortunately, a pair of tugboats were able to rescue the U.S.-flagged vessel and tow it to safety, where it was determined a broken air compressor valve was to blame.\n\nJust last week, another container ship lost propulsion near the same bridge. The Liberia-flagged vessel, Qingdao, experienced the failure around 8:30 p.m. on Saturday as it navigated through the Kill Van Kull shipping lane between Staten Island and Bayonne, New Jersey.\n\nIt took three tugboats to bring the vessel under control.\n\nUnlike most incidents in the Coast Guard database, the Qingdao made the news as images of the gigantic ship floating near the bridge spooked jittery Americans still reeling from the recent Baltimore disaster.\n\nThat the two events happened in close succession was not so much a coincidence, but rather a fairly common occurrence that’s bound to happen when tens of thousands of ships from all over the world travel in and out of U.S. waters every year, several maritime experts told USA TODAY.\n\nStatistically, the experts said, such failures are more likely to happen in ports and harbors, as well as in close proximity to bridges, because that’s when the ships are under the most stress.\n\n“That’s when you’re giving all your engine orders,” said Calnan, the assistant professor of marine transportation who ran the simulation at Cal Maritime for USA TODAY. Calnan has operated large ships himself and has experienced what is sometimes known as a dark ship, though only while out at sea.\n\n“It’s just like in the car; if you’re going 65 on the highway, there’s not a lot happening,” he said, “But when you’re doing a lot of stop and go and changing engine orders, it’s putting stress on the engine, and if something is mechanically wrong with the engine itself, there’s a higher chance it will happen when you’re using it more.”\n\nMechanical failure, human error and a host of other conditions can conspire to shut down a vessel’s engine, seize up its propulsion system or thwart its crew’s ability to steer.\n\nSometimes a simple miscalculation can cause a crew to lose command of a ship – or cause an otherwise seaworthy ship to hit a bridge.\n\nUSA TODAY’s data analysis revealed at least 2,600 bridge strikes occurring in U.S. waters since 2002, the earliest year for which such data is available. Three of these allisions were fatal, claiming 16 lives in all. The majority, however, were minor – a ship’s antenna or mast hitting a bridge, or a barge clipping a bridge’s protective fender.\n\nBut maritime problems – which international governing agencies call “casualty incidents” – have been steadily rising over the past decade, according to a report by Lloyd’s List Intelligence, a global maritime data and analytics company.\n\nThat’s especially true for those caused by machinery damage or failure.\n\nThe Lloyd’s report cites 700 such reported events in the third quarter of 2022 – the highest in 14 years – and attributed the increase to several factors. Among them: fewer ship inspections and internal audits, an unavailability of dry docks and technicians to perform maintenance and repairs, as well as supply chain delays in getting spare parts.\n\nLloyd’s was unable to provide updated data, but a representative told USA TODAY incidents have continued to rise.\n\nThe crew could do little to avert catastrophe\n\nThe frequency of such malfunctions and the risks to life and property are at the heart of Cal Maritime’s simulation exercises, which train students how to react to the worst disasters in a controlled environment.\n\nIn the case of the Dali simulation, the unfortunate lesson was that there was little they could do to avoid a catastrophe once the power was down except alert others to their plight.\n\n“Making that emergency call and alerting all of the other traffic in the area that, ‘Hey, we’re this ship and we can’t maneuver anymore, we’re not under command’ – that call itself is what we see in this accident in Baltimore,” Calnan said. “That singular call… saved countless lives.”\n\nWhile most power outages cause minimal harm, the one that darkened the Dali occurred at a most unfortunate place and time: about 0.6 nautical miles from the Francis Scott Key Bridge while the laden ship was moving at a speed of roughly 8 knots and the wind was blowing from the northeast, according to real-time data fed into the simulator.\n\nWhen the blackout occurred, the ship’s rudder was turned 3 degrees to the starboard side and remained stuck there as the vessel drifted off course. Its towering stack of containers acted as a sail for the wind, which aimed it directly at the bridge’s support column.\n\nEven if the engine had been working, Calnan said, it would have taken 0.8 nautical miles to bring that particular vessel under those particular conditions to a full stop – farther than the distance to the bridge it was about to hit. Simply put, time had run out.\n\n“During any situation on board any type of vessel, we have a concept which we call the point of extremis, which essentially means there’s a point in every situation where no matter what you do, it's going to lead to some form of undesirable outcome,” he said. “Basically, it’s the point of no return.”\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board and U.S. Coast Guard investigators are still working to determine the cause of the blackout on the Dali. They have retrieved documents and interviewed the crew, as well as others who witnessed or were involved in the crash. But it could be months before they release their findings.\n\nIn the meantime, maritime experts have offered a number of possible causes based on their own experience with engine failure.\n\n“There are 101 potential reasons for a blackout,” said Capt. Ashok Pandey, a master mariner and associate professor of international maritime business at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy.\n\nThey include inexperienced crew members accidentally switching off a valve that shuts down the fuel supply, water forming inside poorly maintained fuel tanks and knocking out the engine, and countless situations involving dirty fuel gumming up the ship’s filters, pumps and injectors.\n\nDeep-sea vessels like the Dali burn what’s known as heavy fuel oil – sometimes called bunker fuel – a cheap, tar-like residue that the crew processes onboard the ship by heating, filtering and purifying it before feeding it into the combustion system.\n\nSometimes the heavy fuel itself is particularly bad and can clog the ship’s strainers. Other times the crew fails to properly maintain its onboard processing system and dirty fuel gets into the engine. Either way, it can lead to disaster.\n\n“We have all been through bad fuel situations – you get bad fuel and it clogs the strainers, and every engineer has had to go down and clean the strainers,” said Keith Deirup, a licensed chief engineer with 20 years of experience in the U.S. merchant marine industry. “If you lose an engine, it's a total loss of propulsion, and it takes a while to get it back online.”\n\nAccidents, dirty fuel and fish cause blackouts\n\nCoast Guard incident reports blame a host of culprits for the power outages reported by hundreds of ships over the years. They include unpredictable events like lightning strikes, fires on board or even fish clogging water inlets meant to help cool the engines.\n\nSeveral incident reports attribute power losses to dirty – or degraded – fuel, as was the case in June 2017, when the Hong Kong-flagged Mallika Naree went dark on the Elizabeth River outside Norfolk, Virginia. The bulk carrier dragged a buoy nearly 400 yards before running aground. The investigation revealed about 16 gallons of water had leaked into the fuel oil supply tank.\n\nDelayed maintenance also shows up as a common cause of power outages. “Poor maintenance” on a fuel oil valve led to a power outage that ran the 681-foot-long Alexander Dimitrov aground east of New Orleans in January 2002. The report states “the valves should have been checked as part of routine maintenance.”\n\n“Lack of inspection, testing replacement/maintenance of the time delay relays” was to blame in February 2019, when the captain of the Portuguese container ship EMS Trader ordered an emergency lowering of the anchor. The ship had lost power, steering and propulsion not far from the Commodore Barry Bridge southwest of Philadelphia.\n\nMany of the incident reports blame human error and inattention.\n\nThe 1,096-foot-long container ship Ever Lotus lost power while mooring at the Port of Los Angeles in November 2016. Even though the vessel’s crew was trained to slowly increase the pitch of the bow thruster so as to not overload the generators, “the pilot adjusted the pitch from 0% to 100% instantly,” according to the incident report.\n\nThree years earlier, the 604-foot-long Manistee went dark as it was backing out of Ashtabula Harbor east of Cleveland. The engineer on watch forgot to throw a switch that would prevent the generators from overheating, leading to the outage.\n\nSuch incidents reinforce the need for extra precaution when ships navigate near critical infrastructure, said Pandey of Massachusetts Maritime, who advocated for mandatory tug escorts regardless of the ship, its cargo or the port.\n\nProtecting bridges:Baltimore's Key Bridge, opened in 1977, had few ship defenses. Are modern bridges better?\n\n“Increasingly, the use of tugs is considered too old-fashioned, maybe too expensive, simply because we have the technology,” he said. “It’s something we don’t talk enough about.”\n\nOther experts said nothing can prevent every disaster, and the Dali might be a case in point.\n\n“Naval engineers will look at the root causes and ask what we can do to prevent it from happening again,” said a senior government official and former Coast Guard officer who spoke to USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.\n\n\"And maybe there isn’t anything we can do,” he said. ”Maybe fate just caught up with it.”\n\nMore than half of major bridge collapses are in the U.S.\n\nDespite the frequency of power failures and bridge strikes reported to the Coast Guard, the maritime shipping industry has had relatively few major accidents like the one that toppled the Francis Scott Key Bridge.\n\nUntil this March, the last incident identified by USA TODAY in which a ship knocked down a U.S. bridge was on Jan. 26, 2012, when the Delta Mariner cargo vessel carrying rocket components down the Tennessee River from Alabama to Florida slammed into the Eggner’s Ferry Bridge near Aurora, Kentucky.\n\nThe ship, going about 10 knots, tore away a 322-foot span of the bridge as it attempted to pass under a section with insufficient clearance.\n\nFortunately, traffic was light and vehicles stopped before reaching the missing portion of the bridge, according to an National Transportation Safety Board report of the crash. There were no deaths or injuries, but the bridge sustained major damage. It was repaired and reopened later that year but permanently closed in 2016 after a new bridge was built in its place.\n\nThree years earlier, in March 2009, a tugboat pushing eight barges on the Mississippi River knocked out the Popps Ferry Bridge in Biloxi, Mississippi, when it crashed into one of its pilings and sent a section of the span tumbling into the water. Again, nobody died.\n\nOther ship-on-bridge allisions killed people but did not topple the span. This includes the July 2015 death of a construction worker on the Eads Bridge in St. Louis when a tugboat pushing two loaded barges struck his scaffolding as it was passing under the span. And the August 2014 death of a tugboat master when his crane barge hit the Florida Avenue lift bridge in New Orleans and the crane’s mast fell onto the wheelhouse, crushing him.\n\nThe last U.S. ship-on-bridge allision to cause both fatalities and bring down the bridge, according to USA TODAY’s review of the data, happened more than two decades ago.\n\nOn May 26, 2002, the towboat Robert Y. Love was pushing two empty asphalt tank barges on the Arkansas River when it veered off course and struck a pier supporting the Interstate 40 highway bridge near Webbers Falls, Oklahoma.\n\nThe impact sent a 503-foot section of the bridge tumbling into the river. Unlike the Kentucky bridge collapse, highway traffic on the I-40 span had continued to “drive into the void,” according to the NTSB report.\n\nFourteen people died and five were injured in the accident, which the report said caused an estimated $30.1 million in damage to the bridge and $276,000 to the barges.\n\nWorldwide, between 1960 and 2015 ships or barges caused 35 major bridge collapses that killed 342 people, according to a 2018 report from the World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure.More than half occurred in the United States.\n\nYet the United States has some of the strictest maritime standards in the world, according to the experts. Its rules and regulations – which include a host of technical, personnel and environmental practices – go far beyond those set by the International Maritime Organization, which governs all global shipping.\n\nThey ensure that U.S ships are built and maintained to the highest standards and that its crews follow industry best practices. These rules also apply, to a certain extent, to foreign-flagged ships in U.S. waters, even though those ships might operate under what some experts described as subpar conditions.\n\n“Many of the world’s shipping companies are based out of countries like Liberia, Marshall Islands and Panama” Deirup said. “They do that to save on costs and liability, so they get to run these ships really cheaply. They hire mariners from whatever country they can offer the cheapest wages and will run a really shoddy operation without much oversight.”\n\nMany of the ships, he said, “are just ramshackle.”\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard has jurisdiction in U.S. waters and can detain a ship for safety issues, Deirup said, “but they’re spread really thin.”\n\nDetainments typically happen when a Coast Guard inspection finds significant issues with a ship, but it takes years to train the marine inspectors and there aren’t nearly enough of them in the field, said the former Coast Guard officer who was not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nNot all ships are inspected, either, he said. The Coast Guard uses an algorithm based on the vessel’s history and previous ports of call and current port to determine which ships to check.\n\nExacerbating the situation are the extremely tight schedules ships’ crews face to unload outgoing cargo and pickup inbound cargo before racing to the next port. That’s especially true of container ships, experts said, whose slots at ports are scheduled weeks in advance and must make it on time or miss the window.\n\n“For this ship, the Dali, in Baltimore, they were probably under that pressure,” Deirup said. “That’s why if they had problems with their generators – just theorizing – but they might have been under a lot of pressure to just make it work and get off that dock.”\n\nThat type of pressure is difficult to mimic in a simulator, which is perhaps why the crew on the bridge of Cal Maritime’s digital ship operated with calm efficiency each time they ran through the scenario. Blackout, steering out, ship dead in the water, bridge looming, crash. Again and again and again.\n\nOnly one run involving tug boats averted the disaster, and even then only when two tugs at full power were tethered to the ship all the way under the bridge. That lineup is not a current day reality except in rare situations, such as tankers transporting oil or other toxins in certain ports.\n\nSolutions:Tugboats left before ship reached Baltimore bridge. They might have saved it.\n\n“No matter what nationality the crew was or what their training was like, I think in the end, it’s an unlucky situation at an unlucky point,” said Conor Finnerty, a Cal Maritime senior who assumed the role of officer of the watch during the simulation.\n\nOne of the most critical positions on the ship, the officer of the watch ensures the vessel navigates safely regardless of obstacles or conditions. During the simulation, Finnerty gave orders to the crew to continue testing the equipment, then to drop the anchor and, finally, to sound the danger signal warning anyone on the water that collision was imminent.\n\n“There’s really not much that could have been done about it,” Finnerty said of the unfolding disaster, “except just watch it.”\n\nUSA TODAY reporter Dinah Voyles Pulver contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2023/12/20/2024-snap-benefits-increase/71975285007/", "title": "SNAP benefits increase 12.5% for 2024: What to know about food ...", "text": "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, provides food benefits to eligible low-income families.

While it has dominated news coverage for weeks, it's for good reason: There won't be another solar eclipse in the U.S. for 20 years.\n\nJournalists with Delaware Online/The News Journal were out and about throughout the day, reporting from communities, schools and museums.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the event.\n\nEclipse glasses:Where to get solar eclipse glasses, eclipse safety and how to make your own solar viewers\n\nWhat time does the solar eclipse start in Delaware?\n\nThough Delawareans won't be able to see a full eclipse of the sun, the partial eclipse began at 2:07 p.m. and will end at 4:34 p.m. local time.\n\nThe maximum eclipse begins at 3:23 p.m.\n\nFor the 0.55% of the population, or 43.8 million people who will be able to see the total eclipse, it will be visible at 4:41 p.m. The duration of totality will last four minutes and 28 seconds, nearly double that of the total solar eclipse seen in the United States in 2017, according to Great American Eclipse.\n\nAbout 8.19% of the population, or 652 million people, will be able to see the partial eclipse. No matter the time of day it is, the sky will darken as if it were dawn or dusk.\n\nNo, you're not imagining a temperature drop\n\nAs the moon begins to obscure more and more of the sun, you may have noticed it's already getting darker out. With that decrease in light also comes a drop in temperature.\n\nNASA says most people can expect the temperature to decrease about 10 degrees Fahrenheit (5 degrees Celsius) depending on the humidity and cloud cover. It'll get warmer again once the moon moves past the sun.\n\nEclipse viewing at Auburn Heights Preserve in Yorklyn\n\nMore than 100 people parked cars around 2:30 p.m. and began making a short trek to a Yorklyn hillside to watch the eclipse.\n\nThe Auburn Heights Preserve, directly across from the historic 19th century Marshall mansion in Auburn Valley State Park, is normally only used for parking, a state park employee said on Monday.\n\nBut on Eclipse Day, a crowd hiked up the steep, grassy hill, spread out blankets, and set up camping chairs.\n\nA park employee said the site is considered one of the highest spots in Delaware.\n\nSome families with children blew soap bubbles to pass the time, others chased dogs through the grass, and still others donned glasses and eagerly looked toward the slightly overcast sky.\n\n\"Let's hope the clouds move,\" said another park official as she handed out eclipse glasses. \"It's playing hard to get.\"\n\nThe atmosphere felt like an outdoor music festival but with no music or stage.\n\n\"We might have a slight chance to see something,\" said a man who sat with a group of women. \"Oh, here we come!\" he said as the sun peeked out of the clouds and brightened the sky.\n\nThe crowd began cheering at about 3:10 p.m. and many started clapping.\n\n\"It's so slight, but I can see it!\" said a woman, who also joined in on the clapping.\n\n— Patricia Talorico\n\nAt University of Delaware, students watch eclipse\n\nCheers and claps carried across the University of Delaware’s campus as the maximum partial eclipse set in.\n\n“Woohoo! Yeah!” a student could be heard shouting at 3:23 p.m., eventually joined by a chorus of peers.\n\nMorris Library staff took over the area outside of the building as they took a quick break to enjoy the event. Students looking for a last-minute spot to watch stopped in their tracks or quickly huddled with others to see the action.\n\nAlthough some students packed up and left once 3:30 p.m. hit and the maximum partial eclipse passed, plenty of observers remained camped out for the long haul, phones and eclipse glasses still pointed toward the sky. A student on the South Green climbed a tree to set up a hammock.\n\nThe once-crowded Green saw a lot less action once the partial eclipse approached its last leg in Newark.\n\nPeople could still be seen enjoying the sunshine and spring weather, but most photographers and eclipse-watchers parted ways with the astronomical event and went on with their days. Backpacks were slung over shoulders and folded blankets were thrown over arms as students headed to their next destinations.\n\nAs the partial eclipse wound down around 4:30 p.m., eclipse glasses were unfolded for a final time.\n\n— Krys'tal Griffin\n\nClear skies, perfect viewing in Rehoboth Beach\n\nIt was a downright gorgeous day in downtown Rehoboth Beach. Clouds did not block views of the sun as the moon passed in front of it, much to the delight of people gathered on the beach and boardwalk to watch. The mood was merry as strangers chatted with each other about where they were from and shared past eclipse experiences.\n\nDevar Burbage, of Potomac, Maryland, walked down the boardwalk offering views of the crescent shadows through backwards binoculars.\n\nJJ Catts, of Rehoboth Beach, sat with family and friends on the steps of the bandstand, looking at the sky through protective glasses. He was in Rehoboth in the 1970s for a total solar eclipse, he said.\n\nNina Helwig and three female family members, from Maryland and New Jersey, had just arrived and checked into their hotel before making their way to the boardwalk to watch the eclipse.\n\nEd and Beth Redfield, of Wilmington, were in town for Beth's birthday. They were laid out on the sunny beach with their dog, Kona, and protective glasses.\n\nDwight Johnson and Michelle Terry, of D&S Equestrian Center of Dover, had a unique eclipse experience. They rode their horses, Romeo and Rain, down the beach from Lewes to Rehoboth as the moon moved in front of the sun. They wanted to see how the horses behaved, Terry said.\n\n\"They were very anxious,\" Johnson said. \"I was waiting for (Rain) to get her breath, but she didn't want to stop, she just kept going.\"\n\nThey horses calmed once they got into some shade on Rehoboth Avenue, Johnson said, where people were stopping to pose for photos with them.\n\n— Shannon Marvel McNaught\n\nWatching the solar eclipse from Eclipse Bistro\n\nIt should come as no surprise that a place named Eclipse Bistro had a busier-than-normal lunch business during Monday’s solar eclipse.\n\nThe Wilmington restaurant lured diners with half-price wine bottles, day-long happy hour specials and $8 espresso martinis with manager Nick Taggart giving them free eclipse glasses when they left.\n\nAmong the crowd was Brandywine Festival of the Arts organizer Barry Schlecker, brought there by his wife Weiss to celebrate his 84th birthday over crab cakes and French fries.\n\n“I asked him where he wanted to go to lunch. He was hemming and hawing so I said, ‘Let’s go to Eclipse.’ It seemed appropriate,” she said.\n\nAbout a half hour before the maximum eclipse, two tables filled on the restaurant’s patios with diners alternating between munching beef skewers and looking skyward at the solar anomaly.\n\nKerri Klingensmith and her husband M.J. drove from Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, for the event, armed with their own plastic eclipse glasses.\n\n“Being at Eclipse for the eclipse is going to make it memorable,” she said. “We’ll always remember it.”\n\nThe next table over, Wilmington’s Sheri Stump and Bill Irvin, owner of city restaurants Snuff Mill Restaurant, Butchery & Wine Bar and The Brandywine, couldn’t pass up the uniqueness of it all.\n\n“How could we not come to a place called Eclipse?” Irvin asked.\n\nBut shortly after the two tables got settled, several large clouds moved in overhead, blocking the big moment.\n\nThe sky darkened, the temperature dropped and there was suddenly no need for sunglasses.\n\n“This sucks,” Kerri Klingensmith lamented. Responded her husband: “Nobody’s going blind today.”\n\n— Ryan Cormier\n\nJust before peak eclipse: A family reunion finds itself by the side of I-95\n\nA family reunion in New Jersey found itself on the side of a Delaware highway during the eclipse.\n\nOn the sidewalk out front of the Delaware Welcome Center outside Newark, also known as the Biden Welcome Center, sisters Barbara Miller and Mary Finch, and niece Kira Mauro, set up shop with their eclipse glasses next to barren trees adorned by stray strips of tissue caught in the breeze.\n\nThey hadn't intended to be along the side of a Delaware highway for this eclipse: But they got a late start this morning, said Kira.\n\nNone live in Delaware, nor New Jersey for that matter. Barbara lives in Fort Howard, Maryland, while Mary lives in Illinois. Kira, at the rest stop with her young daughter, had flown in from Florida.\n\nBut the family had traveled from all over the country Sunday night to support an art show by Kira's father, Paul Miller, showing his mosaic art at the April show for the Ocean County Artists Guild in Island Heights, New Jersey.\n\nAnd on their way back to Maryland, they all found themselves here, just outside Newark, when they realized the eclipse had caught up with them.\n\nAs clouds passed over the sun again and again, we wondered if they were disappointed at the overcast weather.\n\n“Not at all,” said Kira. “It’s easier to take pictures with my phone.”\n\nThen she stopped, observing a bird picking up a strand of apparent toilet paper caught in the trees outside the Welcome Center.\n\n“Oh look!” she said. “It’s building a nest.”\n\n— Matthew Korfhage\n\nSen. Cory Booker watches the eclipse from a Delaware rest stop\n\nYou never know whom you’ll run into during an eclipse.\n\nAround the eclipse’s peak at 3:23, New Jersey U.S. Sen. Cory Booker strolled onto the parking lot of the Delaware Welcome Center with eclipse glasses in hand. He was greeted warmly by other onlookers.\n\n“It wasn’t intentional,” Booker told us a little later about his eclipse viewing along the side of I-95 in Delaware.\n\nBooker was on his way to the capital from his home state, he said, when he and his team witnessed a terrible car accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. “Literally right in front of us,” he said.\n\nThey pulled over to the site of the accident, he said. (The 511NJ Twitter account shows a crash, with a truck fire, at around 2 p.m. near the Delaware Memorial Bridge.)\n\n“We got out of the car to try to help render aid to the first responders out there,” Booker said. “And so we ended up trapped there just trying to help out. The car burst into flames.”\n\nBy the time he got back on the road, there was no hope of getting to Washington, D.C. before the eclipse. And so as the eclipse neared its peak, the former Newark, New Jersey, mayor pulled off the highway near Newark, Delaware, to get a look.\n\n“I’m happy to be here at Joe Biden’s rest stop!” he said, smiling as a young man approached with his hand outstretched.\n\n“Senator Booker,” said the young man. “I just wanted to shake your hand.”\n\n— Matthew Korfhage\n\nUD groups gathered ahead of eclipse\n\nIn Newark, University of Delaware students trickled to and from classes as the partial eclipse in Delaware began a little after 2 p.m.\n\nSmall groups of students were spaced out on the Green, a grassy area running through the main campus, enjoying the sun and waiting for the maximum eclipse to begin. With just over an hour until the main show, eclipse glasses eagerly popped out of bags and back pockets as students checked for changes in the sky.\n\nAside from students, locals could also be seen camping out and periodically looking up at the sun, along with a few lucky tour groups that passed through campus once in a while.\n\nOn the eastern portion of campus, the Harrington Turf was filled with students on blankets and towels minutes before the maximum eclipse began. Where you’ll usually find undergraduates playing volleyball in the sand or kickball on the turf, today’s crowd was filled with shared snacks and upturned heads.\"\n\nWhile the University of Delaware did not officially cancel classes for the event, some professors took the liberty of canceling class duties to let students enjoy the occasion. One student walking from an academic building could be heard saying that their professor canceled their exam to make sure everyone would be available to watch the eclipse.\n\nStudents who had been parked on the grass since the onset of the partial eclipse could be seen playing soccer to pass the time. Or taking a nap, as one student chose to do.\n\nA baby, who may be the youngest eclipse-goer on campus, toddled on a blanket under the shade of a tree. Despite the shining sun, cloud cover over Newark made for chilly spells as wind blows through town.\n\nAs the countdown to the maximum partial eclipse continued, more students congregate in green spaces and walkways to solidify their viewing plans. Some professors head outside with their classes for group eclipse viewing. Even a few runners had pairs of eclipse glasses in their hands while jogging around the area.\n\n— Krys'tal Griffin\n\nEclipse begins in Wilmington, but some nap instead\n\nIn Rodney Square and all around the Market Street area, pockets of office workers cheered at little glimpses of the eclipse that appeared through the clouds. They squinted at their cell phones, trying to capture a social-media worthy image and passed around glasses so everyone could try to get a view.\n\nAnd as the clouds over Wilmington began to dissipate and the sky brightened as the moon and sun’s positions began to diverge, people started slowly trickling back into their offices.\n\n“Back to work,” one man in a suit said as he took his eyes off the sky.\n\nAs the moon began to pass between the Earth and Sun above Market Street in Wilmington, delivery workers continued their routes, lawyers trudged toward Wilmington's courthouse and business continued as normal.\n\n\"We are going to try to get out,\" said one local coffee shop barista when asked if she was going to sneak outside to see the event.\n\nIn Rodney Square, one group was set up with a blanket on the ground and glasses over their eyes feet away from another person taking a mid-afternoon nap on the grass.\n\nAs the eclipse neared its peak, pockets of office workers stood on street corners downtown looking up.\n\nWhen a thick patch of clouds obscured the sun, a delivery driver stood in the middle of Shipley Street, hands to the sky and yelling \"boooooo.\"\n\n\"Welcome to the East Coast I guess,\" he said with a laugh after.\n\n— Xerxes Wilson\n\nDelaware beachgoers begin watching the sky\n\nDebbie McGill of Laurel, Maryland, had scored a prime boardwalk bench at the top of Rehoboth Avenue in Rehoboth Beach around 2 p.m.\n\n\"When I was a kid my dad took us to one and he loved astronomy, so it's kind of a memory of him,\" she said.\n\nThe eclipse is a spiritual experience for McGill, too.\n\n\"You think about tribes a thousand years ago... What they thought when this happened. It's really bigger than us. It's a big deal, I think.\"\n\n— Shannon Marvel McNaught\n\nWhy you should play 'Total Eclipse of the Heart' during your viewing\n\nHave the lyrics to the 1983 single \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" been running through your mind in recent weeks?\n\nWell, it's an appropriate ballad for Monday's eclipse.\n\nRunning for 4 minutes and 27 seconds, the song perfectly matches up with the eclipse's longest duration of totality, which NASA said will be 4 minutes and 28 seconds near Torreón, Mexico. The path of totality is where observers will see the moon completely cover the sun.\n\nMost residents situated along the path of totality will see a totality duration between 3.5 and 4 minutes.\n\nWatch the solar eclipse from NASA telescopes\n\nIf you can't − or don't want to − head outside, you can watch the eclipse on YouTube, through NASA's telescope feed.\n\nWatch USA Today's solar eclipse livestream\n\nWant to see the eclipse from multiple perspectives? USA Today's live broadcast has you covered. Watch here:\n\nWhat happens if you look at the solar eclipse without glasses?\n\nJust because our former president did it doesn't mean you should, too.\n\nYes, we mean that you shouldn't stare directly at the sun during a solar eclipse − or any other time, for that matter.\n\nThe concentrated solar rays will burn through your eye lenses and corneas, reaching the macula, which is part of the retina, NASA says.\n\nYES, IT REALLY IS DAMAGING:Can you really go blind from looking at a solar eclipse? Real life cautionary tales.\n\nAnd according to the American Medical Association, even a few seconds of viewing the sun during an eclipse can temporarily or permanently burn the macula.\n\n\"Once retina tissue is destroyed, it cannot regenerate, resulting in permanent central vision loss,\" a March 8 research article says.\n\nCan you drive during the solar eclipse?\n\nYes, it's safe to drive, but AAA reminds drivers that there could be more traffic on the road before, during and after the event, so people should use caution.\n\nAdditionally, Delaware State Police is reminding motorists not to wear their eclipse glasses while they drive.\n\nADDITONAL ECLIPSE DRIVING TIPS:Solar eclipse 2024: Is it safe to drive during the eclipse? How to stay safe\n\nNASA launching rockets to study effects of eclipse\n\nNASA is using spacecraft called sounding rockets that are equipped with scientific instruments to take measurements and perform experiments during Monday's eclipse, USA Today reported.\n\nThe three rockets will launch from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia and will reach an intended altitude of 260 miles, NASA said. That's high enough to study disturbances during a total solar eclipse in the ionosphere, a region of Earth’s atmosphere between 55 to 310 miles above the ground.\n\nSTORY:NASA is launching 3 sounding rockets into space during the total solar eclipse. Here's why\n\nThe mission team hope to collect data on how the sun's sudden disappearance during the eclipse creates disturbances that could interfere with communications on Earth.\n\nTargeted launch times for the three rockets are 2:40 p.m., 3:20 p.m., and 4:05 p.m., NASA said, but that may change.\n\nWeather permitting, Delawareans may be able to see the rockets 10-30 seconds after takeoff.\n\nAccording to Delaware Surf Fishing, which had a rocket photo contest several years ago, some of the best places are at the beaches. For a complete list, visit their page.\n\nThe launches will also be streamed on YouTube beginning at 2:30 p.m.\n\nWhere can I buy eclipse glasses?\n\nDid you wait until the last moment to buy your eclipse glasses and now it's too late to order them online?\n\nSome locations of the following retail chains sell ISO-compliant eclipse glasses and/or handheld viewers made by companies verified by the American Astronomical Society:\n\nWalmart\n\nWegmans\n\nCracker Barrel\n\nLowes\n\nStaples\n\nAdditionally, some libraries and museums in the state are offering glasses.\n\nThe Delaware City library, for example, will give them out for free while supplies last. While the library doesn't officially open until noon, residents can knock on the door or call ahead and someone will bring them out.\n\nREAD:Still hunting for glasses? Here are stores selling them in Delaware\n\nWhile chain stores and libraries will likely be offering glasses that meet American Astronomical Society standards, if you want to double-check, look at the arm of the glasses for the the \"ISO 12312-2\" label. The standard may also be written as \"ISO 12312-2:2015.\"\n\nEither of these means that the glasses will properly block light and radiation.\n\nI can't find glasses.

But what about my phone?\n\nMany residents know not to look directly at the sun during an eclipse. But is pointing a phone or other camera OK?\n\nPhotography experts caution against doing so unless the optics are fitted with a certified solar filter. Cameras can magnify the intensity and brightness of sunlight, B & H Photo and Video says, which can damage equipment.\n\nExperts also warn that pointing a phone at the sun could \"fry\" the device. They instead recommend shielding the lens with eclipse glasses or obtaining a solar lens ahead of time.\n\nSolar eclipse time by zip code\n\nWondering when the eclipse will area in your area?

Others need a new after-work activity now that an outdoor walk in the park is out of the question.\n\nAnd you must exercise caution (hydrate!) if you must work outside, walk a distance or are considering doing your favorite outdoor workout.\n\nWhatever your heat-related plight may be, we know how frustrating it can be to limit yourself to the indoors, especially if you have a house full of children to keep entertained.\n\nThat’s why we’re helping you out with a list of fun indoor activities around the state to keep you out of the heat and make sure you keep your cool:\n\nIs there a heat wave in Delaware?\n\nThe National Weather Service issued an excessive heat warning for New Castle County, in effect from 6 a.m. Thursday to 10 p.m. Friday, and a heat advisory for the entire state, in effect from 11 a.m. Thursday to 6 a.m. Friday.\n\n“Extreme heat and humidity will significantly increase the potential for heat-related illnesses, especially for those working or participating in outdoor activities,” the weather service reported.\n\nIn New Castle County, a heat index value up to 108, classified as dangerously hot, is expected for areas like Wilmington that are impacted by the excessive heat warning. All other areas are expected to see a heat index value up to 104.\n\nIn Kent County and inland Sussex County, heat index values up to 110 are expected.\n\nWhat should I do during a heat wave?\n\nThe main way to stay safe during a heat wave is to stay out of the sun. You should drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room if possible, and spend some time checking up on relatives and neighbors, according to the weather service.\n\nWhile young children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles, this is especially true during days of excessive heat when “car interiors can reach lethal temperatures in a matter of minutes,” said the weather service.\n\nOther ways to practice safety during a heat wave include:\n\nLimiting strenuous activities to early morning or evening.\n\nKnowing the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke, which include excessive thirst, fatigue, headaches, sweating, dizziness and feeling clammy. If this happens, move the person to a cool, shaded location and call 911.\n\nWearing lightweight and loose-fitting clothing.\n\nTaking frequent rest breaks in shaded or air-conditioned environments if working outdoors.\n\nWays to cool off in Delaware during a heatwave\n\nCatch a movie\n\nIf you have yet to hop on the “Barbenheimer” wave, the box office premiere of both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” on July 21, or have your sights set on other new releases, now is the time to get your tickets.\n\nGrab your popcorn and drink, recline your theater seat and kick up your feet as you enjoy a new movie on the big screen.\n\nLace up your skates\n\nAre you in desperate need of a chilly climate? Surrounding yourself with ice should do the trick!\n\nNo, we’re not talking about booking a trip to Antarctica. With the Fred Rust Ice Arena and the Patriot Ice Center open, you can spend some time ice skating around local indoor rinks.\n\nWhile we’re positive these ice arenas don’t offer the penguins and seals of a trip to Antarctica, ice skating in Delaware is a cheap and easily accessible way to cool down significantly.\n\nIf ice skating isn't your thing, you can swap your ice skates for rollerblades and cruise around the Christiana Skating Center in Christiana or the Dover Skating Center in Dover.\n\nBrush up on your strikes and spares\n\nWii Sports Bowling is great and all, but don’t you think it’s time you give the real deal another chance?\n\nDelaware has plenty of bowling alleys up and down the state, and if you’re looking for a Friday night activity to wait out the heat advisory, the air-conditioned lanes are calling your name.\n\nA bowling alley visit also guarantees a meal of greasy pizza, hot french fries and all the other nostalgic alley foods without having to pile up in the car and drive elsewhere.\n\nJump the day away\n\nTrampoline parks may sound like a kiddie activity, but adults can enjoy the jumping fun, too.\n\nSkyzone in Newark, Urban Air in Christiana and Fly Over Park in Dover are a few places offering open jump or day program options.\n\nAt the end of your jump session, huddle in the food court for some small bites before going back on the trampolines for round two.\n\nTake a scenic train ride\n\nIf physical exertion of any sort does not sound like it belongs on your to-do list, we feel you.\n\nThe Wilmington & Western Railroad in Prices Corner operates steam- and diesel-powered tourist trains on 10 miles of track in the Red Clay Valley between Greenbank and Hockessin from spring through Dec. 30.\n\nThat means you get to cruise through beautiful state views without doing any work. Pack your lunch to enjoy on the ride or just sit back and relax.\n\nKeep your pets safe from the heat:Avoid these risks to dogs this summer as warm weather, pet dangers, amp up\n\nTest your wits\n\nHear us out. Using a heat wave as an excuse to lock yourself in a room with friends as you dig for clues to aid your escape sounds like as good a reason as any to do it.\n\nChannel your inner “Nancy Drew” to beat the clock and free yourself from the Axxiom Escape Rooms in Newark and Wilmington or the Novus Escape Room in Middletown.\n\nFor a fun twist, head to Ctrl V in Bear for virtual reality escape rooms and arcade fun.\n\nGet your game on\n\nThere’s something about the neon lighting, funky music and wacky designs of arcades and events centers that always feels welcoming.\n\nFamily Fun Galaxy at Mid County Lanes in Middletown has a laser tag arena, indoor bumper cars, arcade games and more for everyone in your household to enjoy.\n\nMain Event in Christiana has a gravity ropes indoor course, laser tag, pool, bowling, arcade games and tasty eats.\n\nXbos in Smyrna has an arcade, bowling, a trampoline park and an indoor playground.

At the conclusion of this six-week trial, 12 Delawareans will decide the outcome of one of the highest-profile defamation lawsuits in decades.\n\nThe trial was originally set to begin Monday morning, but the judge announced late Sunday night that it was being pushed to Tuesday. While Judge Eric Davis did not give a reason for the delay, media outlets reported that settlement talks are ongoing on Monday.\n\nSettlement:Fox News, Dominion reach $787.5M settlement just before defamation trial was set to begin\n\n“I can't think of another one that has been as consequential in recent history,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. “It clearly ranks as one of the most important, partly because of who the players are.”\n\nNo need for on-air apology\n\nNew York Times reporter Jim Rutenberg claims Fox News does not have to apologize on air to Dominion as part of the settlement agreement.\n\nFox News statement\n\nFox News issued a statement saying they were \"pleased to have reached a settlement\" in their two-year \"dispute\" with Dominion Voting Systems.\n\nThe three-paragraph statement also said they \"acknowledge the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.\"\n\n$787.5 million settlement\n\nWhile Dominion Voting Systems was looking for a $1.6 billion in damages, they received just under half of that according to their lawyers.\n\n\"The truth matters,\" Dominion Lawyer Justin Nelson said outside the courthouse Tuesday after a settlement was announced. \"Lies have consequences.\"\n\nThe settlement means the Delaware jurors selected for this case will not get to hear testimony from many high-profile Fox News personalities and executives, including Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch and hosts Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson.\n\nSettlement reached before opening arguments began\n\nTwo hours after Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News was to start came word that the parties had settled their dispute.\n\n\"The parties have resolved their case,\" Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said shortly before 4 p.m.\n\nJudge in the room\n\nMore than two hours after opening statements were set to start, Superior Court Judge Eric Davis has entered the courtroom. But not before speculation grew as reporters waited for word of what has been stalling the start of Dominion’s $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News.\n\nOpening statements were supposed to start at 1:30 p.m., but no word from Davis on what’s causing the delay.\n\nReporters have been tweeting how unusual it is for a judge to not tell the courtroom what's going on. Some are even writing about it.\n\nBritain’s The Independent is calling the delay a “mystery” in its heading.\n\nReuters is reporting that a reason has not been provided for the delays, “but two sources previously told Reuters that Fox and Dominion had been holding last-minute settlement talks.”\n\nThe New York Times’ Jim Rutenberg is reporting the courtroom scene as “it is sweltering, everyone is up from their seats, going in and out of the room. Fox’s lead lawyer, Dan Webb, has taken several phone calls. Some people are standing, all are talking, others gesticulating. It's relative anarchy for Judge Davis’s court.”\n\nHe also said legal experts in the room told him “this delay is a highly unusual development just minutes before opening statements were set to begin.”\n\nJudge authorizes special master\n\nHeading into trial, Fox has already experienced several setbacks — and according to ABC News, it looks like they were handed another ahead of Tuesday’s scheduled opening statements.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Eric Davis had already rejected Fox’s motion to throw out the case, ruling in favor of Dominion that the claims Fox aired about the company were indeed false. Newsworthiness, the judge ruled, is not a defense for defamation.\n\nDavis, during pretrial hearings, also sanctioned Fox’s legal team for withholding evidence, including recordings of a former Fox producer that involved Trump associates.\n\nOn Tuesday, just before opening statements were scheduled to start, Davis authorized an investigation into this issue to see if Fox needs to be sanctioned even further, ABC News reported. Davis last week reprimanded Fox’s lawyers, telling them they have a “credibility problem” and questioned if he could trust what they told him. A Fox lawyer formally apologized to the court last week.\n\nMore:Fox News sanctioned by Delaware judge for withholding evidence in $1.6B defamation trial\n\nABC News is reporting that the order is calling for an investigation by the special master that will \"include a determination\" of whether Fox News and Fox Corp \"complied with their discovery obligations.\"\n\nThe special master, who was previously appointed to oversee discovery in the case, is now \"further authorized and empowered\" to look into multiple declarations made by Fox attorneys in the case, ABC News is reporting the order as saying.\n\nStill waiting\n\nAs of 2:45 p.m., opening statements had yet to begin despite being set for 1:30 p.m.\n\nNo reason has been given for why there is a delay.\n\nInside the courtroom, attorneys for both sides are sitting looking fairly relaxed as media reporters go around asking each other if they know what is going on.\n\nThe judge, who is not in the courtroom, previously said 4:30 p.m. was going to be a hard stop time.\n\nDominion lawyers said they would need 75 minutes for their opening statements, while attorneys for Fox News said they would need 90 minutes for their opening statements.\n\nMore:Dominion Voting sues Fox for $1.6 billion over false 2020 election fraud claims\n\nOpening statements scheduled for this afternoon\n\nOpening statements in the long-awaited Dominion defamation lawsuit against Fox News are scheduled to start at 1:30 p.m.\n\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis met with two representatives from counsel for a sidebar before breaking for lunch a little after noon.\n\nDominion Voting Systems filed its $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News in 2021, claiming the cable news network \"broadcast a series of verifiably false yet devastating lies\" implicating the election software company in an unfounded conspiracy to steal the presidential election.\n\nMore:Jan. 6 insurrection not relevant in Fox defamation trial, Delaware judge rules\n\nDominion asserts that Fox News intentionally aired false allegations that its software rigged the election against former President Donald Trump \"because the lies were good for Fox's business.\" Dominion said the network was trying to lure back viewers who were angered when the network called the Nov. 3 election for Trump's Democratic challenger, Joe Biden.\n\nThe company said the legal action follows repeated demands for retractions, adding that \"Fox producers, content managers, and hosts were notified more than 30 times that their smears were not true.\"\n\nStern warning from judge after photo taken in courtroom\n\nSuperior Court Judge Eric Davis said someone was found taking a photo in the courtroom just before proceedings started Tuesday morning. Photography is not allowed in Delaware courtrooms.\n\nThe person is a \"party,\" the judge said, but he did not give more detail.\n\nWashington Post media critic Erik Wemple said Caley Cronin, a public relations representative for Fox News, was summoned from Davis' courtroom and directed to the overflow room for having taken a photograph in the courtroom.\n\nThe photo was deleted from the person's phone, Davis said. Ha also gave a stern warning to people in the courtroom, many of whom are reporters, to not take photos or connect to the Internet while in the courtroom.\n\nThis is the most access any Superior Court trial has ever had, Davis said.\n\n“It’s not a joke,” he said.\n\nMore:Judge in Dominion lawsuit sanctions Fox News, questions truthfulness of network's lawyers\n\n'Fight human nature,' judge tells jurors and alternates\n\nThe jury and alternates, who will hear what's expected to be a weeks-long Dominion defamation lawsuit against Fox News were chosen just after 11 a.m.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Eric Davis gave initial instructions to the 24 Delawareans, urging them to \"fight human nature\" and not discuss this case with the other jurors until deliberations — as well as with family and friends.\n\nHe also warned the jurors from doing \"any detective work.\" They must limit themselves to the evidence presented in the courtroom.\n\nMore:Dominion Voting sues Fox for $1.6 billion over false 2020 election fraud claims\n\nFollowing Davis' words to the jury came a quick break.

Here's why\n\nThe trial is expected to last six weeks.\n\nWhat's happening outside the courthouse\n\nA school bus filled with children drove past the courthouse. The children, who looked elementary or middle school-aged, yelled out the window at all the media lined up outside the courthouse. The kids laughed and stuck their tongues out, clearly excited about the commotion.\n\nWill Kenkel, a local, stood outside the Wilmington courthouse with a sign that read “Tucker Carlson, ditch the fascistic, stick w/ fish sticks.\"\n\nKenkel, who made the sign himself, said the slogan was prompted by his wife, who couldn't tell if he was saying \"fascistic\" or \"fish sticks.\"\n\nWhile Kenkel didn't mention Carlson's family fortune, the TV host's father married the heiress to Swanson frozen foods when Carlson was 10. The frozen food empire is well known for its fish sticks.\n\nKenkel said he was a little bit worried Monday when they delayed the trial, joking that if they settled, his knee pain from making the sign was going to be for naught.\n\nHe added that he plans to protest throughout the weeks-long trial.\n\nMore:Delaware residents will decide outcome of Fox News defamation case. Trial to begin Tuesday\n\n“I’ve just been dismayed for a long time about all the mistruths and selective coverage on Fox,” he said. “There’s just some sense of justice after finally getting called out on it and taken to court, and hopefully made to pay for their broadcasting known falsehoods.”\n\nA third protester showed up around 9 a.m., wearing a shirt that said Make America Kind Again. He held a small sign that said, in all capital letters, \"Fox + GOP = fascist propaganda.\"\n\nObjections to opening statements\n\nThe final part of jury selection has officially started.\n\nJust before, lawyers for each side indicated they have objections to each other's opening statement slides. Fox lawyer Dan Webb said Dominion is \"objecting to huge amounts\" and that it would \"cripple\" their argument.\n\nFox has also objected to a significant portion of Dominion's presentation, he said.\n\nFinal stage of jury selection kicks off Tuesday\n\nThe final stages of jury selection started at 9 a.m., with opening statements starting shortly after.\n\nThese 12 Delaware jurors will have to decide if Fox committed “actual malice,” or the idea that Fox knowingly published false information about Dominion or recklessly disregarded information showing the claims were not true.\n\nLast week, Delaware Superior Court summoned more than 1,000 people, who were asked a series of questions about their media consumption and if they worked at polling places, among others.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW:Delaware residents will decide outcome of Fox News defamation case. Trial to begin Monday\n\nIn the course of the upcoming six weeks, a dozen jurors will hear the evidence with 12 alternates, who will fill in if jurors have to drop out due to sickness or other circumstances.\n\nWaiting for the trial to start\n\nReporters began lining up outside of a Leonard L. Williams Justice Center courtroom before 7 a.m. when the room opened an hour later.Reporters have two options to watch the trial: They can watch from the courtroom or via a livestream in a neighboring courtroom – both on the seventh floor.\n\nOutside the Wilmington courthouse, media largely swarmed the area. But one man held a handmade sign saying, “Make Them Pay” and “Fox is guilty.”\n\nThe man appeared to focus on a group of well-dressed people, though it’s unclear what their role in the trial is. One man in a suit and two women stood in the group chatting. As the news cameras gathered around them to take a photo of the protester, they would move.\n\nMobile billboards\n\nTwo mobile billboard trucks trolling Fox News have been circling the area near Wilmington’s Leonard L. Williams Justice Center, where the Fox News defamation trial is scheduled to start.\n\nThe mobile billboards, commissioned by left-leaning media watchdog group Media Matters for America, have messages reading “Fox News Lied,” “Lachlan Murdoch Knew,” “Rupert Murdoch Knew,” “Tucker Carlson Knew,” “They All Knew,” “FoxKnew.com”\n\nThe billboards highlight that Fox News knew the election fraud claims Trump’s team was pushing in 2020 were lies and promoted them anyway, according to a statement by Media Matters for America. The billboards specifically call out Fox Corp.'s chairman Rupert Murdoch and his son, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, who are scheduled to testify at the trial.\n\nShortly after 8 a.m., the trucks moved from their spot on King Street and began driving down the road, turning onto Fourth Street as they circled the courthouse. As they drove by a DART bus stop, one man looked at them and smiled, saying “wow, wow.”\n\n“That’s wild, isn't it?” he said.\n\nWhat to expect at the trial and what's at stake\n\nDozens of journalists are expected to flock to Delaware to cover the trial. This case will also likely be one of the most significant trials The First State has ever hosted.

Scoring an empty-netter, he sealed the victory for the Skidmore College Thoroughbreds, prompting raucous cheers from his teammates.\n\nBut on the afternoon of March 19, the 20-year-old stood alone on a roof at an unofficial fraternity house at 153 W. Main St. near the University of Delaware, according to witnesses. A light rain pelted discarded beer cans and bottles. And Golden, a fierce competitor known for his effortless ability to make people smile, fell 30 feet to his death.\n\nWith that one misstep, a young man whose college adventure had just begun joined countless other students across the country who have died after teetering on roofs, balconies and fire escapes.\n\nHow does a community prevent such tragedies in the future and who should be held accountable? Local police, code inspectors, landlords and city and university officials agree that increased patrols, citations and alcohol education play their part. In the end, however, they can't substitute for individual judgment.\n\n\"A landlord's responsible to offer decent housing in exchange for decent rent,\" said Bruce Harvey, who owns seven rentals in Newark. \"People don't put things like 'don't fall off the roof' or 'don't fall out a window' in their leases. It's common sense.\"\n\nCommon sense is a scarce commodity when national statistics show that nearly two out of three college students who drank alcohol in the past month engaged in binge drinking, defined as more than five drinks in a sitting for a man and four for a woman. More than 1,800 college students ages 18 to 24 died from alcohol-related unintentional injuries last year, including vehicle crashes, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n\nCloser to home, Newark Police logged 461 criminal alcohol charges last year. In anticipation of St. Patrick's Day festivities, city police dispatched 22 additional officers on March 19, along with several agents from Delaware Alcohol and Tobacco Enforcement. That day, police made 58 criminal arrests, including 16 charges of underage alcohol possession or consumption, and broke up 16 parties.\n\nPolice and city code enforcement officers can't be everywhere at once to warn students of dangerous behavior, Newark city officials said, and they must weigh individual property rights. Newark landlords aren't required to register their leases with the city, which could give enforcement officers more leverage in discouraging rooftop cavorting.\n\n\"We do the best we can to proactively ... prevent those circumstances from arising, but it is difficult,\" Newark police Deputy Chief Kevin Feeney said.\n\nUniversities have spent millions of dollars trying to educate students on the perils of excessive alcohol consumption, along with sanctioning and banning fraternities notorious for \"Animal House\" antics.\n\nBut when parties are pushed off campus, the enforcement gap is more pronounced. Fewer than a dozen of UD's 48 fraternities, sororities and multicultural groups have registered houses that require bi-annual university inspections, according to a university spokeswoman. Newark city code bars the creation of new houses. About one in five UD students are involved in Greek life.\n\nOn weeknights and weekends, dozens of students spill out of rickety homes, urinating and puking on sidewalks, as neighbors grow increasingly agitated.\n\nLiving next door to a student rental on West Main Street, Deborah Worthing has witnessed drunk students borrowing her yard as a public toilet.\n\nShe has alerted police to the packed basement parties, but results are short-lived. \"What if there is a fire?\" she said. \"That would be a larger tragedy.\"\n\n\"Cleveland Avenue is crazy,\" echoed West Main Street resident Robert Skinner, who chain-smokes cigarettes in his backyard until the last of the revelers are driven out by last call.\n\n\"If I know it is a party night, I'm going to be up,\" he said. \"You have to be vigilant.\"\n\nOne week after Golden's death, it's still unclear what made him climb on the roof and whether alcohol played a role, according to Newark Police, who are awaiting toxicology test results. No foul play is suspected.\n\nThe rundown rental home, located a block away from Main Street bars, is not emblazoned with Greek letters but houses brothers in the Sigma Pi fraternity who regularly throw rowdy rooftop celebrations, neighbors said.\n\nEstablished in 2006, the 80-member fraternity was previously placed on probation by UD through spring of 2016 for multiple violations, according to university records. Fraternity brothers and Sigma Pi's Lebanon, Tennessee-based international chapter did not respond to repeated requests for comment last week.\n\nIn an earlier interview, Jason Walker, interim executive director of the national Sigma Pi organization, confirmed that the house was rented by a number of Sigma Pi members. \"We are investigating along with the school to try to figure out what happened and our condolences go out to the families of those involved,\" he said.\n\nOwned by Elkton landlord Anthony Scarangello II, the home was listed as the only address for the Sigma Pi chapter in a 2014 IRS filing. Last month, the chapter advertised a spring rush event at the three-story residence. Scarangello, who owns at least five rentals in the area, declined to comment.\n\nGolden was best friends with a local member of Sigma Pi, said Walker, and was visiting him during spring break. The Skidmore student's death marks the first time in three years that a student has died at UD in an alcohol-related incident, according to university spokeswoman Andrea Boyle Tippett. In 2013, UD sophomore Ethan Connolly was struck by a pickup truck while walking with friends on Route 896, south of Interstate 95.\n\nIn another university loss last week, sophomore Matthew Rosin died Wednesday after five months of hospitalization following a serious bicycle crash that was not alcohol-related.\n\nRooftop parties are common\n\nLike any college town getting a jump-start on the weekend, Newark's Main Street buzzed with activity Thursday night. Students lugging backpacks from the library mingled with a group of men who lifted their togas above their ankles as they hustled across the street.\n\nRooftop parties aren't uncommon, several students agreed, but rarely do they have devastating consequences.\n\n\"It's just bad luck, a bad turn of events,\" said UD junior Dan Freeman, who lives near where Golden fell. \"I don't think much more could have been done.\"\n\nFreeman said the university is less of a party school now after administrators clamped down on tailgating and alcohol violations. In 1996, UD became one of six universities nationwide to receive a $770,000 grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the American Medical Association to curb binge drinking by changing norms and attitudes on campus. Most of the money was spent developing educational programs and nonalcoholic social opportunities.\n\nUD also implemented the \"three strikes you're out rule,\" which mandates suspension for students who violate the school's alcohol policies at least three times. The university has sent letters home to parents when students violate UD's Code of Conduct and instituted a \"zero-tolerance\" plan with city and university police to crack down on loud parties. UD Police patrol campus property while city police handle off-campus complaints.\n\nIn 2014, UD's Campus Coalition for Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Prevention was tasked with encouraging responsible drinking among students of legal age and minimizing the risks for those under 21. The group has increased collaboration and communication with city officials and business owners, Tippett said. Last year, UD and Newark Police conducted 17 joint operations to combat underage drinking on and around campus.\n\nFirst-year UD students are required to live on campus in university-supervised housing. In those facilities, university officials say, the doors and windows that need to stay shut are locked, campus police patrol the grounds and resident advisers staff each floor to keep order and assure safety for students.\n\nSTORY: Student hit by bike at UD dies months after crash\n\nSTORY: Delaware State cuts more than a quarter of its majors\n\nBy the time they become sophomores, students can live off-campus and must be mindful of their personal safety, according to Director of Student Wellness Nancy Chase. University statistics show that slightly more undergraduates — 8,036 — live off-campus than on-campus.\n\nOver time, UD, like other universities nationwide, has been marred by occasional incidents reported in the media of intoxicated students dying young.\n\nThe problems aren't limited to Greek life. Students who violate UD's alcohol and drug policies are required to attend the BASICS program, which helps them identify behavior changes. Each year, roughly 5 percent of undergraduates enroll.\n\nIn one of the more high-profile cases, after the 2008 alcohol poisoning death of 18-year-old pledge Brett Griffin at UD, the family sued and forced the university to change its Greek life site to list violations against fraternities and sororities.\n\nCurrently, there are four fraternities, including Sigma Pi, with \"deferred suspensions\" for \"multiple violations\" listed on the site, along with 10 chapters that are no longer formally recognized by the university or by their national chapters. As of Friday, UD had not issued an outright ban on Sigma Pi, according to Tippett. She would not provide details on Sigma Pi's violations.\n\nWashington, D.C., attorney Doug Fierberg, who sued UD on behalf of the Griffin family and also represented the victims of the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, said colleges and universities continue to publish vague information — if they publish it at all — about fraternity infractions, including deadly hazing rituals and sexual assaults.\n\n\"We're still facing significant problems because most universities refuse to tell the truth about student deaths at Greek organizations,\" Fierberg said.\n\nStudies have found college freshmen particularly vulnerable. A 2006 study by USA Today found that first-year students represented half of all undergraduate deaths from falls from windows, balconies and rooftops.\n\nLimited jurisdiction\n\nUD's unofficial Sigma Pi house offers a textbook example of potential code violations. Located next to a campus ministry, the residence features broken glass, dangling electrical cords and a barbecue grill strapped outside a third-story window.\n\nThe chapter's website shows brothers volunteering to pick up trash, gripping girls in tanktops, holding puppies and eating fast food.\n\nMore than 1,000 fraternities in the Interfraternity Conference have gone dry, but Sigma Pi isn't one of them. Previously, national officers seriously considered adopting an alcohol-free housing policy but received pushback from members, according to a 2000 Washington Post article.\n\nFour years later, a Colorado State University sophomore died of alcohol poisoning after attending a party at an off-campus Sigma Pi house.\n\nFierberg, the attorney, has represented clients who have sued universities, national fraternities and local chapter members for alcohol-related student deaths. Even if a party is held at an off-campus unofficial fraternity house, the hosts and the organization may still be liable, he said.\n\n\"These organizations need to be rendered safe,\" Fierberg added. \"There is no excuse for not intervening.\"\n\nIt's not a criminal offense to hang out on your roof, but a Newark spokeswoman said city police will address the issue when they see it. City police target large gatherings where underage alcohol consumption is prevalent, and go undercover in liquor stores during big party weekends. For out-of-control parties, officers rely on disorderly conduct and criminal nuisance laws. They are also permitted to halt parties when more than 150 people are gathered without a permit, city police said.\n\n\"A lot of these large parties don't exist anymore,\" Newark police Chief Paul Tiernan said. \"The biggest we have is still Homecoming, St. Patrick's Day and Cinco de Mayo.\"\n\nCode enforcement officials can break up rooftop gatherings if they pose a structural threat. Decks and patios also must have protective railings.\n\n\"If we see a large crowd on the roof, we could say there is an imminent danger and you have to vacate,\" said Dave Culver, Newark's code enforcement manager.\n\nAt the same time, officers must recognize the property rights of landlords and their tenants.\n\nIn 2012, a political advocacy group protested a draft city ordinance that required inspections of rentals without the consent of tenants or the landlords. City officials said the language was included in error and promptly deleted it.\n\nThat same year, the Chancery Court approved a $900,000 settlement in a civil lawsuit filed by landlords over Newark code enforcement operations. In response, City Council decreased rental permit fees and pledged to increase communication with landlords.\n\nThe city requires permits for rentals and conducts annual safety and building inspections. Newark is engaged in an ongoing study focused on the demand for rental housing and quality-of-life issues for longtime residents. Currently, rental permits are renewed even if inspectors aren't able to access the properties.\n\nThe last time city code inspectors visited the West Main Street house where Golden fell, they found no evidence of the roof being used as a patio, Culver said. The June visit documented a fire escape that needed repair, along with other minor violations, he said.\n\nCity records initially showed that the rental was not properly permitted. Culver later said that was a system glitch. The property is allowed to house up to eight unrelated people, he said.\n\nCity Councilman Todd Ruckle, a local real estate agent, said safety issues are less about code enforcement and more about the enforcement of lease terms.\n\nBut even the best landlords don't think about tenant safety in terms of their behavior, according to Harvey. A landlord's responsibility, he said, is limited to ensuring the building is up to code, secure and a safe place to live.\n\n\"Applicants don't come with 'I party 24/7' tattooed on their foreheads,\" he added, \"so there's a chance of getting some bad tenants.\"\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, University of Delaware seniors Joe Moye, Mark Murphy and Ryan Corey sat on the porch of their Prospect Avenue rental.\n\nTheir living room window, broken through and duct-taped back together, sat behind them.\n\nThe landlord is coming to fix it, said Murphy, 22. They had just emailed him about it.\n\nLandlords in the area are pretty responsive, “give or take,” he said.\n\nBack at Skidmore in upstate New York, where there are no fraternities and sororities, Golden's hockey coach Rob Hutchison described his former player as honest, passionate and \"extremely likable.\"\n\n\"He was kinda figuring out what he wanted to do here,\" said Hutchison, noting that Golden played lacrosse and hockey when he was younger but wasn't a hockey recruit. He still earned a spot on the roster after a walk-on tryout.\n\nThe eldest of three children, Golden was buried Wednesday in his hometown of Cohasset, Massachusetts. His family has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nMore than 600 Skidmore students, faculty and staff honored his short life at a memorial service Tuesday. Golden's teammates proudly wore their jerseys in tribute to a player who celebrated his assists as hard as his goals. Two students performed \"Let It Be.\"\n\n\"We come together trying to find meaning in response to an event that simply makes no sense,\" Skidmore President Philip Glotzbach told the crowd.\n\nTwo days later, 20-year-old Kevin Lu, who lives on Cleveland Avenue in Newark, surveyed a trail of splintered red cups clinging to dusty patches of grass. When a reporter approached him, he offered her a spot on his dingy couch on the porch. He told her some of UD's best parties happen on Tuesday and Thursday nights.\n\n\"The houses aren’t in the best shape, Lu admitted, but “it’s not bad.”\n\n\"It shouts college.\"\n\nContact Margie Fishman at (302) 324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.

Temperatures are averaging 10-13 degrees above normal, and Drag predicts the state will experience another heat wave closer to Labor Day.\n\nTemperatures on Monday topped 90 degrees in Rehoboth Beach and stretched to at least 93 in Wilmington, adding to the 25 days of 90-degree-or-more heat seen throughout the state this summer. The heat index over the weekend topped 112 in some places.\n\nMichael Mann, a professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University, say the elevated heat is indicative of a much larger problem. Last year logged the hottest temperatures ever, with July marking the hottest month on record, according to data from NASA. Already 2016 is trending hotter than ever seen before – marking a pattern that Mann said shouldn’t surprise anyone.\n\n“That overall warming is tipping the odds toward more frequent record-breaking heat waves,” said Mann, who studies global warming. “We’ve seen that over a large part of the Eastern U.S. with historic heat waves that are part of a larger pattern.”\n\nSTORY: 10 Facts about heat and your health in Delaware\n\nSTORY: Beer garden serves workouts with brews\n\nNASA on Monday released data showing July 2016 was 1.51 degrees warmer than the 1950-1980 global average, marking the 10th record hot month in a row. That makes NASA’s five hottest months on record July 2016, July 2015, July 2011, July 2009 and August 2014.\n\n“The scary thing is that we are moving into an era where it will be a surprise when each new month or year isn’t one of the hottest on record,” said Chris Field, a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution and Stanford University.\n\nThe temperatures are especially alarming along the shoreline, Mann said, where heat is usually mitigated by coastal winds and proximity to the water. Beach towns like Ocean City, Maryland, reported temperatures into the triple digits, he said.\n\n“That’s where we’ve seen some of the hottest temperatures,” Mann said. “That, to me, is unheard of.”\n\nOn Monday, Robert Williams, 51, braved the heat in Rodney Square, which baked in the afternoon rays.\n\n“The sun is beating down and the heat rises from the ground,” he said. “I don’t remember the last time it was this hot.”\n\nNadiyyah Ennals, 32, used an umbrella to provide relief.\n\n“It’s hot as hell,” the New Castle resident said. “(I’m doing) a lot of praying that I won’t die of heat stroke.”\n\nAn excessive heat warning remains in effect until 8 p.m. Tuesday, a two-hour increase from original predictions due to the increased temperatures. The spike in temperatures on Saturday prompted organizers with New Castle County Family Fun Day at Carousel Park to delay the event’s start time. Newark also opened cooling stations at pools.\n\nThe heat wave is blanketing a wide swath of the East Coast, and four people have died due to heat-related incidents. The most recent occurred Sunday when a 72-year-old west Philadelphia man died. He also had diabetes, hypertension and obesity.\n\nA 59-year-old north Philadelphia man, a 67-year-old north Philadelphia woman and an 82-year-old northeast Philadelphia woman also died from heat-related injuries.\n\nMeteorologists are reminding residents to stay hydrated and out of the heat as much as possible, and make sure to check on older relatives and neighbors as the hot weather persists. Those with outdoor jobs should take frequent breaks and utilize shaded areas as much as possible. Forecasters suggest doing any necessary strenuous outdoor work in the early morning and late evening hours.\n\nAt the Hotel du Pont Monday, valet workers were rotating in and out of the air conditioning to stay cool. Hotel employees deal with extreme weather in every season, said doorman Brian Laws, but he sympathizes with other workers like police officers.\n\n“I feel for them,” he said. “We’re hanging in there.”\n\nThough Monday may have felt slightly cooler, temperatures will ramp up again Tuesday morning and humidity will again settle into Delaware, forecasters said. A dip in humidity may occur later in the week, but the physical temperature on the thermometer won’t be going down. Instead, the state will see 90 degrees and dry air.\n\nHeavy thunderstorms could come with the temperature change first thing Tuesday, with the possibility of another strong storm again early Tuesday evening, Drag said.\n\nWilmington resident Maurice Speight, 54, said the relief can’t come soon enough.

Age and health conditions can make people more susceptible to health impacts from the heat, so keep these factors in mind when deciding whether to up the AC a degree or two on hot days.\n\nHVAC.com reports that 78 degrees has long been marketed as the ideal thermostat setting in the summer, but if that’s too hot for your household, try your best to keep your thermostat above 72 degrees. For each degree that your thermostat is above 72 degrees, you can save up to 3% on your energy bill. When sleeping, setting the thermostat to 82 degrees is recommended. Gradually increasing your thermostat temperature over time will help ease you into the practice of letting your thermostat rest at higher temps.\n\nIf pets are in your home, do not set the thermostat higher than 80 degrees, said HVAC.com\n\nWhen you’re away from home for a few hours or on vacation, increasing the indoor temperature of your house by 5 to 7 degrees can lower your monthly energy costs. According to ENERGY STAR, setting your thermostat closer to 85 degrees when you’re gone is ideal.\n\nOther ways to efficiently use your AC include opting to use a smart thermostat for automated temperature adjustments throughout the day and implementing “zone heating,” which is cooling only the occupied areas of your home. This reduces energy waste in unused spaces, according to MakeMyHouseGreen.\n\nOther tips for cooling your home, from HVAC.com, include:\n\nUsing fans.\n\nClosing blinds and curtains to reduce the amount of heat entering a room, especially when you are not home. Blackout curtains can reduce the amount of heat that enters a room by up to 24%.\n\nAvoiding the use of heat-generated appliances, like ovens, dryers and stoves as much as possible. Consider using these appliances in the evening when it’s not as hot outside or opting to grill outdoors once a week.\n\nOptimizing airflow by arranging furniture and other belongings in a way that does not block any vents or take up prime space in front of fans or cooler areas, allowing air to circulate effectively.\n\nSummer forecast:Hoping for more beach days this summer? Here’s what the Farmers' Almanac is predicting\n\nCeiling fan hacks\n\nIf you plan to take advantage of your ceiling fans this summer, there are a few ways to make the most of them and help you save money on cooling.\n\nDuring hotter months, your ceiling fan blades should rotate counterclockwise. This pushes air down in a column and creates a “wind chill” effect. To maximize this effect, run your fan at the highest speed, according to Home Depot.\n\nOptimizing your ceiling fan this way can let you increase your thermostat by 4 degrees while remaining comfortable and can reduce your energy costs by up to 30%.\n\nTo change your ceiling fan’s direction to counterclockwise, and eventually change it to clockwise during the cooler weather, most fans have a switch on the motor that can be flipped. To check if your fan is moving counterclockwise, stand directly under the fan and look up. You should feel a rush of air if it is moving in the correct direction.\n\nAn outdoor ceiling fan spinning counterclockwise at high speed can help keep mosquitoes and other flying insects away due to air force.\n\nMore ceiling fan tips from Home Depot include:\n\nConsider upgrading to a new model if your fan is emitting little to no air movement. It may have a failing motor or the pitch of the ceiling fan blades may be too flat.\n\nKeep the blades and motor clean. Buildup can cause the fan to work harder and use more energy.\n\nTurn off ceiling fans when no one is in the room. Fans make people feel cooler or warmer, but they do not actually cool a room, so there is no need to keep them on when no one is present.\n\nInstall a ceiling fan with a remote control or a ceiling fan switch. This makes it easier to control the fan and allows you to change the direction of the blades by tapping a button.\n\nHeat wave safety, staying cool:Heat wave guide: Delaware weekend temperatures, how to keep yourself and pets safe\n\nGet ahead of vampire energy\n\nAlso known as standby energy or phantom power, vampire energy occurs when appliances or devices continue to use energy while plugged in, even when turned off, according to Delmarva Power.\n\nCommon household items like computer cords, game consoles, printers, phone chargers and coffee pots still draw energy from your home while plugged in, resulting in unnecessary energy usage. For those of you with plug-in fans around the house, those are hidden energy drainers, too.\n\nThis can account for up to 20% of the total energy used by a device and more money lost from your wallet, according to Delmarva Power.\n\nTips from Delmarva Power to cut back on your energy usage and save money:\n\nUnplug your phone charger, laptop charger and other electronic devices once they are fully charged.\n\nTurn off all lights when leaving a room or use timers for indoor and outdoor lights.\n\nUse energy-efficient LED bulbs. They last longer and use up to 75% less energy than standard bulbs.\n\nUnplug all nonessential devices like televisions and other electronics before going out of town.\n\nUse a power strip with an on/off switch to completely shut off electronics around your house when they are not in use.\n\nWeather-strip or caulk leaky areas to trap escaping air from windows and doors. Close chimney flues.\n\nLook for the ENERGY STAR label on home appliances, electronics and other products, which ensures that the item meets strict energy-efficiency guidelines set by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy.\n\nGot a tip or a story idea?

In fact, forecasters are now expecting Sunday to be just as hot as Saturday, when it could feel like 111 degrees in Wilmington, 106 degrees in Dover and 110 degrees in Georgetown.\n\nClouds in Wilmington Friday morning would be burnt off by a rising sun, lifting temperatures to a high of 96 degrees, said National Weather Service Meteorologist Patrick O'Hara. Between the heat and the humidity, the heat index will be 107 degrees.\n\nDover is forecast to be slightly cooler, with a high of 94 degrees and a heat index of 103 degrees. In Georgetown, the high will be around 96 degrees and the heat index will be 105 degrees.\n\nPlaces to cool off as heat wave continues throughout Delaware\n\nThe air mass sitting on Delaware is hot and stagnant, O'Hara said. The sun gets high in the sky this time of year and shines for hours and hours. In short, it's the mid-summer.\n\nO'Hara said Saturday's forecast is basically Friday's, plus 3 degrees. That could make the heat index in Wilmington 110 degrees without rain or wind to bring temperatures down.\n\nThe heat wave strikes Delaware just as the state fair is opening for its 100th year.

But the heat wave won't last much longer than that.\n\nHigh temperatures Monday will fall to about 90 degrees before the outbreak of thunderstorms with the advance of a cold front from Canada, according to O'Hara.\n\nThose afternoon and evening storms will signal an end to the heat wave. He said high temperatures in Wilmington Tuesday are expected to be a blissfully cool 84 degrees.\n\nHeat safety tips\n\nHere are a few tips from the National Weather Service for keeping yourself healthy and safe in extreme heat:\n\nSlow down: Reduce, eliminate or reschedule strenuous activities until the coolest time of the day. Children, seniors and anyone with health problems should stay in the coolest available place, not necessarily indoors.\n\nDress for summer. Wear lightweight, loose-fitting, light-colored clothing to reflect heat and sunlight.\n\nEat light, cool, easy-to-digest foods such as fruit or salads. If you pack food, put it in a cooler or carry an ice pack. Don't leave it sitting in the sun.\n\nDrink plenty of water (not very cold), non-alcoholic and decaffeinated fluids, even if you don't feel thirsty.\n\nUse air conditioners or spend time in air-conditioned locations such as malls and libraries.\n\nUse portable electric fans to take hot air from rooms or draw in cooler air.\n\nDo not direct the flow of portable electric fans toward yourself when the room temperature is hotter than 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The dry blowing air will dehydrate you faster, endangering your health.\n\nMinimize direct exposure to the sun. Sunburn reduces your body's ability to dissipate heat.\n\nTake a cool bath or shower.\n\nCheck on older, sick, or frail people who may need help responding to the heat.\n\nDon't leave valuable electronic equipment, such as cellphones and GPS units, sitting in hot cars.\n\nContact Adam Duvernay at (302) 319-1855 or aduvernay@delawareonline.com.\n\nHEAT WAVE\n\nNo relief in sight as Delaware heat continues to rise into sweltering weekend\n\nDel. 1 lanes close for repairs after extreme heat damage\n\nBurned feet at the beach?

Delaware Wing Madness pitted 32 of the best-loved restaurants and taverns and breweries in the state against each other in a multi-round, single-elimination tournament.\n\nLast week, you narrowed the wing field to two well-loved, decades-old restaurants: Kid Shelleen's Charcoal House and Saloon in Wilmington and Brandywine Hundred and 2 Fat Guys American Grill in Hockessin.\n\nEach was a colossus of wings. Each had towered over its competition in each round of voting. And the stakes, in their own way, were high: 2 Fat Guys co-owner Jeff Cook said earlier in the competition that if he didn't win, he'd sell his restaurant and retire.\n\nWe're pretty sure he was kidding. But we won't have to find out. Because when the dust settled on Saturday morning, 2 Fat Guys was victorious.\n\nAccording to voters, the best wings in Delaware come from 2 Fat Guys, owned by 40-year restaurant veterans Cook and Tom Craft. 2 Fat Guys is once and forever the winners of Delaware Wing Madness, the makers of the Triple Play wings, the symbolic bird emperors of Hockessin, and the sole bearers of the One Wing to Rule Them All.\n\n\"I am very, very honored that our guests think of us this way,\" said Cook at 2 Fat Guys. \"I'm also very, very honored to come out on top of some very stiff competition.\"\n\nCook praised the wings of the other restaurants 2 Fat Guys competed against for the prize. In particular, he called Kid Shelleen's owner Xavier Teixido \"tough competition\" in the championship round. Indeed, Teixido's other restaurant, Harry's Savoy Grill, was named one of USA TODAY's Restaurants of the Year for 2024.\n\nBut this time, it was 2 Fat Guys who prevailed.\n\nSo what makes 2 Fat Guys wings the best in Delaware?\n\nIt's the sauces. It's process. And it's the chicken itself.\n\nBefore we started our Delaware Wing Madness competition, we polled wing lovers in our office and all over the state. And when people mentioned 2 Fat Guys, they didn't just tell us they liked the wings: They often told us their favorite sauce.\n\nThe PB & J wings are famous, of course — a conglomeration of peanut butter and jelly and barbecue sauce with flavors both familiar and surprising. The sauce stems from the deft mixing skills of saucemaster Craft, and from Cook's love of peanut butter as a topping for pretty much all things.\n\nSome customers are intimidated by the unfamiliar idea, Cook said. \"But once they try it, they eat it again,\" he said.\n\nBut there's also the barbecue sauce with scratch-made poached pears. The apple bourbon sauce. The \"Yuengwing\" sauce made with the beer you think it's made with. The rotating featured flavors, whether spiced-up barbecue or orange ginger. Hot sauce from mild to hot to something called \"nuclear.\"\n\nAnd if 2 Fat Guys wings seem extra-crisp, it's because they are. Each 2 Fat Guys wing arrives lightly dusted with a seasoned, 16-ingredient, flour-and-cornstarch mixture for maximum crispiness and maximum flavor. The wing is roasted, then fried to a crackling texture that lets the sauce stick glisteningly to each wing without being over-sauced.\n\nThe rest of the story is the chicken itself, Cook said. The chicken is all fresh and local, Perdue or Mountaire. The wings and drums are medium to large, for the best ratio of meat to crispy surface area.\n\nThe result, whatever the sauce, is Delaware's favorite wing. Eat it at your leisure: 2 Fat Guys is open seven days a week, lunch to late.\n\n2 Fat Guys American Grill is located at 701 Ace Memorial Drive, Hockessin, 302-235-0333; 2fatguys.net.\n\nMatthew Korfhage is business and development reporter in the Delaware region covering all the things that touch land and money.

Broom St.\n\nA stranger walked up and one of the kids at the familiar gathering spot asked, \"Who's that?\"\n\nMoments later the stranger began spraying bullets, Ellerbe's family told The News Journal.\n\nThe kids scrambled. One teen, 17, was struck in the chest, another, 16, was hit in the arm. Ellerbe, 16, was hit in the head, and later died.\n\nTwo days later, people gathered at a memorial for Ellerbe on the same front porch – and were again sprayed with bullets from semi-automatic weapon fire. This time at least 18 rounds were fired from a vehicle driving by the home, neighbors said, injuring two teens and a 21-year-old who had gathered among teddy bears and candles to honor Ellerbe.\n\nVictims and shooters alike are believed to be kids who live in the neighborhood, police said. Neighborhood teens described the dispute as being between kids who live at the top of Hilltop vs. those who live at the bottom of the hill near I-95. They probably know each other from local basketball leagues or community centers, longtime Wilmington residents said.\n\nBut rather than duke it out with fists as their fathers did, teens today frequently settle disputes with guns.\n\n\"What we see are trivial matters that really aren't things you should be fighting over. They should not be issues that cost someone else their life,\" said Wilmington Police Chief Bobby Cummings.\n\n\"It's about conflict resolution and these kids don't have that. The only option that they see is to take somebody out. And I don't know how they can get to a point where they see that as their only option.\"\n\nWhile Wilmington teens have adopted hyper-violent elements of gangster culture, Cummings said, the rival groups typically don't participate in traditional criminal enterprises. Some may be involved in drug activity, but it's likely lower-level street dealing rather than trafficking or money laundering.\n\n\"The bad thing: They're all kids,\" said Ellerbe's 19-year-old sister, Jakiera Jordan. \"I don't know where their parents are. All of them are younger than 19 that are shooting. First thing they know about is guns. They don't know about school.\"\n\nEllerbe had no criminal record, according to a search of court records. And his family insists that he was not the assassin's intended target. They say he was at the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nEllerbe's funeral Friday was packed with teenagers at The Arise Church on North Van Buren Street, where his cousin Joyce Lewis drew applause when calling out the killer:\n\n\"I pray that the person that did do it is here. So you can repent, so you can repent because you have done messed up. You shot the wrong one and I ain't resting till you are arrested.\"\n\nPolice can't say yet who the target of the shooting may have been, Cummings said, but he warned teens to be careful about the company they keep.\n\n\"They (rival youth groups) have intended targets that they're going after and you have to be cognizant of the individuals you hang around with because you know their background.\"\n\nPaul Barry, who owns Blackfeather Academy martial arts studio on North Fourth Street, said \"kids not being able to take a punch\" drives violence.\n\n\"They're taking on the world and trying to show everybody that they're not afraid,\" Barry said. \"What happened over that weekend was, 'We don't care, we're not afraid, we're just gonna' come back and shoot you up.\n\n\" 'We shot the wrong dude, we'll come back and try to shoot the right dude.' They're trying to be big city gangsters with that mentality.\"\n\nMusic glorifying hair-trigger violence helps fuel violent reactions when teens feel they've been disrespected, Chief Cummings said.\n\nEllerbe's sister Jakiera agrees.\n\n\"The music has them thinking they can shoot at anything and everybody,\" she said.\n\nSaid Felicia McKinnon, who lives in an apartment above the shooting scene: \"These kids are not playing.\"\n\nMcKinnon stormed down the stairs on Jan. 23 when she heard gunfire, concerned that her child was among the wounded. She found teens bleeding from gunshot wounds and Ellerbe with a horrific head injury.\n\nAfter the second shooting outside her home, McKinnon grimly inspected the bullet hole in her Buick's hood and swept the shattered glass from the floorboard. The back-to-back shootings reaffirmed in her mind that this neighborhood is not a good place to raise her children. She intends to move.\n\nDeadly squabbles between neighborhood groups are difficult for police to track because membership is fluid with kids coming and going, Cummings said.\n\n\"If you can talk to the leader, generally, you can get other people to follow behind that,\" Cummings said. \"But when you can't pinpoint someone who is a leader in a group – there is no focus, no direction – then how do you get to that group?\"\n\nA day after the second shooting, a group of teens were arrested in a vacant home on the same block of North Broom Street, one carrying a stolen 9 mm Glock handgun.\n\n\"Some of the kids come to our church and Sunday we had to spend time with them just crying,\" said Lottie Lee-Davis, pastor of Be Ready Jesus is Coming Church on Fourth Street. \"The kids are tired, they're tired. You think the adults are, but you don't know the kids are tired because they feel that they're potential targets.\"\n\nThat house where the shootings occurred has been silent following the rattle of gunfire. Ellerbe's memorial was replaced with garbage bags brimming with clothes and boxes of books while a moving van sat across the street.\n\nResidents and business owners say a sense of fear is palpable in the neighborhood.\n\nTwenty people have been shot in Wilmington during 2015, seven of them fatally. One person has been charged with murder in connection with one death, and another has been arrested in connection with a non-fatal shooting.\n\nNo arrests have been made in the Hilltop shootings.\n\nDown Fourth Street from Davis' church, Victor Rodriguez, Jr, who runs Rodriguez Food Market, said fear is a normal part of business. When people loiter outside his corner store, he is hesitant to do anything about it.\n\n\"How are we gonna be calling the cops all the time, and then they find out that we're calling, then it's the snitching part and that's where the problem comes and the kids could come in here and start shooting,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nThere is a culture against talking to police. While many kids on the block claim to know who committed the crimes, it is difficult for police to establish probable cause for an arrest.\n\n\"In a lot of our incidents, when our victims get struck, our victims are not telling us the truth, they're not being cooperative,\" Cummings said, adding witness accounts can be the difference between the police knowing who a shooter is and arresting them.\n\nRumors also keep investigations from being solved. Investigators, Cummings said, try to dig through talk on the street to find who's starting the narrative strings, and whether those strings are credible.\n\n\"As long as that rumor stays out there and continues to fester, people then start believing it's true –– without ever getting back to a true source,\" the chief said.\n\nTwo days after Ellerbe died, his sisters heard gunfire while taping pictures printed from their brother's Instagram account to the front of their two-story brick house. The shots came from four blocks away at the Broom Street home where the original attack occurred, where the name Jordan had been spray painted on the retaining wall abutting the sidewalk.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Ellerbe's 19-year-old sister, Jakiera. \"You are letting off all these shots, and these people expecting to hit a person wind up killing an innocent person – who doesn't even know what is going on.\"\n\nEllerbe grew up in Wilmington and lived with his sisters and mother in the Hilltop neighborhood. A freshman at A.I. du Pont High School, Ellerbe played basketball and was known among friends for his sharp attire and sneaker collection. His mother declined to comment.\n\n\"He was just a sweet kid,\" said 21-year-old sister Jazmine Jordan. \"When we did fight, it would always be over the house phone. He always wanted to be on the phone talking to girls.\"\n\nHe told his girlfriend he wanted to be a businessman and wanted a job. His friends and family remembered him as persistently giving.\n\n\"He always helped his friends,\" said Jazmine. \"If he had money, they had money. If he had clothes, they had clothes. If he had food, they had food.\"\n\nEllerbe's funeral was simultaneously a remembrance of a young life lost and a discussion of how the violence that took him could be avoided. His silver casket was flanked by photos of him with his friends. A gray hat covered his head.\n\n\"He was just a regular kid. He wasn't a rowdy type of kid,\" said Charles Meredith after carrying his cousin to the grave. \"These guns are everywhere. How are these babies getting guns so easily? These kids don't know what they are doing.\"\n\nFamily and friends called for more discussion between parents and kids about what is going on in their life.\n\n\"Older folks, we have to start taking these kids and walk them to the church or just stop by and talk to them,\" said church youth minister Clarence Taylor. \"[Young people] put the guns down and give each other a hug. This is not for me, this is for Jordan.\"\n\nThe service served as a warning to the teary-eyed teens gathered, their shirts emblazoned with tributes like, \"Rest Easy Jordan.\"\n\n\"We was allowed to [fist] fight back in the day,\" said Ernest Morris, Ellerbe's uncle. \"These days the kids they have no reasoning. They shoot first and think later. Twenty or 30 years later, sitting in a jail cell thinking about how they shouldn't have done that.\"\n\nContact Esteban Parra at 324-2299 or eparra@delawareonline.com.
